so buddy come on you come in go go say
hi
come on of Milo man
oh shit oh fuck what happened your foot

but did I see your paw
hi guys I'll be back my cats foot is
bleeding for some reason one second guys
I got hey what happened your foot let
Daddy see daddy see let's see which
closet make sure you're okay come here
let it take care of you shit blood
everywhere it's okay it's okay
April
I know I know you don't like this
all right one second guys I uh
once I can cat cut himself
all right guys whoo so uh sorry for dip
setting like that unfortunately
unfortunately my cat Achilles ripped his
toenail and so there's like a trail of
blood you actually see on my arm here a
little bit of the blood as we were
holding down to to treat it this is a
restream tool all my subscriptions start
with an A I had it happen I don't know
um here's me on it the door I thought he
wanted to come in and he was actually
just in pain so as you can see I've
quite a few subscriptions they don't all
start with a
I thought something happened to the cat
and what actually happened was uh
there's a cockroach that a rose
screaming about right now I don't know
if you do you guys hear that it sound
like bloody fucking murder to me um who
anyhow it so originally I was citing I'm
going to answer questions we got kind of
sidetracked by life that's okay that
should happens I'm here we are so let's
get back on track April's grabbing the
spray for the roach um what uneventful
start today 28 those did I was just as
shocked by what I don't know what's
going on was I gonna sleep I got it I
got little pop blood paw prints here and
in the hallway I got some cat blood on
me it's it's eventful April screaming
like I don't know man
it's uh it's something it's something um
so um any questions yeah let's say hi to
Aurora am I saying that or aura I'm
gonna say it's aura hi aura I didn't
realize you had a daughter Kevin I did
not know that
godless monkey welcome welcome so today
what we're going to be doing once a
broke it's in here is we're actually
going to go through the JavaScript
section w3schools
so she can you got six year old and a
two year old nice man
good for you I'm one of those people who
and everyone has told me that eventually
my mentality will change but um I'm 29
and this could be because I feel like
maybe I'm not I've always been kind of a
logical person and I just started
getting my life together probably in the
last two years so if I had my life
together for
maybe about five more years I might
consider having children but uh I don't
know I've never I've never felt that
need quite yet we'll see we'll see it'll
be interesting I don't know that I want
a little meet that someone asked that
came up this conversation came up today
at work so um for those of you don't
know April and I have been dating for
about six years so since I've been 23
I'm 29 now we've been dating for six
years we've got our rough parts but for
the most part that's accurate and for
most people six years you're married
most people for me uh I think we're just
getting started I think it's a
commitment thing I just can't see the
point of getting married yet um we'll
see I don't know man maybe it is gonna
commitment thing um how do you sir on
this hello Aurora I hope you're having a
wonderful day with your dad and I hope
he's teaching you JavaScript
oh if it's teaching you JavaScript and
how to become a programmer um six too
young to teach some of your code
probably is what what age you start
reading is it like it's probably around
six right I think you have to know too
how to read before you can write and
learn basic algebra um kids equal no
free time
yeah tomorrow's nice and clean
uh yeah it's cuz uh there's nothing in
here right now except the wife or cuz
we're moving in two weeks or in ten days
nine days nine days actually um so we
are getting situated we so now that
April I've been holding off on buying
some of the small things when wanting
for the office random questions but when
should you reach 500 plus connections
500 plus connections on what what
specifically um yeah I mean I got a
little bit of adrenaline going with the
cat bleeding and on LinkedIn um James
Shackelford says are you going to work
on the information security and quality
assurance on the beta free code camp I
am indeed um James I I think that's
great
what does my shirt say says yes I am a
programmer I know I don't care about
your app ideas and then on the back it
says I see not even for equity um yeah
um for those of you don't know if you
fall in the Facebook group you might
have noticed that I've been leaning
towards selling some coding shirts so
you might be seeing some of that in
future videos I'm leaning towards
everything said and done a t-shirt being
$25 tax shipping flat done that's what
I'm leaning towards out the door 25
bucks
you get a nice quality tea and we go
from there um but I don't think there is
a I mean 500 connections on LinkedIn I
don't think there's a point in time
which that's important because you
really should be connecting with people
in your field that you know um where did
I get this one this was actually made by
a subscriber of mine who
who wanted me to wanted me to wear it
for a video and I did and I think you
got to sales out of it three sales out
of it and so he sent me one well yeah so
I'll probably be pushing a few shirts in
the in the future um for if if you guys
know anything about YouTube the way that
you make your money in YouTube isn't
actually for ad revenue it's through
utilizing the audience that you have in
various ways whether that be promoting a
business you're starting of course
you're selling a t-shirt that you're
selling whatever it may be and the key
for that is to one sell something that
people would be interested and to to to
to make sure it's high quality so that
it's all about repeat business just like
repeat watch it repeat views right so
like I don't I don't really get anything
out of you watching one video I want you
to watch every video I post from the day
you subscribe and so that's the same
concept when you're when you're selling
something as well this is all about
repeat business
there might be a coding Dodd t-shirt in
the works a couple different ones where
let's just say that there's a skit
coming up if you if you guys are
following I'm dropping hints boys on
dropping hints about some epicness
that's going to happen in about three to
four weeks there's going to be some
epicness if you've been following the
Facebook group I posted a few things
earlier today
dropping a little bread crumb somebody
might be putting together that
something's in the works um but I got
I'm tying it all together you guys think
this coding god thing just came out of
nowhere it's definitely a way of steal
your sponsors so way up isn't a sponsor
I just put them on my thing because I
get 75 cents to sign up and I only get
like $10 every three months for them so
I probably won't do that in the future
but def Nilan is a sponsor of mine the
only reason you don't see it on there is
some reason when I use restream the
description doesn't load a default I
have to figure out how to do that with
restreamed io so basically what I do is
I just go in after and I copy and paste
my standard description in there to take
care of it but yes Deb Mountain is still
my sponsor they actually just um
they just renewed their sponsorship
today so we go on a month-to-month basis
but I've been they've been my my sponsor
for quite some time we have a very bit I
think I think I give them a pretty sweet
deal
I think everybody's happy so I imagine
they'll stay a sponsor for quite some
time the only way that would change is
if perhaps I want to start marketing the
end of my videos for myself at which
point I may have to say hey I need to
charge you more money or I got to take
it away I don't know I'll figure
something I plan on being sponsored by
Deb Mountain as long as I can be because
I like their product and they they have
treated me well from day one I'm a loyal
guy
this is a thing man I'm a loyal guy and
Deb Mountain sponsored your boy when he
had like 6000 subscribers that's hard to
get man um so yeah here we are coding
out t-shirt in the works
um how did I get Deb Mountain as a
sponsor you guys want me to give away
all the hot tips how do you get the
screen the chat on the screen they do
this um well I emailed them that was it
I emailed them and liked the product I
like I like their bootcamp I've heard
good things I've talked with the
engineer shoots who's been there I've
actually been to their campus in Salt
Lake City
uh excuse me Provo Utah by Salt Lake
City when I went and hung out with Matt
in Utah so I this is kind of funny I
didn't want to come I um I was uh they
didn't know Matt and I knew each other
when they sponsored me and then a week
later I was at their campus I was like
hey thank you for the sponsorship by the
way not like stalking or anything but I
wanted to come by and say hi see the
campus at math Benton at four last three
months but they asked to that that's
kind of how that happened uh it's a
small town Salt Lake City isn't though
Salt Lake City was beautiful I would
love to live in Salt Lake City man that
was my shape man
um I would love to do that
I would actually love to work at one of
them as well um I wish they would just
hire me that'd be cool man
your boy just I like literally what if
we just changed the coding tutorials 360
channel and instead all we did was we
changed it to dev Mountain I got all the
ad revenue and we just did it and at the
end we promoted the fuck a dead mountain
every video man just sell out completely
uh am i I've always wanted to work at a
coding boot camp as a small note not
necessarily as an instructor but
something uh I don't think they'd hired
me as instructor I don't think I'm
qualified enough to be answering I
really do think you should only be
hiring senior developers as instructors
for a lot of these things but uh yeah
um
I wish one day I could work for free
code cams though that like there's a
couple companies I'd like to work for at
the top of the list is free code cam if
free code camp ever starts making some
real money and they need somebody to do
something I'm ready man
put me in coach this is this is the
dream right now what I want to work with
free code camp I want to I'm just a
believer man I like what they're doing
go from there start coding we're waiting
on April right now I'd also like to work
for code CAD me I think they're fucking
up and I think I could help them about
you know how many most instructors are
not senior developers that's probably
true but I think they should be so I'd
be kind of a hypocrite to you guys want
to see the new the new office plant but
y'all didn't know that your boy was
kicking it all classy like this the
bamboos off is plainly wet look at that
that looks fancy as shit right so not
only are we going to have not only we're
going to have the central a diffuser we
also have we're setting up the whole or
set up the whole garden here now man so
this is leafy leafy is they're twins of
bamboo um now I plants are supposed to
be good free for your offices this is
the only plant I think I couldn't I
wouldn't kill it's pretty hard to kill
bamboo so I've been told I don't know it
might die really knows uh so far so good
though it's only been two days but I
think it's soon pretty hot yeah now that
April is working I'm able to treat
myself to a few things that I wasn't
before
tomorrow
I'm going to go buy two more 4k monitors
so that'll put me up to four 4k monitors
I have a stand coming in so that they're
going to be mounted two and two
um so just smoke no I'm so a small
because I that have been $1200 on
monitors but um really the only thing I
spend money on is my computer in office
everything else is neat we got the green
screen that's coming we got the new
lights April works in an office that's
really all I'll say about that just
because a lot of employers don't like
you talking about stuff like that
ah so Josh the reason I didn't get a
mini cactus and I got bamboo instead is
because I have cats and I don't want
them I don't want them to scratch their
face on that's that's the truth
I don't think it's too stressful um but
I don't know man I'm feeling pretty
stressed at my job um yeah you can see
I'm breaking out but over here and here
and here it's just probably the second
time in about eight months I've been
stressed at work um which is all the
more reason I've been stressed for about
a month at work it's interesting man
because I've never felt like this before
so it's interesting we there could be a
whole video just about being stressed at
work and talking about that you're going
to write that down
uh stressors and I don't know what I'm
doing no I know what I'm doing or
stresses and if I fuck this up I might
lose my job stress as in they're trying
to sell an unfinished product I guess I
I don't know my issue there's just like
we're starting to a lot of meetings
we're starting to do a lot of
presentations and stuff like that
stresses me out there we go come on
let's try to wake up your eyes oh all
right you ready no
all right so today um do you want me for
the webcam up or down for this we're
just sitting here yeah
listening on something else
yeah I was debating Alaric
Lawrence Wilson will answer this
question and then we're going to start
our session here and at the end if
there's any additional questions will
once nobody says I work full-time and
I'm in school for coding how much time
stress our encoding to fully grasp the
concepts you should probably Cody
minimum of three hours a day but make
sure you coat every day so even if you
can't cut the three try and get your
wanted hi Jordan
hey Kelly's house there a little battle
written Kitty to do McHale thing did you
don't long yeah I started this video and
I was like holy shit what's all this
blood Aurora that April is very nice and
super funny oh thank you alright loser
Mara as his daughter I'm six years old I
believe Oh Nev six ears they're so spray
pepper age just all that whirring sprite
okay um hello hood and goddess God over
here is bill jelly alright so let's talk
about jobs all right so I won't put this
down because you may focus there's so
much to cover all right so we're talking
yesterday about how you didn't
understand I didn't know what is in
JavaScript essentially what what's there
for you to use and it's all for you to
decide how to use it so we're going to
go through all of this probably not
today
definitely not today well that's our
task today so let's see here
to output syntax I will start with
syntax so console dialogue and stuff
like that don't worry about that we're
sharing syntax so you know how to set
variable sum assign variables right and
reassign and right strings with double
quotes or single quotes you can do math
operators
you can also create if you're not going
to assign values you just want to create
under a bunch undefined variables you
can by putting a comma in between them
how would you give value to those
variables later like this just reassign
the value okay um let's see yeah you
know how to do comments we've talked
about camelcase
picture all right so Dom manipulation
we've talked about before we haven't
done too much of it
what it basically does is the document
is the whole page on the browser with
the page okay and then you get element
by ID will then get the element in this
case is demo and then ill set a property
of it in this case enter HTML which
essentially what's inside it so even if
we have tests in here we run this it's
actually overriding and putting hell of
dolly so that's the JavaScript working
with the HTML to be done in remember the
light bulb on and off sort of thing
exactly like that you really could take
variables and use it to add things
together you know how to create
functions you can throw the Dom
manipulation in the functions as well
all right let's continue on comments
talked about single and multi line multi
lines a slash star star slash variables
alright so you have number credit
variable you can add variables
you need sign read value with equals you
can create them and they'll just be
undefined
oh this looks pretty you can also
declare a bunch of variables at once so
you can see for our person is equal to
John Doe call informationally declaring
them yes this is fine you know I don't
normally do this too much I actually
don't know if that's good convention or
about a convention I normally don't and
the reason for it the reason for why I
don't is I like to go line by line to be
able to better examine what my code is
doing and this to me is a little more
jumbled but it is important to know that
you can do this but you can do it as
like this as well see but you have to
know see this might look like we're
reassigning the value but we're actually
just initially assigned variable akiles
I was like I'm not looking at you
okay so one thing to note is if you try
to add a five string to a two and three
number what you're going to end up with
this 55 because these two are going to
add together to make five and then this
plus is going to concat a I know buddy
you hurt your paw
yeah that's something that I did see
when I was watching the videos mm-hmm
all right the equals assignment operator
you can add you can multiply you can
divide subtract the modulus increment
and decrement what's what's this one
doing it and adds one to the value minus
1 to the value and then you can do the
same thing where plus equals there's
also minus equals x equals divide equals
modulo equals good just shorthand
basically um there's some comparison
operators we've talked a little bit
about this double equal stood checks if
the value is equal to equals checks as
the value type again redemptions nobody
um there is not equal right and then
there's not equal equals which is type
and value and so what's the difference
between value and type for what
in general value in type your type can
be like string good value
use the amount and which you give it
value
good good greater than less fun then
there's this ternary operator which when
there's a ternary operator which we'll
talk about later so logical operators
this is something that you haven't been
really working with you and you should
when you should know that work so the
and if both sides of statement are true
okay the or and then the not so there's
also two ways to check the type of an
object you can say type of and then the
variable and you'll get the value and
then there's instance of this is where
when you're checking if it's at
basically a check of class which is a
saying so let's say you wanted to make
sure that you're getting the correct
type of something you would say type of
whatever your variable say variable is
my array they're my number you want to
check the type of it if it's a number
it's going to your number if it's a
string it's a return string so it's
going to return what type it is
what is the bottom line instance of this
is for you can create classes with
objects and you can set things to be
part of that class essentially and so
that's what does checking oh well if you
just want to make sure that you created
the right class or something that would
be how it would be used so like maybe
you had maybe your code wants to make
sure that you're a student in instance
you're all persons but every person is I
very teacher a student and then you want
to make sure that that instance of April
is a student of the person class and you
start going down like that so we've
talked about arithmetic all right so
some of the stuff I'm going to be going
through pretty fast cuz we've already
gone over it right everything so far
should be reviewed
so the expression grouping
fortune
that doesn't exist shit
Latino all right so there's also gone
over this whoa what was that
greater than greater than greater
one of those
Oh
it has to do with bits like the 1 and 0
digital representations uni don't worry
about it that's such a crazy use case
there's no need to worry about it
alright uh data types alright so you
know about number string and object and
there's boolean as well undefined as
well
you can also write your numbers in
exponential see this 123 e5 will come
out as that looks like but bullying us
we've also talked about a raise now if
your check the type of in array it will
return object so just be aware of that
because it's an object
hey let's go off these guys right now
giving them attention no matter their
marilene I know so you said let's see I
see the type of right here if you want
to find out if this is a string it will
return string
yeah
all right so see returns object not
array for type of if you want to check
that it is an array I'll show you real
quick things the way of doing that so
instead of checking that we can do that
you say array dot is array and this will
strip this will return either true or
false in this case it returns bullying
but which is it this is going to say
true that's what it's returning because
it's returning the type of so we have to
rid of type of and we run it you know
suture there we go so there's a function
in a ready to check if it is an array so
just be aware that if you're checking
the type of something that's an array it
will return as an object
all right let's data types functions
we've talked about flinches what's this
one to do no for a cat who does roof is
nail off she's being a pretty feisty
right now so this one multiplies right
so getting the product it's taking to
parameters and then multiplying the name
of it is my function and the way we call
it is just say my function parentheses
with the parameters in it well we have
to call the parameters to know this is
an example you can name whatever you
want as long as they don't match a
keyboard that RT exists and the actual
real values that were passing in the
four and three are the arguments so four
is the argument for the a parameter and
three is the argument for the bean frame
all right let's show you this one so you
can kind of see it game tied together so
we have this ID demo we're targeting it
there's a document dot get element by ID
demo and then we're saying hey what do
we want to change that value to well we
want to actually take the Celsius and
convert it to Fahrenheit and then we
want displayed on the page so when our
document runs when this loads it goes
ahead and does that for us
and see how we're setting it on the sly
good
now if we don't use
if we don't use the the if we don't use
the parentheses it will actually just
print out the function so I would just
call to Celsius our function here we
don't pass any parentheses into it it
actually is just all we're doing is
sending over such loose string version
of that function cool okay like I don't
know I don't know either I've never
actually used it for anything so you're
not the only one all right so I feel
like they smell blood in there and
they're getting like very primitive yeah
yeah um okay so let's look at this our
car we instantiate our object with these
curly braces and then we have a key
value pair so in this case when we say
hey we're targeting our demo paragraph
again and we want to change the text to
be equal to card so our card type is
feel that's how we're able to set up a
basic object we've gone over this in the
past as well although we haven't taught
you haven't really worked with objects
too much same thing with a person first
name last name now if you did something
like that let's say
like search like let's say you know as a
fee Appa you typed in all the
descriptors
what do you be able to get feedback what
do you mean like a search if we were
doing a shirt like say we just wanted to
get first name that's what you're saying
yeah but you didn't know his first name
or - no to ask that it was this first
name so you just put in all the
information you knew would you be able
to get John missing information yeah I
talk I think you're talking about
querying a database so there's a
database and what you're talking about
is doing a search say we knew the age of
50 in this case we would we could filter
a database by everybody whose age 50 and
we could filter by another primary
another parent but that's not what we're
doing
oh but you might get that data back in
an object or an array of objects so you
can also access this with the property
value so remember there's bracket
notation for things as well so you can
use personal property or person bracket
property it's the same thing usually the
standard way is doing the person da
property
all right so you have bracket notation
access so you can also have so you can
also have functions as part of objects
so see how we have this function
parameter here full name and it's equal
to a function that does some stuff so
so
so when we when we call full name we're
actually saying hey for this whoever
this is getting called for in this case
its person right so this person our
person first name plus space plus last
name we're going to get John Doe it's a
function that we wrote within our what
that plus is being used for their
ticking cat to add a space to see how we
don't invest race okay so you can add
functions to objects as well ignore that
you know everyone do that
are you tucked right so we talked about
scope we've talked about global multiple
scope so then you really need to be
aware of um but basically global scope
you can access things anywhere and then
it's various shades of local scope with
for loops with what's functions with
with everything else area shades huh
handle it huh mm-hmm
alright events so we're going to start
we've shown a couple of these things in
the past where we we can actually write
on click where we can call a function in
this case we're just putting straight-up
JavaScript and setting the inner HTML
instead of what time it is a button to
that time or excuse me we're actually
going to the demo to the demo and
putting it up so every time we do it
it's going to change
but this is called an event events are
something where the user interacts with
the page events I have keywords - yeah
like on click so we do it that's an
example of one there's on change meaning
that an input has changed or element has
changed onmouseover you hover over
something onmouseout when you hover out
of something when you push a keyboard
down or on on page load and there's more
of these as as we move on and as we
start using frameworks and things like
that
all right so shrinks we've talked about
strings pretty extensively you can get
the length of the string with don't lean
just like an array dot length you get
the length of a string how long it is um
we've talked about how you can't use the
same quotes in here you have to use
these escape characters where if you
want to use that you have to do the
forward slash my little stop and there's
some other ones on here you don't really
need to worry about this because we're
going to move you into es6 and there's a
lot easier ways to do all this ourselves
Milo come on buddy all right so string
string string string methods ship there
haha
okay so dot length I think you
understand let's talk about index of so
say you want to font my life I've
fucking kill you say you want to find
the first occurrence of this word so in
this case we're trying to find locate
locate if we count the letters that's
zero is P one two three four five six
seven
on the seventh index we find what we're
looking for it locates Oh index of will
give you that
okay and this can go for anything that
you want it to be but it's only going to
return the first occurrence of it Laurie
yeah or if there's duplicates
it's not giving a duplicate there's a
duplicate how about it just says seven
doesn't tell you there's no that's what
I'm saying it's not going to tell you
where this one is it's going to tell you
where the first yes how do you tell you
is it's a different you probably after
an algorithm well you can do the last
index of which will actually return the
last occurrence of it but there's three
there's middle one that wolf
oh the middle and if it doesn't occur if
it doesn't come back if it doesn't exist
it's going to return negative one the
middle child doesn't exist no no I'm
sure that says no middle occurs if it
doesn't exist
it returns a uniform okay
I'm trying to get you to to actually be
good at coding them it's a journey
a lot of fun what apparently
all right so um
you can also stop put up parameter in
here as to where you want to start so
like we start on the 15th index and then
we'll find the first index up so you
might write an algorithm that would do
exactly that find one and then start
from there find another one start from
there sort of thing
the search method is kind of similar
I couldn't tell you what makes that one
different from index of they're kind of
the same thing
all right the slice method so say you
want to actually extract part of the
string you'll slice it out and give it
to you so say we wanted banana we run
our code he'll get us banana and we pass
in a starting index and an ending index
so let's look at here where we go 0 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 so then we go BAM 8 9 10 11 12
13 and we take out the word banana and
now we have banana
I think I borrowed an something like
this but dot slice can be used to turn
something into an array right so there's
this doesn't turn anything into write
array has a similar function we can
slice it out of the array yeah we sliced
something we turned it into an array but
it was a string I think you're getting a
couple things confused
but we split a string into an array and
then we joined it back together into a
string that's not what this is doing
this is just taking something out of a
string from a starting point and an
ending point as parameters
sub-string is
someone or to exactly what we did so
substrate you do that as well
now there's sub STR which the only main
difference is instead of actually
putting one today good the only main
difference is that you put how many
letters you want to slice out and not
the index number as the same parameter
that's just another way of slicing out
of a string right for place you can out
replace words you want to get them down
so he doesn't hurt himself
alright so replace it's okay I don't
know if I like it just funny bucks oh my
god yes windows
could God means a better desk Gossman
think about upgrading the desk and
giving April this one I want a bigger
desk um anyhow uh so you can also
replace stuff as well so you have you do
that with the string replace method
first you say hey what do you want to
replace what word out is it that you're
looking to replace the next one is what
do you want replace it with so please
visit Microsoft will now be pleased just
at w3schools that's the replace method
why would you use why would you we'd
would you what like okay so feel like
fifty thousand pieces of code you would
just sort of looking for it you just
replace it no it's a function that
allows you to replace a string whenever
Cody is all about making things dynamic
so let's go back to the login example we
have a login and says hey please login
or thank you for logging in Dylan that
string if it says please login we could
do something where we want that to
change to this other string when the if
statement passes the if stick link
exactly
and you can pass in what's called a
regular expression which is basically
formatting in here as well
I did for a moment yes like to uppercase
it to lowercase so temper case into the
lowercase to uppercase will capitalize
everything so if we run this you'll see
hello world one one way to that you want
to keep up keep in mind is when you're
solving algorithms and things like that
is that you're going to need to use cell
per case into lower cases things are
case sensitive so you may want to
convert those things if I'm comparing
two words and once capitalized and one's
not they're never going to be equal so
you may have to lower them use these
functions to uppercase or to lowercase
to use that properly yes okay so you
have two uppercase Y all set to
lowercase or it's things lower case
we've talked about concat I'll show it
again can cat ads words together so we
have hello we have world and we're
saying text one we want text three to be
the output or say text one calm cat and
then you can pass chained as many things
together as you want so in this case we
just have to we're saying text once
hello then go ahead and have his face
then go ahead and add text to which is
hello world
so char at say we want to know what the
the character is that we can save char
at and then zero is H that's another
string method we can use to get the
character at that location
another thing you can do is it doesn't
work in IE but I use a piece of shit I
don't care about that but you can access
a string this faithful
are we are we going too fast
where would you like me to
I don't know I think you're just going
that quickly because you don't really
have that much to say about anything
so I mean if that's just all there is to
say it's just because I mean we're at
the section where okay
and when do you want to go through and
I'll answer questions would that be
better
so what does this function do what is it
I'm sorry darling there is no string
tells you the length of the characters
in the string okay what does index up do
or is it
in themselves
so
so the first occurrence one yes
takes in a stream
once were the first occurrence so that's
why we're talking about the first and
the last and the non-existent no good
um lash index off what's up David and
against the loss and X of something
you're looking for search is kind of the
same thing so don't worry about that
slice with sliced it how does it work
first pull something out of the string
yes and what's the first value and the
second value so what if you don't know
the first you write your code so that
you do
so you can also one thing I skipped over
is that you can also go backwards if you
want to start at the end of the string
you do negative so you go start working
your way backwards so I like starting
and like banana started a and go back to
the B negative 12 so if we go let's see
here you were to say 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12
negative she'll remember starts like one
here and then we were to go to negative
six with basically what happens is it
would go backward so 1 2 3 4 5 6
Oh
so if you don't know the rest of the
string it will just take the rest of it
a little slice from where you started
okay same thing with the negative
substring works in the same way except
it can't go negative so it's not as
dynamic as a little bit but it works and
then upstream so strings like slice
except it can't go backwards I couldn't
tell you why one usually over the other
of their sub STR which is similar but
that second parameter is how many you
want to take from that first parameter
not the index number it's a little more
intuitive I would say for most people so
we want to start at index seven and then
we want to go six spaces past that to
slice it that's always say oh okay so
kind of like what you do as a human
being
what a computer with I suppose so yes
um we've talked about replace you
replace the words
see
- uppercase what's that - turns
everything in uppercase and then yeah to
lowercase rinse everything lowercase
it's usually compared and how does can
categorise to put strings together Chara
Chara stands for character would you so
char at will return the index value pass
in of the string value so if we pass it
one it will return a capital e
why
because remember each string every
character is an index value so when we
say char at zero its H when we say char
1 its e so on and so forth
simply say native to uh I don't think it
goes negative
let's check gonna try it try it
all right these commands important I
thought most people just reference them
are you talking about the functions the
reason we're going over them is because
April doesn't know they exist and she's
not quite there looking of documentation
yet so we're going over we're going to
be going over the string functions the
number functions the array functions the
boolean functions may be the object
functions there's only a couple Doug so
but we're going over the main methods
anyhow of strings numbers arrays I'm
covering this so that she knows exists
so that when she's trying to solve these
algorithms she knows that there there
are tools that are available for her so
it looks like the negative doesn't work
we've already talked about accessing the
string value like that dot char at is
the better way of doing it though okay
so what's the difference between that
this won't work and ie the other ones
just better you do it like this but
so um do you remember what split does we
used it yesterday at the end of yeah so
I'm a little fuzzy on the details I
guess because I was under the impression
that it takes a string and turns it into
an array yes ooh that's promise effin
not what you said I remember what you
said if I said no it was not so let's
take a look at this so if we split on a
comma and this is our string what do you
think is going to happen it's going to
return each index split on an a my
function my function on our string so I
was saying that string equals ABCDEF
then it's saying bar argument equals so
why is that a variable we're storing
that we're taking what's in the string
and where you are now I didn't know if
our variables could do that yes you've
seen this couple times where on one end
we call a function and that returns a
value so it's Bar function
so here what's going on here is we have
a function that is connected to the on
click event so when we click this it
runs our my function yes you get that oh
okay okay okay so in my function in the
block code of my function of my function
we have a string variable string which
equals to that ABCDEF then you have
another variable R for ready all right
equals string dot split and we're
splitting it every comma split is what
breaks it up into the array I just
didn't know you put it in a variable you
can yes because we have to store it this
returns a value so when it returns about
so if you don't use it in a barrio won't
store it no wouldn't do anything so it
returns a value to nowhere so either you
didn't get far enough we didn't get far
enough on the string for you to know ok
so this returns this string in array
form
and then we return the sink it goes AV
shoot yeah that's what they're saying we
could have done yesterday with the
algorithm and I showed you that so split
is a common one to break a string up
into an array and if you want to break
it up into characters you do it in this
face okay I think that's a good place to
stop we touched on some string methods
I'm a little tired today so I learned
about make something eat my dessert I'm
eating my dessert right now I'm not
going to beg cuz you gonna eat it all I
have everyone all right guys uh sorry
friends a little dream today
uh I am and I'm stressed about work and
stuff so I apologize for that I try not
to be on here but were in day 28 you
have good days we have bad days um I'm
even thinking about wrapping this up on
day 30 be honest with you but I don't
think I could do it to myself
hmm
Oh
and it's been hard for us tonight Joshua
it's just been a lot especially with us
moving work
yeah but uh look you've gone today was
just a hard day for me anyhow guys um
thank you for watching don't forget to
join our Facebook group by the way maybe
have I told you how much our Facebook
group is killing it dropping little
breadcrumbs about things that have come
with the challenge and they yeah Jane
join my facebook group you guys a lot of
a lot of things are coming Dylan has
been very very excited about what's
gonna be happening yeah I Kevin Choi I
was thinking that too I was thinking
maybe we don't have to do it
consecutively now we have to okay
apparently hundred days is consecutive
yeah uh so we're at tooth Morgan came to
him thirty-eight this week almost 2400
not too shabby um thank you nice to have
him
yeah we'll get there guys um okay so
today we went over string functions so
remember let's review you can get the
length you can combine strings you can
cut things out of strings and and you
get you can okay you can locate parts
characters homewards and you can break
it up string into uh
you can you can break a string up into
it right that's what you now know all
the string methods exists tomorrow we're
going to talk about the number methods
and maybe the array methods okay good
alright guys that's it for today um I
don't want to hear about your stressful
life Kevin I'm sorry my life is you know
as funny is like how you were saying
that here in another stressful person
you're like oh that's nothing Kurt
alright that that's a lot what's funny
is like other people's stress stressing
me out so
I wish you the best on that yeah oh it's
much serenity to you something like that
yeah something
yeah we're sticking the planet ah I'm
just I'm probably going to stop working
on side projects for the wat for the bit
for the next week or so I don't know
what I'm gonna do um I think I'd be
alright if I could exercise but my hand
isn't quite there yet
it's almost
anyhow guys I joined the Facebook group
13 grad Jesus would you buy a car um
join the Facebook group support me on
patreon page rank Amish code or 360 I'll
see you guys tomorrow for day 29 and as
always cold long and prosper bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
