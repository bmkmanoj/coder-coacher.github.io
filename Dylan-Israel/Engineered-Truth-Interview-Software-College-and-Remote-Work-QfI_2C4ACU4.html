gonna be interviewing an old friend of
mine Matt Tran he has a much more
popular channel than I do called
engineered truth so that gives career
advice and you know what they're the
best degrees for college that sort of
thing
so one of the cool things is he does
social media video editing as his job a
lot of it freelance and contract and
he's been getting into software lately
doing for the free code camp he was had
some interest in going to a boot camp
where they might sponsor him do videos
about boot camp and so he's been really
kind of studying up on JavaScript all
those things and now his job his video
editing is met with the software and I
haven't talked too much about what my
job is I work at a software company and
I make videos and documentation for them
and now our worlds are kind of
overlapping I thought it'd be a great
time to kind of talk about what to do
when you try and learn new skills
software just being aware of how
software works can help you land jobs
and just any advice he's got his new
book coming out new grab job hacks and
so I thought this would be kind of a
cooperton
to do an interview with him his thoughts
on maybe software and engineering and
job market and just kind of a unique
perspective from someone who already
kind of gives career advice and you know
looks at what's out there and gives his
opinion on it as well so this is gonna
be hopefully a fun little thing all
right shameless plug is uh my book just
came out last month it's called new grad
job packs it's actually the complete
guide the complete guide to getting a
job after you finished college it's
actually really good I put a lot of
practical real-life advice in here that
is really up-to-date and a lot of
problems with
when I did research for the book a lot
of the books that are already published
are extremely out-of-date written by
people who are parents age who think the
world is still not not where it is today
so device you be reading from their book
is outdated while mine is completely
updated and obviously I make a lot of
common sense so be sure to check out on
Amazon
I'm sure Dylan will put a link in the
description below categories are kind of
overlapping and yes so you haven't quite
yet worked with software just can you
kind of explain how in a recent
interview for a video making position
how that kind of benefited you all right
so I was I did recently in Scott a it
was they had a phone interview with a
company called 10-fold they contacted me
over angel list comm Angela which is I
highly recommend if you want to work at
a start-up our Technology annual Co and
so I was in the phone interview with
their founder and you know the founder
asked me you know if the video stuff
never worked out if my youtube channel
never worked out what would have done
for a career and I told them you know
I'd be a software engineer I actually
teach myself a little bit of JavaScript
through for you code camp and you should
I hate you sit up here his tone change
he's like oh you want to learn code like
you know we have 14 developers on the
team like you can learn and so you know
when people are hiring my role at this
10-fold company would be to make all
their videos and you'd be surprised at
how many videos you need at a tech
company they need tutorial videos they
need marketing videos they need videos
that help build a community and for most
videographers they don't really have any
interest in code at all they're like
opposite direction there they don't want
to learn it just
baura boards them right so being a
videographer who appreciates code really
set me apart and I pretty much have this
job like guarantee and this guy's
getting rid of job but you know it makes
me such a unique person where I'm not
just a videographer who wants to make
short films right I'm a videographer who
wants like practical videos that help
companies grow and in this particular
case a software company finding a
videographer who appreciates code is
really rare and it also helped my videos
be better because I have a deeper
understanding of how the code works so
then when I explain it I don't sound
like a noob alright so a lot of people
one of the things they like about
programming is that you can be
self-taught yeah Stack Overflow in 2015
says 41 percent of people are
self-taught programmers and I know you
have a very unique stance on college and
maybe you can elaborate about that and
in terms of how software you can do
outside of that I think with software
it's something where it moves so quickly
that a computer science degree is
usually outdated it is outdated computer
science degree is straight-up outdated
right and you're gonna learn a lot of
fluff that you don't need to learn you
don't need to know like there's a lot of
 Dylan was studying the other day
and he was putting some some things out
I'm like yeah you're never gonna use
that in real life he's like yeah I know
I'm not gonna use in real life and
that's just a matter of fact so like the
most useful degree one the most useful
degrees you can get in college is a
computer science degree and even that
degree is outdated so basically you
shouldn't go to college and gentlemen
right but you know like Dylan mentioned
40% of all developers are self-taught
and so if you're a person who studied
something not very useful its Soviet we
studied something not useful in college
and you're think about oh I need to go
back to school to study engineering like
mechanical engineering or Electrical
Engineering I recommend against it
actually I only recommend going to
school back to school pretty much if
you're gonna do something in healthcare
like that's pretty much the only reason
you need to go back to college for is if
you want to switch
you know careers to be a doctor or a
nurse or something but if you want to do
something technical like being an
engineer or being a software engineer
don't go back to school just teach
yourself from their internet and
employers will not ask for your degree
you know I want from I wear all the jobs
I've applied for not a single one of
them have passed for how do you hey Matt
have you gone to film school like
doesn't matter it doesn't matter to them
and it was not going to matter that you
need a degree in computer science
they're not gonna ask Quincey Larson the
founder for you code camp which I'm sure
you guys all whaler because this coding
tutorials 360 has a degree in history
quincy larson founder of free code camp
wrote all the code has a liberal arts
degree so no you don't need to go back
to school to get a high salary you just
even cheat yourself code which is a huge
pain the bud well okay so one of the
main reasons i feel so passionate about
my channel is because I was getting
incorrect career information and I think
it's easy for people to say like oh
Millennials are lazy Millennials are
lazy have you ever considered that maybe
you're sending Millennials in this
direction and actually that's the wrong
 direction and you should be
sending them this direction maybe
they're not lazy maybe they're on the
path that goes in circles and
doesn't get anywhere and the path that
actually makes sense
nobody's telling to go on that path so
they're working hard at something that's
ineffective right if you're working hard
at something ineffective it's never
gonna be effective because it's an
effective job right so so that's why I'm
so passionate about my career my channel
is because I got two degrees both were
not as practical as I like them to be
even the mechanical engineer one and I
feel like if I had better guidance which
this one my career channels for I would
have saved myself a lot of time so
that's what I hope to do with my channel
is save you guys a lot of time in
getting degrees that lead to careers
that me nothing right I want to give you
if you get a degree I want you to mean
something and most degrees in college
currently don't mean anything remote
work is the most broken thing to do like
literally I'm on a plane on vacation I'm
sitting on the plane for 18 hours
I do work the pace for the vacation and
then I'm on wait up how broken is that
sound it sounds really broken to me so
basically on a plane like you can
sometimes get Wi-Fi and do the work but
in my case I do videos so I can just
download all the videos that I need and
you do the editing on the plane right so
you can imagine you know I'm on the
plane to go to the Philippines I'm on
the plane for about 14 to 16 hours I
could do for like theoretically I could
do 14 to 16 hours of work technically
it's like when you're doing work like
this on a plane it's not that
it's not that appealing but you know I
did do work on the plane I did do work
wows in the Philippines
and the best part of freelance work is
that nobody can tell me not to take a
vacation like I'm gonna go there's no
one I took and tell me that I can't go
uh and actually while I was there I
actually maintained all that contracts
so I got paid while I was there I guess
you got to meet Matt if you don't know
from his YouTube channel engineer truth
go ahead and subscribe check them out
but I just thought it was very
interesting because a lot of what I
thought to be true about oh you have to
go to school for computer science to
break into the software industry is kind
of not true we have about 12 developers
at my work and a bunch of other das and
others so but really just about 10 to 12
developers and only one of them has a
computer information systems degree one
of the developers who just left went to
another company for more money and he
has a history degree so don't think that
you can't ever get that entry-level job
and break in just keep on getting better
creating a portfolio working on those
things that you need to work on make
sure your github is looking nice your
linkedin is looking nice all the stuff
that you have to do take on the low
freelance work just keep on trying take
on internships whatever it may be to get
your resume up but don't ever think that
the barrier entry is a computer science
degree no the barrier of entry is how
much time it takes for you to learn the
material on your own and if you can
learn it there's a job for you
so keep looking good luck guys hey guys
