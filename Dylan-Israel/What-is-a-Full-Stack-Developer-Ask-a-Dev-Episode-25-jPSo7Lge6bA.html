full-stack developer and specifically
what is the mean or myrn stack I could
do two videos of it so I think it's
probably best just to do one so what if
you're new to developing web development
specifically and you're not too sure
what a full stack developer is what it
basically means is that you are a
developer that can work on the front end
that would be HTML CSS JavaScript and
various JavaScript frameworks like maybe
jQuery angularjs react that's part of it
then you have the back end which would
be an example that could be node it
could be nut node and Express would be
the mean example and that also includes
your database so you have kind of the
front-end connects to the backend which
connects to the database and if you have
all these skills and your database can
be my sequel or MongoDB it's typically
what it is in the mean stack when you
when you have a front-end which connects
to the backend and communicates back and
forth and then it connects to the
database as well you have your full
stack developer it's basically you can
build the front part the good-looking
part you have sorted the back-end which
is typically your get calls your API
your you know this would be the node and
express in the mean example and then
that sometimes connects to the database
or does connect to the database and
those sort of three subsections if you
will really makes up a full stack
developer now what is the mean stack or
the myrn stack that refers to a certain
stack of technology that a full stack
developer would use so the mean stack
would be MongoDB MongoDB Express angular
and note so long go DB would be the
database Express a node would be the
back-end they kind of go hand-in-hand
and then Express is a framework for a
note by the way if you're not
not familiar with this just a package
that you use to work with note and then
you have angular for the front end and
now the merge stack is the exact same
thing except in that example instead of
angular it's react and you know these
these are things that common terms
you'll see quite often and if you're
you're really new I remember starting
out you know a year and a half two years
ago and still being a little confused
about it but that's all it is is the
full stack developer someone that can
work with the database can make a front
end of the application the website if
you will for the view and can make the
backend so you in the main example is
MongoDB which is you know SQL and that
MongoDB may may be switched out for my
sequel or something like that you know
it's kind of interchangeable but at the
end of the day the mean stack is MongoDB
Express angular and node kind of your
database your front end your back in and
the merge stack you just swap out react
for as well but hope that cleared up a
few things it's it's really that simple
and if you still want to know more about
the mean stack and just kind of see some
examples you can go to Mineo and you'll
see a quick little breakdown it
literally says mean stands for and you
can check it out but that's basically
all it is and I don't want you guys to
be confused but you should strive to be
a full stack developer sixty-five
percent of the jobs are for full stack
developers 25 percent are for back-end
and 10 percent for the front-end so if
you're trying to get to that developer
level that's where you need to strive
for the mean stack is a great stack to
learn mean or myrn just got to find
which one you prefer a reactor angular
react seems to be picking up pace quite
a bit and go with it you want to stick
with a stack of technologies now there's
also the lamp stack which is a open
source stack like most of these and
what's interesting about that is it kind
of uses a little bit of older
technologies the lamp stands for Linux
Apache Apache would be your server in
this instance my sequel and then that P
kind of transition similar to the mean
and merge between PHP Python or
even pearl I work with the lamp stack a
little bit at work with the PHP and the
my sequel and the Apache and I'm touched
Linux too much but that's a little bit
of an older stack typically at the boot
camps now they're teaching the mean
slash burn kind of combo stack there's
also the the Ruby on Rails stack but I'm
not too familiar with what the stack is
for Ruby's I don't want to dive into
that too much but that used to be pretty
popular I take about four or five years
ago as kind of the the curriculum of
choice at a lot of boot camps and it's
been replaced for the most part with the
mean and myrn stack and kind of a for
the better I think
one of the benefits of learning the mean
or myrn stack versus something like the
lamp stack in my opinion is you
typically one of the one of the great
things is everything's in JavaScript
right so Express works with JavaScript
node works with JavaScript angular react
works with JavaScript any of the
database right you can't do anything
about that but but if you use the
MongoDB and Mongoose it's a JavaScript
also right and so you can work it's more
like in JavaScript so you have
everything in JavaScript well you're
working to the lamp stack you have a
front end of the application has
javascript has maybe a framework that
goes with it then you have to do the PHP
also and it's much harder to become
proficient in all these things but my
cats kicking at the door he was ready to
get out of here that's my two cents on
the mean and Marissa as always guys
