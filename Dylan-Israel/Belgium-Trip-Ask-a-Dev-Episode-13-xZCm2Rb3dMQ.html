usual ask a dev but I thought it'd be
kind of fun I recently went to Belgium
for about three days to hang out with
engineer truth or Matt and here's a
little bit my triple some pictures some
videos just a little bit of fun if it's
a you only want the coding content this
is not the video for you disclaimer
anyhow I hope you guys enjoy it thanks
for watching we are live down on the 175
the freeway this is take number two take
number one we miss the turn oh we had to
pause the blog so we're right now for
those who don't know I'm headed down to
the Miami Airport for exact Iranian
close to Tampa is because the ticket was
like two hundred and fifty dollars
cheaper if I'd left from Miami so I'm
driving for hours there
each way and
hey Priscilla example the way back when
I meeting Matt trend or in future for
user followers or subscribers and
Belgium has been out there for about two
months now I kind of senior up into its
business and things like that going down
have a good time came across them just
already some really strange stuff a
giant 20-foot confederate flag and what
April support me is an RV park which is
kind of strange that that is allowed
someone needs to take that down that's
just my opinion oh yes so we're on our
way down and hopefully have a good trip
oh he's awesome how's the portal and we
didn't get any video yeah they may be
extinct they don't want to see the cows
dude how exciting is it to seek out if
we see any world
and then we should shampoo instead of
dipping cow bull shampoo couch oh no
can't see the cats well there was a
glimpse like you should do like a slo-mo
on that
and
you don't know behind those trees our
beautiful cows whoa
hi guys so we're on our way to the
airport and we see something that looks
like it'd be out of a tom and jerry
cartoon I honestly I'm afraid that at
any moment this thing's gonna fall and
over and crushed my tiny little car but
I've had a chance to go around it yet
I have three cylinders second militar
hi guys just got through security landed
in Belgium walking to the next to try a
taxi is about 130 a.m. eastern time my
normal time it's about 730am here I
think we're going to skip a day of sleep
in just your beast mode all right i'll
find taxi
did I love me like a farmers market /
antique
roadshow started saying
and I gave far away so nice tip
hey guys so this is the casino that Matt
and I were in he was only able to stay
in the bar because he wasn't dressed
good enough since he had sandals on as
security won't let him proceed alright
guys quick room tour we're about to
actually leave it but figure I get it I
camera we're seeing that easy hotel
which is kind of cool a little cheap
hotel where it's tiny you have the basic
amenities shower bathroom a little mere
little desk area that pulls out and then
two single beds and it comes with the
the youtuber as well package where one
is just in your room with you
all right guys
we have this I think it's called the
ultrium altay neum I don't know but it's
pretty beautiful structure here
you
you
tires
from the little bit you know let you
move it
really nice view here
this is the type of if we had a
tripod we throw it up get 30 seconds of
film on this circle right here throw it
up on video blogs yo man to infinity and
beyond I tell you what though be able to
exit this in style I like that it's
about 5am leave in the Penta Hotel right
now it's been a good but short trip kind
of wish I took extra day off but it is
what it is waiting for my uber pick me
up take to the airport and get back to
work get back to the grind I actually
didn't sleep so I was having trouble
sleeping because it still jetlagged so
it is 5am their time and I haven't slept
yet so just powering through hopefully
I'll get some sleep on the plane though
hey guys hope you enjoyed uh I guess
just some pictures and videos from my my
trip I have a lot of time in fun Belgium
are the reason I like to travel is one
day I hope to work remotely probably
about five to six years from now and I
want to see where I want to work for
remotely I don't necessarily want to
just work remotely in a country or state
I've always lived in and Belgium was
kind of exciting and worked out you'll
see that i really like the people i
really liked the architecture the food i
I just had a relatively good time it's
definitely place i would consider living
and down the future if that's a
possibility but i hope you guys enjoyed
it i'll try to do more as i travel
