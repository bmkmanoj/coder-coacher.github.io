back in code fights the intersection
through the fog deposit profit there's a
lot of subheadings and stuff but that's
where we're at
so what we're asked here is we are
getting three inputs a deposit amount a
rate of growth and a threshold and what
we threshold of being hey when we hit
that number we're done
and what we want to return back is how
many years with this rate of growth will
it take for us to hit our threshold so
in our example here you know if we are
growing by 20 our threshold will hit 170
in about three years so that's what we
need to return back let's start by
creating a function called year it
should be pretty straightforward and
what we're doing will have a while loop
the error rate so check say is our
deposit greater than our threshold or is
our threshold still greater than the
faucet if it is run our logic against
which is just a balal loop and in here
the wall threshold is greater than
deposit
what we want to do is we want to take
our deposit amount we want to add to it
the deposit value times the rate of
growth divided by a hundred because it
will actually pass in a floating number
so in our case we have deposit plus
equals the value of deposit times rate
divided by 100 so every time that
happens we want to increase the year by
one and that's it I mean at that point
we just return the year so the hardest
part is maybe if for some reason you got
to was this number 33 or 35 or whatever
and you don't understand interests and
like a mean interest and how that's our
compound interest but this is
essentially compound interest at its
core so I for the first year he gains 20
after that he gains 24 because now he's
gave me interest on his interest it's so
on and so forth and we're just keeping
track of how long that would take for
him to do it
pretty straightforward uh you could
probably use recursion in here as well
um if you don't want to use a while loop
you wanna maybe create a more fancy
function and but uh so I did pretty
straightforward in my book no need for a
recursion but as always guys so thank
