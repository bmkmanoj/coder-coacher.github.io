you're like me your show the local
weather project is broken because you
use something to check the browser
geolocation that's no longer allowed if
you're not from a secured site in the
new versions of Chrome and Firefox so
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
go ahead and get the geolocation using
an API so first thing we want to do here
is take out all our bad code now we're
just gonna go ahead and delete all of
this right here and then we're gonna go
ahead and delete the two brackets at the
bottom as well so here's one and two so
at this point we still have it all
broken but we've got rid of our bad code
now what do we need again let's start
fresh so we're gonna need a new lab tube
we're gonna need a new longitude all
right so these are undefined right now
so now we need to fill them I used I pee
- API comm to get the geolocation
so we're going up to the latitude and
longitude just by using this link right
here or this link so this will take you
to the API code
what we want to do is go ahead and do
another get json call we want to pass in
the URL then we want to run a function
it takes in a parameter call it data two
and that does some stuff now the first
thing that we should do is just create
set the value of lat
to our data to dot lat and then we're
not console dot log that out to make
sure that we fully understand what is
going on so at this point you should we
should be getting a API link and so
you're still see it's undefined but
we're getting our number here so that's
all that we care about so we know that
it's working so let's go ahead and set
up our long as well so that was data two
dot lon no it no G on there and because
we're paranoid we wanna make sure we're
doing that correct as well it's pretty
good to check every step of the way and
now we have a new number here which
we'll assume is my number so it's going
to get rid of this long so as we've
noticed we're still getting undefined
there's two things we can do about the
way I did it was we are going to instead
take everything that's here and just go
ahead and throw it in this JSON call
here and that should fix our code and
you'll notice now I have this background
Universal City scattered clouds 57
degrees Fahrenheit everything's working
just fine so again all we did was we use
the API ok came out in JSON form and we
said look for that data I get to launch
to latitude and then we ArchiCAD the
string we can go ahead and get rid of
this now that we know everything's
working and we have our weather 57
degrees Fahrenheit so I hope that you
guys found this helpful I know it was a
little bit of a shock but this is
another way to solve this and if we
would have done in this way if there was
no way to predict that the chrome update
was gonna break it
but you just have to go back and change
your Co that's part of programming I
hope you guys enjoy it see you next
