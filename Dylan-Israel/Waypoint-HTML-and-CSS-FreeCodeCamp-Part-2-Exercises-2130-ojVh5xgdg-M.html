HTML CSS or on exercise 20 line and
we'll probably go to 30 where 20 is a
little bit much for these videos so
we'll go 30 so it looks like we'll have
about seven five or six or seven videos
this time around so if I remember
correctly were youth we're working with
anchor tags now so
see here's an example of blah blah blah
you're a element should have a anchor
text of cat photos alright so where is
our a element I guess we need to create
one
so we'll say a a href equals to here so
this is where our anchor element it's
going and then do not copy that
there we go and we wanted to say cache
photos
alright rent us they're gonna school so
you can look to the right here and you
can see look oh it's an anchor tag when
we click on it it's gonna take us to
free Kat phone app calm create a P
element around your a element alright so
we're gonna write a paragraph around our
anchor tag so let's just go ahead and
set it up let's give ourselves a little
bit of space to work with here all right
and your a element should be nested
within your P element that's true your P
elements should have text view more do
more and let's remove it and there it is
so view more and then cat photos cool so
that was too
make dead links using the hash symbol
hmm excuse me you're a element should be
a dead link with the HR set to the pound
all right so a true kind of by default
needs to have something in there if I
remember correctly and the default here
in most case is just putting pounds so
this look this won't you can click on it
and then it'll just put pound at the top
of your url and does nothing so if you
don't have a value just a am percent a
hash tag pound this is what I called it
back in my day and just use one of those
Tic Tac Toe looking mofos alright so now
we're gonna nest an image in our ailment
so let's see if we just so let's see if
they let us do that so see where how we
can click on it all now cool save just a
little bit of typing so what do we do we
took our image class that was already
here that wasn't part of this paragraph
we then inserted it into the paragraph
and into the anchor tag for the link and
bam we're good so that's three uh we're
moving on to four here killing it we're
going through about a slight a minute
right now it's pretty good I'd say your
your image element Shevin all attributes
such a cute orange line in the back so
alt for an image is basically what their
text is so like when you hover over it I
believe so a cute cat lying on its back
nice so we're going on to five right now
sorry I'm keeping track so I can I don't
go over cuz that's one thing I wish they
had this number one of whatever so that
would be very nice maybe I'll send them
a message about making it easier to list
or waiting out so we're gonna create an
unordered list bulleted list so um looks
like we can do this forever we're gonna
do it right below where our image class
is and we're gonna say ul so I know
ordered list and then we just want to
have one li / a line and we'll just say
it's something like that
alright you should have three li oh we
need three in there
alright so cats and we're gonna copy and
whoops
we'll just copy through three more
elements of this
fat fingering the keyboards or cats cats
and cats cool so we created our
unordered list that's why they're bullet
points if we wanted to create numbers
we'd use oh well instead of UL and then
we printed up cats three times all right
so we need a Noel with three allies in
there okay cool so we just sit our ul
and this time we'll create a Oh L which
is what I was just talking about with
the ordered list it's pretty easy to
remember the difference range waiting ul
I know well just remember that one's
ordered and once not and should be a
problem so we'll type this out the
old-fashioned way and let's see here
and so there's our ordered list with
three objects we don't have anything in
there so we'll say dogs
sheep Mouse
I don't know why but we're going with
the animal team and there we go
so now we're moving on to exercise seven
I believe so yeah
create a text field so text fields are
kind of cool so here we go we do a
little something like so we say input
type equals text
and then now we're able to click in and
we can type yeah
battle whatever your own type cool and
this is useful in like web development
because it'll be integrating the HTML
into you know PHP and java servlets and
things like that I think we're going on
to eight I think I add placeholder text
to the text field so you can put a
placeholder this is like cuz obviously
like what's this box for any maybe you
just want to put it in there so where's
our input type text and then placeholder
like in this case this is where you add
your cat photo URL so
photo URL and make sure useful place
loader right and you can see right there
it fills up but ever it's removed once
we start typing I think we're going on
to nine I'd be really impressed if I
kept track of this I son s your text
input which means we only have one more
to go
awesome alright next your text input
element from a form from a form element
nest your text input element from a form
element all right so we're creating a
form and we're gonna set we need to
close the form after this guy now what
do we want in our form here where you
want to set action equal to
/ cement cat photo so take our relative
URL meaning whatever page were on and
then supplement it with this I can
catenate it with this it's better way of
putting it go there let's friend that
you know we're good so what just
happened so this is more technical we
are now getting this form and having to
do it deuce take something so before
this is just empty data two degrees
there's something a mess around there
now we're actually doing something with
it and I believe we're at number 10
let's here add a submit button to the
form okay so now we're now we're
submitting it but now we were sending it
up there we go okay so what do we undo
what's in the form we want to say once
we create a button set the type equal to
submit and we just want to say submit on
it all right
make sure your but no mine is closing
tag it does and run and then you can see
right there there's our submit and that
is exercise 10 I think we did pretty
good this is but we're at about 11
minutes so we took maybe about a minute
a what made a little minute 10 / example
so did we did we keep on track there we
go we did our 10 cool um but yeah if you
guys do 10 of these a day you'll learn
HTML I mean that's that's in CSS this is
pretty pretty great I really like this a
lot it's based a little bit harder
because it's a design little different
but keep on checking out free code camp
comm comments questions concerns all
that good stuff guys reach me in the
comments thumbs up the video and share
it if you can I think just will say
thanks for the likes and the comments
let me know if I'm doing good I'm
learning
hopefully you're learning still this is
a field we all need to be learning in
and if I'm ever miss for if I ever
misrepresent something because I'm just
like I said I'm learning let me know and
if the videos you find them helpful let
me know that that really goes a long way
so I'll see you guys as always in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
