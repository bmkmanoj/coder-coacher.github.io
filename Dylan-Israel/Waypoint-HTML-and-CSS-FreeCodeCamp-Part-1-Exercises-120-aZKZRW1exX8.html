hello world BAM challenge destroyed
alright
once I guess I just want to see how many
challenges there are for this
69 all right I could definitely take 69
all right so I think what we'll do is we
will Jake oh man there's so much this is
excellent
okay so you started buh-bah html5 800
hours of practice all right am let's get
back to it
so add an h1 tag that says cat photo app
to create a second HTML only be a little
your hold all right so we're gonna
create h2 if you're not familiar with h2
these is also a heading and it's a
smaller heading I believe it goes all
the way up to h6 so let's just say cat
photo app cool and yeah it goes up to h6
let's go ahead and run the test cool we
killed in that challenge as well someone
say we're legend alright so now it's
asking us to create it these are these
are our errors that we're getting so
let's give a little bit of a space here
there's our opening paragraph here's our
closing paragraph and in between here we
want to say hello paragraph so you can
see that it's slightly different than
our our our normal texture so let's go
ahead and run the test there we go we're
killing it man
what else going to I wish a week it
would keep track of where right now you
know so make an H at one element visible
on your page by uncommon teen it all
right so this is kind of showing how we
do comments a kind of weird way actually
compared to most languages let's go
ahead and run the test hello program I'm
not bad
so comment out your h1 element in your P
element by leaving your HTML on common
so comment out or h1 element and your P
element the Liga h2 element
so I believe it they just wants to do
that so now it should say cat photos
that be sure to close each of your
comments with I did but what I think
they're actually asking is to leave this
alone do a session and then do
explanation - - I think that's what they
prefer for us to do yeah so it's just so
what we did worked they just wanted to
add some more stuff instead of cutting
out and putting it somewhere Laurium if
some text
replace the bear side with a few words
of kitty if some text
so it just wants to show that we can
switch out stuff cool
alright so delete your h1 element so we
want to get rid of this h1 element hello
world run the test and you can see it's
gone not too shabby
alright so it looks like we're getting
into a little bit of CSS actually so
change the cup air styling rather so um
so the way we want to change the style
so we want it wants us to change the
style of our h2 to blue so we want this
to be blue the way you do this is called
inline styling so you have style equal
and then we're going to say color we
want to affect the color attribute and
it we want it to be blue Oh red excuse
me
all right nice so it's not not too too
bad so what else do we have here we have
just yes remotes you know what they need
to do this need to make these like
instructions just bullet points or like
one do this make them very very simple
so remove the style tribute from your
age to hey chill it should be blue
this is what they want
delete your h2 style attribute and the
secreto cos I'll element
okay that's what they want to see they
wants to do some style scripting type of
type of thing looking thing alright so
we want to say dot h2 and we want to say
color blue
there we go go so we basically just
styled it in the editor and we're just
saying for all our h2s make them blue
all right so let's see we are what it
wants to do create sound up blue - text
create a class called
alright so now it wants us to create a
class called red text so dot red - text
and what do we want to do and apply it
to your HTM it's a dot red text and then
we'll say we want it to apply to h2 so
class is equal to so here we'll say
color red and we'll say class is equal
to red - text you can see right here it
changed because this is more specific
because it's a class it overrides our
age - all right and let's do one more
and then we'll take a little break on
this still to try and decide how long I
should make these videos like this
actually pretty good site that I like
this a lot so I'll play the red text
class your h2 and P elements
so
so class is equal to read - text here I
was just quite a period at the end but
the class descriptions don't basically
what's saying there so you can see that
we have dot read text and then we just
have read text so you don't have to call
it it's not the same exactly dots more
like letting it know it's a class and
then you're just calling it so create a
second P element okay so let's create
another P and don't forget we have to
get a closing P and we want to put more
of this in here just go ahead and copy
and paste that in there so there it is
inside your style element set a font
size for all P elements alright so P no
dot because it's not a class we'll say P
will say font size to 30 pixels see
already it's much larger now just go
ahead and run that give the elements
with red text classifies 16 alright so
we'll say font size 16 px and remember
this one's the reason this is smaller is
because this one's more specific then
just a general paragraph
I cook us so we will continue on with
our HTML and CSS in the next we are
video back in one of my favorite new
coding resources it's called free free
code camp and it's 800 hours of practice
free and the kind of environments
similar to code Academy so that's why I
like it right now we're we're going to
do HTML and CSS and you can see this is
just for HTML and CSS right here it's
about three hour course they say so
let's just go ahead and get started you
see right here this is where our text
displays in here is how we're styling so
what is it that we want to do make the P
elements use monospace so how do we do
that
we are go to font - family and we set it
to mono space so let's run the test you
can see it already changed it so cool
not bad
so apply the font family of lobster tier
h2 element all right so we have style
here called direct text so let's see if
they are okay with us doing it like this
because I see I'm thinking they may want
us to actually do it specifically for
h2s so let's see
yeah so not what they wanted so in our
style tags we're going to add h2 and
we're going to say font - family lobster
import the law officer photo I didn't
see that so we don't know a lobster is
so we just go ahead and copy this and I
believe it's probably proper to put it
above so this is saying to our Google
API get our get to lobster font it's
actually really nice nice font and this
is just saying what it is it's a text
and a CSS file and it's a stylesheet
it's a cool not that bad Waypoint
specify how phones should be degrade so
what they're talking about here is not
every browser will have the font that
you're looking for and so you set up
backup fonts so for in this case right
here saying when Lobster is not
available we want mono space and then
what else coming out your call to Google
for the lobster for putting alright so
I'm just going to comment out this and
be sure to close your toe all right so I
think that's everything so you can see
right here it change it changes to a
different font
add images to your website all right
this is pretty straightforward so where
do we want is there a specific image
what image should we want let's say all
right you
okay so like Ryu from Street Fighter and
we will put it try it with this image oh
that's boring
ah we should have chose around
okay so we'll put it after here so image
we're saying IMG and then the source for
it of where we're getting it it's right
here and we're putting a slash cuz it's
a self self closing attribute in fact if
that's the correct term
your image elements should have the
class smaller image all right so this is
our SRC and we'll say class is equal to
smaller - image and your MIT should be
100 pixels wide so here we're going to
say dot smaller - image for credit
smaller image class and we're going to
say that we want to set a width till 100
px so now that's going to be smaller
cool looks like everything's feeling
according to plan
all right so what are we doing now we're
adding borders around your element
so borders are very important when
trying to make things look good so let's
see so still off credit class called
thick green border your Magellan shoves
a classic green border all right so
let's create a dot thick - green -
border class give your image border with
this also border - how how many how
thick do we want the border - wood with
me we wanted to be 10 pixels and then
it's also a border so - style and we
want that to be solid so what it instead
like your your border could be dashed
also and a couple other things so that's
what we mean by solid and your border
image element should be green so say
border - color so that - color and we're
going to set that at green just go ahead
and run these tests all right
so thing oh we never change this so you
want to change this to dot thick or
excuse me thick - green - border
so there's our border and I guess maybe
they just want us to have both these so
we'll just replace this with smaller -
image
oh whoops okay I see what they want and
slice important area directions so we
are going to do one class that we're
basically putting two separate classes
on here is what they want us to do so
it's still small it's still got a nice
fat ass border
it's ugly but hey um your meat
should have border radius of 10px so
here's your mission have a border radius
iso border radius is what you use to to
essentially explain it to curve the
corners so the radius which is kind of a
so you see right now how that curves
there it is
apparently at 50% the border radius is a
perfect circle that's cool
I didn't know that and that will make
things in my life a lot easier knowing
border-radius 50% will do a circle like
that very nice
I am make sure use for sentiment I pick
Somalia and just go I like that um let's
keep it going we'll do two more I think
actually we just finished that CSS we're
going to do anchor tags next so I'll see
you guys in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
