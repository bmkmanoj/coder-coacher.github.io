back in managed packages with NPM let's
go ahead and open up our section here we
are now in this tag oh my god was this a
pain this is a pain section I remember
this one so much so that we have to give
our boy here where's our boy our boy
Randy Davis right here I screenshot this
I want to give him credit because this
section took me forever I was doing this
live stream on the site I saved this so
thank you to Randy Davis who commented
on some some posts and helped out with
this section so what is a disc tag a
dist AG is so it basically strings so
every every version the most current
version will have the latest disc tag
meaning that's the one that gets
installed however when we're making new
versions we need to or but when we're
making new versions perhaps we have an
old version that will work better for a
different operating system and you may
want to have a tag for something like
that so that's basically what this tags
are used for you know maybe I'm an
experimental version or beta version of
the new version the latest version of
the latest version tag is will always be
the one that's published so the the
latest published or I should say however
you need to publish a default version of
a package side maybe it's for as I say
legacy version you do that you do that
using list tags so let's go ahead and
follow our boy Randy's example here so
we do NPM LS so you'll see right here we
have this at CT 360 / @ CT 360
going on here and to do what we need to
we are going to
this is weird this is slightly different
I think I installed this yeah so to take
part from the beginning we're gonna do
NPM just - tech we're gonna add this tag
and then the next thing that we do is we
put that at CT 360 /ct 360 yours maybe
like at your user name slash your work
space and then the at the current
version 1.0 point 1 and then the tag
name in this case we'll throw tests
why didn't work test is tagname so at
dis say oh I forgot that so npm dis -
tag and then we want to add at CT 360 /c
t 360 at the version number which is 1.0
0.1 and then the tag which is test so
there we go we added our dist ack you
would not believe how long it took me
and so thank you to to to Randy Davis
who saved our day and now when we were
in - how to - NPM verify we should be
good to go and I believe we open our
packaged up JSON and we'll have a disk
tag or will not it's might be stored
elsewhere it doesn't look like it's in
here but uh we stored elsewhere
somewhere in a version but as always
