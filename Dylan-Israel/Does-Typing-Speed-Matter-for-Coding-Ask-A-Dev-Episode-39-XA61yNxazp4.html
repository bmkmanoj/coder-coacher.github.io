answer a question that I never really
thought of but I've got asked it a
couple times I never decided to a video
till now so as you can see my hand is
bandaged up I had some surgery done on
it and some skin grafts and stuff like
that and I'm gonna have this on for at
least two weeks and it's kind of
relevant to the discussion is do you
need to be good at typing to be a good
coder to be a good developer is that
crucial to your development as a coder
and I would tell you right now I I can't
type with this I'm actually in a lot of
pain because the this will affect me I
have one hand right my right hand I use
my mouse with it but originally I was
asked this question by a subscriber who
has a disability in one of his hands but
I've also had this question asked time
and time again for people who are either
can't type without looking or are like
hunting and pecking now how I'll be
coding is hunting and pecking with
basically one hand transitioning from
mouse to single hand I can't really move
this around too much because there's
skin that's been cut out and whatnot so
I literally can't use my hand up at all
so I will be doing this sort of hunting
and pecking and it give you a
perspective about how little it will
affect my work
it will most of your time spent as a
developer is I'm actually typing code
it's figuring out the code you're going
to type relatively a small amount of
code and it's more of it's logically
going on in here so you don't really
need to be a fast coder now I'm losing
one hand completely and I predict that
this is going to slow me down by about
10 to 20 percent out of absolute max and
that's only just me because I have to
type out the codes and go back and forth
because the bulk of your time is it
spent typing it's actually spent solving
issues
understanding that and research and so
yeah I'm going to I'm going to have a
hard time typing in things when I'm
googling and going to stack overflow and
and all those resources that you go to
as a developer but the actual time that
I'm going to lose from from typing
things out it's going to be relatively
minor and so that's something you're
worried about you're slow typer you're
worried that that you're going to have
an issue because you have to look where
the asdf is and all that sort of stuff
and one thing that'll become easier the
more you type right the other thing is
it's not that big of a deal it really
isn't I'm losing an entire hand and I
you know I I'm probably pretty fast with
just my right hand it's been a long time
since I've ever had to do that but if
that's one of your concerns don't sweat
it
the more you type the faster you'll get
but your typing speed has absolutely
nothing to do with you as a developer it
really is just about you solving
problems and understanding and be able
to read documentation correctly and
understand what the necessary steps are
to get from point zero to 100% so don't
sweat it and you know I mean when we
read the Stack Overflow survey there was
a question on there that said how many
people were disabled and how many people
didn't type with their hands and it was
like point is like 1/10 of 1% but of 64
thousand people that were surveyed and
stackoverflow 1/10 of 1% is 64 people
who are typing with their toes or their
tongue or something else and they're
able to be confident developers so don't
sweat it if you're slowing down I'm
going to be slowed down for at least two
three weeks and I expected not to affect
my work too much so if you're slow typer
don't worry you'll get faster and it's
not going to be something that's none
there's not going to be any how many
words can you type for a minute they're
going to give you algorithms and expect
you to solve it and if you can solve it
the time being spent on typing will be
very little compared
time spent on solving it as will be your
time as a developer so don't sweat it
it's always good if you type fast kind
of cool cool skill look at it not look
away look at a carry conversation on
you'll get all those skills you know but
not affect you as a developer so don't
sweat it kind of a funny question to me
because it never even occurred to me but
I've actually had a quite a few of you
asked this and I'm happy to finally
answer it anyhow guys stay motivated
keep working hard
sorry about the mess my dad's visiting
right now and so a little messy in here
but hey this is real life man we're in
fake any of this this ain't a studio
this is the office with the guest futon
