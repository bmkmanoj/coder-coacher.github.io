manage MongoDB while saving time with
peace of mind cloud manager premium
includes a visual profiler that lets you
see into query latencies the query
profiler can analyze the data to suggest
indexes to improve query performance
cloud manager premium can also
facilitate adding indexes to a cluster
by performing a rolling index build
which ensures the database remains
performance throughout the entire index
build let's check out this functionality
on my cluster I'm going to enable the
profiler on one of my database nodes our
automation agents will handle this for
us now after collecting data for a few
minutes we can see the profile of data
that has been collected this swarm of
blue-coloured queries grouped by query
shape looks to be taking more than 800
milliseconds each we can drill in to see
what this query is it appears to be a
query on field 3 and we can see that an
index is not being used let's see what
index is suggested for us here we'll
click on suggested indexes an index for
field 3 is what suggested on the user
table collection now we can either copy
this command out and add it through the
Mongo shell or instead we can use that
new rolling index build functionality so
let's add this index to our cluster if
we go into our cluster editor scroll
down and click index configuration we
can click add and add an index we'll
then name the database collection name
and the field and click Add we'll click
apply and now we have a draft automation
configuration that includes that index
we'll click review and deploy which will
cause our automation agents to build
that index in a rolling fashion across
our shards in this cluster so that a
replica it needs shard does the index
build in the background while we
preserve availability and performance in
the member of each shard that remains
primary we can see the build index is
occurring and very rapidly we're
reaching goal State on this particular
cluster because we have a very small
amount of data and can perform the index
build quickly well that's a lot of fun
and it means that those people who are
using the application that relied on my
database cluster
now have a far faster and more pleasing
experience and that's what this is all
about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
