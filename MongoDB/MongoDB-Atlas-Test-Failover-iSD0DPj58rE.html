tutorial series my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate at MongoDB and I'm
here to teach you the ins and outs of
using our database as a service MongoDB
Alice today we'll discuss how to test
your application for reliability with
the MongoDB Atlas to test failover
features
MongoDB Atlas provides you with a simple
method of launching your databases in
the cloud prior to your release into
production you may want to test the
resiliency of your application by
triggering a test failover - a new
primary node in your replica set
triggering a failover will cause the
node to step down and begin the election
of a new primary based on your blog
being most up-to-date you can use this
method to ensure your app stays online
as expected during unexpected failover
incidents it's important remember that
this is only available to our paid
instances so you'll not be able to do
this with our m0 sandbox cluster MongoDB
attempts to avoid rollbacks which should
be rare when a rollback does occur it is
often the result of a network partition
secondaries that cannot keep up with the
throughput of operations on their former
primary increase the size and impact of
a rollback to get started we're gonna go
ahead to the cluster we want to work
with and then click its ellipsis menu
we'll find the test failover option and
click that and we'll be brought to this
new window you'll see that Atlas will
manually restart the primary elect a new
primary then returned the restarted
recovering instance as a secondary if
you are using the full connection string
in your app the driver will act as a
smart client and recognize where to
direct new reads and writes so there's
no need for you to make modifications to
connect to your database within your
application let's click restart primary
and we're given an information box
showing that we're in the process of an
election you can close this window and
you'll be able to monitor the process as
it occurs so you can see we're doing 0
of our three instances once it's
completed you'll go ahead and see that
our cluster will go back into normal
service and you'll be able to use it as
expected with your application
if you're running into any issues
related to using MongoDB Atlas features
contact our support team at any time
click the support link in the lower left
of your Atlas interface or go to MongoDB
