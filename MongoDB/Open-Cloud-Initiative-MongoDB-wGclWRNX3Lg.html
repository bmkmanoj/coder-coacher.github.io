the board of the OPA the open cloud
initiative I'm going to take just a
couple minutes to talk about why we
built it and what it's supposed to do so
the initiative is a non-profit
foundation our purpose is to advocate
open standards to cloud consumers and
providers cloud computing is at a
tipping point in 2011 and we think that
some of the practices that providers are
offering are unsafe at any speed data
that you can't get out based on terms of
service data that you can't get out
based on rate limits data that you can't
access based on bad formats or based on
sheer latency is bad for you as a
developer it's bad for consumers we
think it's important to get this message
out and to help create a legal framework
to curate the community discussion about
what the open cloud principles are
collectively these principles have been
worked on publicly for about two years
and we're announcing that we're in the
final 30-day public comment period we
aim to serve you to take your concerns
and what you think open cloud ought to
mean and enforce it we want to apply
those requirements to cloud computing
products and services such that this
becomes a competitive differentiator for
new entrants in the market who want to
abide by these principles the principles
are as follows currently number one
interoperability you should have the
right of interoperability for your data
and your services second avoiding
barriers to entry and exits we want to
avoid enabling business models that are
simply based on being a roach motel your
personal data your business data can
enter but it can never leave if you
prefer Hotel California to roach motel
that's just fine we can go that way to
third technological and really business
model neutrality open cloud we don't
think is about open source or not open
source it's about open protocols open
formats and the ability to have the
right terms of service so that you can
get at your data and services the way
that you want to so we'll find vendors
will find nonprofits will find
completely open source projects there
will or won't support these principles
it's technologically neutral from our
standpoint
fourth forbidding discrimination
gentleman named I believe his name is
Thomas monopoly real name was shut down
about two weeks ago by Google as he was
in the process of moving all of his data
into Google Mail and Google Apps that
represents a form of discrimination that
we find intolerable that's just one
example but we think that this is
important across all cloud services and
then finally open standards for formats
and interfaces you'll see something
common in here between the Open Source
Initiative and what we're trying to do
as a hat-tip with the open cloud
initiative what if you took the four
freedoms and reflected those into
software you'd get the OSI and the OSD
and software licenses what if you took
the four freedoms and tried to reflect
them onto cloud services that's what we
believe needs to be done that's what
we've heard needs to be done and that's
what we want to enable so with that I'll
stop you guys are all here because you
can read so I'll just put the status up
here and feel any questions the chicken
that you can answer we've got forty
percent of the board here Sam Johnston
who some of you may know from google now
at equinix is in switzerland couldn't
make it here John Mark Walker is
standing up here as is Rick Clark
Shanley Kane is at odds Khan you could
talk to her tomorrow she's not here
right now Evan mark you may know from
rising tide norian pluck it from apache
software and others me swirly and thomas
cool who's in germany so ask away
hopefully we can take a minute for
questions if you guys have any
clarification of you
absolutely so I'm going to talk about
all the talking so I'm going to pitch it
to one of my co-conspirators which
agrees hey 10 as an example drive I
understand what they are the motivations
so ever since poke back well I'm not
listening in an inner conceptually ever
since telecommuting as as popular has
been easy pretty walled gardens services
that is difficult person to you for
example need to move your data access
your day any time there are barriers
that are erected to prevent you from
doing that and there's two prevents
service level service level my courage
so that's a thing for trying to use for
bed
I mean you've got the larger after
babies sure so with those example
there's two other so there's peering
issues today without having any bad
actors in the pictures if you could put
a terabyte of data into a system over
time which are limited to removing at a
gigabyte a day it's going to take you a
thousand days to get your data out some
of the sum of its architectural you
determine you something there MapReduce
I mean what those issues are more about
latency and cloud interconnects when you
get down to those types of issues but
you have other issues that you see with
with popular services like Twitter you
can access the last 3,200 tweets until
they change their terms of service in
which case you will have access to less
but swear has access to all of them
forever and can sell it however they won
those are some of the examples of when
there were no seatbelts for cars nobody
really thought about because cars were
so awesome they could get you from point
A to point B faster than a horse but in
the early 60s people realize after 50
years experience with cars some things
were just unsafe at any speed so those
are the points that we're trying to make
we're not trying to hang anyway we're
just trying to make sure that the
industry can grow more efficiently that
all the players can be rewarded for
acting well we're trying to create a
fair playing field looks like the user
she was doing other bits on where it's a
very so so so one question over that
last analogy implied that
might be looking to influence regulation
yes if we're successful then touch it
then that would make sense are you focus
on cloud providers or service providers
you focused on here went from from
rackspace what is your focus on what are
you having gating what looks baby
advocated above I just access to data I
mean there are 11 got a bag what's that
what about back what about it for me for
they allow all the other positive edge
now it's exactly the issue there's a
point right no but you're talking about
you're talking about protocol in privacy
versus versus thanks Andrea morning okay
you're not you Jake Zuzu you know what
running out of time you guys like this
off this definitely reminds me
for a breakout session when I talk about
this so if you like to engage we welcome
your engagement so thank you for your
time won't be here for a bit so I thanks
a mess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
