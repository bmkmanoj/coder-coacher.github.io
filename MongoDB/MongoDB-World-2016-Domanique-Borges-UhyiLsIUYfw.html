just having that community having so
many people here with different
backgrounds and who have different
experiences and who have actually had
different paths that have led them here
so for me that was really excited to
hear because I felt really nervous
knowing that I don't come from a tech
background but then having people that
have come from different backgrounds
like I met a woman who was an education
for 10 years who had then moved into
Tekken just getting that support from
people who are giving me the ideas and
kind of somewhat uh helping me kind of
decide what my framework is and how I
will move forward in tech so that for me
has been really exciting and it's been
really great what I really loved was the
exhibition hall where I was able to
actually like talk to different
companies and see what they have what
products that they're using that they're
integrating with MongoDB how they've
been able to come up with solutions for
some of the different problems that I've
actually heard about through some of the
keynote speech speeches and everything
like that so by meeting with a lot of
these companies I've gotten to hear
different ways that they're being
innovative in different ways that
they're actually using their products
and
merging that with mongodb technology and
being able to solve their issues at
their companies which has been really
cool I would definitely recommend this
conference to someone who's interested
to someone who doesn't even think
they're interested I would recommend
this then because what I found hairs
there's just so much that you don't
think about there's so many questions
that you have that you don't even know
you have until others start talking to
you other people start picking your
brain so for me I wasn't sure if this
was the right thing to do but I think
it's actually been one of the best
things I've done for myself and kind of
setting up myself for my career so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
