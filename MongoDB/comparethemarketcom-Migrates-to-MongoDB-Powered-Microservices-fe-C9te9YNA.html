a dull and boring experience of
comparing insurance as founded as simple
and frictionless as possible my name is
Matthew Collins I'm director of
technology and architecture compare the
market we're a price comparison website
with relatively famous in the British
Isles for our meerkats and associated
marketing campaign the way we're
organized within competitor markets that
we have product verticals of motor
insurance bark insurance pet insurance
life insurance all runners stovepipe
product based teams the challenge we
face is that originally all of that was
one team and one system as we've
experienced rapid growth over the years
both in terms of customer numbers and
staff we've had to organize ourselves
differently we needed to break apart the
monolithic application architecture
underneath into micro services which
have a single responsibility single
reason for existing the relational
database that we had underlying our
application which was a point of
contention when things were changed
you'd break other teams applications and
that was a bad thing that that was
changed towards the doctors oriented
approach backing all of our micro
services require some sort of persistent
States so we chose MongoDB to replace
our relational database we use MongoDB
Enterprise Edition and we use that for
the point in time backup and restore
functionality and the automation
capabilities that exist in the ops
manager suite of tools getting features
out into the hands of our customers is a
key concern of our business because we
want to be able to capitalize on any
changing consumer trends or technology
adoption trends that we spot in the
marketplace our use of the Micra
services approach docker caf
mongodb have enabled us to realize that
objective of actually getting change
into the hands of customers in a much
shorter time frame than was previously
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
