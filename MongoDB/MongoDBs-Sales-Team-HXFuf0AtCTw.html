Whether it's the leadership team coming to
meetings with you, the solutions architects,
the support team, we all work together to
make our clients happy.
So, at MongoDB, we're looking for sales athletes,
and what that means is we're looking for somebody
that has committed themselves to the sales
profession, they've shown success in their
career, and they're looking for that next
great challenge.
It doesn't matter which department you reside
in, the collaboration, and the teamwork and
the camaraderie is palpable.
A big part of what we believe at MongoDB is
we are all in this to get better together,
and so it's my job to develop my sales leaders
so that they can be better for their sales team
What's so intriguing about MongoDB is a few
things.
The first is the market.
The total addressable market is somewhere
in the ballpark of 36 to 40 billion dollars,
the biggest in software, so the market is
huge and ripe for disruption.
Many companies are actually standardizing
on MongoDB now, which means larger and larger
deals coming down the pipeline every single
quarter.
It is a great time to be a salesperson at
MongoDB.
Successful sales reps at MongoDB have one
thing in common - we work really hard.
If you bring that work ethic and you apply
yourself to what we're doing and the value
that it brings to our customers, there's no
doubt you're going to be successful.
So, my customers include anybody in the media
space, the retail space, the finance space,
however many of my colleagues are also working
within software, healthcare, everything under the sun.
Everybody needs a database and MongoDB has
become that all-purpose, general database at this point.
So, the really cool thing about MongoDB is that it's really not hard to understand the value proposition.
MongoDB really facilitates really great business
outcomes for our customers.
It's a great product and customers actually
enjoy using it.
It's really nice to have customers that want
to buy more.
I'm proud of the company that I work for,
and for the values that we have and that we actually live.
If you'd have told me ten years ago that I'd
be a software salesperson at a database company,
I would have laughed at you, but Iove every
single minute of it.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
