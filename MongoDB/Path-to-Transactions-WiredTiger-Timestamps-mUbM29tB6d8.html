is working toward transactions and we
put this little video series together to
walk through some of the technical
implementation of projects leading up to
transactions I'm Ali Cabral I'm a
product manager on the core server I
focus mostly on distributed systems so
replication and charting and I'm Michael
with me who's the director of
engineering first storage and and he's
gonna introduce himself and walk through
what we're gonna talk about today thanks
Ali
so my name is Michael Kyle I've been
working with databases for over 20 years
and I have a background in transactions
and transaction processing I did a PhD
on efficient processing of transactions
while making sure that applications get
correct results and I started a company
co-founded a company in 2011 with Keith
Bostick in Boston called white tiger in
2014
white tigers started working closely
with MongoDB and realized that we'd
solved some of the problems in the
storage engine that MongoDB had in its
database that led at the end of 2014 to
mommy to be acquiring Y tracker and the
white tigers team coming across and
joining one where DB I'm pretty soon
after that we started having a
conversation around transactions because
why Tiger is a transactional storage
engine and so very quickly the question
came up is like how hard could it be to
make the whole of mommy to be
transactional if the storage engines are
already providing transactions
internally how hard did that turn out to
be well so that's really what this talk
is about it turns out that there are
still some pretty hard problems to solve
and really that's what we've spent three
years working on and so what I'm gonna
talk about today is is some of the ways
that we've tied together moment eby's
requirements for transactions with
functionality in the storage engine and
really the this all comes together
around the idea of time stamps in wire
tiger so I'm gonna explain what they are
and some of the things we can do with
them okay so the issue is that we do B
is a distributed system and the
replication layer in MongoDB writes
individual operations as they happen
into something called the OP log which
is a special collection inside being
short for operation log the operation
line
and the order of operations that appears
in the op log is really important for
the correctness of the system as a whole
if each node in a replica set doesn't
end up with the same operations in the
OP log in the same order then they'll
end up with different versions of data
and that's a huland to the data just
being corrupted or lost so the OP log in
in MongoDB implies a certain ordering of
operations but traditionally in storage
engines the storage engine itself has
its own idea of ordering so this is
called concurrency control and wire
Tiger provides a version of concurrency
control called multi-version concurrency
control whereas the operations are all
happening in parallel the storage engine
gets to decide what order they're
recorded in in the journal underneath in
the storage engines idea of the ordering
and the journal is important in terms of
what values can be seen so what Burt
what values are read by by queries but
also what values survive if there's a
crash so if the order in the applaud as
you can see here one hundred hundred one
hundred and two is different from the
order that the storage engine records
here you can see one hundred and two
comes before one hundred and one
this can lead unless we do something
else this can lead to replication not
getting correct results right so what
we've done in white tiger is really
really tected from the ground up to
allow this ordering that is determined
here by Moni DB to be reflected all the
way down inside the storage engine and
before making these changes in wired
Tiger we had to deal with this at the
replication that's right so we had some
fairly complicated code up in MongoDB
that was tracking what operations were
in flight and controlling how threats
could read the OP log so part of what
we've done with timestamps is allowed
all of that processing to be pushed down
inside the storage layer where it can be
handled more efficiently
and so to give you an idea of what it
means to react attacked wire tiger from
the ground up I want to talk just a
little bit about some of the data
structures we use to represent data
inside wire tiger so when you store
documents in a collection in MongoDB
there can also be indexes associated
with that collection and all of that
data the documents and the index entries
are stored inside a tree in in cache so
this is why it is kind of primary data
structure is this kind of tree an inside
a tree are keys that allow you to
navigate around and then you find leaf
pages here that have keys and values
together and these values might be the
Beeson for a document or they might be
the the index entries that are used to
store indexes and anytime one of those
things is updated so if you change a
document or you insert a new document we
create one of these things that wire
tagger calls an update structure and an
update has incited some information
about the transaction a link to the next
update in order and the the data that
was changed as part of that update and
when reads come in and and they need to
figure out what should value should be
returned wire tiger has its own internal
logic about following these these lists
of updates to return the correct one and
this is the the basic mechanism of
multi-version concurrency control that's
been in white tiger for a long time but
the change we've made is right here
so we've changed this really fundamental
data structure to add a timestamp or
what we are calling a timestamp and this
is a value that the application in this
case MongoDB can pass in and and tell
the storage engine what order of things
should should happen in so now MongoDB
can send this down to the storage layer
and the storage layer will respect that
time as something valuable that it
should like respect exactly right so so
Mangal you can can do two things it says
the order as the updates happen and then
what it can do is ask to read
as as of one of these time stamps so
then if you query as all the time stamp
wire tiger we'll make sure that you see
exactly the values as they were at that
time and this is true even if there are
lots of operations going on in parallel
and some of these updates arrive in a
different order or they're installed in
a different order by wire tiger then the
time stamp order the time stamp is still
used to guarantee correct results so
we've really changed right down at this
fundamental level we've made changes
inside the storage engine in support of
transactions and so now I want to move
on a little bit to talk about some of
the things we can do now that we've got
this time stamp mechanism in place so I
mentioned that when will you be created
up log as operations are applied on a
primary and then the applaud is what's
used by replication to get that data
onto multiple nodes so each replica set
node reads the OP log from the primary
and build up its own local copy of the
up log and then it has to apply those op
log entries on the secondary in order to
bring the collections and indexes up to
date and the way this is done is by
breaking the OP log into batches so we
take some set of records that are
together in the OP log and we split
those records up amongst multiple
threads here and apply them in parallel
the reason we do any multiple threads is
that if we do it in just one thread it
can't keep up with all of that work
that's going on on the primary so we
have these multiple threads here and we
have a clever technique for sharing this
work out amongst these threads so that
most of the time if we have related
updates they go to the same thread and
they end up being applied in the same
order on the secondary however across
these updates they can apply out of
order so you can see here that what
although the uploads in the expected
order 100 hundred and 102 that the order
that the threads do the work is 101 100
and 102 so there's a different order
again to maybe what was in the journal
and each of these entries in the op log
represents a modification in the
database exert an update to your data
exactly right yeah so so they they can
be a field update or a new document
being inserted or various other kinds of
updates and and applying them can both
change the documents on the secondary
but also change the indexes right and so
the there are several things that we can
now do that now that we're labeling all
these changes with timestamps
one of those is that we can resolve this
difference in ordering for queries so
when a query comes in even though these
these have been applied out of order
what wire targets time stamps allow you
to do is come in after the fact and do a
query as of timestamp 101 say and wire
Tyga will show you the right things
they'll show you the changes update in
location 100 and 101 but it won't show
you this one here in 102 so you never
see 100 and 102 without 101 right so
you're always making sure you're seeing
a consistent state of the data exactly
and that then solds some problems that
have that have kind of been
long-standing issues in terms of the way
white the moment eby's replication works
so let me talk a little bit about one of
those so I said we split the up log up
into batches and each batch is applied
by multiple threads and the batch
boundaries have typically been
identified with with locks so as we are
applying this batch here mommy to be
internally is holding a global lock for
that that period and what that means is
while we're applying these things reads
execute on on a secondary because it
wasn't safe because you could get an
inconsistent view of the data because
the order of the batch application is
not guaranteed in any way exactly right
and so what we've we've guaranteed that
reads are correct on secondaries using
locks until now but what that means is
that at these batch boundaries first of
all the reads
to wait for the batch to complete but
also if the reads themselves take a long
time then replication itself slows down
because it has to wait for these reads
to finish on the batch boundary before
the next batch can start which could
lead to replication lag absolutely yeah
and so one of the things we're we're
addressing inside the storage layer and
with replication is allowing reads
inside this previous batch so here in
batch one once it's completed and we've
moved on and we're applying but things
then batch 2 here all of the changes
inside batch 1 have been applied and
they have time stamps so it's now safe
to read inside there up to this time
stamp of the the batch boundary and and
correct results will be returned and
that means where we're moving towards a
world where we can read on secondaries
without any locking at all right but you
wouldn't see any changes in the batch
until all of the batches can see that's
right so we apply all of batch one and
wait for all the threads that are doing
that work to complete all of their work
before they move on to batch two and
then the reads can can start reading in
this range here for between the time
stamps at the beginning and the end of
batch one now one of the specific
problems that we've we've had to resolve
in in this code path relates to indexes
so even though I said we split up the
work among threads and we have a clever
way of sharing that work out it can
still happen that two different threads
are working on documents that have the
same unique index key if you if you
declare a unique secondary index and so
one of the things we've we've had to
figure out is how to make it safe to
read during that batch if there were
collisions on a unique secondary index
key and that's involved a change to the
format of indexes to support those reads
so there's been various projects in here
to make all of this work correctly and
provide you know correct results
I'm personally really excited that we're
going to be able to service reads during
a PI ops on secondary yeah likewise I
think I think it's it's gonna improve
things for our customers but it's also
going to improve some things internally
for some of the operations of only to be
itself does perfect so the next thing I
want to talk a little bit about another
application of of time stamps is related
to replication again but in this case
it's what I want to talk about is
replication rollback so to understand
this we need to understand a replication
concept which is the majority commit
point so that's what I'm going to try
and explain right now so as I said the
up but the up log is built up on the
primary as operations complete there and
secondaries read the OP log and make
their own copy and then they apply those
operations but the secondaries are all
at different points so you can see the
secondary one here has applied up to
this point of the op log secondary two
has gone all the way to the end so it's
up-to-date with the primary there's no
lag and secondary three is is right back
here so it's it's further back and than
the other two and what we care about for
the purposes of changes becoming durable
across a replica set is what's called
the majority commit point so this is a
point where we we know that a majority
of nodes in the replica set have all got
that op log entry and that's important
because you know that point will never
be rolled back and it's safe and secure
in a case of an election or a node
failure exactly right so once once we've
reached that point and and I'll show you
where it is here so here you can see the
secondary one has this one secondary two
also has that same upload entry and even
though secondary 3 doesn't have it still
a majority of nodes are up to this point
so this is our majority commit point in
this in this scenario and and yeah
exactly as you said that's the point
where we know no matter what happens in
terms of how you've configured your
systems to hand
different kinds of failures any of those
failures can happen and no data older
than this point will will be lost
whereas some of these other updates that
might have been in flight on the primary
but haven't yet been copied over to a
secondary if you pull the power on the
server that's running your primary then
you could you could potentially lose
these updates yep
so the reason this matters is because we
we can lose that history so if a primary
does go down so this is here used this
node on the left here used to be the
primary if it goes down and then comes
back up again
in the meantime typically what's
happened is some other node in the
system has become the primary of that
replica set and when the old one the old
primary comes back up to rejoin the
replica set it figures out that it has
some history here that's no longer part
of the new replica set so it's no longer
a valid history exactly right so these
are these are those kinds of rights that
were accepted locally on the primary but
they were never replicated so they
weren't part of that majority commit
point and the process that happens now
is that this primary has to get in sync
the old one has to get in sync with the
new replica set with the new history so
if this one crashed and came back up
online and now needs to resync to the
replicas that in order to be a
productive node that's right and so in
order to do that what we have to do
essentially is to undo this part of the
old history and then we can catch up we
can get the new history and roll forward
and catch up that way but it's not just
as simple as chopping off the OP blog
and getting the newer blog and rolling
forward because we've also made changes
in here associated with these these
operations and the way that replication
has handled that up until recently is to
have to refresh the documents that were
modified by this part of the history so
it goes off in requests from some node
in the replica set copies of those
documents and then it can be sure that
any of those changes have been
not included in those documents and it
can roll forward the op log and catch up
that way but that process of refitting
documents and also just the code
involved in in maintaining that path is
quite complicated code and what we
realized is that what now that the
storage layer knows about transactions
and knows about timestamps we can just
have it go back to this point so what
we're what we're doing right now is
transferring responsibility for part of
that rollback process into the storage
layer and what replication can say is it
tells the storage layer as it's running
what that stable point is what that
majority committed timestamp is and why
our tiger will make sure that change is
more recent than that stable point are
not written to disk so in fact what
we've done is changed regular
collections and indexes down here to not
use journaling at all in this scenario
so instead what they do is as
checkpoints are running in white tiger
it makes a copy on disk a point-in-time
copy on disk of the collections and
indexes at some timestamp and so there's
a consistent point in time version of
that data on disk that replication can
use to roll forward from so this has a
number of benefits it makes that that
process of replication rollback more
efficient it it eliminates some
complicated code that we've had to
maintain up them up until now and as a
bonus which really wasn't our goal but
as a bonus associated with this we're
actually only writing 50% as much data
to the journal so for applications that
are high-throughput doing lots of
inserts or updates this should have a
significant performance benefit in terms
of how much journal data we're writing
that's great yeah so um I guess to
summarize some of what I've talked about
we've made these changes in wire tiger
to support time stamps which means that
the notion of ordering can be supplied
to the storage layer from MongoDB from
outside and based on time stamps we've
been able to simplify and improve the
way that a whole lot of other parts of
the system work from parts of index
maintenance replication the way we do
rollback here so there have been a whole
lot of of knock-on benefits from adding
this kind of making these changes right
down at the lower level inside white
tiger amazing what's next well so once
once we deliver the the transaction
project and we have transactions working
we know there are some other areas where
we can make further improvements so one
area where we have plans is to improve
indexing and at the moment you need to
choose when you use MongoDB whether to
do your indexing in the foreground or
the background and there are advantages
and disadvantages to going either way we
have this idea that would allow us to
kind of combine the best of both worlds
there and and allow you to build indexes
online but with the some of the
advantages you get from foreground index
builds today so that's that's definitely
on our roadmap another area that we're
planning to work on is to allow
long-running reads as all the point in
time so initially the design point for
transactions is for relatively short
running transactions but we know that
some customers want to be able to start
a query at a point in time and query a
really large volume of data that's going
to involve more kind of low-level work
inside the storage engine to make that
work and make it efficient but that's
you know hype sort of priority task for
us once we get transactions over the
line yes sounds like a lot of work but
seems like you're cut out for it I'm
glad we have you um well thank you so
much Michael for walking us through this
I think this is really incredible and
I'm excited for transaction thank you
