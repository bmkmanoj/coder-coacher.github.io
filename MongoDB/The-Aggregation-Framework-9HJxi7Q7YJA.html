being here so indeed I'm the director of
solution architecture tangent which
essentially means that I'm the one who
goes to you prospects and customers to
explain to you how to leverage the
technology and in that in that respect I
am very glad to be able to tell you
about the aggregation framework because
I think it is a major major improvement
and an incredible feature that we're
adding to this version what is it
answering they very common a very common
question that we were asked by customers
was do I really need to write MapReduce
code to do an average group by I come
from the data analysis world and this
average group by an SQL was sort of my
bread and butter
those come from the programming world
and they were also able to do incredible
things very fast with this and MapReduce
was not necessarily the most intuitive
framework or mindset to be able to
compute just meta views of the data and
this question was really asking a very
important question we accumulate data we
encourage you to accumulate massive
amounts big data in MongoDB and that's
fine as far as the application is
concerned but then when you want to sort
of understand this data and you want to
do some analysis and you want to
understand what is there you want to
keep track of it are things going fine
are you know you want to have a
dashboard you want to build reports on
this you want to have tools that allow
you to do this quickly and in particular
you want to have tools that allow you to
have a conversation with the data
because invariably when you ask you a
question to the data as soon as you get
the reply only more questions come up so
you have to be able to react very
quickly and change that that code easily
until the aggregation framework you had
two options for this right you had the
MapReduce framework which is essentially
something working on the JavaScript
JavaScript engine on top of MapReduce
and this will
- you know you could write much simpler
MapReduce code in JavaScript functions
to basically ask these questions and if
you had really massive works that could
do social network analysis sentiment
analysis these kinds of you know deep
analysis then we had basically the we
still have the Hadoop connector to offer
where you know you could send the data
to Hadoop cluster and you had you know
you could point the input source to tufa
doop and the output to Mongo sorry and
the output source back to long ago now
to explain to you the point of the
aggregation framework and why we think
is this you know a very important tool
to the toolkit of analysis and analytics
that that Mongo provides let me give you
an example let's say that we have you
know this is going to be simple
documents for this example but we have
some sort of blogging application right
where you have documents that have you
know in each document you have an author
you have a post and you have tags to
describe the post and you have something
perhaps to describe you know the number
of views of this post and whether this
user is active so you have example
documents on the left here and I want to
do something very simple which is I want
to see how many views and how many posts
they are per author right if I was to
write this in SQL it would be what's on
the top of the second column here it
would be a simple select count sum from
with a group by author with the
aggregation framework is going to look
very similar it's going to be the call
to the aggregate function which says
okay group by author and I want you to
sum every document you find someone and
I want you to sum the views and
aggregate this into view count so this
is to show you that essentially if you
come from an SQL like background the
aggregation framework is something you
should be able to learn in 10 to 15
minutes because there's a very similar
mindset additionally you can do things
that are more complicated and we believe
that really extend what the what SQL
like capacity allows you to do because
this is also taking the
taking the idea of the pipeline from
UNIX if you come from the programming
background where essentially we have
seven operators and I'm going to explain
briefly and each operator takes data in
operates on the data and basically takes
data out and hands it over to the next
operator so you can introduce the
sequence of operation that you choose to
operate on the data in this pipeline
fashion so suppose you want to do
something that is a bit more complex
which is pivoting the data right right
now the documents are from this author
perspective each document is you have an
author and a post and you have multiple
tags for each post now what you what I
want to see is something which is on a
tag basis I want to understand for each
tag how many posts there are I want to
see the array of authors that have
contributed to this tag and I want to
see how many views overall there has
been all over post containing this tag
so it's like reversing the structure of
the documents right this is going to be
a non non trivial operation so let me
tell you the operators that we have
available to us to do this the first is
match match is essentially something
that selects the data set right you have
this massive amount of data set you
probably not all of it is relevant so it
allows you to put a query operator to
select what is relevant project is to
select what you're going to see
sometimes in a document it's in the
document can be massive and what you
want to see is perhaps only two or three
fields project is going to select what
you're going to see out of the result
unwind is how we deal with arrays right
unwind is you want to say if I want to
write if I'm going to aggregate over
tags at some point I'm going to have to
basically turn this array structure
containing the tags into something that
is normalized so if I unwind the tags
array is going to create instead of
having one document with three entries
I'm going to have three documents with
one entry each time and this will allow
me to have a predictable structure to
aggregate over group by is the key
operator to aggregate things this is
what will say you know basic you
Suns and counts and averages and minimum
and maximum over this unit of analysis
whether its authors whether it's tags
whether it's area or region could be
product if you're in another if you're
in retail it could be client whatever it
is and then you have things like sort
and limit to basically allow you to say
I want to see you know the most
important one and I want to see the top
ten so the result I want to see is
something like what is on the right
where I have the IDS each tag and the
author's is going to be the array of
authors that have contributed to this
tag and then basically counting
operators and the way to do that is the
code that you see in the middle here so
I'm essentially the first operator is
matching which is selecting only the
post where the user is active so that's
my first my first where clause basically
projecting is selecting the part of the
document that is only relevant to us in
this case author tags and views and then
I'm unwinding the tags array so I have
you know I had an author and several
tags and now I'm going to have basically
each document that is going to analyze
over will have one author one tag so in
the case of this first document that had
you know me as an author with three tags
now I'm going to have three documents
with me as an author and one tag each
and I'm explaining how I want to
aggregate and this is something that is
very powerful relative to say a
relational relational setting where I
can add to set the author right what
would be easy in a relational setting
would be to aggregate that count the
authors do something like this but here
add to set means that the result is
going to be this array so I can
introduce a complex document structure
there and add two set means that it's
not going to repeat the same offer twice
obviously and that's the powerful thing
you can imagine that in this sort of
application you can have you know a tens
of thousands of posts and maybe only
twenty authors
tribute to this and I don't want an
array of 10,000 I just want the array of
the distinct authors and then someone is
to basically count the posts and then
Sun the views is to basically sum all
the views that were on this thing match
this is what I'm using the second match
I'm leveraging the fact that this is a
sequence framework right so I know that
the match here is working on the result
of the group by so match here is
basically saying on this result I'm only
interested in the tags that have had a
significant number of views so forget
about those that had fewer than 10 views
this is where I can cut some of the data
set off and then I'm sorting because I
want to see the maximum one first and
then just for the exercise I'm saying
limit - so basically show me the top two
and then the result is what you see on
the right this should give you an
example an overview of how to use these
operators to do simple things like I
showed you with you know summing the
views over over the tags and more
complex perhaps less predictable things
like pivoting a document structure the
last thing I'd like to say about the
aggregation framework before I hand it
back to Dwight is a very important thing
about data analysis is to feel safe as
an analyst but part of my career I was a
data analyst and which means you you
know I would work on massive amounts of
data to do you know to understand
basically what kinds of products what
kinds of attitudes were relevant to two
particular customers and when I worked
on this data I would invariably you know
have my conversation that would have
would do these massive queries get
replies and then I would realize it's
not exactly what I wanted that we try to
send it again and then there would be
all kinds of mistakes all the time every
hour would make a mistake and what
usually that mistake meant is that the
query was hundred times more massive and
demanding than it should have been and
it that means if this query was going to
interfere with the operational workload
right if this
query was going to have an impact on
people who were doing quote unquote real
work I was going to be in real trouble
so it was critical for my work to feel
that whatever I was doing was protected
was separate from whatever else was
happening on the data I had to feel safe
in the right to experiment and make
errors with the aggregation framework
you can actually separate this work you
can basically have the primary in a
replica set handling the operational
load and you can have the analyst
working with the analytical load working
on a secondary on a completely separate
node and these two workloads are going
to work on different nodes and are not
going to interfere with each other and
when there is a spike on the primary
that's fine it's not going to change the
analytical query and when there is you
know an analyst like me making a big
mistake it's going to happen on the
secondary and it's not going to have no
impact on what's happening with the
application load on the primary so it
allows you I want to stress that this is
a really useful and production-ready
tool that can be used on operate on real
production deployments because it leaves
your data and your application safe
thank you for listening to this I hope
you're going to download version 2.2 as
soon as this is done and that you're
going to try the aggregation framework
because at least I find it very exciting
but of course you know I'm a little
biased and meanwhile I'm going to hand
it over back to Dwight who's going to
explain to us the massive improvements
of concurrency in this new version
Dwight please come back on the air thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
