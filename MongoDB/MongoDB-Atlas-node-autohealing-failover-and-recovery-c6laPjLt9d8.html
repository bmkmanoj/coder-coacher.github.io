tutorial series my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate at MongoDB and I'm
here to teach you the ins and outs of
using our database as a service
MongoDB Atlas today we'll discuss
replication redundancy and recovery of
your cluster with MongoDB Atlas
all MongoDB Atlas instances paid or free
have the default of three nodes as a
minimum within your cluster there is no
ability to launch a cluster with less
than three nodes in it to view the
status of each node on your cluster
click on the name of the cluster you'll
see the three green dots to the left of
each node if one of the nodes fails
you'll see a caution symbol with an
exclamation point on it within seconds
of a failed ping from our monitoring
agent to our management system Atlas
will send you a notification based on
alert settings if your MongoDB database
node does not recover Atlas will remove
the failed load from the set replace it
with the new node and sync data from
your primary will then enter your new
node into service and then notify you
and completed you'll retain existing
connection string details as we will
preserve DNS settings for each node as
you can see here in the alerts section
any changes made to the MongoDB Atlas
cluster will be stored within here so
you can always go back and check the
history once your recovery happens you
won't need to worry yourself about
modifying your connection string or
making any changes to the server they'll
just continue to work as normal
if you're running into any issues
related to using MongoDB Atlas features
contact our support team at any time you
can click the support link in the lower
left of your Atlas interface or you can
just go to MongoDB comm slash contact
and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
