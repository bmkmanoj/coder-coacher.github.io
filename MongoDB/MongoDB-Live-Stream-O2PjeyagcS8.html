MongoDB world my name is J Gordon we met
just previously and I want to introduce
you to someone else this is Juanita
Juanita is from insta no comm insta no
comm does some automation and artificial
intelligence once you give us a quick
intro yes
thank you so much for inviting me no
problem I'm having a great time here at
this conference and I really look
forward to representing it's no calm
because we're the leader in artificial
intelligence we hold several patents and
our technology is used as a business
solution throughout industries across a
broad spectrum quote so we chat a little
bit and one of the things we wanted to
really highlight while we're here at
MongoDB world is the fact that MongoDB
really wants to include a culture of
inclusivity and ensuring that
underrepresented groups typically which
were not outraged by the technology
industry are being given opportunity and
also being given a voice to kind of say
what they feel and so how do you feel
that this experience is really as you
both a woman of color in technology and
a person that's trying to network how do
you feel that you've really had the your
experience here it's been really great
first of all I like the curiosity people
do approach me they're curious well what
are you doing and so when I talk about
artificial intelligence or how I got
into the industry I've been interested
in technology all of my career and I
started as the first female health
physics surveyor
oh that's wonderful yes many years ago
at Monsanto Research Corporation and
throughout the years I've always had an
interest in science and technology so as
a corporate trainer I reach out to young
women students to let them know look if
you start with science math and don't be
afraid to take a step towards the
unknown or like what's around the next
corner as our keynote speaker spoke
today that's the curiosity base and then
so young children out gaining sure
that's I think an avenue for inclusivity
as well so people can jump aboard and
then branch out to other areas there's
definitely been a trend
or it's a gamification of inclusive
inclusivity getting people to come
together and maybe make it like I said
dick a game
yes saying that it's not always just
about the typical prototype of people
that we look at in this business that
there's more for everyone and that's why
one of the things I'm really proud of
with MongoDB is we have our diversity
scholar program we give opportunity to
people to come to MongoDB world and
don't have to pay for it and and we feel
like it's really powerful to say to
people we want you here then very
important and I really believe that you
know I talked to someone yesterday and
she said to me you know I remember the
first time I saw another black woman at
a technology conference it was very
powerful to me that I saw someone that I
recognized enough to say wow we're both
kind of doing the same thing so Juanita
I'm so glad you came out here from Los
Angeles if you haven't yet I really
think you should go to insta know calm
WWWE insta no calm so Oh everybody that
comes does interview today they're gonna
get some fun stuff all right let's ditch
t-shirt okay stitch is our latest
product and I've also got one of these
silly hand spinners everybody loves them
I'm gonna probably fall asleep playing
with one later I'll be on the plane so
that would be something for you but here
you go so much thank you for being part
of this we really appreciated having you
and thank you we're going to continue
having more interviews as the day goes
on if you have any questions just go
ahead and pop them in the comment
section if you're on Facebook and just
keep watching
thanks a lot and we're be back from here
