center awareness and what that means and
first let's talk a little bit what it's
not right so people of been using
multiple data centers with Mongo for a
long time so data center awareness is
not having a second data center for
disaster recovery or maybe doing some
you know secondary reads in a different
data center right the data center
awareness really is about being able to
have multiple data centers taking rights
at the same time being able to handle
certain types of partitions in being
able to manage your workload so that
users have the lowest possible latency
when actually using whatever system
you're building and that's really what
we're trying to solve here so let's go
through a little bit of a sample of what
someone might actually do in the real
world so let's say I go out and build a
website called my photos calm and my
photos the commons a relatively simple
photo sharing site I am going to let
users upload pictures view their
pictures and send links to pictures to
their friends right maybe I can do some
very simple things I can tag pictures I
can maybe have some privacy settings I
want to control all sorts of things and
so what do I care about here what is
that when me is the person uploading
pictures when i upload pictures i want
to make sure that it's fast right I want
the upload process to be fast I want to
be able to read my pictures quickly I
want to look like see what's going on I
want to change my settings pretty
quickly right if i want to change
privacy settings if i want to change
tags I want all that interaction to be
very fast for my interaction with the
site I want this to also be fully
consistent right when I'm modifying my
my data I want to you know read exactly
what I am writing and know what's going
on and have this all be very natural the
other thing I need to do with this side
is I need to look at other peoples
pictures right if I send a link to
someone else someone else is going to be
looking at my pictures and I need to
look at you know other people's pictures
for those actions we may be okay with
slightly delayed reads right if I'm
reading someone's picture and the tags
are five seconds old doesn't really
matter too much right there I do wants
to realize ability or I do want the
operations to appear in the same order
but if I if it's slightly inconsistent
that's okay and we want all this to
happen with the lowest possible latency
so now let's take a look at you know how
I might set this up in a toot you know
I'm running Mongo two point oh and I've
got a small charter to cluster
this is a maybe but likely what I have
right so I've got let's say I've got two
data centers one in New York City in one
San Francisco and again this is Mongo 20
so the New York data center is my
primary data center so that means that
for my two shards I've got two nodes in
New York and one node in California the
nose in New York are probably a higher
priority and all my rights are going to
hit New York all my you know my
consistent reads will hit New York and
that's pretty much the way the system is
going to work so if we take five random
users around the world the latency is
are going to be very very right if I'm
on the if I live near New York if I'm in
Boston or somewhere things are going to
be pretty fast right a nice low latency
everything's gonna feel really snappy if
I'm in California now I'm going across
the country things will definitely not
be as snappy things are going to slow
down considerably but you know maybe
it'll be sane now say I'm in Tokyo now
it gets even worse right if I'm trying
to do rights to the system from Tokyo
all the way to New York latencies are
going to get pretty bad so I it's not
going to be super fast it's not great
for anyone so the goal with tagawa
sharding is to make this that wherever I
am in the world Layton sees are as low
as possible and ideally that they're
consistent right does it shouldn't
matter where I am the site should
respond relatively the same so let's
take a look at what tag or sharding is
going to do so first this is sort of
what a sample document in this
collection might look like or some of
the core fields right so we've got a
country field which is you know what
country or what country you're in the
region and some picture ID so now what I
really want to do is be able to control
where these things live right if I live
in New York or if I live in Boston I
want my data to live as close to me as
possible so i'm going to assume that
we've got some intelligent load
balancers a you know directing traffic
to the right data center so the question
really is how to store data and so we
really want to do is allow Mongo to
intelligently intelligently put data
where you want it based on load within a
data center and then based on geography
outside of a data center so we go back
to our two shards so again we've got two
data centers
San Francisco one or New York but now
we've got one shark whose primary in is
in New York and one charges primary is
in San Francisco okay I'm going to tag
these two differently so the date so the
shard that is it has the primary in New
York is tagged with an NYC tag and the
sharp that has the primary in San
Francisco is tagged with an SFO tag and
then what i could do is go to my data
and say all right for all people whose
country is USA and the region is CA i am
going to require that their data lives
on a shard tagged with SFO and i was
doing the surreal i would do this once
for each each state all right so out of
50 entries in this table now this is all
done at the administrative level so the
developers and the site doesn't doesn't
happen you just go and run these
operations and what's going to happen is
immediately Mongols gonna start moving
data now obviously actually moving the
data is could take a while if you're
moving across the country is you've got
a ton of data to move but basically so
immediately the balance is going to kick
in start moving data from New York to
California California to New York it
could actually end up rearranging a very
large percentage of your data all right
if it's if you do have two active data
centers and move a ton of data around
but in the end all the users who live
near New York their data is going to be
in New York and all the people who live
in California their date is going to be
in California and for each state you get
to choose where where their data goes so
what does this end up looking like for
users well now my latency is for
California are much better right if I'm
in LA now my data now lives in San
Francisco much faster right so I've gone
from an 80 millisecond time to 10
milliseconds vastly improved now Paris
and Tokyo are still a little bit out of
luck because they're still going across
the cross the world so we can go further
right now we can say all right let's add
two more data centers so I'm adding an
am sorry I'm data center on a Tokyo
datacenter and I'm going to keep tagging
this way right so the answer data
centers can be tagged with a Nemea tag
the toki ones do we tagged with the
Japan tag and then I can make this more
general right so the the way you define
how these things are defined is more of
a hierarchical based on the chart key so
i'm going to say everyone in France
their data has to live on a shark Agatha
Mia and everyone who lives in China
their data has to live on a shard tagged
with Japan right and you can imagine you
could do this for
the reasons you can use for data
locality you can do this for legal
reasons for compliance reasons and all
sorts of ways you could define these
rules and the key is that the
administrator can define these rules
wherever they need to and the data just
flows and the other thing to notice you
could have multiple chars tagged with
the same tag right so if you have four
shards tagged in New York let's see if
you have four shards whose primaries in
New York you tag them all the same thing
or so they're all tagged with NYC and
the balancer will make sure that all the
day all the documents that should live
there are evenly distributed across
those four shards so now what do we have
well the nice thing now is no matter
where we are in the world accessing the
site latency is basically the same right
now Chicago is a little high because
it's kind of in the middle of nowhere
but besides that right if you're if
you're in China if you're in Tokyo go to
the toker data center it's right there
write it here in Paris you're going to
Amsterdam it's 10 milliseconds so matter
where you are in the world access is
pretty fast so this is really nice right
now no matter where I live everything is
pretty quick this is for my reads this
is for writing my data reading my data
now what if i want to read Jane's data
and Jane lives in Paris right so that
means I'm in New York Jane's data is
impact is in Amsterdam and I want to
read it well now mongo s and 22 will
actually route reads right secondary
okay reads to the closest secondary so
since we said before that we were okay
with slightly delayed reads for images
right we don't need we don't need to
read the images aren't really changing
very much and the tags aren't changing
very much so okay you're reading there's
a few milliseconds behind right so so
now I'm going to hit the local data
center so I'm gonna hit the New York
data center the New York a mongo s in
New York City is going to say all right
what is the closest secondary to me well
if I put a secondary for every single
shard in every single data center
there's going to be a secondary right
there and so now my reads for other
people's data are also as low as
possible so now we're in a situation
where i can write my data fast i can
read my data files that i can read
everyone else's data fast now we may
have lots of copies of every piece of
data if we want to go to the extreme but
we can do it right we can make
everything as fast as we possibly can so
that's all pretty handy so now there's
other advantage of those two right you
know we said originally
the main goal for data center awareness
is to be able to do right to multiple
data centers at the same time right so
in this case we've got four data centers
that are all taking rights at the same
time so the other interesting parts
about that too so let's say that the
fiber between new york and amp train
gets cut so all connectivity between new
york and amsterdam is gone what happens
to most of my users OOP most of my users
don't care right if I'm in Paris and I'm
going to upload pictures well I'm going
to Amsterdam if I want to redo my
pictures and on Paris again I'm going to
Amsterdam same with everyone to go to
their local data center now if I'm in
New York and i want to read someone's
pictures from Paris I may have you know
my copy is going to get older and older
as long as I cable is down but i'm just
reading if i'm just looking at old
pictures that's fine right there still
there i can still read them not a huge
deal obviously I can't see new pictures
right the secondaries going to keep
falling farther and farther behind as
long as I cable is down but at least
I'll still be able to read all the old
pictures just not see the new ones and I
can't get emails about the new ones
anyway since there's no internet
connectivity so that actually works out
pretty well so that so while the
geography is a pretty powerful use for
this there's a lot of other ways you can
use tag recharging and tagged you are
starting actually has no built-in notion
of geography right all we did before was
just we said okay for this shard key
range we're going to assign it to a
certain tag the tags are just completely
anonymous you can find them however you
want they can be geography base they can
be color based so what else can you do
with this so one interesting example is
archiving right let's say I've got a
relatively I've got a data set that's
relatively time-based and I really
really care about my data that's new and
I don't really care with the data that's
a few months old and I really don't care
about data that's like two years old
right I needed to be online I need to
access it once in a while but I don't
care too much so what do I do so now
let's say I shard by time and there are
ways you can make that very fast now I
can have three I can have three KAG
types or I can have some shards tagged
with awesome from some shards tagged
with good and some shards tagged with
bad right so my good shards are going to
be all SSDs have tons of ram be super
powerful my good shards are going to
have you know maybe like a 15k drives
and but
spindles my bad charts could be running
in like a bunch of you know 3 terabyte
5400 RPM drives that I found in the
street so this is pretty nice snug at
these three shards and then what do I do
when I way to find my tag ranges based
on dates so I say all data from the last
two months has to be on shards tagged
with good or I think the said awesome
before so data from two months ago to a
year ago has to live on good shards and
stuff older than a year ago how to you
know lives on the bad shards and that
can as many of these different you know
how can 25 good shards and seven awesome
charge doesn't really matter right it
can all be split up whoever you want and
then what do i do so now alright a month
passes and then I change the range for
like a year ago I say you know what this
range from january to februari of 2012
no longer should be in a good chart it
should be on a bad chart and so the data
is just going to move over there right
again it won't happen immediately it'll
just happen a little bit over time and
eventually then all of my data is going
to live on the stars I want so if you
this way you're hot you're hot current
data is on the fastest possible shards
and the other data isn't and you could
do this for anything it doesn't really
matter if this is archival or
multi-tenant is a lot of different ways
you can do it you know it's led to a lot
of customers about how you how people
are using this feature and there's a lot
of different use cases out there a lot
of people are using it in ways that we
hadn't thought of so there's a lot of
really interesting things and so we're
actually pretty excited to see what
people end up doing with this and now
you can change the rules dynamically
whenever you want so now i'm going to
hand it off to and relaxin who is a vp
