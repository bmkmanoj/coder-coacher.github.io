last year was a few more of us and this
year we brought six people here you'll
have a conversation in the hall and
people from you know Mongo staff will
stop it they'll hear part of that
conversation they'll say hey let me tell
you what we did on this other project
and have you thought about this if you
use this technology if you thought about
structuring your data like this to make
more sense it's a very interactive it's
not like you're here listening to
someone else talk about it they're
actually participating in the design
process of problem-solving and stuff
it's very cool I think consistently the
people that are speaking are very very
high quality they understand the topics
they're working on you're able to
deliver very very clear messages and I
know how hard that is I would say from a
delivery perspective that it's
consistently very very high like a brain
trust here where you get to see things
you never see you hear people from the
Air Force or from other branches of
government and it's interesting to see
how they took this technology and did
something with it and how do they
consume large amounts of data which we
do and you know it is a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
