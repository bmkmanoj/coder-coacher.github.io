look at how compass visualizes the
distribution of values against each
field can start by looking at the
underscore ID field you'll see the
underscore ID is made up of object IDs
in this case compass is able to extract
the date field from object IDs and
represent them in a histogram below
looking at the date visualization we can
see information such as the most popular
day the documents were inserted on and
the most popular times you can also see
a barcode of when the documents are
inserted over a period of time this
allows you to see when groupings of
documents have come in and when there
have given quiet patches in your inserts
for sub documents we can see the number
of fields present in the sub document
allowing us to extend out the field that
contains a sub document and see the
fields contained with M for fields
containing multiple unique strings such
as email address compass will provide a
sample portion of the strings visible in
a refreshable list fields containing
strings that are duplicated across
documents are aggregated and displayed
in a histogram from this histogram we
can see the document validation is the
favorite feature and incurs in 29% of
the documents fields that contain a low
cardinality of possible string values
are represented by a single bar giving
the values in this case male or female
for the gender field fields that contain
numbers are represented in a histogram
in this case we can see that the minimum
age is 7 and the maximum age is 63 we
can also see by moving the mouse over
the tallest bar of the histogram that
the most common age range is 34 to 36
for fields that contain mixed data types
such as postcode we can see the values
for each type by clicking on the type
bar for example we are currently looking
at string values stored against postal
code by clicking on number we can see
the values for the field that have been
stored in the document as a number it's
also possible to view the raw documents
from this collection by clicking on the
document viewer icon once I click this
icon the document viewing pane expands
and I can see the raw documents
themselves as you can see from this
beautifully slick interface compass
allows MongoDB users to get a high level
understanding of their collections and
then really drill down into the specific
view of their data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
