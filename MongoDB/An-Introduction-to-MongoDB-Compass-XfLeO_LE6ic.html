user interface that enables users to
understand the structure of the data in
the database and perform ad-hoc queries
against it all with zero knowledge of
MongoDB query language first up let's
connect a MongoDB by typing in the
hostname and port we wish to connect to
I'm just going to connect to a local
host running on port 2701 seven I have
the option of saving that connection for
future reference I'm going to save it as
my connection and if I'm running with
authentication turned on at the database
I can choose to supply the username and
password plus the authentication
database details here I'm actually not
running with authentication right now so
I'm going to disable this but we
currently do support MongoDB CR and
scram sha-1 for the GA release of
MongoDB compas we will also support
connections running with SSL will
support authentication with Kerberos and
also with LDAP I'm going to go ahead and
hit connect once compass is connected to
Mongo D you'll see the name of the host
and the port that it's connected to and
whether this is a community version or
Enterprise version of MongoDB you'll
also see the version of MongoDB that is
running in this case it's 3:06 you'll
see that there's four databases within
this Mongo D and eight collections and
those collections and databases are
listed down the side here I have the
choice of filtering through those
databases or I can simply select one
from the left let's go ahead and select
that MongoDB fan club once I've selected
the MongoDB fan club compas will go away
and analyze the documents within the
collection to present me with a
beautifully designed interface that
shows me very useful information about
the structure and schema of my
collection as you can see here compass
presents me with the number of documents
within the collection the total size of
those documents the average size of
those documents and a bunch of index
information this is the same information
that we picked up from DB dot stats in
the shell of Lesson one you'll also see
the MongoDB compass has given me the
field names present in the documents of
the collection you'll see that there's
things like age email favorite feature
gender last login membership status name
phone number underneath the name of each
field is the data type of the field
itself you'll see in this case that
phone number is made up of strings and
this case string is present in 84% of
the documents within the collection
you'll also see that compass indicates
that in the remaining 16% phone number
is made up of a number this could be
indicative of a bug in the application
whereby it started to store strings
instead of numbers or simply the version
of the application has evolved over time
and that you are now storing numbers as
opposed to strings in the past either
way this is a good indicator that you
have mixed data types within your
collection it's also possible to really
drill down into the shape of the schema
for example with the address field we
can see that it's made up of a hundred
percent of documents we can choose to
expand those sub documents by clicking
this arrow and viewing the fields within
the sub documents themselves in this
case you'll see that we have fields
within the sub documents called city
made up of strings country made up of
strings postcodes which is present but
made up of strings 88% of the time and
numbers 12 percent of the time and
streets this schema visualizer is a
really powerful tool enabling MongoDB
users to understand the frequency and
presence of fields within documents
within their collection this was
previously not possible before MongoDB
