for the city of Chicago
our giant idea was to view everything
that's happening in the city of Chicago
in real-time that's across 2.7 million
people that's across 240 square miles
but it's important that we're able to
take a look across the entire city of
Chicago to help improve the efficiency
of the city's operations we're over 30
departments or hundreds of lines of
businesses ranging everywhere from non
emergency 3-1-1 requests to filling in
potholes to issuing business licenses to
help build new buildings whatever it is
we need to be able to look across the
expanse of this city of Chicago to see
what's happening and to be able to use
data that we've been collecting through
all these different business processes
to try to improve the efficiency of city
operations so about four years ago we
got a question from the city's chief of
staff question that might not be too
unfamiliar to you which is why when I
try to figure out information do I have
to go to different departments and
different systems to get information
what's happening in the city why can't I
view that all in one location that's a
big question but we were able to address
that question by using MongoDB we're
able to bring that information together
so we're able to see that all at once
and to see it in real time and now it's
being used by multiple departments
across the entire city of Chicago the
city of Chicago like many other
organizations needs to break down silos
between our different data warehouses we
have over 30 departments and we have
hundreds of lines of businesses all that
speak to different aspects of the city
whether or not it's crime or whether or
not issuing new permits we need to
understand what's happening around us
and when do Grid as an application to be
able to provide a single map to explore
how we live to explore the vents and
happenings that happened the city of
Chicago and putting this into the hands
of city users who are then able to
understand what's happening around them
as opposed of looking at the lens of the
city of Chicago through a single data
set and instead we're able to so far
combine over a dozen different data sets
into a single interface to see what is
happening around you suppose a staff
member from the Chicago Department of
Public Health wants to understand and
find all the restaurant complaints and
also all the new restaurants have opened
up across the city of Chicago in the
pass
one month we open up our query fine
window we go back to the last one month
of data we're going to pull from two
different systems the first is going to
be our 301 system which contains
restaurant complaints a second wholly
different system pulling up business
licenses filed with the city of Chicago
and in particular restaurants when I
submit the query we use MongoDB to bring
together the data the actual data
sources exists in two different systems
but in this paradigm we're able to view
everything at the exact same time
organizing data about how we live
instead of how data is organized in our
individual silos once the query is
returned we're able to take a look at
all the data at the exact same time the
map interface allows us to visually
explore the data meanwhile this grid at
the bottom is able to show us what's
happening on a point by point basis
pulling up even further we can take a
look at the restaurant complaints
whether or not it's on East 111th Street
or we can take a look at new business
licenses filed on West Madison Street
taking a step back we're able see
activity across the entire city of
Chicago at one time a staff member such
at the Chicago Department of Public
Health would have been tied with the
data that they could look at now they're
able to see all activity from across
multiple different departments across
the city all in one screen without
permission from anybody else and is able
to view this when they need it
Mongo scalable infrastructure means that
we're able to import data from a number
of different sources such as Twitter the
city of Chicago collects geo-located
tweets from the Chicagoland area
approximately 11 million tweets a year
that's available through Twitter's
public API we can take a look in
particular neighborhoods across the city
of Chicago such as the downtown area
otherwise known as the loop and pull up
all tweets that have occurred within
that area over any time period here
we'll take a look at tweets over the
last two weeks again we're able to pull
up and in this case we're just going to
look at tweets we use pre-loaded
geographies to be able to determine the
neighborhoods and organize the
neighborhoods and communities across the
city of Chicago
here we're able to zoom in to see what's
happening to be able to look at the data
as it comes in in real time and also
historically it's helped us understand
things such as sediments and moods
across the city of Chicago through
different weather seasons and through
different activities we can understand
what's happening throughout the city and
how residents are responding to it the
results show us what happens on a day to
day basis and being able to look at the
tweets in more detail all these tweets
are publicly accessible and publicly
accessible through the Twitter API we
load those into Mongo and then made
available through the wind you get
application to the users across the city
of Chicago so we can expand even outside
of our own silos to take a look at the
social media data that's available to
everybody else city employees sometimes
can't search by a predefined geography
sometimes we need to look in areas
around a certain location so we allow
users to draw on the map to see what's
happening let's again take a look at
tweets but this time what we want to
take a look at is within a certain area
a drawn extends here we're able to take
a look at tweets within three different
CTA stations the results show tweets
within the geo bound area nothing
outside and nothing more than what has
been asked for by the user again now we
were able to break down silos but were
able to isolate what's happening in the
city of Chicago it provides a convenient
way to organize the events and
happenings around the city of Chicago
it's organizing data about how we live
instead of organizing data by the silos
that we keep them in behind this is
Mongo database and what's also helpful
is that Mongo database is used by our
advanced researchers our data scientists
it provides a single location where our
data scientists can get pertinent
information they don't need to go to the
user interface but they can use mongos
drivers to download data whether that's
from python r or any other programming
language so we can do more sophisticated
research such as predicting which
restaurant is going to fail their
restaurant inspections much of the data
that's used our advanced analysis is
also stored in Monga though we don't
access it through the user interface the
Mongo database gives us a single
location that we're able to pull down
this data when you grid is an
application a step towards a data-driven
it's a step towards a smart city what
this allows us to do is take a look at
what's happening around our city allows
us to break down the silos and expand
across 30 different departments and
hundreds of lines of businesses and
share the information with each other
that's pertinent for your respective job
this is breaking down the silos that
both we need to do here in the city of
Chicago it's also important in the
corporate enterprise Mongo database has
done a lot of work for us and allowing
us to achieve that goal so in Chicago as
we start building these systems how can
we leverage software and data towards
the public good by the end of this year
we're going to be taking our windy grid
application and open sourcing and make
it available to the public that means if
you're in another city and a different
municipality or anywhere else you're
gonna be able to take the software that
we've used that we've taken taxpayer
dollars to invest in to build and your
will use that yourself
that's gonna be able to transform how we
look at software and how we view these
projects not only benefit ourselves not
only benefiting the residents but also
being able to benefit other cities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
