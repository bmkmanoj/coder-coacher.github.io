tutorials my name is Jay and I'm here to
teach you more about how to get started
using our database as a service
Atlas today we'll introduce you to our
latest Atlas feature our free m0
instance our free tier allows you to
spin up a free three node replica
perfect for learning and prototyping
there's no need for you to enter a
credit card which means you can start
writing your code against MongoDB in
minutes MongoDB Atlas is the easiest way
for you to run MongoDB with security
database best practices and high
availability baked in when you're ready
to scale up you can launch a custom
cluster with a configurable disk size
speed and provision I ops all this is
available with a few simple clicks of
your mouse or a call to our API so let's
take a quick look at how you can sign up
and launch your free m0 cluster if
you're an existing Atlas user there's no
need for you to sign up for a new
account just follow the directions after
if you're new to Atlas we'll start by
going to MongoDB comm slash cloud slash
Atlas in our browser and then clicking
on getting started so we start off with
the simple stuff here adding our email
address and coming up with a complex
password our account creation tool helps
out with this complexity remember that
by default will also add a username and
password to log into our database this
will be separated now let's agree to the
Terms of Service
but clicking the check box and now we're
ready to click continue and move forward
with our new Atlas account creation
we're now prompted for some basic
contact info this contact information
can be used to notify you of potential
problems new features and alerts related
to your cluster once we've finished
filling out our personal details we'll
go ahead and start to name our group
your group will manage your MongoDB
deployments you can give other Atlas
users access to your group allowing them
to log into the group and manage your
deployments for security and auditing
reasons you cannot use a name that
you've used earlier nor can your groups
name be changed so be certain that this
is the correct name you'd like to use
you'll be limited to just one m0 cluster
for your group so let's go ahead and
name our group and we'll just call it J
demo
20:17 and let's add something silly like
maybe potato and then click continue now
that we've created a group it's time to
go ahead and name our cluster we'll name
our cluster J easy enough and then we'll
scroll down and we'll see that there are
all these different options but there's
a new one DM 0 the M 0 is our new free
offering that allows you to get started
without having to enter a credit card
pretty simple so then we'll scroll down
and we'll remember that we need to add a
username and password so I'll just use J
and we've got this auto-generate secure
password you can use that to create any
number of very secure passwords that are
complex and click copy and save that you
can also use custom passwords if you
decide to so before we go ahead and
click launch let's go ahead and look at
what we're going to get so the region is
going to be by default US East one
that's our default for this our RAM is
shared our disk storage is a total of
512 megabytes you get a default
replication factor of three and one
shard there is no backup available if
you'd like to upgrade you can launch a
new cluster not a problem and then just
migrate your data over so let's go ahead
and click confirm and deploy and we'll
confirm we're not a robot the process to
create your cluster will take about five
to ten minutes you can use this time to
go ahead and maybe configure your
whitelist or maybe get a cup of coffee
regardless when you're done you'll be
able to start building your application
at no cost to you if you're running into
any Atlas issues contact our support
team at any time click the support link
in the lower left of your Atlas
interface or go to MongoDB comm slash
