to transactions as you guys know MongoDB
is coming out with multi document multi
stream and multi collection transactions
across replicas sets in MongoDB for oh
but we didn't get here overnight there
was many projects that had to be
implemented in order for us to offer
this functionality and one of those
projects and was in MongoDB 3:6 for
travel rights and Randolph is here to
talk to us about this project I'm not
like a brought a product manager on the
core server and mrs. Randolph an
engineer on the sharding team so I'm
gonna toss it off to him and we'll get
started
sure FERPA gate I would like to get it
like read overview of what trouble
arises yeah so what this allows you is
example for example you send a right to
a server like say for example the right
looks looks like this X increment 1 so
you incremented the X field by 1 you
send it this to the server but before
you got the response the connection was
dropped so you were not able to tell
whether you actually success will apply
this right or not right because that
connection could have been lost on my
trip there because it or on my trip back
for yes
both ways and what your tribal rights
allows you to do is to send the same
exact write for the second time without
the fear of the increment happening
twice and before I talk about how we did
this I also want to go to the overview
of how replication works in MongoDB for
every single write in a MongoDB like
this one like this would of course
correspond to a upload entry this is
basically a document describing
how what how to perform the exact same
right and this right is idempotent so
that means that if you this would be
convert
they say for example urgent the document
was x3 and it becomes x4 so basically
the upload document would say set X to 4
so that means that this right will be
converted into something I dependent so
like an every non idempotent right is it
converted to an item potent right when
placed in the op lock because all the
other nodes are replicating from the
habla yes because of the secondaries
could apply the writes like multiple
times and it has to be that's why yeah
yeah and going here we have an example
where like multiple writes has happened
at the primary and the secondary is a
node that basically replicates all the
writes that happened at the primary and
this is done by basically cooing for
from the primary all the blog entries
that happened and this is in a very
particular order here in this primary
backbone right to write three four and
five and the prime the secondary would
extract all these upload entries and
apply in the same order as a primary
well I'm simplifying things because
there's like things that happen the
secondary that like kind of paralyzes
the application but for the sake of this
discussion let's say that they're being
applied the same order and that's how
the secondary is copies like the primary
and with this blog entries it has all
the rights description on the right so
what this allows you to do is for every
writes that had reliable features on we
could basically look at those blog
entries and figure out whether we have
done the right or not
so I'm going to walk through of how the
tribal rites work and I and should be
able to give us a glimpse of better
understanding of what's happening under
the hood so for example we're gonna use
the exact same example the increment of
x1 let's say we have multiple increments
of different fields on different
documents y1 and etc etc so each of this
would correspond to one particular blog
entry and every time we create a blog
entry on a write that is reliable we
also update the transaction table well
the transaction table contains is the
logical session ID the transaction
number of the right and the link to the
last up log entry that contains the last
write of this transaction so for example
in this case when we do this right we
created a transaction table link to this
guy and when we did this update we
created a new entry that links to this
and so on and so on and going back to
the same example before where we sent
this right increment X 1 then we lost
the connection so what happens when we
send the same write again back to server
what the server will do is it will find
out that oh this right has an LS ID of
10 transaction number of some number 20
years of example with this you will be
able to look at the transaction table
and match the same
logical session ID and transaction
number and this will in turn point to
the last right that happened in this
transaction and with this information
you will be able to inspect all the up
blog entries in this chain and see
whether it has actually performed this
right or not so in this case since the
this particular byte is already here
this particular tribal rights will not
apply the right jaesi that already be
implied already and since we did apply
the right we will although we did are
probably right we need to be able to
still return to the user the response as
if we have their track we did the right
so you want to give them the response
they would have gotten if they had been
a successful on their first attempt yes
so in this particular case we have we
also embed in this upload entry all the
information that needs to be returned
for example like you have we have
updated one document or we have observed
at a document was the absurd ID like
everything can be extracted from the out
log entry there's a special case in
especially fun kind of right we call
find and modify because final modify has
an option for you to return the document
before the update or document after the
update we have destroyed this
information somehow and we did this by
creating a special up log entry that is
special because unlike other upload
entries that describes what right has
happened this is a upload entry that is
no op but contains the free image or the
post image of the document after the
modification
so for if I modify your tribal whites
you will look very much similar to this
example I gave earlier with the
exception that you will have a special
link to an up log entry that contains
the pre image or post image of
modification so that when we retry the
right we will be able to give you the
same response as if you did this for the
first time right so the same success the
client could be unaware that over trial
like a retry even happened yes because
the drivers actually automatically do
make one attempt to retry for you
when you have the retablo rights option
on at the client level okay so now I
would like to talk to about how we
replicate the transaction table but
before that I'm going to explain what
will happen if we replicate the
transaction table the normal way and so
if we're going to do this the normal way
we have let's say for example multiple
rights for transaction 10 contains right
1 and right to you so this one means
that the primary will contain a blog
entry for right one right - and then the
update to the transaction table so what
this would look like in the primary is
we have right one here and we did right
- and this has a link to the previous
right right one and we write the
transaction table here
that contains the link - right - so this
is what the primary state would look
like and if the secondary is replicating
the upload entries for the primary then
it would have applied right one and
right two as well
however if this primary goes down before
the second day was able to fetch the
update to the transaction table then the
secondary would not contain this
particular state which has the
transaction table entry that is supposed
to link the last right so what will
happen is if a new permit goes down and
this becomes a new primary a new writes
happen along then this particular update
to the transaction table would have been
lost and this is bad because if you sent
the same exact transaction this
transaction to here to do a retry the
secondary has applied right one and
right - but it has forgot that he's
applied because it doesn't have the
transaction table entry so what will
happen is if you rewrite this the
secondary would look like this every one
W two and then W 1 and W 2 again it
would just reapply those rights even
though it had already successfully
applied that yes so this is bad
yeah in order to get around this what we
did instead is we don't replicate the
transaction table normally what we did
is for every single blog entry it also
contains all the information the
secondary needs to be able to form the
chain and update the transaction table
correctly so what it will look like is
like W 1 W 2
and some other rights is a w-4 and when
the secretaries apply these rights fetch
this up up entries and try to apply them
this up each individual up log entry
would also contain all the information
the secondary needs to construct the
transaction table what this means is if
this applies to everyone it would look
like this it would apply w1 and it has
all the information needs to be able to
construct the transaction table and
point the right right one and it would
when you place write to you will then
apply right to here and has all the
information needs update transaction
table and point - right - and that
information is a logical session ID or
the LS ID and the transaction ID yes and
we also have like a unique identifier
for every single right okay yes the
statement ID this is kind of internal
right bookkeeping so statement ID is the
internal statement within a transaction
transaction ID is the sequence of
transact statements I guess an
ideological session could have multiple
transactions and within a session
yes we also have vary in order to keep
the memory loved that like memory alone
we also clean up every entry when you
bump up the transaction number so we
only keep track of the latest logical
session ID with the latest transaction
number so say for example you have here
a less ID some ID and transaction 10 and
then you start a new trend transaction
transaction 11 with the same ID this
would get overridden
so basically we're assuming that if you
start a new transaction with the same ID
e you don't care about the all the
transactions anymore and
an ID or a logical session ID is tied to
like one thread so it has to be like a
sequential operation yes got it
so this is pretty much how we travel
guys work in the server 36 awesome thank
you so much Randolph for walking us
through this great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
