test cases that's exactly what we're
going to do here first we're going to
write a bunch of test the test bad
parameters to our API or enrolling new
users specifically we're going to test
the user / and roll route here in our
API and we're going to be expecting
error codes like 400 so this is how you
create a frisbee test here frisbee die
create and we're going to issue a post
on the user and roll URL here we're
going to pass last name email and
password note that we're missing the
first name field so we're expecting a
status reply of 400 with a json error
telling us that we forgot to define the
first name all right and then we toss
the frisbee that's how you tell frisbee
to run your test so this is our first
error test case we have a number of
these of course I have other ones to
find that missing a last name missing
email etc here we're going to try
testing a password that doesn't have any
lower case letters all right so we're
going to be getting an error back from
the storm pass API that creates a new
user because they're going to validate
the password and give our REST API and
error saying that the password was
invalid basically wasn't strong enough
okay so we should be expecting a status
of 400 for that alright if we pass an
invalid email you'll see I've bolded
here there's no add sign there's no
domain name so here I'm validating that
the email address they give us is at
least a valid email string okay again we
should expect status 400 back from that
all right now let's actually run some
tests that work so basically I want to
create three different test users that I
later test cases can use so again our
storm pass application name is called
reader test we're going to require the
frisbee file and the test config and
then for each of those three test users
that I have in the array we're going to
issue a user enroll post just like we
did on the previous test cases but
because here we're passing valid
parameters we're going to expect the
status 201 which is the success status
means that the object was created
successfully and the JSON payload that
comes back in this case of our
application is a document showing what
the user object looks like that was
created just so we can verify that it
actually did create what we asked them
to write and then we toss that frisbee
and
all done we're going to enroll a
duplicate user just to make sure that we
get an appropriate error response when
we enroll a user where that email
already exists alright so basically
we're trying to test all the corner
cases make sure that our test cases do
go through at least every path in our
code we get good code coverage from our
test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
