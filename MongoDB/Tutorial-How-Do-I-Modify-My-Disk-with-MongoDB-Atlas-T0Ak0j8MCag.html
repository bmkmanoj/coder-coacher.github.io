tutorial series my name's Jay and I'm a
developer advocate at MongoDB and I'm
here to teach you about the ins and outs
of using our database as a service
MongoDB Atlas today we'll discuss how to
modify your MongoDB disk options in
Atlas
MongoDB Atlas provides you with the
ability to modify your clusters
configuration via the control panel or
the REST API in this video we'll review
how to modify a live cluster without any
downtime right from the browser so let's
say you've reached a point where the
maximum I ops provided by the
configuration you're using a production
is no longer sufficient or maybe after
launching your deployment you need to
increase the total amount of hard disk
available perhaps you might even want to
go back and ensure that data at rest is
encrypted all these things can be done
to your cluster without ever going
offline
MongoDB Atlas ensures that each node in
the cluster will be updated one at a
time ensuring the database remains
available during the process by using
your full connection string that we
provide you right here the m0 sandbox
does not have this feature so you won't
be able to modify this disk you'll have
to ensure that you have a paid cluster
in order to perform some of the same
actions that I do in this video let's
click configuration for our cluster
you'll be brought back to the same view
when you first created the cluster here
you can modify the disk options disk
size can be modified on any of our
dedicated Atlas clusters each of our
dedicated cluster types comes with a
default disk size for the instance if
the default disk size or speed is not
optimized to your application you can
make modifications at any time to select
a different disk you can just drag the
slider to this size required and once
you're finished choosing the size you
can just click confirm and deploy I ops
or total input output per second allowed
on our disk can be increased on the m30
and above clusters a lack of available I
ops on your app produces the total
amount of work your cluster can do per
second by providing your MongoDB Atlas
cluster with a larger size of provision
I ops you have the ability to improve
the performance of your application to
modify I ops make sure you have at least
an M 30 or above cluster our existing M
10 does not have the ability to modify
its ions so what we'll do is we'll
upgrade to an M 30 and then we'll have
the ability to select one of the three
options standard which comes as default
fast or
fastest and we can just go ahead and
click confirm and deploy to have this
new instance type and speed of our disk
applied
if you're running into any issues
related to using MongoDB Atlas features
contact our support team at any time you
can click the support link at the lower
left of your Atlas interface or you just
go to MongoDB comm slash contact thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
