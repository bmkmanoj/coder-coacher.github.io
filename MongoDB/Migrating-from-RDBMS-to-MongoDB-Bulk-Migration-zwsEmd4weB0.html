move some data into your new system and
the truth is you're probably going to
want to move a whole pile of data quite
early on to test out various schema
designs and test out various bits of
your stack and then initially you're
probably not looking for a robust
operationalized reconcilable data
incremental transfer system you're just
looking at how easily can I get data
over and transfer and push it into
MongoDB and you may need to use a range
of different tools to do that as well
because depending on the source system
and the transformation you need to make
it could be that there are different
things required so let's look at some of
the tools available one of the first
tools available right out of the factory
so to speak available with all MongoDB
installations is Mongo import Mongo
import is a tool which can read
tab-separated comma-separated or most
importantly new line delimited JSON data
and push it rapidly into a database as a
version 2.8 the performance of it is
increased significantly
it's multi-threaded you can tune buffer
sizes and it can push data very quickly
so you can work with extracting your
data using whatever tools you have for
the source system creating Jason
remembering that Jason other data
description language actually doesn't
contain things like a date type although
the MongoDB database does because
MongoDB is a strongly typed database so
remembering to put in things like this
that allow you to define that something
is a date so that when you look inside
the database you'll see that this is a
date type and you're able to do date
range queries or clearly such as find
everything that happened on a Tuesday
there are also lots and lots of good
tools out there for working with Jason
data and tools like JQ Jason query which
could be worked on to kind of filter and
merge it you may also want to look at
traditional vendor ETL tools obviously
down the line it would be nice if your
ETL process and you merge it into your
new database it's handled via a nice
workflow in an ETL too many ETL tools
work very nicely some such as Pentaho
have
specific support not just for MongoDB
but for creating that rich data shapes
so you know it's always worthwhile
considering using a traditional ETL tool
for moving with Asia around sometimes
you might want to use your ETL tool up
to a certain point and then use its
workflow to launch custom tools that
you've written to do a final
transformation or a final push into
MongoDB we also have various community
tools for moving data into MongoDB so
I'll give some information about
firehose firehose is a command line
interface it's designed to weed right
data and push it into MongoDB the idea
is it provides a framework you then
write Java modules which plug into it
which allow you to push the data and to
do various transformations the MongoDB
community is very large with nearly 10
million downloads of the software so
lots of people out there built lots of
nice tools from moving data into a noted
MongoDB another example of one of these
tools is Mongo empty import Mongo empty
import is similar to Mongo import the
difference is that it allows you to
write plugins and to perform
transformations on the data as it's
being loaded so if you want to for
example encrypt certain fields or
decrypt certain fields you want to
hashes of things in or you want to do a
lookup as the data comes in and change
it to some other value based on some
reference data then Mongo MT import
gives you more flexibility than the
standard MongoDB import the next step
down the line is getting into the also
open source r2m to relational to Mongo
which is designed to basically read data
using that the Perl DVI DVD interfaces
which allow you to read a huge array of
data sources I've used an earlier
variant of this tool to actually take
over 500s tables from four different
systems and merge them into a
replacement system built on top of the
document database it's only an excellent
way of approaching it the definition is
a recursive config file if you like
written in Perl but the downside is
you're working in Perl the upside is
that you have access to a first order
language where you can
to design how all the visas merge
together how all the nesting works and
perform any arbitrary transformations on
it as it goes it's also quite a quick
way of moving the data so the r2m tool
is available for download from github
again it's a community tool but it's a
great one when it comes to merging
tables together and embedding them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
