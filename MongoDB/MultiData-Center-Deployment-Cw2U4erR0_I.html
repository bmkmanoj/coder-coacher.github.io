foundational technologies but clearly we
need to make this this technology
manageable certainly as you're building
out global applications you need to be
able to manage things centrally so you
don't have to have administrators on
every local site and so moma DB provides
a management platform through MongoDB
ops manager and through the MongoDB
management service ops manager itself is
software it's on-premise software you
install and run it yourself it's part of
our commercial MongoDB Enterprise
advanced product alternatively what you
can do is connect your systems to the
MongoDB management service which itself
as a service hosted by MongoDB in the
cloud so youyou literally point your own
cluster at mms and then mms manages that
for you what's really useful is in in
areas like backups for example so you
can initiate backups and that's stored
in among going to be management service
without you having to manage your own
backup infrastructure and when you want
to issue a restore you know you can do
they can send you a link or it can push
you the files to to restore yourself but
either way you're not managing all the
backup infrastructure that goes with
that so MongoDB ops manager and mms
largely have the same functionality they
enable you to provision and to upgrade
clusters you can do that with just a few
clicks from our management console all
you can do it with a restful api call so
we integrate with through that restful
api a whole bunch of management
frameworks for example we've integrated
very closely with public cloud platforms
right now on AWS the AWS a whole
provisioning spinning up a VMS is
integrated into mms so is your
provisioning new clusters you can
actually select your am eyes you can
select the regions for deployment and it
was go and spin those instances up for
you so you don't have to provision those
separately so it makes cross region
automated deployments and upgrade
something that's very very simple to do
in addition ops manager and mms are
providing you with real-time monitoring
and alerts so you can be alerting
automatically if your hosts are failing
you can monitor things like
replication and status of replication
specifically any lag between your
primaries and your secondaries and you
can configure alerts against those
things so you can for example configure
it to send an SMS message you can
configure to send an email you can
integrate it with things like HipChat or
pagerduty so it's fully integrated into
your operational tooling and it will
tell you for example if replication lag
between one data center and another is
exceedingly the thresholds that you
configure to even golfin a figure out
what what the issue is also included
with ops manager and mms is a set of
backup and restore tooling so this is
the only backup tool that provides
things like pointing time backups and
consistent snapshots of Chardon clusters
and so you manage those backups yourself
through ops manager or with mms the
MongoDB management service we manage
them for you so I mentioned you can
control with this functionality through
a self-service portal or you can
integrate it with your existing manager
management frameworks via the restful
api that comes with these tools how ops
manager a moment and mms helps you well
it's fully automated in forces best
practices helps you to meet your SLA is
it it cost management overhead and it
allows you to scale online very very
easily within a data center or across
multiple data centers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
