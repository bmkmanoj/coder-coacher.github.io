kind of undergoing massive disruption
almost every hospital is migrating to a
electronic health record system but none
of them actually know how to do anything
with the data so they've got a whole
bunch of data but no information I'm
John Berry I'm up senior platform
engineer at a paleta we're a platform
for analytics one of the major pieces of
our business model is that we're
ingesting a wide variety of hospital and
hospital data varies from hospital to
hospital and we needed a way to
accommodate that in such a way that we
could still map it to algorithms and
still execute on the data to deliver
clinical outcomes mongodb is a critical
part of our infrastructure because it's
dynamic schema allows us to ingest
patient data in a way that maintains the
fidelity at the hospital yet still
allows us to operate on it at runtime in
a way that can deliver clinical outcomes
it's mind boggling how much data is out
there for patients we looked at
relational databases and we initially
started our first iteration with the
relational database but the sequel was
shall we say complicated right now we
have three hospitals you know in three
months we're going to have another
twelve hospitals the end of the year
we're going to have even more with
MongoDB were able to scale horizontally
and via technology such as sharding
we're able to actually grow with it
because it's healthcare data and patient
data there's a lot of regulatory
compliance that we need to go through we
encrypt everything at rest we also have
a series of different layers of security
protocols we use MongoDB authentication
layer to ensure that MongoDB connections
are always authenticated we also have a
whole layer of entitlements so that
organizations don't muddy their data by
accidentally seeing somebody else's
without technology like MongoDB I don't
know how
been done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
