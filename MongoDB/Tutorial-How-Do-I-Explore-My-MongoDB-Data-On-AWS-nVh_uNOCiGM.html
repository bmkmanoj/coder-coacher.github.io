tutorial series my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate at MongoDB and I'm
here to teach you the ins and outs of
using our database as a service
MongoDB Atlas today we'll discuss how to
explore your MongoDB data on AWS
MongoDB Atlas paid clusters come with
our data Explorer
a quick way to view and query data from
your browser there's no additional
software required or need to connect to
a Mongo shell to access information
about your documents to get started
we'll just go ahead and click data right
here in our UI next we'll be given a
list of our databases we can go ahead
and click the database that we want to
work with in this case we'll use Meeny
and will be given a summary of all the
different collections that are part of
this particular database so here we'll
be able to see a summary of our
collection and in this case you can see
in pages posts and sessions we've got
the number of documents so what we'll do
is go into posts and now we'll be able
to actually review the different posts
that are stored in document format
within our data Explorer if I want it to
look up something specific like publish
true just put it right here and it'll
load all documents with the publish true
value matching in this other example of
going into this people list database
going into collection people and went
ahead and did a search for a name for
the user Alice as you can see now all
the documents that were matching with
the name Alice have been come up you'll
also be able to view indexes and get
information on how many databases
how many collections you have the total
data size and the total size of your
indexes you can use this section to do
simple queries across all your different
databases in your MongoDB data however
what we really recommend is if you want
to do more complex queries you stick
with MongoDB compass or use the shell
if you're running into any issues
related to using MongoDB Atlas features
contact our support team at any time you
can click the support link at the lower
left of your Atlas interface or you just
go to MongoDB comm slash contact thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
