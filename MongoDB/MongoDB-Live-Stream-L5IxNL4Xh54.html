is Jay I'm a developer advocate like I
mentioned before we're doing a series of
interviews today talking to people who
are either customers developers or
partners with MongoDB and right now I've
got Chuck from IBM Chuck thanks a lot
for joining me how are you I'm great
so um iBM is one of the biggest
corporations in the world that does
incredible things with technology we're
all aware of just some of the most
amazing advancements in our life that
IBM has provided to us would you just
tell me about how IBM and MongoDB are
intersecting right now I think what's
fascinating about MongoDB and IBM coming
together is we're a phenomenal
technology company we make everything
from processors to software to Watson
technology and yeah things like that and
Mongo is one of the hottest new
technologies and capabilities in the
industry right yeah and so you take what
Mongo is able to deliver with you new
you know data source models and develop
these rich new applications we have
companies like Florida blue who you
heard from folks that we're here
yesterday heard from from Claudia sure
and you put MongoDB on top of our
technology and it's a fantastic
combination you get great performance
you get great throughput and response
time for the end user clients you know
your application developers get to run
on basically a hot rod yeah they love
that kind of stuff so I also love that a
lot of companies are now kind of
enabling developers to get out of data
legs
mr. saying let's take what you know
would have been a huge process that
would have included an ETL that brings
data over here to here then you run the
process once and then you have to do the
whole process so MongoDB is really turn
developers to use operational data
sources and I think a company like ABM
you're producing just such rich rich
products yep um what would you say like
while you've been here at MongoDB well
there's been one of your better
experiences well I like maybe I use the
word unleash share it can unleash
MongoDB because you can take advantage
of rich sources of data as you mentioned
so for example we've got retail clients
share financial industry clients we've
got folks that do you know airline
reservations they're generating 500,000
reservations today that creating the
truth amount of data but it's gone into
those traditional data store model
archived in the god-knows-where right
but you take MongoDB now you can keep
that data like sure and they can look at
you know what was it that caused the
outages and what's the impact on our
business you know what about longer-term
trend analysis another fascinating one
there was a guy from a company called
Emerson electronics sure and they put
these little sensors on the bottom of
your like Purdue chicken or on the yes
and it keeps track of the temperature
which is important exactly as it makes
its way from you know the processing
plant all the way to your whole foods or
whatever that's then I was asking about
using MongoDB it's a phenomenal
application model for him yeah there's
been a really great revolution of
internet of things that we've seen
people apply MongoDB as the place where
the data is going to be stored for
output information or just logging
anything you could think of where you
need to store info MongoDB has kind of
been that answer so I want to thank you
very much Chuck for being part of this
everybody who comes by on the MongoDB
live show as I like to call today is
gonna get a fidget spinner
everyone loves fidget spinners and a
t-shirt or out stitch so thank you very
much for coming today Jay enjoy the rest
of your time there at MongoDB world
we'll be back in a few minutes we're
going to have more interviews we're
going to keep going with great great
info about our whole experience here at
MongoDB world so stick by and if you
have questions or concerns just throw
them in the comment section on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
