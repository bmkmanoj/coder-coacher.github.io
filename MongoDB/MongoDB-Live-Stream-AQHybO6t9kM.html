continue to interview people who are
both integrating MongoDB developing with
MongoDB or in this case helping people
find love through MongoDB so I want to
introduce you now to Vijay Vijay works
over T harmony and I think a lot of you
know that e harmony is the site that
people use to find one another maybe
fall in love maybe just go on a date so
once you tell us a little bit about how
MongoDB and harmony kind of intersect
yeah sure um so far as user experience
is the important thing
sure right so people are you hard people
use the harmony to find their loved ones
one of the important things in the
Harmony is like communication so
everybody who subscribes to harmony to
find allow and communicate with the
other person who so recently we
redesigned our communication system and
we are using MongoDB Atlas as the store
oh wow yeah so Atlas if you don't know
already it's our database as a service
product it's on the cloud and so I'm
guessing you you took all that stuff and
placed it in Atlas on the AWS Network
this was the right situation for you yes
that that's true so basically I mean we
have been using MongoDB for quite a
while let more than three years you're
our core compatible product but this is
the first time we are using it for the
communication the only difference
between that product and this is that's
kind of like a back office product sure
but this is more like a user interaction
the communication is very critical we
can't afford any downtime and also it
should be more very performant like we
are expecting a low latency and have you
had that situation where you didn't need
to really worry about failures because
you knew Atlas was going to just take
care of it for you yes
so that's the point so the reason we
went to rent with Atlas is one the
maintenance sure and then - we don't
need any database admins and see is
pretty incredible
scalability that's very important for us
because site like us our traffic is
bursty mine's like February 14
Valentine's Day are like during
Christmas holidays these BC increases
profit sure how many use
do you have a little over 80 million wow
that's a lot of people and that's a lot
of JSON documents or documents in
general Wow yep yeah so we handle a
pretty high load and then I'm happy to
say that MongoDB Atlas has been working
great for us oh great in six months
they've been in production and so far so
good so when you get into Chicago you
pitch to me before we start over here
from the Los Angeles yes I'm from Los
Angeles I mean our headquarters is in
Los Angeles cool I was here to list ago
okay um I landed here on 19th and I mean
I tendered yesterday actually we had a
talk pretty good poll awesome about a
harmony messaging platform with the
MongoDB Atlas great it's pretty good so
overall has been the whole MongoDB world
experience for you that's great
a lot lots of content I still can't
parse all the content I have to go home
and you know we want a video ideas and
including this one you'll be able to go
matter of fact as soon as you finish up
you'll be able to watch your video right
on Facebook I love being everyone all of
his friends Vijay is having a great time
I promise you so um as we kind of wrap
this up what I like to do is make sure
that every member who comes over gets
one of these silly fidget spinners
because I love them so here you go and
here's a MongoDB stitch t-shirt and I
want to thank you very much for being
here and being here MongoDB world thanks
a lot thank you have a great day and
we'll be back with more people in just a
few minutes so stick around ask
questions and don't forget if you need
anything maybe want to know more about
MongoDB world just go ahead and put it
in the comment box in Facebook so we'll
see you very</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
