you just met at a tech conference and
you both have availability next week you
might suggest three times and they might
come back and accept one time tomorrow
they realize that they're too busy and
they need to suggest three more times we
wanted to build a virtual assistant that
could handle this pain for you we call
her Amy my name is Matt Casey I'm a CTO
and a co-founder from xai xai is a
startup company that is building an
artificial intelligence-driven personal
assistant to schedule meetings for you
we believe that by introducing a me as a
middle layer between two people with an
invisible interface and absolutely no
friction that we can actually finally
solve this problem Amy will learn about
you over time she learns what you like
to meet people she learns information
about you and the people you meet with
your preferences for what time of day
you like to meet your business hours all
of these things we need to pick up from
the email and store them somehow in the
database which is a very interesting
problem for us that we're constantly
evolving and constantly changing we
decided to use MongoDB because we had
use it at our previous company and we
were already familiar with the tools and
technology and were confident in the
reliability of the database system it
turned out to be good for us because
with machine learning we need to design
our data models but we don't actually
know what that data would look like so
with the schema list database it was
easy to change our scheme is over time
very quickly and try new things we're a
sequel database makes that much harder
right now we're in a closed beta because
we're focused on gathering more data and
improving the accuracy of Amy this
person I've been talking to Amy over
email and didn't realize that she was an
artificial intelligent assistant and
when he showed up to work he brought her
flowers and you know we just got a kick
out of that
is for Amy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
