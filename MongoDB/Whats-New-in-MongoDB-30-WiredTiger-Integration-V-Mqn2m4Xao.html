biggest feature in 30 this is a new
storage engine with many many new
capabilities and ideally should be a
pretty simple plug and replaced upgrade
it should not have too many backwards
compatibility issues as well it should
be fairly transparent to DBS from a
maintenance perspective as well as
developers as to whether they're running
on MF v1 or wired tiger ideally all they
see is the improved performance and
added features so before i get into the
wired tiger details i want to talk a
little bit about the product itself so
why did we make the decision to go with
wired tiger as our very first officially
supported storage engine with this new
storage engine API well wired tiger was
kind of a great fit and that is
addressed many of the weaknesses of
mmp-1 so some of the weaknesses were mmv
one did not store data compressed so
therefore did not utilize this space as
efficiently as possible another
perceived weakness would be the locking
model in MF v 0 which was basically the
2624 to two branches all of our previous
storage engines up until this 30 release
had database level locking until two two
and then prior to that it was a global
walk the difference here is that wire
tire is capable of more concurrent
locking so while we have made
improvements to the MF branch MF v one
supports collection level walking for
high writes throughput use cases wire
tiger is just simply a better fit it
also means that with this finer grained
locking model we can operate in much
more parallel this allows for full
hardware utilization so previously where
CPU is not necessarily fully utilized
now we should be able to max out
powerful machines wire Tigers storage
format also allows for online compaction
so you do not have to worry as much
about fragmentation and there's also a
lot of features many more that I can
possibly name here they are included in
wired tiger that have yet to be ported
over to the MongoDB
the integration however it sort of paves
the way and allows for easy exposure of
these features as we improve integrate
and test them appropriately so this is
just literally the tip of the iceberg as
far as exposing the wire tiger feature
set so some background wired tiger is
the authors are former members of the
Berkeley DB team so they've done this
before been making databases for a long
time and they have a wealth of
experience wire tiger the product and
the team were acquired by MongoDB this
last fall and the standalone engine has
already proven itself to be very
efficient and stable as it's being used
today in production in many large
deployments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
