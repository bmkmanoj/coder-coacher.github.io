spinning because you know what I'm gonna
get ready to kind of end the day and I'm
getting to end the day here at MongoDB
world with one of the cool people that
I've got to meet in just a last few
minutes this is Jocelyn
she works at JP Morgan and I think she's
a little bit more than just a person
that works at a bank though so why don't
you tell us what uh what kind of
software engineering do you do mostly
great so I'm actually a Java developer
okay I actually got my job through JP
Morgan through zip code Wilmington which
is a Java bootcamp in Delaware awesome
um yeah so I've been there for almost a
year and a half now I work in the
mortgage space and I work actually on a
legacy application right now okay up so
you came to MongoDB world on our
diversity scholarship correct and um you
you and I was chatting a bit about one
of the people who is a an incredible
Stewart for that program Danielle yeah
um so have you spent time in the WTC
lounge I did I actually just had lunch
with Danielle and a bunch of the other
applicants that receive everson
scholarships and everybody is so amazing
I can't say enough good things about
Danielle she's just been a rockstar
since like somebody actually reached out
to me on Twitter and asked me to apply
for the diversity scholarship so we do
yeah we what do we do what we do is we
really go out of our way to find people
in our community yeah and because
there's a lot of power to having a black
woman at a tech conference correct other
women of color or other underrepresented
groups that typically have a tougher
kind of road into technology because the
industry really hadn't caught up to the
fact that there's so many people who can
offer so many different things right and
that's what I thought was amazing like
the fact that the only thing I have on
Twitter is the fact there was a software
developer and that somebody somewhere
just saw me and reached out to me was
amazing and then it could have been made
I also like the fact that MongoDB is so
passionate about diversity and inclusion
because I feel like a lot of bigger
fortune 500 companies are just now
starting to get the ball rolling on that
where I feel like MongoDB was like the
first couple one of the first
be back yeah at that in mind one of the
things that's really important to me and
I tell this when I have kind of
one-on-one conversations because you
know I I fit kind of a prototype of what
people used to think the technology
industry was about you know the standard
you know straight white male that was
going and doing the software and you
would call them your software dude or
your DevOps dude or whatever but I think
that we don't need to do that anymore
because there's more than just the
software dude or the DevOps dude there's
an entire world of people that one don't
deserve to just be called dude right
exactly yeah and so what I'm really
trying to do as a person that one really
loves to see everyone part of the
community be a part of it it's just to
say to people you know you've got this
opportunity just to give you an idea
like I I personally like I came to a
MongoDB world maybe four years ago the
first one yeah I just came as a person
to tend it now I work here wow that's
amazing
yeah yeah I love it and and you know
what everybody's got that chance to
maybe try something new and I think it's
one of the benefits of if you think
about a MongoDB gives you the idea to
not gate be structured gives the ability
to stay uh you know freedom to move
around and try different things and
maybe a little bit of that is built into
us as a company yeah I think so and I
think it's a really delicate balance to
find because not only do you want to
make sure you address the fact that
there needs to be a diversity among
women of color and other groups as well
but you also need to make sure that when
those people come into your company that
when they're there that their work and
their passion for their work shows
versus having it be like oh you're woman
so because diversity is not a checkmark
now certainly should never be treated so
yeah and we don't believe that at
MongoDB and one of the best things I can
say that we've done is like I said try
to make sure that everyone has a roadmap
that they can follow to either succeed
as building software of MongoDB or as
people that work at the company I can
tell you we are all given a chance to
succeed so I'm glad to hear that Mongo
is helping you yeah
and we're about to wrap up this entire
day of incredible interviews and you
know MongoDB world we're going to be
doing some of the live keynotes so I
want to go ahead and give you something
that I've been giving out to everyone
but you're getting a special one okay is
he
thank you is copper marks I'm going to
give you one of these silly magic
schools awesome so thank you so much for
