starting out and I started playing with
it a little bit to own a few million
records at it to see how it would work
and I turned about this great you know
no SQL web-scale database that could
pretty much do anything I was like sweet
up and I've been stuffing millions and
millions of rows into my sequel for a
while let's see how MongoDB can handle
up so started out playing with it and
then I started using a little bit more I
toss them some rescue I've tossed them
some stink still text indexing that I'll
talk about a little bit later and
definitely uh definitely held up pretty
well and I was pretty happy with being
it would just kind of jammed JSON data
in there and had to handle it you know
we kind of left the honeymoon period at
one point though and I i started
inserting some data I was like are
50,000 pro six gigs of data for 50,000
profiles it seems like a lot but alright
you know see whatever was kind of what
it does and we got over there and then I
was migrating tens of millions of
documents and we were happy again and
stuff was rockin and then I had some
limits again now our working set
exceeded Graham and I spent several late
nights upgrading our boxes and a flurry
of firefighting and all kinds of stuff
like that but but you know we reconciled
and we came back together and I was able
to give her four thousand operations per
second which he handled pretty well so
mondo and I have had a decent history
it's it's been pretty fun and kind of
want to talk about that and how I've
gone from building just this one middle
single server to the whole
we'll talk about how to choose a shard
key so it requires an index pretty
straightforward it can't include array
values because array values are stored
in such a way that it doesn't give you
the ability to create a range based on
it so it's an exclusion it's essentially
used to distribute the chunks of your
collection between shards so a shard key
defines essentially a continuous range
of values say for example you sharted on
user ID it would start from if it was a
string it would start from a and go
through Z for the first character and
then the second character o do the same
and essentially you'd have a key space
which represented all possible values
you then take that key space break it
down into chunks each of those chunks
might be for example you know the first
letter of the user name which give you
twenty six chunks or 25 chunks or 27
chunks sorry and then those chunks will
be spread around between the shards to
give an even distribution so the
important part about choosing a shard T
is trying to understand what you're
trying to optimize for right why are you
chardon are you sharding for insert
distribution meaning that you're going
to be inserting a bunch of values and
you want to be able to scale out your
disk throughput are you going to be
charting for querying because you wanna
be able to split up your working set and
isolate your queries to each shard are
you going to be you know I'm trying to
optimize your shard key based on update
throughput for example if you're doing
lots of updates but you have very few
inserts and all of these things affect
how the shard system will run under load
over time the interesting thing to
remember is when you're actually adding
values to either ends of this range the
shard key space you'll be writing to one
and only one shard at a time so if you
choose for example a date prefix be
using your shard key as then you'll
always be writing over time to the end
of your key range by increasing it on
the right hand side or left hand side
whether you're increasing or decreasing
the value over time
integration between mother dbm to do but
there what it was kind of in the
experimental use this at your own risk
babe thanks evelopment so we weren't
really crazy about that and so we did
something even more crazy which was we
decided to build our own lap lightweight
MapReduce framework to replace to do so
you write your MapReduce jobs in Python
your input of streams from a MongoDB
collection your output goes to a MongoDB
collection and rather than writing
intermediate bottles to a MongoDB
collection we're just writing these two
local beasts on files and that it's rid
of a lot of the contention that we were
seeing with the monavie MapReduce and
then will you zero in houston's be like
it and we're familiar with it already
for the event logger for job
distribution so not produced how many
people have used metric system kind of
MapReduce framework okay many people are
not familiar with MapReduce at all okay
so quick quick quick what MapReduce does
and this is a little bit of pipeline
pseudocode so the basic idea is you've
got an intricate collection some query
on the template collection filter it and
an outlet collection and you've got two
functions and map and reduce so the
first thing that you do is you find all
the objects in the input collection then
you apply the map function to all of
those objects and you get another list
of objects and then you sort them by
their key and then you group all the
things that have the same key and you
sternums the reduce function here and
then you save those results and the
outlet collection I'm a nice thing about
MapReduce is that there's two parts that
are completely parallel and no
dependencies on anything else that's the
map and a reduced part so the map
function is defined as being you know
isolated from all other map functions
that you can apply it to one object and
it does not affect the results of
another object so you can distribute
that over as many nurses you want the
reduced function is the same thing for
any given key the output of the reduce
function is not dependent on the output
of any other reduced function so it's a
nice way of being able to paralyze
certain classes of problems so that was
so great you got a Geo index how do we
query it so one caveat we're weird right
where we're a big flat coordinate plane
we're basically an idealized case of
geospatial query and indexing so if I
were to ask you which of an ordinary the
globe or a big flat plane was easier to
deal with and any guesses yeah it pretty
much just a flat plane it's much much
easier we don't have to think about
projection issues turns out there are
lots of ways you can project a sphere
onto a flat plane and not everybody
chooses the same one we don't talking
about things like Great Circle distance
calculations polar coordinate systems
pirates so if you're querying actual
location data probably most common
operation for normal people would be
near hey I'm here tomm of the things
that are near me so here you can see me
issuing a query for near a particular
fixed location and i'm using the max
distance parameter in order to say
exactly how many sort of whole units i
want to be so in ordinary geo spatial
coordinates you'd be thinking of sort of
one degree of latitude or longitude as
your your core unit so give me all the
things that are near me with within one
degree of separation or one Radian a
separation with a position in 1010 now
if you want distance there's actually a
separate operator you can use called geo
near which is unfortunately one of a
more low-level operator so you can see
here I'm using it but I'm actually
having to use the command interface on
the Ruby driver to get at it where I'm
saying the command is you know the
command is geo near the collection is
tiles and I want the things that are
you know same other parameters here's my
location here's my max distance but the
advantage of doing this is actually
about a bunch of additional fun date
aback as well it's not just you can see
here in red I'm providing the nearer
itself is actually the Geo hash that was
the result of the query as well as the
the distance for the individual results
so that's you know obviously fairly
useful if you're building a female but I
restaurants within 50 miles of here but
you do have to use the lower level
interface and also again note that the
command is in Ruby here is actually
taking a hash of arguments so right back
to the whole ordered unordered thing be
aware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
