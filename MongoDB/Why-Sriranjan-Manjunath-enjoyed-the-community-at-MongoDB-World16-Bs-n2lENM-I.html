service in India we have about 18
million users and we do about 300
million streams a month then we started
looking at MongoDB right the only reason
we chose MongoDB was because of the
community that was packing here we
looked at a lot of alternatives but
nothing stood like MongoDB I think that
that essence of community is being shown
here as well there are like lots of
people we just talked about MongoDB
they're willing to help you they're
willing to solve your problems in fact
even after my talk there like 10 people
also approached me they wanted to know
more about how they solved it in the
same thing applies to other talks as
well so that what shared sense of
community and the fact that we can share
knowledge and solutions kind of keeps a
MongoDB it is like a level compact all
their college competition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
