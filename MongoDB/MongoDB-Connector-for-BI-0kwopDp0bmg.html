your MongoDB data from a bi tool so it
could be tableau which is what I'm going
to demo today or it could be any other
reporting tool that can speak SQL
because it ends up connecting to the BI
connector which runs between the MongoDB
server or clusters the case may be for
you and the BI reporting tool the
reporting tool connects to the connector
the connector tells us the schema that
you have as you know MongoDB does not
have a fixed schema so we have to
represent something that approximates
the schema of the data that is in your
database and then as the SQL queries
come in from the BI reporting tool or
really any source the BI connector
translates them to MongoDB native
queries or aggregations as appropriate
and when it gets back the results us
beasts on it translates them into SQL to
send that back gob I reporting tool so I
have a pretty small database it's an
extract from Yelp as you know Yelp has
you know businesses there are reviews
and there are users and you can see that
as you would expect these are not flat
documents the data is somewhat
structured in case of users we have
several arrays we have arrays of friends
here's a very popular person these are
all user IDs of their friends we collect
votes about somebody's reviews and of
course reviews are things that will
write to each one is written by a user
pertains to a business and it generally
will have some sort of a text there what
I did was I ran a couple of utilities so
there's a Mongo schema gem utility which
connected to the Yelp data and it
generated the schema file it generates
it in a format we call document
relational definition language and it's
a very simple text kind of a mo like
format which you could edit so if you
know you're gonna be adding fields or if
you want to remove some fields because
you don't need to report on them you
could actually manually or via scripts
adjust that file before passing it to a
utility called Mongo dradle which takes
the DRG
file and loads of schema into bi
connector as well as configuring
appropriate permissions so that you can
authenticate to the connector and it can
authenticate to Mongo D to actually get
the data so let's see what that might
look like here in tableau and I'll show
you how these data sources were set up
so I was connecting to localhost which
is where the BI connector is running I
named the database bi I'm logging in
there as myself now here I pulled out
the user table and you can see that all
of the fields that exist in the user
table have been kind of flattened into a
relational schema but of course because
the data is sparse there are some null
fields so if a field doesn't exist in a
particular record we simply see it
represented as a null which is of course
what a tabular relational schema
requires now we might have wanted to see
what percent of the user is you know
responsible for majority of reviews or
how many reviews on average does a user
right here I just did a very simple
visualization right I showed review
count and the columns here is some of
the number of Records so essentially how
many users have one review while 57,000
users have only written one review now
there's belief 333 thousand users
altogether right you could see that you
know fewer users contributed to reviews
thirty thousand contributed three
reviews and by the time we're into the
double digits of reviews the number of
people that are contributing them is
dropping significantly so you can
imagine how now you can use the power of
tableau to interactively explore what
percent of the users are contributing
what percent of the content right so I
decided to do the same thing for
businesses now here what I did is the
business record includes the longitude
and latitude now going back to the data
source for business I actually added a
filter even though what's being sent is
SQL tableau allows you to specify it in
a pretty nice way right you can select
the field on which you want to filter
and then it offers you a list of values
so I said I only want to see reviews for
the state of Nevada and so of course
all of these reviews are for the state
of Nevada we have longitude and latitude
from that I was able to drag those as
dimensions which automatically picked
you know math visualization
what I did now is I said that the color
should represent an average review so
average stars so color is gonna
represent how high their rating is right
so we could see the darkest green is 5
it's a 5 star rating 4 star rating is
green 3 is going to be that neutral gray
and then 2 stars is red and then 1 stars
really dark red then the sons of each
business because each data point
represents you know essentially
longitude latitude which probably will
represent the number of reviews so you
could see that in this particular
extract of the data the most reviewed
businesses only have you know forty to
forty seven reviews and of course
there's plenty of businesses that only
have a single review because you know
they're scattered somewhere eight
distinct count of reviews one right one
now if you know familiar with Las Vegas
area and you know if you use tableau you
might have been because their conference
in October in Las Vegas you can kind of
tell that this line right here
represents the strip and of course the
businesses that have the most reviews
are all kind of close to the strip
because well that's where a lot of
people go and the more people go there
the more reviews you're gonna have what
else can we do let's see if we can
figure out how many businesses are at
each location now beyond the score ID
that's the business ID in fact so that
it's easier for us to remember that we
can actually come here and we could
rename it right let's call it business
ID just so that's easier to read now it
shows us the remote field name is
underscore ID right so in MongoDB it's a
regular on describe the primary key by
the way when you see dots in names it
means that that's a sub document in
MongoDB so we'll go back here there's
the business ID we dragged it into a
tooltip and now here we will get account
distinct and
see what that does to it so at this
location we have 19 distinct business
IDs and that this fairly large circle we
have 141 obviously and a lot of these
small points have a single business
which just has a single review so the
best way to see how you could use the BI
connector which is going to be available
towards the end of this year with
version 3 - as part of enterprise
advanced is to wait until it's released
and then try it out you don't have to
use it with tableau you could use it
with your own favorite bi tool the BI
connector receives connections and can
speak the same wire protocol that
Postgres database does so if your
reporting tool can connect via ODBC we
will have an ODBC driver that you will
be able to use from your tool to the BI
connector and of course the BI connector
is going to talk to your Mongo cluster
natively using the Mongo DB wire
protocol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
