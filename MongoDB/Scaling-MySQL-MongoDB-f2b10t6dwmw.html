here in the oil okay we'll be talking
about scale out my sequel which one of
you actually use my sequel okay it's a
good thing my secret is a great database
but the problem with databases okay we
which one of you is using ec2 cloud
amazon no okay ec2 is elastic right yeah
that's the cloud that's a computing
cloud everything is elastic everything
no should grow and scale out but with
the project with the database there is a
problem we can scale out application
servers and web servers but we cannot
scale out the database why is that
because the database you know everything
that is stateless can be scaled out lata
basis stateful is the most helpful
machine in the world is it has all the
data and the data is the state we have
to have to deal with the updates to the
data and the and this is the reason why
a generally it's not so easy to scale
our databases and my sequel is a
relational database in the process so
let's see how it can be done in our know
in our world and what scale based can do
about it this is as classic you know use
gets me off l'application we have
the user web application server the
server application servers right there
are load balancers everywhere there is
one database ok let's holds all the data
we've read wave right we end and we have
a lot of data to to deal with what can
we do we can we do we can do a
multi-master replication we can take the
data generate several copies of this
data several databases each one they
hold all the data written rights are
possible on all instances
and there is a lot of you know ongoing
thing synchronizing between between the
note did we actually scale out our read
we did we improve our it not not so not
so much because the data is still is
still there's a lot of data on every
database if I thereabouts database now
it will now have three instance of the
copies of this tent ten terabyte if I
want to act front of celery treats I
have to a lot of data it's bad for it a
lot of users is dead for right now
eventually I have right on every
database but eventually all rights are
going to the store database because
everything is synced there is there are
six arrows here free database six zeros
how many arrows will have with 10
databases you know 90 arrows so every
database have to synchronize all the
other database and this is the this is a
lot of noise in the in the internet work
in the MMA in the tire system also will
have conflicts because if databases roll
roll a blocking when I when I other the
same role instead is saying the two
databases I have conflicts conflicts are
never come and what come is one they
come is big pecs and that when i start
with having conflicts everything grows
and grows and i have more and more
conflict confident solution will not
help me in this situation one another
what would be another way to scale out
my database everything anybody use they
read replicas here replication slaves so
these are my application slaves okay I
have one master which then we draw a
reads and writes I have replication
slaves at doing the reeds okay did I
scalar the scale me or my rights not
really because my rights still goes all
of the m to the same database a master
database this is the bottleneck for the
rights I have less noise in the up in
the system which is good but and I can
offload reads from the master to their
slaves okay did is it really
Cale a read I didn't scary it's because
there's still a lot of data it also data
in each database there are full copies
of the databases so I didn't really
scaled my right normally my read the
solution would be shouting shouting is
the solution to scale reads and scale
rights why is that because right are on
every database the databases are small
the tag is not replicated as a whole on
all other bases its pleated across the
databases so if I have 10 terabytes of
data i can I can have four for four
let's say it's split almost done some
some parts the replicated users are
spread across the databases so right off
Esther reads are faster because the
amount of data is smaller but shutting
is very very a it's very hard to
maintain still a it's consistent it
faster reads faster right a smaller data
and it's unlimited I can really really
redistribute the data add more and more
machines however shouting is Charlie may
be very hard to maintain very hard to
implement when I say shouting we
immediately think about code right I
have to call I have to write it in my
code how do I petition metadata what is
the break matter the best way a somewhat
stable table are split how do i although
I aggregate data from several databases
how do i do order by group by rebalance
the data I start with three databases ed
ed one and then em in several months and
another one how do i do all that it's
very hard to hard to do how do i
maintain transaction structure and
consistency of this because consistent
data is a motive supported is the most
important thing with sync with sequel
databases and when i connect told with
although you're my secret workbench I
want to see the entire picture can I do
that with my code during the shouting so
this is this luis gálvez come from
scale based our tagline is your database
transplant escaped we let you keep your
database we walk in my sequel will look
like my sequel standard my sequel but at
the back we can maintain 10 or
ready databases we do the analysis would
display your data we said sat in front
and give you the picture of a unified
all their bases one we aggregate the
results from several queries we write
the query to that correct database it's
one stop shop for every shouting a
requirements you might have it simply
will take the database and then split it
and then you can scale out in a very
transparent way no code change and no
data migration you are very welcome to
look at our blog right here and that's
about it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
