advocate here in New York City at
MongoDB today we're joined by all the
rooms there are developers they're
creators and they're using MongoDB and
we want to talk about what exactly their
use case is like and give you a little
bit more information so let's give them
a chance to introduce themselves
I'm Alex Shaw I'm backing software
developer from all the rooms I'm Belle
bet Claire I'm a CTO and co-founder of
all the rooms great so let's get started
why don't you tell us a little bit about
all the rooms and what it is you do
all the rooms is a website for people to
find a place to stay that aggregates
every kind of accommodations in the
world from hotels to Airbnb to Groupon
hot wire couchsurfing any kind of
accommodations website that you might be
looking at to find a place to stay we
put it all in one place so you don't
have to spend a lot of time going to
lots of websites to find a place to stay
so I know that most websites have to go
to API is maybe get loads from other
sources how do you get your data on
where your users are going to actually
stay so honored philosophy is we get
data from anywhere that we can okay
which means that some partners give us
data on an API where we get everything
we need when someone makes a search on
our site we do we hit an API and we
merge those results with everything else
we have some partners it's a combination
of a cron job an API some websites don't
have an API but they want us to just do
what we call a real-time web scape where
we have a headless browser that goes to
their their 8 their website parses their
results and sends them back to up to our
website in real-time and then finally
our biggest data source is a web of
crawlers that's similar to Google's
where we have crawlers that are always
going around on the internet looking for
new accommodations that may not show up
in any of the api's or web sites that
we're already looking at great um so how
do you actually write the app what it is
what is it written in and what are you
writing primarily we're usually noticing
no J is for the back pain we're using
angularjs version one for the front-end
the whole app is built in JavaScript and
we're integrating MongoDB and one
supposed to be for more fixed stops
great oh but what's a normal day for you
like well I normally
and fixing some minor bugs in JavaScript
and from the providers I'm integrating
new providers usually we have a lot of
fixes because providers usually change
the API or change the webpage and we
usually have to fix that gotcha
so what made you decide the document
model say over using a traditional SQL
or did you try SQL so we started out
with the document model and we're really
thrilled that that's how we started ok
when we began we didn't actually know
how the data would be structured what
the biggest challenges would be and we
found out that we ended up intereting
our data storage philosophy several
times before we were able to finish our
first MVP if we had made a choice that
constrained us or made it harder to
iterate around how we structured our
data then we would have never hit that
first milestone and successfully raised
great so what's the hosting environment
that you're putting all the rooms in we
started out with AWS and we've stuck
with it we're really happy with it it's
a good way to host Mongo great so we've
talked a little bit about all the rooms
let's take a look at what the
application is learn our white board and
then hopefully we'll learn even more so
let's get started
hey we're back and now it's time to
start our whiteboarding session so what
we're going to do is go over a little
bit of the infrastructure that all the
rooms uses and then we're going to talk
a bit more about MongoDB and the
implementation so let's get started um
so wants to show me from the top what I
guess the blob of a cloud that we'll see
obviously and then once you take us down
there from after the blob okay sure so
you know be it the way I'm going to
explain this and in order for you to
understand the choices we made some of
the more interesting choices we made
sure I have to give you a bit of a foil
okay of what we decided not to do which
is sort of the architecture of your
traditional website that handles online
accommodations okay I used to work in a
couple other travel companies and I know
what the traditional architecture is and
what the major choices are and it's
because I spotted some some bad choices
in there that we decided to go with what
we have and you have to understand that
to see where we made interesting choices
it's got to fail before you succeed
that's what you're saying right so
you're a typical accommodations website
whether it's a meta search like kayak or
trivago or whether it's a hotel site
like booking or whether is Airbnb has a
massive database that has a list of all
the properties in their system and then
they have lots of services that wrap
around that database that try to protect
it from getting overloaded with all the
things that need to happen loading in
data taking out data and those services
get filtered up to the customers who are
able to access the critical list of
hotels or or apartments that that people
care about so this is kind of like a
monolith if you're saying it's a it's a
data monolith and it's possible that
they have a service that's hitting the
data monolith for different purposes of
going in going out or you know doing
analytics but those services are there
to protect it overloading of the
monolith okay now the challenge with
that is that you have to know a lot
before you can build anything you also
have to spend a lot of work making sure
that all of your data can align so for
example if I get a hotel from this place
and I get a hotel from that place I need
to be able to put them together into the
correct place in that database
is they need to sit there and I need to
know ahead of time when two hotels are
the same hotel so that I can serve the
correct data about the hotel to the
customer so not a lot of normalization
done beforehand you've got a lot to work
with yes so when we when we started our
site we thought we want to have
essentially an unlimited amount of data
sources with very little overhead per
data source which means we didn't want
to spend a lot of time figuring out how
to massage everything into a single data
format gotcha
and we also would never be able to know
until we built it what would that data
format be so if we had tried to we'd be
iterating the data format and going back
and changing things and saying oh we
have a new provider we have to go back
so what we did is we came up with a
model that looks like this there's one
provider a provider for us is sort of
like a source of accommodations one
provider would have a service that
includes a sort of node component that
handles the data access and the data
response and then a manga collection for
that provider or a sort of document
within a collection that has handles
multiple providers if you're accessing
this with the standard nodejs
driver correct yeah yeah Center so one
provider gets a document and we have
each provider gets their own document
and then we have one thing that's called
the grouper the grouper handles the
merging of all of these guys and the
grouper is accessed in real-time this
was like a scheduler it's not a
scheduler it's something that's there to
help Kalle all of the results it's sort
of how if you go to Google and you do a
search they don't run that whole search
on one server but they have one server
that's handling this search making a
choice as to which thing to put at the
top like the brain of the application
gotcha it's almost like dealing way we
do in MongoDB DB with sharding and the
meta services that were the metadata
services you're not necessarily just
searching the entire database collection
you're looking and saying go find around
all these
Computers where the right data sources
that's right gotcha and one of the big
innovations of the grouper is that the
grouper does the work that is happening
here
in these services but instead of
happening in in when the data is loaded
it happens after the services have come
up with the results okay and that means
that we can then merge hotels that are
the same at that moment so if five hours
ago a hotel didn't exist but then they
put up a shingle and said here we are
you can book us next time you go to Las
Vegas our site sees that hotel for the
first time ever no human being is
looking at it no one is making sure that
it slots into a database but the grouper
sees it and it says that hotel there is
coming from two different places today
and we're going to merge them and give
you you know the lowest price for the
hotel across multiple providers in real
time so the groupers job is to do the
collation and organizing that a
standardized data model would have done
if that were the model we had chosen
gotcha
it's cleaning up data that's already
been somewhat cleaned by the services
that wrap around a diversity of document
types
now the grouper communicates through a
socket connection to individual
customers in the cloud and over the
internet who are you know looking for a
place to stay and the reason that
they're seeing it through a socket is we
also have an angularjs app that's pretty
low overhead and doesn't require much
work from a web server that just handles
the sort of like chrome of the
experience so we use this scary word a
few minutes ago about our database but
it looks to me like you've written an
app that's actually using micro services
as opposed to a model of the gap you
tell me a little bit why you chose micro
services as opposed to writing just one
application the why is because it's easy
to manage all of the collections as a
separate services service right so if we
had like a single collection we couldn't
have as many providers as we have today
you know almost 60 providers now and the
way we manage is this provider has ten
parameters this provider has 60
parameters because it gives us so many
information so it helped us a lot with
managing information as the providers
manages great so how many micro services
did you need to write specifically for
the all the rooms application you know I
I really have lost count and if we had
thought of that in advance as you know
something that we had to manage and
think about how many micro services were
there and a half we it would defeat the
purpose of micro services micro services
gives us the flexibility to decide how
to allocate resources how to handle data
a diversity of data how to schedule
things that have different types of
schedules and resource constraints and
each of them gets to gets to sort of
live on its own so one of the things I
wanted to talk about because we've been
talking about multiple data sources
let's talk about your your documents
you've got what we talked about earlier
you've got this decision that you made
to use the document model coming into it
why did you have to have this
particularly can you explain a little
bit about the data sources sure so um
there's there's a variety of things that
make the data that comes from different
providers sort of inconsistent a hotel
room is a very different beast from an
Airbnb rental um a Hotwire option so
sort of like a three-star Hotel in
Atlanta where you don't know the name of
the hotel
is different from a hostel in Bermuda
that where you're staying in a dorm room
and you're one of 15 beds each of these
has different factors that you want to
store and you can never know in advance
when you are you know looking out across
the whole world of accommodations what
are the sort of critical things that
you're going to need mmm so as you're
growing you need the flexibility to add
things and to store them in unique ways
and one of them one of the best examples
of that is calendars so for example one
partner could have data that tells you
what is the availability of a room in
the future in the form of block out
dates these dates you can't stay in and
they send us a long list of all the
block out dates or ranges of block out
dates whether or not this
of individual dates the ranges another
partner might just give us rules rules
could be things like Mondays are out or
you can only have stays that are from 3
to 8 days and here's the pricing rules
for these combinations of dates each of
the types of data that we get from our
partners are completely incompatible
they didn't talk to each other
beforehand and normalize how all this
data would be stored so I am sorry so I
realized in a traditional relational
database you're talking about lots and
lots and lots of places you'd have to
keep all this unnormalized data yeah
either you would have to have a
different table for everyone and the
different access method for all these
tables and a lot of you know crazy joins
between the sort of metadata that's in
common and the data that's not uncommon
by the time you've gotten all through
that you have a really difficult set of
kind of interrelated queries to handle a
given provider and it's not obvious
looking at it where something is stored
where to look how to get it back out
again
and from like an infrastructure
standpoint there's ton of overhead
involved with that if you're constantly
making those big queries to relational
database you have to have a gear to
actually support it - well the great
thing about the document model with
these sort of like diverse calendars is
that you can do things like retrieve
properties based on availability by
indexing sort of which dates are
available within an encounter on a list
of dates so it's sort of like an
existence of a ray element filter or on
a range filter there's a whole variety
of ways of putting this data so that
it's retrievable in a fast way and the
speed of retrieval is something that you
don't have to think so much about if the
document model lets you come up with the
right index for each type and just mix
it all together whereas in a relational
world you really have to think a lot
more ahead of time about how you're
going to structure data across
especially if it's across multiple
tables if you want fast retrieval
combined with a diversity of complex
sort of numerical data that helps to
define pricing and availability you're
dealing with much more rigid schemas and
spending time planning where as opposed
to like I know MongoDB
you can kind of on-the-fly determine a
new schema and just start writing data I
guess in the end you're dealing with
complex data and MongoDB sounds really
capable of handling all that complex
data yeah wait we believe that we have
the world's largest database of
accommodations and it's is growing fast
and nobody's anywhere near us and we we
think that's partly due to the fact that
we decided to go at such a flexible
model sure so house performance been one
of the things we want to talk to people
about when it comes to databases how the
performance has been overall what have
you seen we're using both at MongoDB 2.6
and what would it be 3 through I believe
and the improvement the improved
improvement overall to MongoDB 3.2 it's
amazing it's almost twice or three times
better and we're planning on migrate all
of our infrastructure to MongoDB tree
but it's a long way there we have so
many documents so many sillens with
three we started really focusing on
using water tiger or using wire tiger on
there yeah great yeah a tiger did you
feel the compressions really helped with
the total size of the document great
that's awesome
all right so we've kind of taken a basic
look at all the rooms application today
we've talked about how they built it
some of the decisions they've made and I
really think it sounds like a great
opportunity you have out there with so
many different providers of data want to
thank you for coming today is there
anything we should know about all the
rooms that you think we we have coming
up so if you're looking for a place to
stay
check it out and if you're looking for a
really interesting challenge and you
want to help other people find a great
place to stay
look us up we're looking for great
JavaScript developers all the time
awesome and also remember if you haven't
tried Mambo DB yet you can go right to
Mongo DB comm slash download you can
grab the binary for any operating system
you're working with get started right
away so thanks for joining us and we'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
