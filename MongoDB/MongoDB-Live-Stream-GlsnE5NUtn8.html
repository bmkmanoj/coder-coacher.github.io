welcome to MongoDB world and once again
we are talking to partners we're talking
to developers we're talking to people
who are building and doing awesome
things with MongoDB right now I got Matt
he's from chef software and if you don't
know what chef is you're probably doing
something wrong with DevOps
that's it that's a bold statement Jay
but I'll take it I'll take it there's a
lot of great offerings but you yeah you
got a great one yeah we've uh you know
chef has been part of the DevOps space
for a long time when we think about you
know we kind of you know kind of cut our
teeth with what we used to call
configuration management but much rather
refer to now as infrastructure as code
really it's about treating anything as
code like I love everything s code
everything should be code in my mind and
that's that's a big way we think at chef
so first of all just to kind of think
about it like what does it mean to treat
something as code sure it means that
it's virginal it means that it's
testable
and hopefully tested right and also that
it's abstract right here you know that's
what we that's what code is right so in
modular is so important nowadays and so
if we treat our infrastructure that way
you know why can't we treat other things
that way why can't we treat maybe our
compliance or our security sure and so
that's when we think about things like
inspect which is a testing framework we
have which is thinking about being able
to take like your whether it's your
formal or informal compliance regime and
being able to test for that in a
codified way and actually specifically
around Mongo we have an inspect profile
that pretty much goes and we take all
the best practices that MongoDB says the
way that things should be configured and
this inspect profile will check your
machines your nodes and say is this
right or whether they're containers
whether they're me arms or the physical
doesn't matter yeah testing I think what
we all talk about how test-driven
development is important I've spent my
hours cutting my teeth on you know
r-spec and having you know making sure
my my my cookbooks look right and it's
both lifted properly and that the code
actually works so I think the one of the
great things about like my
the chef and all these other big pieces
of software their portions of a lot of
companies DevOps story yeah it's really
cool like to have chef here along with
us because you know that you end up
becoming of potentially having people
who want to use both and want to ask the
questions how am I going to do this with
ops manager and chef so it's really
great you know MongoDB world we bring
people like yourself here um how has
been the experience like just meeting
people and who are interested both chef
and Mongo it's been really interesting
and I think for me especially just kind
of seeing the the different kinds of
folks who are here and what their
approaches and usually because you know
the first question when you when you're
anybody is working a booth you know even
if you have name recognition or whatever
unless you're basically probably IBM or
Microsoft sure someone deferred you know
a lot of times a question the first
question out of someone's mouth is
what's chef yeah yeah how are you or we
like I say what's Mongo Dai I get you
you see the person's approaching the the
booth and you're like I can see the
what's chef question in your eyes so we
have some of that also apparently there
was a - I'm unfamiliar with but I don't
know if that was one of your tools or in
the marketplace called Mongo chef Oh
somebody else but it actually caused a
little bit of confusion that's there so
I'm sure but what's been really
interesting is to see when folks talk
about the the need to scale Mongo you
know again this is uh when you talk
about treating your infrastructures code
this is the thing that lets you have
predictability to be able to say you
know what I need to knock out like 50
more nodes right now and get them up and
make sure everything's cool and
consistent and obviously consistency
across your infrastructure matters a ton
so people we've seen folks it really
depends on where you're at in your
automation journey in the conversation
we've been having because we have three
open source offerings that we've been
talking sure we have chef which is like
kind of our flagship offering which is
that infrastructure is code sure kind of
like how we have Mongo DD community
right out the door like everybody could
download it same thing with chef and
that's the thing we've been doing since
I mean we renamed the company after it
so clearly it's important to hey we did
the same we were 10 gen now
Oh Divi you were what was the ops code
that became Chevy sure googling didn't
get harder with the name change right no
the i/o at the end makes it so anyway uh
just to kind of wrap up but I really
appreciate your time here and everybody
that's kind of been able to come and sit
with me I like to give them a little
something
Oh a little something to say thank you
so we got these silly fidget spinners
here at MongoDB world I want to give you
one of these and thank you a stitched
t-shirt thank you very much awesome
so thanks for your time and if you
haven't already go check out chef it's
one of the most incredible ways to
deploy software quickly repeatably and
you know what it works great with
MongoDB so we'll see you again in a
little while we're gonna have more
interviews with more amazing people
we'll see you here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
