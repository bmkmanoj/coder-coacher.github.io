providers of gaming experiences we
produce computer games such as Final
Fantasy Tomb Raider hitman and many many
more nowadays when we release a game
every single game is connected to the
internet and dust something online my
job is to make sure that this something
happens nice and smoothly originally
when we started to do anything online
and with with the game data it was all
running on a traditional relational
database and it was fine for a few
titles we did at the beginning but as we
try to do more and more we suddenly
discovered they didn't scale well at
certain amount of data suddenly
everything became slow and very
cumbersome and difficult to add more
computing power to it we had this
massive growth in the data produced by
our games and the relational leader was
just couldn't cope anymore that's when
we discovered MongoDB what made us to
decide for mongodb was the speed of
processing large amount of data
scalability and ability to do rolling
upgrades and they have no downtime
whatsoever physical hardware obviously
cannot scale up and down but in law is
very easy this is where cloud manager
from MongoDB comes into play every
single year we release a game we am
surprised how much data it can generate
for example rise of Tomb Raider the
latest to my game is able to generate
roughly around half of terabyte of data
per day it's just completely somewhere
beyond our expectations we never thought
we will get that much data in one day
cloud manager helps us to manage all
this and run all these operations in
quite small team without cloud manager I
think I would just spend all my life
working on these things back in all the
days of relational databases we we used
to run query for weeks and now the
queries are
to execute in few minutes this is our
like faith year of running MongoDB
during those years we literally had zero
downtime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
