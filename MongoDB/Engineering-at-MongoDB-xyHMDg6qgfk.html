are building platforms out there and the
ones that are about doing anything new
interesting or disrupting the market so
what I really get excited about within
MongoDB is the ability to innovate the
company provides a lot of freedom to
experiment and try to solve a problem
creatively it's easy to follow the path
or problem it's a lot harder to sit back
and take the problem down to first
principles and really try to address the
question of like what is going on here
what is wrong here and how can we target
the actual problem MongoDB is a
next-generation general-purpose database
so for any kinds of technologies you're
building whether it's a website any sort
of new software generally you'll need a
database to store all of the user data
Mongo DB is interesting because it's
designed for modern application so the
application people are building today my
favorite part of being an engineer at
MongoDB is there's a really great white
culture we always get to work on new
challenging tasks freedom the freedom to
be creative the freedom to try out ideas
the freedom to experiment with your
peers and to find something out that you
didn't think you knew the day before to
learn the challenge to be inspired every
single day you find out about a new use
case a new interesting thing someone's
doing some people are you know
calculating the genome and we happen to
be storing and analyzing that data in
MongoDB some people are making really
cool video games sometimes in my day to
day life I'll be using something and
then later that day I'll find out that
it's powered by MongoDB we really work
together and try to find solutions and
discuss them in our meetings and we do
have really great leadership who listens
to our input to features our feedback
and really tries to make you grow in the
company and really tries and supports
you achieving your own goals so you
really feel like you're part of the team
from a leadership perspective I think we
have some of the best people in the
industry really leading the company in a
good direction both from a technology
standpoint and the business standpoint
or does it work for a product that
people recognize and something that I
recognized that I used and something
that was just valuable to me and
but I know you really feel like you you
member of the team and you do have
impact as an engineer MongoDB is our
most fun place I've ever worked at
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
