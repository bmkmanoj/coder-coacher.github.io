i'm going to show you how we can deploy
a shorted cluster to amazon web services
in just a few minutes okay i'm already
logged in to mms and now i'm going to
create a cluster i do this by starting
the setup process and there are three
different ways i can deploy MongoDB i
can deploy it locally on my laptop or i
can deploy it on AWS or i can put it in
any data center if i first get the
servers running in that data center and
start the automation agent today we're
going to show you how to do it via AWS
now if you want to deploy MongoDB in AWS
you can have us provision the servers
for you or you can provision them
yourself i would like mms to provision
the servers for me because it'll be
easier that way and now i choose what
type of MongoDB deployment i want i'm
going to choose a shortage cluster and
i'm going to call this shortage cluster
new day and i'm going to have it contain
three shards with three nodes Bechard
and will call the shards shard we're
going to put data in / data we're going
to use only nine servers and all and
that's about it let's go forward now you
have the option of using mms to backup
your data this is continuous back up
with point and time recovery and I'm
going to say yes now normally that will
require a credit card you don't need a
credit card if you just want to get mom
going to be running without backup but
you'll need to put a credit card in if
you want to use the backup system and I
already did that so we're just going to
move through this screen and then we
have to put our AWS credentials in now
I've done that previously so that you
don't have to put them in but this is
your access key in your secret key you
can create a set of keys that has only
the limited privileges you want to grant
to mms i'm going to go forward and now
it wants a name for the actual ec2
servers i'm going to call them DB
servers and i'm going to choose us east
i'm going to run on a bunt too i'm going
to choose a m3 extra large we put 100
gigabytes for server this is mostly a
demo and then i'm going to choose my
default VPC and let it spread them
amongst the subnets and you choose my
default security group which i did set
up beforehand and aww
it's set up to allow the MongoDB port
range in and also to allow ssh to the
machines all right we're going to
continue forward and at this point it's
going to provision these nine instances
of ec2 it's going to actually spin up
servers in amazon's ec2 ok now it's
provisioning the servers and we're going
to skip forward until the servers are
completely deployed what's going to
happen here is it's going to start a
server using Amazon's API and then it's
going to run the automation agent on
each server and also install any
security patches that are needed on the
server not to take just a few minutes
and this continue button will be
available once it's finished all right
now all the servers are up and the
monitoring agents are responding so
we're going to continue forward now at
this point we're going to review and
deploy our MongoDB cluster and mms has
made some decisions about what's going
to go on each of these servers now if
you remember we have nine servers and we
asked for three charged three nodes each
three nodes in each replica set some of
these shards are going to have multiple
things like the backup agent on them and
the Mongo s server on them and that's
fine with us we can move those around if
we wanted and now I'm going to go
forward and deploy it and while we're
waiting for that you can read some
information but how to use mms and how
to go from edit mode to view mode to
edit our cluster our deployment if we
want we're going to go forward and we're
just reading more information about this
alright and now our cluster has been
deployed so this is fantastic our
cluster is deployed and we can now
connect to it so let's do that let's
view and connect to our servers so to do
that tells us to go to servers and get
information about them so we'll do that
here we go let's go into view mode here
so we can see our servers and if we
click on one of them we're going to see
some monitoring data of course there's
nothing quite there yet because we
haven't done much with this database yet
let's click on servers and see these
servers ok so now we're going to connect
to one of these servers so I'm going to
go here and see where there is a Mongo
asks which is where I'd connect to it I
can see there's a Mongo ass process
running at 27 017 on this server so I'm
going to click on connect I'm going to
get the hostname and now I'm going to go
to the terminal and connect to that I
pasted the hostname in here that i got
from mms and it told me the port number
that the Mongol Wes was running on
7017 so I'm going to connect to it and
now i'm going to put something into this
test collection and now i've inserted a
document in now if I look in the
collection called world I can find the
document and there it is the message
hello world alright so in just a few
minutes here what we've done is we've
successfully created a 3 shard cluster
of nine total servers with monitoring
and back up and we can see the backups
running here and we can see that the
backup is started and it's currently
doing the initial sync and if we go here
to the deployment page we can check out
any of these servers and we can get
monitoring data on them and for instance
we can look at the memory map virtual
memory total memory use the cues inside
the system cursors other information and
a lot of different granularities this
screen is a little bit small so the
monitoring get is not quite showing up
but you can see that with mms in just a
few short minutes you can get a large
charted cluster running and now if you
wanted to upgrade it or change its
configuration or change it to a
different version that long ago DB you
could do that in just a few clicks as
well I hope you've enjoyed this
demonstration of M&amp;amp;MS to get started go
