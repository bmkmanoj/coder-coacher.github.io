athletes and what that means is we're
looking for somebody that has committed
themselves to the sales profession
they've shown success in their career
and they're looking for that next great
challenge it doesn't matter which
department you reside in the
collaboration and the teamwork and the
camaraderie is palpable everybody here
is trying to help each other and work
towards a common goal and that there's
opportunity for growth and leadership
and growing spaces within the company a
big part of what we believe at MongoDB
is we are all in this to get better
together and so it's my job to develop
my sales leaders so that they can be
better for their sales team what's so
intriguing about MongoDB is a few things
the first is the market the total
addressable market is somewhere in the
ballpark of 36 to 40 billion dollars
it's the biggest and software so the
market is huge and ripe for disruption
successful sales reps at MongoDB have
one thing in common we work really hard
if you bring that work ethic and you
apply yourself to what we're doing and
the value that it brings to our
customers there's no doubt you're gonna
be successful we are here to work hard
but have fun while we're doing it and to
really make a difference with our
customers so the really cool thing about
MongoDB is that it's really not hard to
understand the value proposition MongoDB
really facilitates great business
outcomes for our customers I think what
sets MongoDB apart is how much they
invest in their people and I could tell
that they invested a lot in me and in my
co-workers from day one we spend just
over six times the industry average on
sales reps in their first year just in
development here at MonaVie B I'm here
because I believe that MongoDB is the
place to be from our company vision to
our leadership to having the
industry-leading technology that's going
to enable us to help our customers meet
their strategic initiatives and
accomplish their mission I'm proud of
the company that I work for and for the
values that we have and that we actually
live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
