a developer advocate for MongoDB and we
are here once again in MongoDB worlds
2017 and I'm joined right now by Erich
Fromm Amadeus so Eric you work as a DBA
if I'm right yes yes I work as Mongo
database administrator great automata
was data processing in Germany Oh
awesome
and also I'm also I have that second
function I'm also Mongo technology on
that otama Davis Oh awesome so it sounds
like you got a lot to do yeah so how big
would you say one of your if you feel
comfortable how big is one of your
largest deployments of MongoDB how is
their largest deployment which I saw or
say like from a gigabyte or terabytes
okay in-house we have a very huge one
okay the biggest database has at this
moment of 70 terabytes whoa oh yeah whoa
so 70 terabytes um have you found that a
backup strategy is it in an issue or
what if you've really found to help you
out actually what you we are using but
using ops manager
oh okay great oh we connected everything
to ops managers actually edit phones at
this moment we have three ops managers
okay yesterday I had the talk here
because I was a speaker at Mongo that's
awesome about about our strategy how we
use of manager well that's great because
a lot of organizations they take on
databases and they don't really know how
to work with a backup strategy ensuring
reliability it sounds like you've really
taken that as a big part of what you do
every day is that right yeah yeah antic
Holdings my opinion ops manager is
perfect to to back up in Mongo
awesome so what language do you
primarily work with primary I work in
English oh about our work computing
languages okay okay so I'm using Python
Python is fantastic
people love it yeah it's fantastic
because you know what because the ops
manager is providing you ATI
you have a very nice API and you can
automate everything pretty easy well
have you got a chance to play with Atlas
yet in not know well one thing that's
really cool about Atlas is you get that
kind of same api's and stuff like that I
got to work a lot with it and I love the
idea of just like when I need a database
it just I'm ready you know and an
obvious manner ops manager does provide
a lot of that same experience especially
for people who want to keep everything
in-house because I'd imagine it's 70
terabytes thinking about the cloud is a
little rough well you know we are going
to just wrap up all right thank you very
much for coming by everybody that comes
over here I like to give them one of
these fun spinners and a MongoDB stitch
t-shirt so thank you very much thank you
very much and to all his friends in
Poland did you say they were at I start
you say you have friends in Poland or
Germany yes yes yes now they are
watching me I want to I want to say
hello to cachaça boof maybe she is
watching me well hello and hello thanks
for watching everybody we'll be back in
a little bit later I think after 2
o'clock with even more interviews with
more people were either developers
partners or just people who want to
scream to the world about how great
MongoDB is so thanks for joining us
again we'll be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
