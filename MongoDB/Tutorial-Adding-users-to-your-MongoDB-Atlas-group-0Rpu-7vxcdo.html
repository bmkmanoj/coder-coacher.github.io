tutorials my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate here with MongoDB and
I'm here to teach you more on how to get
started using our database as a service
Atlas today we'll go over how to invite
another member of your team to your
Atlas group inviting a new member of
your team to your Atlas group is as easy
as entering an email address and setting
a role only owner users can invite
additional members to verify your user
role click settings click users as you
can see our role is an owner
this means we have proper permissions to
add an additional user to add our new
user
let's click add user the add invite user
window gives you the ability to state
what additional users are permitted to
access your app list group simply enter
the email address of the user that you
would like to invite to your group then
select the role owners can launch edit
and terminate Atlas clusters be sure
you're fine with your new user having
this access if you're uncertain you can
always select read-only this role will
not allow any modifications to be made
to the cluster in this case we'll be
using owner once you finalize entering
these bits of information click Add
invite you'll be prompted for a
two-factor verification go ahead and put
in your information then click Add
invite if the user hasn't been found
within an Atlas group they'll get an
email stating that they've been invited
one important part of to remember is
that the user cannot actually log on to
the MongoDB shell these configurations
are actually managed separately in the
cluster security user section your owner
users will be able to create these
database user accounts if required by
your application if you run into issues
getting the actual email go ahead make
sure you check your spam folder it
happens from time to time if you're
running into any Atlas issues contact
our support team at any time click the
support link in the lower left of your
Atlas interface or go to MongoDB comm
