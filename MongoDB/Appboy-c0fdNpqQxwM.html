and CEO of app boy app boy is a
marketing automation platform for mobile
apps we work with some of the biggest
apps in the App Store to help them
understand what their users are doing in
their apps and then based on their
behavior and demographics target them
for automated messaging so using MongoDB
is our main data store to track hundreds
of millions of users and devices across
all the applications that are in we also
heavily use pre aggregate analytics to
take billions of data points that we get
from our customers every month to
transform it into very fast responsive
web dashboard for our customers to view
what's going on in their app real time
at MongoDB world I'm gonna talk about
how Apple has grown tremendously on the
MongoDB platform we started just
collecting a few million data points a
day on behalf of our customers and now
we're collecting billions of data points
every month across hundreds of millions
of users and devices for some of the
biggest apps in the App Store and we've
done basically everything when it comes
to the scaling we started vertically we
grew up we shard it out we split onto
different clusters we've introduced
multi-tenancy so we put customers there
in databases we've tried a lot of
different things I'm going to share all
the best practices that we've learned as
we've grown to accommodate the scale
that we have and also I'm going to teach
everyone how we use pre our gated
analytics to take these billions of data
points each month and make it very
responsive and snappy on a dashboard
what I'm most excited about at MongoDB
world is learning from other
technologists how they're solving their
problems with MongoDB because MongoDB
schemas are so flexible you really have
a lot of room for creativity and how to
solve your problem and so when I've gone
to previous MongoDB conferences I get
some of the the best experiences out of
just listening to what people are doing
so I can apply those learnings to a boy
and to other projects that I'm working
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
