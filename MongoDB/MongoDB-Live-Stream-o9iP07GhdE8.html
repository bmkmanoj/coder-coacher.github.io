very busy and once again we're
continuing our interviews with different
people that are here and enjoying our
conference so I'm joined by Samantha and
Samantha is with Erding and she works in
the machine learning field correct yeah
machine learning engineer awesome so one
of the big things that you told me you
want to really talk about today and I
think it's really important is hearing
about how women are getting better
access to technology uh resources and
being part of the industry how do you
feel that while you've been here that
kind of experience has kind of been made
a little bit more available to you yeah
so I would definitely say at MongoDB
what I think is awesome is that you guys
are really focusing on diversity so you
have this woman in transcoders lounge
and you're really promoting diversity in
this space because as a woman in a
male-dominated field you go most of the
time you're surrounded by men all the
time yeah we're not always all that
great and one of the things that MongoDB
really does try to do is really create
this um experience where everyone feels
welcome and I'm glad to hear that you
felt welcome while you're here um have
you met anybody that really like maybe
say wow I'm so glad I've been here yeah
so I think it's been pretty awesome that
in these sessions it's more of a
conversation between the developers at
MongoDB so as a machine learning
engineer I use PI Mongo Oh yesterday I
met the three people on the PI Mongo
team we're building out the libraries
and I said to them oh you're celebrities
that's great oh so you're writing mostly
in Python right yeah so what kind of
brought you to that Python with MongoDB
in your like I guess path to being a
machine learning expert because that's
what I'm gonna call it your neck spurt
okay I would say that I needed to
calculate some location-based features
and MongoDB has this awesome 2d
geospatial sphere index okay combining
Python which is the language I code all
basically everything
I was just using your PI Mongo library
was super powerful and creating some of
the features for my awesome and you have
any kind of apps that you feel recently
kind of want to brag about and tell the
world apps that I've built no no okay
well you know one of the things that you
get an opportunity to do while you're
here along EDD world is get ideas from
other developers have you found that
maybe there's been some interesting
developers that you like said wow that
was cool I maybe I'll try it out um I
don't know necessarily about apps that
I'd like to build but I was really
fascinated yesterday yesterday by the
keynote from the lady from IBM okay and
how she was talking about how it's
really important to start using data
signs for social good yes and that's
something that I'm really passionate
about and definitely want to get high I
can definitely tell that the more that
we actually are able to accomplish for
just beyond businesses and doing things
for individuals to make a better place I
think is why we want to make software
better and also to make it inclusive for
everyone yeah so I thank you very much
Nathan for your time and everybody
that's been coming here been getting one
of these silly fidgets bitters and a
t-shirt that has stitch on it which
stitch is pretty awesome and I think you
should give it a shot because it could
probably make some pipe lines really
easy so thank you very much thank you
and thank you for coming to MongoDB well
thank you so we're going to be back just
like before we'll have more interviews
we'll have more conversations and we'll
be taking any information and request
questions you have in our comment
section send them away and we'll do our
best to get you an answer right up so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
