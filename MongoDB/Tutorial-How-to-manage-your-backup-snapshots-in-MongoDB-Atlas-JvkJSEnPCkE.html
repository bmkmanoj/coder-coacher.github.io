tutorials my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate and I'm here to teach
you more about how to get started using
our database as a service Atlas today
we'll go over restoring in MongoDB Atlas
backup
while MongoDB does have replica sets to
ensure both high availability and
redundancy we still require backups to
ensure protection from data loss whether
it's downloading a local copy to do some
development tests or restoring directly
to your atlas cluster there's a lot of
value in keeping backups of your data
you can only enable backups with a paid
Atlas cluster our m0 cluster does not
support our automatic point-in-time
backup service to be certain you have
backups enable choose this option when
you create a new cluster or you can
enable at any time by going to
configuration scrolling down and
selecting enable backup you can see I've
already got it done from my cluster but
I have the ability to toggle it on and
off to get started we'll click the
backup icon and then we'll be able to
see after clicking our actual replica
set name a list of snapshots that we can
have access to actually restore or query
Atlas also provides queryable backups
this allows you to query a specific
backup snapshot you can use queryable
backups to restore subsets of data
within the MongoDB cluster compare
previous versions of data against the
current data identify the best point in
time to restore system by comparing data
from multiple snapshots next you'll just
hit query and you can begin the process
of querying a snapshot you can use our
binary called tunnel to access this
queryable backup tunnel handles the
security and authentication you also
have the ability to access your cluster
without using this tunnel however you
will have to download the certificate
files for x.509 authentication so now
that we know how to query the backup
snapshots we can move on to restoring
them so since we're going to perform a
restore of one of our snapshots we need
to decide whether we want to restore
directly to the cluster we have or if
you want to download the data locally
I'll walk you through both of these
options in this case we're going to go
ahead and restore records which is our
cluster so all we have to do first is go
to backup after we click backup we click
the name of our replicas set in this
case it's records - R - 0 now we'll
select a specific one that we want to
restore and this snapshot will pick
because it's fine so we'll pick our
snapshot and then we'll click restore my
snapshot great so we select the record
shard and now all we have to do is click
restore
and all you have to do really is track
the restored history by clicking restore
history and you'll see the process begin
it'll start restoring right back to your
MongoDB cluster here in Alice so all you
have to do is sit and wait and they'll
begin the process of restoring and
getting your Atlas cluster online again
you may see an election of a new primary
this is happening because there'll be a
rotating process between the primary and
the secondary as it goes and deploys
your restored database to verify that
your restore has been completed you can
go ahead click on the backup section go
to restore history you can then go ahead
and look at the submitted at time the
time stamp associated with in the
delivery method in this case our
automated target was the records cluster
we went ahead and had it restored there
and that's that no more work to be done
and no place to actually need to do the
restore to it goes right to your cluster
Atlas also lets you restore data from a
scheduled snapshot or from a selected
point in time for replica sets you can
restore from selected points in time for
shorter clusters you can restore from
check points between snapshots a
snapshot contains your binary data files
you can use this snapshot to run local
copies of your database for further
development if needed we default
snapshots of your data to be taken every
six hours but this can be modified aside
from snapshots provide the ability to
point in time restores these restores
can be done from either a specific date
and time or even based on an OP log
entry along with the offset today will
restore a snapshot to restore a snapshot
we'll click backup we'll go to the
replica set in question and then what
we'll do is pick the specific snapshot
that we want to restore locally I'll
pick this one and then we'll click
download my data once again will be
asked to enter in our password after
we've entered our password we can go
ahead and click download my data again
it'll prepare you a link and what you
can do go back to back up and go to
restore history always and you'll be
able to see when the backup queue is
completed and you're able to actually
download from the link the link only
lasts for a certain period of time
this is at a security for you now if you
do is click get link after we click get
link we can click download and once this
completes it'll go ahead and download
the full snapshot of your backup and
just like working when we did a direct
restore to our cluster we can go back to
restore history and we get information
on the previous restores that we've done
so great work now we're all set to use
our backups and ensure our data is
always up-to-date

issues contact our support team at any
