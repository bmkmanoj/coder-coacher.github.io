finding that and figuring out how to use
Windows I'm you know we could be here a
long time I'm a product manager for
troppo drop us a product as real-time
communications telecommunications makes
it easy for any developer to add telecom
into applications whether it's SMS phone
calls embedding telecom into web
browsers into mobile applications and
that sort of thing what I'm going to
talk to you a little bit about is how we
do this and what we've done so we
actually have our own network or own
data centers we are at seven data
centers around the world and what we've
done is we've taken all of the the
complicated telephony stuff who
recognizes any of these terms awesome
come talk to me we're hiring this is all
this is the language of telecom
developers who recognizes these terms
language of web developers a hell of a
lot easier right so what we've done is
we've taken telecom and made it as easy
as this this is a telecom app this is
your typical IVR the fact this is what I
hear when I call an IVR your money is
important to us your car will be ignored
in the order was received so we run
seven data centers around the world and
one of the things that we do is we make
sure that any phone call that comes in
you know it turns out that for telephony
latency is really really important
because a web application and making an
HTTP call if one of your calls takes 500
milliseconds another one takes four
hundred milliseconds nobody's going to
notice but over a phone call when you're
doing real-time voice people notice
really fast and so one of the things
that we've done is we've eliminated all
latency from the front end of a phone
call so what we do is when a call comes
in we've got these seven data centers
around the world we deliver to one of
these data centers based on where the
call is and some other factors right so
how we get those applications out to
those data centers and make your
application work and all these data
centers is kind of what I want to talk
about and show off what we do this has
nothing to do with my talk
it's just an awesome picture so I have
to put it up here and we'll just leave
this up here behind me for the rest of
the talk because well it's that awesome
so what we do is we need zero latency at
scale and so what we do is we use a no
sequel database that actually comes with
every server that's been shipped in the
last 15 years let's go bind we actually
run all of our data out of bind we run
out of DNS so what we do is when you
when you update something on your
application we've got a traditional
database that your update goes to we
store it there that's the long-term
storage but everything that we do is
really really read heavy and not very
right heavy a phone call we don't do a
lot of writing i mean we write records
we are it logs but those don't need to
be accessed in real time so we write
this we write to the database when you
update an application you changing you
well you had a new phone number or
something like that and then what we do
is we use a agent that runs through
pulls that data out of d out of the
database and writes DNS records and then
delivers those DNS records it's really
easy to ship a DNS record to another
country to another server in another
country so we can your application can
be written in our Atlanta data center is
where the right goes to but within
seconds it's over in our Hong Kong data
center and so if a call comes in there
you get the correct application if you
have a really really read heavy
application this works if you have a
very right heavy application not going
to work so well one of the things that
we do is we set the time to live very
very short so we've got the longest TTL
we have on any DNS record in the company
including the web homepage roxy.com is
120 seconds many of our DNS with TTL
czar much much shorter down into the
two-second range for some things so for
files work platform as a service you
actually run your code on our servers
because going back to that hole HTTP
latency thing making HTTP calls to a
phone call really sucks so what we do is
we run the files on our own locals on
our own servers you upload Ruby code PHP
code JavaScript code for some of our
stuff we do voicexml we do xmltype code
you upload that to our servers and run
we distribute that out to all the
different data centers
using our sink when you when you make a
change we actually use FTP to write to
individual servers we write those out we
do an rsync out to the servers across
round the around the world we use our
say could push the files out there and
then when the next call comes in it
picks up that new code we actually tried
using Sam tried using sams one time in
our data centers and we just write like
locally well we were burning out sands
on almost a monthly basis because of the
how much white heavy we are people
changing applications and pushing stuff
writing log files all of that kind of
stuff just didn't work so we actually
use FTP going back scaling out goods the
old stuff is the good stuff it's well
battle-tested ftp server running push
the stuff out there use our sake to
distribute it around now one of the
things that you need to worry oh and
then those files are served up by
internal web servers with local caching
so all of the servers in our cloud have
copies of the applications when they
need them automatically so one of the
great things about using DNS and all
this file serving is that every single
one of our server has what it needs in
order to run an application now one of
the things that you have to think about
when you're scaling out is make sure
that it's not just you that has to scale
out it's also your providers and your
vendors so we have occasionally somebody
will come to us leo we need to make
40,000 phone calls in 20 seconds like
emergency outbound services so yeah so
good luck with that there's not a
telephone carrier on the planet that can
support that kind of volume you know
when there's a disaster in a city and
you get the old circuits are busy that's
cuz like 4000 people pick up the phone
in a major metro area at the same time
and that exhausts the circuits have a
lot of carriers so you know
understanding the limits of your
upstream carriers understanding the
limits of the networks outside of you is
a very important thing to be scaling out
to scale out and to understand how that
works and design your stuff how to work
within that so I'll be here the rest of
the night I'm sure my five minutes is up
i don't think i want eight minutes but
you know we're good so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
