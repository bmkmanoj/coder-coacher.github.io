hi everyone I am Barry Siegel from
MongoDB we are here today live at
MongoDB world I'm joined today by Tamika
Reeve who is the founder of women and
linens we're so happy to have you here
today thank you so much for joining us
thank you for having me worse so can you
just tell us a little bit about what is
women in linen what is the structure of
the organization a little bit about the
history so what women in Linux is what
we do is we try to get more women into
tech from an infrastructure perspective
and when I say that mean like from
building our private cloud from
understanding Amazon for understanding
MongoDB for understanding really all
aspects of tech so we also focus on
entrepreneurs and also creating wealth
so we've got to cover a gamut of ideas
and a gamut and a range of people as
well too so we're not only just for
women we have men in our group that are
that we consider allies when our editors
is the actual mint is an actual mill and
how long has the organization been
around so actually we've been around now
it's going on two years we had our first
women and Linux Summit last year
everything we do it's virtual so we had
a virtual summit and we have another
virtual summit coming up on August the
19th so go get your tickets it's going
to be good it's going to have a lot of
information for you so clearly when you
put this organization together you
notice that there was a gap in the
industry often times it's hard for women
who are trying to break into tech to
find a community for themselves mm-hm
so can you speak a little bit about what
the impetus was for starting it up was
there sort of a defining moment when you
said okay this is it I need to put a
group together right so I get a
background about me I started in 2000
after I started in 2000 all the way
through college all the way up until a
year ago maybe two years ago I never saw
another black woman in ten
that did Linux so me and my co-founder
was sitting on the sofa and I was like I
will always want to teach someone so we
found it women and Linux and here we are
today music and why Linux where did your
love affair with Linux begin it was kind
of like a flue I actually started out in
Hawaii doing Cisco Networking after I
did Cisco Networking I was talking to my
my lab partner and he was like hey this
is just like Linux me not knowing Linux
I said hey this could this seems just
like something I should I should learn
cuz he said it was like the command line
and he sold me a Compaq Presario for $72
and I just jetted off and started
learning Linux like like that and it
stuck with it it was something that you
know I never I had never seen before so
I made my own notes I joined user forums
I did everything I could possibly do to
get a better grasp on what Linux was and
how could I make it a career have you
ever as Linux ever betrayed you have you
ever found any weird Linux bugs um you
know that goes into being open source so
have I found bugs of course have I got
to take back a 2000 there wasn't a
github back in 2005 that wasn't a github
so in order to you know submit you had
to join your you know your IRC you had
to you know be a be a part of community
and the community was which was a strong
male presence and the community was was
was it wasn't very nice it wasn't very
warming so you had to get that either
grow thick skin and don't be a part of
it
so I kind of did both our became a part
of it and then I moved away from it and
then then you go back to it I think now
I looking over it now do I think women
have have an easier chance than what I
had in 2000 I think there's more support
groups
most definitely I do I think it's easier
I think it's a lot of misguidance when
it comes to hitting into tech and how
you can navigate and where you can go so
I try to provide women and an infant and
children and grandparents anybody I
could get my hands on I try to guide
them in a way to help them to understand
there's different things you can do a
tech from gaming to to flying drones to
being a pilot like I'm studying and
getting my pilot's license so like you
know so just just you know understanding
like you know I want people to be able
to create their own path with a set of
guidance with some type of hey here's
some tips and stuff to read hey call me
if you want to study at 2 o'clock in the
morning I'm gonna set up a study which
yeah so that's why I try so you know
speaking about the the communities that
you had to seek out back when you first
started on this journey and you
mentioned how the landscape has changed
a lot like now you have meetup group
seeing these different opportunities so
you mentioned before you talk about mind
maps that you've built uni what kind of
advice would you give to adults nowadays
who are trying to nurture a young
person's journey into
so I actually started doing some
mentorship we have we have kids that
that email us all the time we have
adults that email us all the time my my
number one thing is or my number one
that is never stop because you never
stop learning you never you never stop
getting information either right
so going to meetups attending
conferences speaking at conferences
writing a book doing an open source
project create your own open-source
project like I really want I want to
cover the gamut and I want people to
understand that's a gamut of things you
can do but understand create a support
system around you so that you can have
that like and that's very important to
have a support system around you I came
in I didn't have one I created my own
support system by building my own
documentation that was my support system
right so I mean you know kudos to to
those who haven't met along the way that
encouraged me and I just want to
continue to encourage others and how do
you tend to encourage like students so
you're mentioning before that you have
sort of like ancillary groups that you
put together to support them yeah so I
encourage students by one I want them to
attend meetups too I want them to be
able to write out their documentation I
think that's important because you're
creating your own portfolio you're
branding yourself right and that's and
that's one of the biggest thing even
though it sounds cliche but when someone
looks over who you are and they go to
your LinkedIn page and you say well I
did this I did this and github or get
laugh or I committed to this open-source
project or I worked on this
documentation or something like you're
really you're branding yourself so you
know I even I even talked about you know
how how people can help other kids like
if you're a kid help another kid out you
know bring them along and I don't I
think we do that but I think we do it in
silos I would like to see the done
across you know across the nation like
when we talk about you know
same meetup.com may have an event a
meet-up and it's no one can see that
meetup because they don't record it
right right who I don't understand why
we can't have virtual meetups across
multiple locations
I know Rancher does it I know
OpenStack out of San Francisco do it
does it I do it but I would love to see
that
expanded because the kid who sits in
Tallahassee there wants to know about
OpenStack and he can attend the meetup
the OpenStack has or he has to look
locally but he can't get to it or she
can't get to it it's a problem and the
platforms are already there the
platforms are already there all the
data's built already sorry today I'm
recording it and making it accessible
right you're right I mean these things
generally exist in big cities where
there's already a critical mass of
people who has an interest right subject
so how do you really reach the kids who
horseface isolated we're Facebook
liveing now very tight right now right
this and gets inspired out in
Tallahassee right right so I my goal is
to to have might not have the meetups
and silos you know like you know most
conferences that we everyone has there
either in San Francisco there in New
York there in Chicago there in Austin
when you talk about the southeast
there's never a conference in the
southeast we have reraised that's coming
up in Atlanta but then when we talk
about something in Miami or something in
Tampa or something in back in Atlanta or
even Huntsville Alabama you know they're
engineers in Huntsville
trust me there isn't they're engineers
in North Carolina A&amp;amp;T they're engineers
in South Carolina
there's engineers at Morehouse that's
engineers at Georgia Tech the engineers
are filming what's wrong with having a
conference a tech conference in the
southeast where you can get a larger
population of minorities to attend
because now they don't have to fly to
Alif or nia and still get a hotel
cost-prohibitive to go to use for you
many women in linux will be one of the
first groups Pascale's I would love it
we leave sponsors like MongoDB we need
sponsors and we need sponsors that's
what we need like we need sponsors I
understand I tried to put on a
conference a conference cost $40,000
minimum that's just for some food right
talking about getting recurs there let's
not talk about swag virtual hit backs
the whole nine so hey do got connections
to sponsors anybody out there want to
sponsor might be able to connect with
people in the next couple days
Julia please it's also it's a great time
to be doing something like this there is
a lot of energy in the industry towards
focusing on helping minorities gender
minorities racial minorities really have
the same opportunity that others have
had in text so I think now is a great
moment for Center like this and one
other thing I like to add I'll often get
that is women Linux for everyone and
when I say everyone I mean transgender
who I mean whatever gender you it stick
for me it stick I don't care I don't
care if you came in with one leg and no
ears just wants you to show up and learn
tech that's it I just want you to have a
path I just want you to have information
that's all that's all I'm here for the
software doesn't care who you are know
this Linux doesn't care what you Alissa
say I and its bias right Tamika thank
you so much for joining us today thank
you it's nice
thank you guys well thank you so much
we'll be back in a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
