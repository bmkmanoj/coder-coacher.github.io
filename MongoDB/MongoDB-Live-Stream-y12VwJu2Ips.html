live from MongoDB world in Chicago I'm
joined here today with J cappella
Krishna from noe and he's going to talk
to us a little bit about what he's been
working on with MongoDB thank you so
much for coming here today we're so
happy to have you
you Barry so can you just give us you
know a little bit of an introduction
about yourself
sure my name is Jay gopalakrishnan
Fondren see of noe we provide native
analytics on MongoDB and other mystical
and sequel databases okay and how long
has the company been around even one for
a couple years so we found in 2014
okay so pretty recent yeah and also
being partners with Mongo since then -
so you started with mommy-to-be from the
very beginning yeah okay and then have
you been using I'm going to be Atlas
because that just came out in the last
year yeah we used to use a combination
of MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB okay in our
brand so you use MongoDB as a elastic
store engine as a default elastic story
engine and after that tracks results of
queries that customers execute for
faster performance we were terabytes of
data in MongoDB you can and for Atlas we
use that for to showcase a demo on Mongo
so we provision classes you know wind
them up turndown
so that's great so tell us a little bit
about the database-as-a-service market
and how solutions like atlas can fit
into the enterprise data architectures
yeah absolutely so it's a very
interesting market because on the one
hand you've got you know adoption of
cloud increasing right so you got
databases and servers that a services
like Atlas that have come on that takes
the pain away from engineers and
operations to manage and scale their
database infrastructure so within a
cooking a couple of clicks you up in a
way with video cluster and it's really
helpful for your time to market so if
you have an idea if your enterprise
working on something that you want to
put together it's very easy to turn that
up instead of having to get permission
from your your department to get you
know never regulations involved and so
on so in you know the the Atlas all it's
very interesting because it's been in
service for about a year or so I think
in the past three months we've seen
about 3x more than the previous nine
months for people who are using or
connecting to outlets through who know
it lots of it yeah so tell us about some
use cases that you're seeing with Atlas
sure so there's a we have a variety of
use cases one of the more recent ones
was someone analyzing Twitter feeds to
get sentiment analysis on that and then
driving that putting that into Mongo
Atlas
right and then also using noe for
visualization and real-time analysis of
their states one of those you know from
tweets in our casing point and also
things like the sentiment there and also
you know when the general election was
announced in the UK what what do people
think about that at that time and since
then you know and what kind of decisions
can people make they start this kind of
analysis then yeah so it's it's
completely custom so you can basically
figure out trend trend analysis
historical data patterns to figure out
what it was was it going what's what's
the action that they need to take on
that on that data
and what other use cases are so we also
one of the other use cases we did with
Atlas was we take taxi data we took taxi
data from New York City GPS location for
40 million records for green cab service
that we then analyze and use that to
showcase how we work with mommy
regardless
Mongo in general so you see geo clusters
or where the pickups happen where the
drop-offs happened one of the profitable
areas for a cab driver and where should
you be at certain times of the day and
so on so forth right so in theory you
could surface up that information to a
cab driver and they would then know how
to best spend their time and get more
efficient Wow yeah they actually did
sentiment analysis on tweets in New York
City based on geolocation and they found
that the guess what that happiest place
in New York City is happiest place in
your city Chelsea I don't know let's
connect so the unhappiest places are
obviously places like prisons and jails
Oh Happy's place is our parks but number
one is Times Square
okay you wouldn't think that right
interesting I don't think said that Oh
No
all right so with the changes in the
underlying data stack what is the future
of analytics hold this is a big question
yeah right so you know when you look at
them they dictate a stack and
architectures themselves you got no
sequel databases that here to stay right
see and there's a comp usually a
combination in the enterprise of sequel
no sequel rest take the eyes and files
and it's a mishmash of things and when
you look at the traditional analytics
platforms it's it's limited to
structured data sets that you can
basically go visualize on it so I think
what you'll see is companies like us
come into the market with native Mexico
analytics that doesn't move the data on
the put structure on that base so that's
already happening now I say but the the
larger story I think is
if bi generally has been looking
backwards but you look at historical
data to say what are the trends and
patterns right and then you look at it
and make some decisions on that see what
you'll see in the next couple years it's
combination a bi and AI that takes
hindsight and foresight and combining
together and also the drives action for
the bit right the predictive analytics
exactly so predictive prescriptive
analytics to say you know what what's
happened based on what's happened what
is what is expected to happen right and
then drive actions from that and so we
launched a latest feature as machine
learning capabilities on top of MongoDB
queries for example a Mongo plus other
sources that allows you to basically say
hey is this person likely to default
their mortgage payment next month goes
on basically historical patterns and if
so then what action do you think so
calling out api's into their own
application to take action all right and
you can really get ahead of something
like that maybe prevent something is
that happened if I do it yeah yeah so
that's the way we see the market going
the next couple years and be there
interesting things happening yeah well
no interesting and then just in terms of
the near term what are you most excited
about at MongoDB world this year so you
know it's really interesting to see
MongoDB mature as a company at the past
couple years so you you know when you
look at the services that have been
launched
they've been launching this year and the
year before and also 2015 so you can see
that that the adlets for example is a
natural fit for markets
right so I got other services that are
popping I can also stitch today exactly
right so it's a sweet raita
it's at building up that ecosystem that
developers can go and make make the apps
very quickly and then also have partners
like our so they could depend on to to
build visualizations and more advanced
analytics on top so it's a it's a great
time you know get done to be here -
great conference so far for us baby girl
yeah exactly
we're so glad to have you and thanks so
much for taking about take though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
