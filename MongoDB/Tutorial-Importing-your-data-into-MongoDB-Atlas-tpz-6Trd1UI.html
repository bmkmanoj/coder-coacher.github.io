tutorials my name is Jay and I'm here to
teach you more on how to get started
using our database as a service atlas
today we'll go over how to import a JSON
file of your data into MongoDB Alice
once you've launched a MongoDB Atlas
cluster and configured your whitelist
it's time to start importing your data
there are several different methods you
may use to import your data into MongoDB
however today we'll focus on importing a
JSON dump into our m0 free tier cluster
to get the most out of this tutorial you
should have launched an Atlas cluster
and whitelisted your IP for your local
computer if you don't know what your IP
address is just go to add IP address at
current IP address and confirm notice
I'm using this 0 0 0 0 slash 0 this
means that I've opened it up to world
this is not secure and is not
recommended for production access if you
haven't reached this point go ahead and
pause the video then review the videos
that we've created related to these
subjects on our YouTube page you can go
ahead and just click the video and then
come back to this when you're done you
should be certain to have the
appropriate shell at least MongoDB three
to seven with SSL if no shell is
currently installed you can get one very
easily on the MongoDB Atlas cluster page
so let's go ahead and see version we're
three for two if we did need to install
this what we do is go back to our
cluster click connect scroll down we'll
find connect with the Mongo shell what
we can do is go ahead find our
appropriate operating system select
download shell and we'll have the
opportunity to go ahead and install it
as needed now we need to download our
demo JSON file to our local computer I
am going to use this file that is called
Star Wars character data JSON let's go
ahead we can just save as you couldn't
either W get it or use a browser either
way is your choice next let's grab our
primaries hostname since we need to
write to the cluster so what we'll do is
we'll click on the cluster name and then
we can see the three hosts that make up
our cluster our primaries here so what
we'll do is we'll click on the first one
and that provides us with our primaries
full
name and port number we can use this
information a copy and then eventually
create our import string great we've got
our primary and we're ready to important
to the cluster today we'll be using
Mongo import Mongo import is a tool
that's included in MongoDB installation
package it's a simple utility for
importing different types of datasets
into your MongoDB cluster so let's
briefly discuss the binary and the
options we'll need to use for Mongo
import there's host which refers to the
actual primary host name and the port
it's associated with next is the
database we're using DB starwars
the type is a file called JSON the file
is located in this particular location
the JSON array is in proper format so we
give this particular auction the
authentication database for all Atlas
clusters is admin so this is a default
that you should always use SSL is as
well and default for all a CLIs clusters
finally we'll put our username and
password don't worry I delete these
perfect now our data has been imported
into our database now the final step is
to validate that our data made it so all
you need to do is just go click clusters
click on the cluster name you can look
at one of the primaries and we'll see
that our data may differ here go back to
clusters click connect scroll down let's
get our shell copy we'll go back to the
terminal
type in our password great show
databases great there's Star Wars will
use Star Wars show collections great so
our collection data made it so now all
we have to do is DB Star Wars character
data find and there's our data your
import has completed if you're running
into any Atlas issues contact our
support team at any time click the
support link in the lower left of your
Atlas interface or go to Mongo DB comm
