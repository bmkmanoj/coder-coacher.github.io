tutorials my name is Jay I'm a developer
advocate and I'm here to teach you how
to get started on using our database as
a service
Atlas today we'll go over the difference
between MongoDB Atlas users and MongoDB
database users you'll learn the
difference in the two and how you use
them to access your MongoDB Atlas
cluster MongoDB Atlas comes with default
security for both your account and your
databases first we'll discuss your Atlas
users these are either owners or
read-only users that are for accessing
your UI with Atlas or interacting with
our API you can easily invite members or
even change their roles you can go ahead
and click add user enter a user name and
then select whether it's an owner which
has full administration access or
read-only which may only modify personal
preferences for their account next we'll
discuss database users click clusters
and then we'll go to security and then
we'll review the user section here's
where we'll create users that will
eventually interact with our MongoDB
database all these users live within the
admin authentication database that Atlas
manages for our cluster so let's go
ahead and click the add new user if we
want to create a new user first we type
in the username then we go ahead and
select one of the three preset roles
there's an Atlas admin and an Atlas
admin is a full administrative user able
to access any database read write and
make specific changes that are
administrative it read and write to any
database user can read and write to any
database within your cluster and only
read any database user can do only a
read to any database within the whole
cluster now if you click on the show
advanced options section you'll see that
there's an entire set of new roles that
we can set specifically for our user if
you'd like to create users that would be
isolated to a single database you can
create the custom role here so we can
say that this read-only user should only
be able to access a database called
tweets great now we can go ahead and
auto generate a secure password
and click add user put wait a few
minutes our new user will be generated
and created across all three nodes in
our cluster if you're running into any
Atlas issues contact our support team at
any time click the support link in the
lower left of your Atlas interface or go
to MongoDB comm slash contact thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
