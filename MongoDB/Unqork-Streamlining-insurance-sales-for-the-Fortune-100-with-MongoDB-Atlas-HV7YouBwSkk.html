uncork before in quark I was the global
EVP and CIO at MetLife uncork is a
software as a service platform which is
transforming financial services we are
the fulfillment engine that will connect
distribution and manufacturing across
the financial service market starting
with insurance and on quark our
competitive advantage will not lie
within us creating our own database team
our own DBAs and our own hosting and
security and support it actually lies
within MongoDB Atlas where that's
provided to us with one-click the best
way to think of on quark is actually
think of when you're shopping in Amazon
behind the scenes in Amazon there's an
entire fulfillment service that's making
sure that that order is fulfilled
properly it sent to you it's tractors
insights we're providing that across
financial services when we designed
encore we designed it as we were the CIO
of a large enterprise fortune 100
customer to do that we can't be a
multi-tenant environment we can't
actually share multiple data sources for
different customers in the same actual
tables as many companies do everything
we collect along the journey of a cell
is something that you need to monetize
to create better products a relational
database structure would require
thousands of fields across hundreds of
tables in order to actually make that
work and once you have that working the
next product that comes in might break
the model what we're able to do is
accommodate that structure accommodate
the flexibility within MongoDB to change
the dynamic nature of the product to add
a feature at a field without breaking
the entire system and we're able to
accommodate features and writers and
report on them and use them in analytics
to see how they actually operate and how
they function in real life our business
model provides an isolated instance per
client without MongoDB Atlas this should
be an extremely complex problem we have
to build and solve each customer that
we're providing an isolated instance of
their data would become a nightmare to
maintain support and spin up new
customers when we're setting up the
customer we're able to do that with
MongoDB Atlas seamlessly one-click we
could actually create either the AWS or
Azure instance associated with it we
could create the AWS or Azure mug with
the Atlas instance and tie them together
through a secure Channel all in one shot
on Clarke we actually had a customer
need where we were hosting them out of
the US and there was a request made to
actually host them out of Brazil for us
in MongoDB Atlas this was one click we
basically started a new instance we
loaded the data from the u.s. to there
and we pointed out database service to
that server we were done for our
customer security is critical and
they're trusting us not just with
customer data but with their business
rules and we have to show that we're
actually storing that encrypted not just
in transit but in storage throughout the
entire process and that's what they're
expecting from us with MongoDB Atlas
that's a single click when you're
setting up the instances they turn on
encryption and I've done it myself for
the first few clients to see this work
and now you're storing it encrypted in
transit and in storage which is what
they're expecting from us when we start
on quark we were confident in using
MongoDB Ellis
there was no questions there we
understood the product the team and we
understood they would be with us there
for the journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
