in Chicago my name is Barry Siegel today
I'm joined here by Mariana siddiqa was
from Mexico and she's going to be
talking to us a little bit about her
work with SEO they're one of our
partners and also how she works - in
love with you so just to start us off -
that's a good start it's a great start
can you tell us a little bit about who
you are and then what your role is at
nazia okay so my name is Mariana sadhika
I'm a software engineer with night at
midnight so I've been working for next
year for about seven years in three
different countries Wow and recently I
joined the cloud Kim okay
yes I do I'm a cloud developer right now
okay and what were you doing before
you're a car developers I work on many
different teams
okay last form related or also customer
related
like one of the things I went before
were the work flow for example okay so
and then you moved over to the cloud
team and that as we started working with
yes we do exactly
okay yeah so can you tell me a little
bit about what it was like to start
working with MongoDB how easy it was to
get up to speed with this new product
and then you're joining with Atlas what
I was really lucky because I moved to
the cloud team and we decided to use
MongoDB Atlas first so it's actually the
best way to get in because you have
Atlas doing all the hard work for you so
you just like in a matter of clicks you
get to provision clusters you get to
decide how your cluster is going to be
set up how many replicas that do you
want encryption do you want backups to
want everything so in terms of for like
using this is really easy
plus you have Atlas managing all the
hard things for you so you don't have to
manage the backups you don't have too
many to the
like monitoring Zoe's story it's a
really easy way to get into contact with
the MongoDB yeah so there was every time
when you were on the cloud team not
using Alice you goes all the way there
yeah I mean like one of the main focuses
of the global team is to deploy on
MongoDB Atlas so we do support our other
databases and we do support the amount
of course outside Atlas because we can
deploy on any MongoDB that database you
don't necessarily have to choose Atlas
right but that's like more of a
discussion of the platform level not
like on my role as a developer in the
cloud team we are focusing on address
right now that's great okay and how do
you see the cloud landscape changing in
the next few years do you see more tools
like Alice coming in and make things
easier yeah I mean like it's clearly
that this is what customer one they need
though that you want secure and they
want to be they want platforms as Mongo
to offer like just like this as a
service and the we want to jump that on
on that so we want to like be able to
answer all to all their needs so like
that's why you that's why it's so easy
yeah and everybody's going and moving
into the cloud and the fact that you
guys support the AWS as you're right now
cloud that's a great thing because that
means we can know like if we have
clients asking us for this specific
deployments we'll be able to support
them as well so which is great yeah
that's really flexible that's right you
don't give the customers what they want
because
so now I do a little more fun stuff is
this your first manga TV world
yes that's my first moment to do it okay
and what are you most looking forward to
in the next couple of days
oh I'm actually interested in some
sessions related to docker
micro-services also security because
that's a huge thing and it's a huge and
very important subject right now so I do
have some sessions in my my agenda okay
great yeah looking forward to them thank
you so much for coming and thank you so
much for talking to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
