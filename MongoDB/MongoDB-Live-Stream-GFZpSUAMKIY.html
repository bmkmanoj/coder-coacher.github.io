here live at MongoDB world in Chicago
today I am joined by Vlad pesky who is
from nuke Co and thank you so much for
coming and I would love it if you could
just share a little bit about my yeah
thank you for invitation it's been like
yet the second time that we are at
MongoDB one
so Nixle is a content service platform
so first of all it's a solution for
building some business application that
can be in any field I mean everything
that is like document oriented so you
can have a quality insurance finance you
we even are like Electronic Arts as a
video game manager so we are using
really the platform for different kind
of feel like this but most important the
most important thing is that this is a
platform for developers so actually my
Nana who was there this morning at night
we are developing for developers well
creating some tools for making more I
mean
easier the way that you're building your
application and MongoDB with with
MongoDB in general we have we can
respond to all the peppermints
I mean demands of our customers very
quickly because it's really good for the
volume is really good for the scaling
and for everything is like Reed wide
sections in general you can have really
good path analysis so you mentioned EA
or Electronic Arts
that's the sports video games right nice
for so can you speak to that use case a
little bit or any other main use cases
that you've worked on so my mind like
right now that all that is using MongoDB
I don't I can I can talk about those but
um I don't know if they and I'm saying I
figure that don't leak any information
no it's just I think they are not using
over to be yeah but no we have our
customer so do you using MongoDB it's in
the intima photographic database so
everything that is like you know the
coordinates of different assets that you
can have it's done about some other you
scan no I don't have in my
how long have you been working at next
year so it's been six years now and we
have begun like in France and Paris and
now we're expanding so we have offices
in New York San Francisco Los Angeles
and now in London this is the HQ in
London and which team are you on
specifically in it so me I'm working so
I used to work on the cloud then we are
changing all the time
and that's that's that's kind of good
for that I think so for the developers
you can see the different type of fit
I'm working on the phone email site so
which is the UI so everything so our
framework is in Java but we have as well
summer everything is like interface is
polymer the Google polymer from her and
so everything is JavaScript on the side
yeah so you mentioned this is your not
your first Normandy be world
no it's you should I can mama to be
wrong yeah what do you think so far
uh Chicago out of it yeah this is my
second Direction here the weather is
much nicer watching yeah so no that's a
real grievance oh no yeah that's nice
but this morning the stitch new future I
mean the stitch new clients of movie was
very nice and I'm looking forward see
all the same sir are you gonna go see
