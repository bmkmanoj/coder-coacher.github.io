at MongoDB Chicago today I have with me
Cupid Chan from horsey decision thank
you so much for joining us thank you for
having me
course can you just tell us a little bit
about what foresee decision is oh sure
foster decision actually it's the
initial for the co-founders
my name is Cupid Chan and Calvin Chu is
an article founder so that's why we
picked the fall see here but on the
other hand like our mission for policy
decision is to help our client to
foresee the business decision using data
technology and analytics okay yeah and
how long ago was the company started
oh we started about two and a half years
ago so like is Stuart a startup company
we are trying to figure out what is the
dance landscape on this like the data
industry so okay yeah so what do you
provide right now what is the company do
yeah so like our focus is so on the
commercial sector especially the
mortgage industry so what happened is
like you know mortgage industry has a
lot of data so like there is already a
standard out there is calm is low so we
are leveraging the industry standard and
MongoDB technology to try to combine
them together to make it an offer to as
a solution to their industry okay so
you're aggregating data about the
mortgage industry they're offering
analytic yes using MongoDB correct were
you using MongoDB from the very
beginning or did you switch over to all
yeah there was a debate whether we
should we should use Longo or not very
obvious reasons because our DBMS has
been in this market for like 40 years or
something alaya so many people just say
okay building up a database or data
warehouse right get our DBMS get some
other vendors that is not like a very
traditional one but the problem for that
is it depends on like your structure of
the data if it is hierarchical it's very
hard to like a farmer Steve
in all DBMS and still keep that
structure intact but you know MongoDB is
hierarchical
in fact missional structure is based on
XML XML JSON perfect match so that's why
we pick MongoDB and the rest is history
mm-hmm all right and it's your first
time in MongoDB world no actually I was
here last time in New York but I can
tell you at this time it's much more
better not because of the organization
but because of so many people right here
like they come all over the world like
that amazing that's great we have so
many people here from all of our
different companies a lot of different
customers not just here today yes and
you're also giving a talk here
yes oh yeah I'm going to talk a little
bit about sure like tomorrow at all
three phony or essentialist at a time
I'm going to give a talk about no sequel
and B I usually this is a very common
complaint from the client saying that no
sequel and you put a bi on top of that
how are you going to deal with that and
especially for the executive they want
to see a very nice or executive
dashboard but but without BI it's very
hard to sell them the idea of MongoDB or
the database engineer it's actually very
robust they don't care about them now or
less care about that so if well we can
present it in a very nice well visually
I think that would be a big plus for
showing up the like showing off the the
capability that Mongo and VI actually
can work together absolutely well thank
you so much for coming to Burma so happy
to have you here sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
