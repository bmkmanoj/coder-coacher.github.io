really when to use MongoDB and just to
understand the scope of where I'm
talking about because there's a lot of
new technologies and enterprise data
management so when I'm
Mongo's sweet spot is that of an
operational database and what I mean by
that is in contrast to a data
warehousing product so where you have
real-time request response you're
basically building an application on a
database that's especially where monitor
B fits in formerly you or you have been
doing that on relational databases you
may still continue for some you know set
of them but Mongo gives you a lot of
value for for most of many of those
applications so the idea is that no
sequel is applicable to use an
operational database and that's where
mom going to be fit there's there are
some addit there's definitely analytical
loads where Mongo also is good real time
or kind of analytics on sets of data but
overall you hear about Hadoop using
being built for the analytical space
which is more in that data warehousing
area you know Hadoop you don't often
build applications where you need a
millisecond response time where you can
really well you need a millisecond
response time that's really more of an
operational database to me more where
you have a job that runs in seconds to
minutes to hours to run aggregations and
analytics is really where Hadoop is is
really coming of age and focused on and
SPARC more recently for longer running
processing but long going to be has it
had to connect er which I'll talk about
for interacting with that environment
and I'll draw out a kind of reference
architecture to for how the two often
combined and here's the Hadoop connector
so you know for people you know maybe
newer to Mongo or hend or Hadoop spark
the idea is that Mongo you have indexing
I would think of that as one of the core
differences MongoDB gives you the
ability to index any field much like you
do in a normal database especially good
when you kind of you know you have a
sense of what your data relationships
are because you need to put data into
documents does not joins at that in that
way and it's great for any subset of
data just super fast we're getting two
subsets of data whereas more just
tributed analytics a spark in the dupe
you know you would run for longer jobs
more analytics and as a batch but highly
parallel processing and it's great for
looking at all of your data so that you
can really you can really distribute
that looking at all of your data or
large subsets it doesn't give you an
indexing structure like a database does
and some people might point out HBase is
part of Hadoop I put that into the no
sequel space and you should just analyze
it in that way and much of what I'm
talking about you know about the no
sequel space earlier with with you know
good scale but not rich indexing and
secondary indexing an expressive query
language applies the HBase and then
there's sequel space and you can see you
know all of what I've been talking about
explains why mangu B is actually the
fourth most popular database in the
world even more popular than Postgres we
have a little while admittedly until
will surpass Oracle and and the like but
they've had a 40 30 or 40 year head
start but you know everything we've
talked about and how the world is
different in the features the Mott is a
Mongo is built specifically for that
world explains why you know we're so
well adopted and just a you know a sub
subset of our customer base but you know
valid 2,000 customers or so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
