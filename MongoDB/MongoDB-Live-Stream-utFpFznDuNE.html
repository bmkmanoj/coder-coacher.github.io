Barry Siegel we are live at MongoDB
Chicago I would like to welcome you to
by T Krishnan who is here with us from
tableau today buddy how's it going good
it's been awesome you guys have put on
an awesome show so cool to be part of it
it's your first mama-to-be world and it
is yes great
it's exceeding all your expectations
that's so far so let's talk a little bit
about tableau can you just share with
our audience a little bit
what is tableau and what is our
partnership with mama-to-be look like
absolutely so tableau is the world's
leading visual analytics platform we
were founded back in 2003 when a
Stanford PhD Pat Hanrahan came together
with crystal T and Kristin Shabbo and
they had this visionary idea for a new
research direction that hadn't been
taken before that combined the best of
databases with visualization technology
and they founded tableau fast forward 10
years what 14 years now we're now a
public company in excess of 50,000
customers all over the world we have
been adopted by 95% plus of the fortune
500 and and you know thrilled to
continue to delight customers and and
really happy the way things have turned
on as for our partnership with Mongo uh
you know you guys are the leading
next-generation database platform and as
part of my role at tableau as Senior
Product Marketing Manager focused on our
tech partner ecosystem I am in charge of
promoting our partnership and all the
different ways our customers can benefit
from a partnership and when I speak with
customers I continue to hear that no
sequel and developer productivity are
themes that are are themes and problems
that need solutions and MongoDB is
working towards solving them and which
ties very well with what we do for a
customer so yeah it's I think it's a
win-win for all of us so
say that what is the customer adoption
looking like how you know you've been at
the company for a while so what is been
the change in customer adoption now that
we've introduced the partnership with
MongoDB absolutely so so traditionally
when tableau
was founded in the earlier years most of
the customer adoption came from business
users and people who were not super
technical and they have this amazing
amazing you know tool to give them
access to all the information they had
without having to write code but over
the years we've seen that you know we
continue to appeal to business users but
now are now being adopted by enterprises
IT has a you know embraced tableau in
you know in ways that we could imagine a
few years back
and now we are a full-fledged Enterprise
analytics platform that appeals not just
to business users for developers and IT
and people who are architecting analytic
systems so developers isn't that's an
audience we have not traditionally you
know expose ourselves to but we're
continuing you know to position tableau
as a platform for everyone and this is
an MongoDB is a conduit for to the
developer audience as far as we're
concerned yeah absolutely I mean most of
the audience here today our developers
your developers database yeah what does
that look like for someone if they're
using MongoDB how would they then
connect to tableau absolutely so at this
conference you know we are launching
fact lunch it's already happened but
you know we're putting a bigger face to
it is the live connector to MongoDB so
as you know customers are currently
using tableau if they have an instance
of MongoDB they can connect to tableau
now offers direct connectivity and kudos
to both our engineering teams you know I
mean they're there they're the real
heroes worked on this for several months
and we're really really happy to ship
this we've had some early customer
feedback it was just been super positive
there's a lot of work to be done but you
know I think it's the first step of many
many that we have to take to continue to
democratize analytics on no sequel
databases can you speak to any specific
use case or you know just an interesting
use case that you've seen with tableau
you know back by MongoDB or not yeah you
know I'm into several use cases I would
say like anytime anyone is working with
unstructured data it could be you know
data coming from sensors from devices
from different the call logs imagine if
I'm at AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon on a telco
and I want to understand my call records
to figure out which customers to upsell
to or what is transactional activity
looking like these are all use cases
that are perfect you know the great
applications of how tableau and MongoDB
can tour the integration of tableau
mangodi you can solve a real-world
problem you can also get ahead of
problems absolutely with predictive
analytics
yeah and the biggest benefit I would say
is like you know in the past there was a
lot of time and complexity involved with
making unstructured data in the
application layer available to business
users because you had to you know the
application layer had no sequel you had
perform some ETL format it put it into a
relational database and by the time you
could touch the data many many exactly
man and many weeks and months would have
passed and businesses were struggling to
be agile so write this solution
hopefully will give all of our customers
a head start
when they have no sequel information to
analyze and again it's it's it's been an
absolute pleasure working with the team
on that is so great to hear thank you so
much for coming thank you thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
