is I was working with one of our paying
customers last month in June and they
have a really interesting deployment
it's much larger than 10,000 machines
actually it's all in ec2 arm for those
of you teased puppet you might know but
for those of you who haven't we do
automation want to mate large numbers of
systems in the same spaces like CF
engine and chef and that sort of thing
our network protocol is all HTTP so a
lot of our performance and scaling
centers around how to scale out standard
HTTP requests and where HTTPS so a lot
of it comes in with scaling out the ssl
encryption so i just wanted to run down
some of the numbers that that I ran into
when we're doing performance testing for
this customer last month NEC to they
were running on the x1 large instances
and for those of you have you used to
puppet have you gone all the way back to
like 0 2 48 or yes okay so with puppet
in the 0 2 480 era all of our
communication was xmlrpc rather than
rest and we found that this customer
needed to upgrade so we're only getting
about 500 requests per second on xmlrpc
and then moving from xml RPC to rest in
puppet 26 we actually doubled the
request rate so by changing nothing else
other than the actual encoding of the
HTTP we went up to about a thousand
requests per second so these are running
trips we tested just static file
delivery in ec2 and found that the
excellent large instances peaked out at
about 2,500 requests per second for just
a blank index dot HTML file they were
primarily concerned with retrieving
large numbers of files off the puppet
server with the current version of
puppet we got around 800 requests per
second without any tuning on the caching
so we're already moving up
hundred to a thousand and then moving
back with the actual file metadata so
the file metadata isn't that much worse
off than just static deliveries this is
actually going all the way through our
Ruby web service to actually get this so
we were we were wondering if we needed
to tune the actual Ruby application and
it didn't look like we're actually
suffering that much performance by by
running through the entire Ruby stack
over static content so then the customer
was already running puppet behind ngin
ex and unicorn which they found to be
really predictable under heavy load so
if you completely maxed out the
resources of a machine it wouldn't
completely fall over with other
technologies like passenger I think they
tried mongrel as well they just found
when you act when you hit the max
capacity of each one of these excellent
large instances performance just
completely degrade to nothing so
definitely take a look at ng INX in
unicorn if you're running ruby in the
ec2 so with that you know we were
getting about 800 requests per second
and then we turned on file cashing in
ngin X so that effectively takes any
request and with the cache timeout it
stores the response just on your local
file system and that gave us exact
performance for delivering static
content so we actually got the requests
up back up to 2500 requests per second
so the numbers to take away from my
five-minute talk or if you're running an
ec2 you can expect about 2500 HTTP
requests per second for an excellent
large puppet does scale out to manage
tens of thousands of nodes it's just a
matter of HTTP scaling we also found
there actually wasn't that much of a
performance gain offloading the SSL to a
front-end load balancer they're running
multiple backends and they found it to
be just as performant to let the
backends handle the SSL and just do tcp
on the front end if you're doing
performance testing definitely take a
look at sea
we tried a couple of other things to
generate load on these excellent large
instances and siege definitely helped
particularly if you're doing SSL so
that's pretty much it yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
