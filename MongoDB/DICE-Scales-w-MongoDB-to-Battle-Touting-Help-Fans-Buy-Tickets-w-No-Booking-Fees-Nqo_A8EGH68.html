discover new music they never would have
found otherwise to get them the tickets
to the best gigs with no queues no
faster no booking fees we provide mobile
ticketing and what that means is when
you buy a ticket it's tied to the phone
and because of that we can ensure
there's no doubting when tickets go on
sale at 9am everyone's in the app they
want to get their tickets and they want
to get on with that day if our system
goes down they can't get their tickets
so we need a platform which can respond
to the demand part of providing that
seamless experience then we needed a
database that could handle massive
traffic in a very short period of time a
MongoDB plays a crucial role we host all
of our instructor of dice on AWS this
allows us to scale out in response to
demand and to ensure that we can provide
one hundred percent up time to our fans
one challenge every company faces when
the hosting on the cloud is inevitable
loss of hardware failures network
connectivity with MongoDB we've never
had any downtime of our epic set since
launching in September 2014 dice has
sold over a million tickets for artists
such as adele justin bieber and many
smaller acts as part of our growth we've
delivered new features such as curated
live music recommendations and
hand-picked editorial at dice we want to
take the tickets out of the hands of the
touts and put them into the hands of our
fans MongoDB gives us the flexibility
and massive scale to make sure that we
can put fans first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
