tutorials my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate I'm here to teach you
more about getting started with our
database as a service Atlas today we'll
go over how to peer your VPC with
MongoDB Atlas and Amazon Web Services
MongoDB Atlas provides you with a number
of security features the one we'll
discuss now is the ability to transmit
your MongoDB data over the private
network subnet to your AWS virtual
private cloud or V PC
we'll discuss the two V pcs that we'll
be working with the Atlas V PC and your
host V PC if you're using a free tier m0
sandbox you'll need to upgrade to at
least a paid version of Atlas in order
to use peering Amazon provides you with
a default V PC for your account as well
as a number of guides to create a custom
V PC with specific subnets if you'd like
the Atlas V PC is automatically created
when you launch a cluster there's no
management of the subnets or the Gateway
required and you can extend the V PC by
appearing to your own personal host V PC
we're going to specifically ensure that
the IP space between our host and our
Atlas V PC can communicate via the
private IPs only one specific caveat you
need to keep in mind your Atlas Sider
block will not be able to be modified if
you've already launched a cluster you'll
have to make this decision on what IP
range is like for your Atlas cluster
before you get started but the one thing
that's important is it has to meet our
FC standard you can't use a bunch of
random IPS because you don't want them
to accidentally get routed over the
public Internet incidentally this is why
we tell you to use only private IP
blocks you can check our documentation
if you need specific information on
which IP blocks are referred to so as I
said before we're going to specifically
ensure that the IP space between our
host and our Atlas V PC can communicate
via the private IPS only this will
ensure that we're not permitting inbound
connections from the Internet to access
our database as well as isolating our
traffic within the AWS network it's
important to always ensure we're working
with two IP blocks that are different
this is an important part of how Atlas
does peering so in this tutorial we're
actually going to use the start V PC
build wizard and you can access it right
in the V PC section of your AWS account
so what I've done here is started
building a two tier V PC on our AWS side
so that's going to be a cider block of
10000 16
and that gives us a ton of private IPS
to get started with I'm not going to use
an ipv6 because it's not necessary and
then what I will do is give my VP C a
name we'll call J demo then what we need
to do is pick the public and the private
ipv4 ciders so in this case slash 24 is
perfectly fine we're going to have one
for our public subnet and that's to make
sure that our host network still can
create things such as app servers or web
servers and then we'll have our private
ipv4 Sider subnet and we're going to be
using this specifically to just transmit
network traffic between our atlas
cluster and our host V PC we don't have
any preference for raz and we're just
going to call our private subnet private
subnet now we have to allocate an IP for
NAT gateway this is to kind of ensure
that we still can have network access
for our public subnets so I'll pick an
EIP that I've already allocated attach
it we don't need a service endpoint we'd
want to make sure that we enable DNS
host names Hardware tenancy really isn't
important and we're not going to be
working with classic link so we'll just
click create V PC and after a few
minutes it'll go ahead and complete the
process so while our host V PC is
building just want to give you some
information I put these two side-by-side
because I think it'll look a little bit
easier for you you'll be able to see
what we're doing on one side while the
other side doing its work so in this
particular case will be working in
peering and as we talked about before we
have a separate block of IPS configure
just for your Atlas V PC you want to
make sure that this never is the same of
any of these on this side and the reason
why is we don't want our blocks to step
on one another this is how we ensure
peering occurs between our two V pcs so
we finish building our V PC for a host
and we've already got a running Atlas
cluster so let's get these two peered
first what we'll do is go to security
we'll go to peering and then we'll click
new peering connection the first step
will be to enter in our AWS account ID
if you don't know it is click this it'll
show you a quick tip on how to get it by
going just to my account preference
and you should be able to just copy and
paste it right here into the AWS account
ID information next let's grab our VPC
ID this is found right here in our V PC
AWS console we just copy it paste it
here and we know we're using the right
one because when we created our host V
PC I tagged it J demo great now we see
here our region is us East one this has
to match on both the Atlas ID and your
host side we won't be able to do cross
region next we'll talk about our V PC
cider this is a cider block that cannot
overlap your Atlas V PC that's right
here and remember we can't modify this
if we've already launched a cluster if
we needed a different what we would do
is say start a new group and then go
ahead and peer those so let's go ahead
and we'll add our cedar block paste it
in here and then we'll initiate peering
great so now this process is going to
continue and it will basically make a
connection over here and ask is it ok
for me to peer with this account so it
will deploy the change and then
eventually we'll go over here to peering
connections right here we've got pending
accept and what we'll do is right click
it it will accept the request so that
will ask us are you sure you want to
peer these two accounts so that's the
requester account which is our Atlas
side and then we have our host side
which is ours so we'll say yes accept
click yes and then the peering
connection will be established so now
what we've gone ahead and finished our
peering connection we'll wait for the
approval to finish typically it takes a
few minutes you'll just notice right
here how do I approve this connection
it'll go on you may see this yellow but
the really important part now is that we
actually get our subnets taken care of
so without actually going ahead and
modifying the route tables for our
subnets we really won't be able to
actually use this so next step is we're
going to go to route tables and we're
going to see our to route tables we've
got one for our public and one for our
private we can tell that this one's for
our private because we've got an at
Gateway set here for how
actually do Internet traffic you can
also look at subnet associations and
you'll see this is the private subnet
that we said when we created our V PC so
all we need to do now is go to routes
and we're going to edit our route we're
going to add another route and what
we'll need to do is go in to our peirong
section and remember we took this is our
V PC side or for that side but we have
this side for our atlas so we'll copy
and we'll paste this here and then what
we'll do is a drop down so this PC X
device now that's our peering device
we'll click that and then all we have to
do is click Save as you can see here our
peering connection says it's available
our routes are configured properly to go
through our peer and now we're ready to
actually start using our atlas cluster
so if we look at IP whitelist
we'll see here that we've already got
our full cider block white listed for
our atlas cluster and if we really
wanted to what we could do is go to
security groups create a security group
within our V PC so it's j demo s create
and then we'll get a specific name for
our new security group in this case
right here it's SG e 4/3 B etc etc we'll
copy it
we'll add the IP address and what we'll
do is put it right there and we'll
comment it we'll call it security group
and then confirm and by doing this we
can start using logical security groups
within AWS to start whitelisting rather
than using IP blocks so we're just about
done but we actually need to test to
make sure the connections work so what
I'll do is create a host within my host
V PC I've already picked that it's going
to be in the security group I created
before and I've picked just in a
Bluetooth server we'll click Launch I'll
pick my key acknowledge and we'll wait
for it to build so now it's time for the
last part of this which is we're going
to test so I built an ec2 instance
within our public
subnet and I'm going to go here and grab
one of our host names from our cluster
I'll just select copy and then I'll type
in host and the host name

Atlas contact our support team at any
