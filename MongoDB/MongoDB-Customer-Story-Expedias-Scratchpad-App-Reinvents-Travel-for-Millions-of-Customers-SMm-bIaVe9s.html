travel site and we have millions of
shoppers all over the world plannin book
their travel and our mission at Expedia
is to reinvent travel through the power
of technology
a typical shopper does about 48 searches
across various travel sites before they
booked a flight and then they had to buy
the hotel in the car and other
activities that they want to purchase
for that trip in addition our research
shows us that users typically forget
what they looked at and they sometimes
resort to traditional tools like a pen
and paper to take notes our typical user
might start a shopping experience on
their laptop at home and then on the way
to work they might power up their mobile
device and continue the shopping and
once they reach work maybe they get a
break at lunch and they do more searches
during that period and they do this over
many different time intervals in
sessions and what they plan to do a
scratch pads to keep track of these
interactions so that you can continue
your shopping seamlessly across devices
so that we can deliver a personalized
and relevant experience to the user to
make an informed decision the conversion
rates for people who interact with the
scratchpad product is much higher than
people who don't we needed a very
flexible document structure and MongoDB
really provided that for us we built the
first prototype a scratch pad and under
two months and we launched production in
about four or five months I believe we
change the schema structure about three
times since we envisioned scratch pad
and pretty radically and the fact that
we were able to develop a system that's
running in production at scale is my
favorite part of anomaly if you're
looking for a flexible
document oriented datastore that's
performing and scales easily then you
should definitely look at MongoDB if you
work with teens that are agile and
working in a creative adaptive testing
on methodology then you should
definitely look at MongoDB as well and
the fact that MongoDB comes with
inherent capabilities like sharding and
that take assets and taking backups
makes it a no-brainer as a tool to
consider</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
