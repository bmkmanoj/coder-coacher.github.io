Craigslist I work on a lot of our
back-end data systems person I've been
using my skull for 10 years or so now I
spent a lot of time doing that at Yahoo
and came to Craigslist and they were on
my skull shop as well but there were
certain pain points we were seeing in
particularly with what we call our
archive database cluster which holds
every posting this urban scene on
Craigslist and we've had multiple
whipping in multiple ways we had
hardware problems we had growing pains
and we had issues of wanting to make a
change and having the altar table take
months literally I spent some time
looking at it and it kind of dawned on
me that we didn't really need a
relational database here like the the
data does not the data is not relational
so it doesn't not necessary it doesn't
mean we need to store it in relational
database we could but we don't have to
and I start looking at alternatives and
said you know what's out there there's
all these new database systems coming
out on the market open-source projects
so I'm getting momentum might I should
really look around and quickly realize
that a lot of them are document stores
and that map perfectly what we really
wanted in this case and I started
noticing that people I knew what we're
doing interesting work we're all looking
at or trying to use MongoDB and just
when I started thinking about looking at
alternative data stores it was one of
the first ones on the list because I
heard enough about it and people started
just they were having good experiences
with it it seemed like I was trying to
get a track record and that's when I
really started paying attention and so I
think about what other features mattered
and having things like you know built-in
ability to handle failures of a single
note was very interesting to us being
able to handle charting and distribution
of data was very interesting to us
because these are both things that
require human intervention in our
current system and involve a lot of time
from our operations team and just a lot
of hassle and after a while you start to
wonder has anyone else to solve this
problem and you know when we looked at
MongoDB we started to see answers to all
these problems one of the issues I ran
into looking at other alternatives to
MySQL when I looked at all the new
database systems out there as it's got
to have a good pro driver we don't want
to spend the engineering time
necessarily create our own and keep up
with a protocol or wrap an existing C
library
to deal with all the changes when they
come out and you know my experience has
been great so far at the pearl driver we
we ran into an issue one time with it
contacted the engineering team it was
fixed very fast it was like two hours
and we had a fix committed everything
was working fine so it's been great
this is our first deployment of MongoDB
and we're really trying to get our feet
wet and get a sense for what it's good
for what is not good for and you get
comfortable with it and so far
everything's going really well
in fact in our in our development
testing we had some hardware failures
and the replica set kept working which
was great validation I didn't have to
simulate that by unplugging the network
card or something it's just something
failed on its own and they dealt with it
which was awesome there are a lot of
other things that we could look at you
know we can look at things like
real-time analytics which we don't have
enough of and we don't do particularly
well there are other parts of our other
systems we have that may benefit from
adopting more of a document model in a
relation relational model you know we
kind of look at the main database even
and some of us kind of squint at it go
why is even that relational and so it
kind of opened your mind up and so what
else could we improve while we're doing
this and and we're gonna look around to
see you know by and large I'm seeing you
know day after day I see people jumping
on MongoDB trying it out and it's
there's a lot of momentum there and
that's exciting to me because it kind of
makes me feel like I made the right
choice it's not just that it works for
me but it works for a lot of people and
that tells me there's also gonna be good
future there too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
