tutorials my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate I'm here to teach you
more on how to get started using MongoDB
Atlas our database as a service today
we'll go over how to apply your Atlas
coupon or prepay code to your account
if you've received a prepaid code from
your sales associate or want to try
using MongoDB Atlas with a promotional
coupon you need to enter it into the
payment section to access the payment
section in MongoDB Atlas go to settings
once you've reached settings go to
billing and subscriptions as you see we
haven't entered a payment method yet so
we don't have any charges yet so now we
have the ability to either add a coupon
code or add a prepaid coupon or add a
payment method like a credit card so
let's click the pencil next to payment
method and we'll see that we have a
section here that says coupon or
activation code if you've purchased a
prepaid activation code from your
salesperson what you can do is check
your email for it
it should look something like this what
you can do take the code copy it we'll
go back to our payment method and we'll
paste it in right here click Save
Changes once you've entered your code
you can look at the credit section and
now you'll see the prepaid credit that
you've added has been applied to the
account you'll see the $85 that I've
added can now be used to spin up new
clusters if you're running into any
Atlas issues contact our support team at
any time click the support link in the
lower left of your Atlas interface or go
