senior Solutions Architect with Mama DB
based in Toronto Canada I'm here to take
a few minutes here time to talk about
Mama DB Alice mom with V's fully managed
database to the surface solution let's
get started
imagine that you have an idea for a
project that could take advantage of
MongoDB vast array of features and
functionalities such as its flexible
data model or its inherent high
availability and disaster recovery you
want to get started immediately but the
data has to reside somewhere typical
on-premise deployments have you spending
weeks if not months
worrying about procuring multiple server
instances installing and setting up
operating systems considering networks
with the proper security and role based
access controls in place installing the
proper dependencies ensuring you are
following MongoDB best practices along
with many manual steps in between you
can instead with a few clicks of a
button choose which MongoDB version you
want deployed where your data is stored
and with what cloud provider instant
size deployment architecture backup
strategy and have it all deployed in
minutes if not seconds
it's quite common that you already
prototyped your application using the
community version of MongoDB or it's
even possible that you are already in
production or want to offload the
operation side of the project so your
team can focus solely on innovation
migrations from ground to cloud
especially zero downtime migrations are
always tricky and sometimes an
insurmountable task utilizing MongoDB
live migration tool long premiere
midnight maintenance windows are now a
thing of the past
Mongo mere utilizes mom would be B's
inherent replication techniques such as
replica set clustering and killing are
offline
this allows your existing MongoDB
cluster whether that is in the
on-premise or in another cloud instance
to replicate its data to a model DV
Atlas both securely using SSL and IP
whitelisting and in an always-on fashion
meaning your live cluster is still
accepting its normal traffic once the
replication is finished and your new
Atlas cluster is in sync you can pull
your app servers over to your shiny new
Atlas cluster now that you have your
data in Atlas you may have team members
who want to get a better sense of what
the data looks like sitting in mono you
can point a model with shell and run
some queries sure you could also utilize
the atlases data Explorer to visually
explore your data and run queries and
get responses immediately from your
database another useful feature of data
Explorer is that you can view
information about your indexes including
index usage statistics this will help
you keep your databases lean and
efficient now that you have an
application running against your Atlas
cluster you probably want to see how its
performance database metrics like
operations per second hottest collection
slowest operation and distillation are
most likely all important to you to
ensure that your application is
performing update la and general peace
of mind not to mention to help diagnose
issues when things aren't performing as
expected
Atlas captures these metrics along with
dozens more in a real-time fashion
to give instant actionable information
with our real-time forward stop for
example if you notice that after a few
months of growth your queries have
significantly slowed looking at your
various metrics you notice that the
number of page faults have skyrocketed
requiring more disease we know now that
we can simply increase the RAM to ensure
the working set 15 numbers or rework our
document model to increase query
efficiency of course you can't have eyes
on all of the metrics 24 hours a day
MongoDB analyst give an exceptionally
rich set of alerting functionality right
from the Atlas UI model DBMS will give
you the ability to send automatic
notifications when your database
operations or server usage reach define
thresholds that affect your clusters
performance for example if we see that
our disk utilization is approaching 80%
we can send a notification to our dev
ops team by a popular channels such as
slack or float on ok so now we have data
in our MongoDB APIs cluster and we are
about to go into or just started
production we understand that if you
lose data due to corruption catastrophe
or otherwise our business is going to
lose revenue we need a backup strategy
enter Atlas queryable backups MongoDB
Atlas lets you choose how fun the grain
you want to take snapshots of your
database whether that's every few hours
once per day week month and how long you
store those for we also give you full
point in time recovery utilizing our
MongoDB aqua with both most features you
are able to restore the database to
absolutely any state down to the
operational level of granularity
although that is you great security and
knowing that you can restore your
database to any point in time that you
want running a full database restore is
often a cumbersome and lengthy task what
if you had a clumsy VBA
drop a small chunk of data and you only
want to restore that small chunk well
with Atlas
snapshot is quite simple you open up a
tunnel to the snapshot that has the data
before it was deleted you query for the
exact data you want and then you restore
it back into the collection it's that
simple
well now you have a better understanding
on the power of MongoDB is our fully
managed database as a service solution
you know that you can be up and running
in minutes with a fully featured
Enterprise ready fully secured MongoDB
cluster point with MongoDB best
practices if you want any more
information on MongoDB is and how you
can utilize it contact your account
executive thank you so much for watching
this video and until next time see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
