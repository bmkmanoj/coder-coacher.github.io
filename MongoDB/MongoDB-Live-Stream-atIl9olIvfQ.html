talking you all day here from MongoDB
world and we're about to continue
another series of interviews with
MongoDB users developers and partners
and right now we've got one of our
partners probably one of our biggest and
most important partners out of Israel
because you are the singular distributor
of MongoDB in Israel once you are still
over from matrix yeah so first of all
thanks for inviting me it's no problem
for me great honor to be the kickee so
actually I'm I'm working at matrix we
are the IT integrator in Israel we are
covering all the fields in the IT area
and we are our journey with MongoDB
started like five years ago when we
realized that we need to bring a new
innovation
it gives in the database layer to our
customer in that time a lot of there was
a big demand of new technologies that
enable the faster development and so on
sure and then we realize that it's a
good opportunity for us and we start
analyzing the show can you find the
market and and we find out that there's
more than 300 vendors Oh database Veda
which is used and then we need to decide
which one we would like to present we
are adding sated by I belong to the sort
of division Part II and we are
presenting the software vendors in
series and we are promoting things so so
you're making the decision to help
technologies implement stuff like the
document model as part of their
application correct yes so what was it
about the document model you think that
really worked for your customers okay so
we we found out that the the
like the new kind of application at the
different min in the new me that the
flexible model yes
and then that's one that was one of the
key indicator for us to choose a MongoDB
because it was the leading software for
the document model sure this is money
and on the other end we it was really
important for us to choose a
general-purpose database that enable you
know get rid of that lock in you all
right yeah go to to to add the window
locking yeah
and that's that so we we start the
journey five years ago it was very
excited and after five years I can say
that we are enabled to penetrate into a
lot of companies across across the
market from the security sector to pull
the final sector and and Israel's become
such a tremendous hub for technology
companies doing new and innovative
things so it's great to have someone who
is part of that big data story for
Israel and all the other nations that
are coming to us really get big software
written so you've been here at MongoDB
world for both days correct yes for both
this actually I came two days ago we
part of the party from a console so we
had the Monday a nice day and then this
today and a yeah great well you know
what um I hope you you've got to do some
great stuff while you were here meet
some interesting people and and get
people to understand what metrics is
doing to help companies implement
MongoDB and other technology standards
so everybody who stopped by today I've
been able to give them a little gift as
parting as I like to do so I want to
give you this is one of our silly fidget
spinners and a stitch t-shirt for our
latest product Thank You Zola thank you
very much we're going to have a bunch
more interviews coming on for the next
few hours or so maybe two so keep your
eyes open keep asking the questions keep
making comments we want to hear from you
