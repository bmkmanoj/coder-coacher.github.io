product manager here at MongoDB and I
wanted to kick this off by really sort
of taking a step back before we talk
about office manager and really
emphasize that we're all here because
I'm all going to be the database is
increasingly popular and you know it's
hard to avoid these days and
increasingly we are responsible for
keeping it running in various
organizations so you know it is indeed
just about the fastest growing database
you can find out there it's increasingly
ubiquitous across all kinds of
organizations and we're very excited
that this week's release of Monga to be
3.0 and ops manager really represent a
new foundation for the product and the
suite of tooling around it to really
bring this bring mom going to be and its
uses to the next level now with that I
will introduce ops manager which we
believe is the best way to manage mom's
going to be in your data center oh we
think that while it requires some
upfront set-up time in the end it will
save you on the order of 95 percent of
the overall operational overhead and
what that really means is you can do a
heck of a lot more what you're going to
want as you know MongoDB is scaled and
takes on more use cases within your
organization ranging from you know
offload of legacy systems moving away
from those monastic monolithic
relational deployments as well as new
applications that are merging all around
us all the time so who is ops manager
for well the answer is it's for folks
who are operations professionals
administrators sis admin's etc folks who
care about SL A's service level failover
recovery time those kinds of things
capacity reliability cost and
consistency is everything being done in
a way that is centralized controlled
that you can feel comfortable with that
you can feel does not represent risk
for you and your business stakeholders
so we're trying to get away awesome
manager is trying to get you away from
having to rely on custom manual mistake
and risk prone methodologies of course a
lot of us have invested a lot of time in
doing robust scripted operational
procedures and you know that's that's
fantastic I'm still hopeful that we can
provide into your stack a very useful
tool that just does bring in some
consistency for the MongoDB specific
deployment configuration changes we'll
get more into that in a little bit
overlook ops manager really helps you
cut over cut management overhead follow
the mom going to be best practices for
automation you're using automation meet
those SLA that you and your business
stakeholders require as well as scale
easily because scaling today you know
you basically have to be able to sort of
scale anything in the event that it
becomes successful or you know becomes
more popular or etc you just never know
these days and you don't want to have to
invest significant resources into scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
