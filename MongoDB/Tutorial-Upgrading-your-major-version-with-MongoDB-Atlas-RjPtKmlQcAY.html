name's Jay and I'm a developer advocate
here with MongoDB and I'm here to teach
you more on how to get started using our
database as a service Atlas today we'll
go over how to upgrade your major
version of MongoDB with Atlas before we
perform any changes let's talk quickly
about MongoDB Atlas and your version of
MongoDB an m10 and above Atlas cluster
allows you to run MongoDB versions three
two and three for m0s
which are our free tier only permit you
to use MongoDB version 3 for regardless
of using MongoDB 3 2 or 3 for all of
your minor version upgrades will be
handled automatically for you you can
always see what current minor version
you're running of MongoDB Atlas by just
clicking your Atlas cluster name you can
see right up here at the top if you'd
like to get information on when you're a
minor version has been upgraded you can
go to alerts you can go to all activity
you go to types and you can filter by
upgrade you'll see that there's a host
has been upgraded section that you can
filter and get information with specific
dates and times that your host has been
upgraded because this is pretty new we
haven't had an upgrade yet
MongoDB Atlas includes a direct upgrade
path from MongoDB version 3 to 2 3 4 but
before we do that we want to ensure we
have backups
there is no downgrade path so you'll
want to ensure that if you need to go
back to 3 2 you have an existing backup
click backups click your cluster name
and as you can see we have a snapshot
here that's already set with 3 to 12 now
that we've confirmed we have a backup
it's time to get started with our
upgrade from 3 to 2 3 4 so let's click
configuration and if we look at the top
we'll see we have a link here to change
version click change version and you'll
see we have 3 to which we're currently
running and we can go ahead and select 3
4 as we stated before after upgrading to
3 4 you will not be able to downgrade to
previous versions so make sure you have
a backup also at this time if you'd like
to make any other additional changes to
your cluster feel free
they'll all be done at the same time
click confirm and deploy and as you can
see our upgrades begun the process to
upgrade may take several minutes
depending on the amount of data that you
have but as you can see we've gone ahead
completed or upgrade to 3/4 if you go to
your metrics section you're actually
able to see the individual hosts that
are updated one at a time because it's
done one two and three your primary
always remains online and your data
continues to flow in and out from your
application regardless of the upgrade
process if you're running into any Atlas
issues contact our support team at any
time click the support link in the lower
left of your Atlas interface or go to
MongoDB comm slash contact thanks for
