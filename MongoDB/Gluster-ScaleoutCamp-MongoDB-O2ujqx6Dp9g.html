I'm the director of communities for
gluster and we talk about Lester FS if
you've seen any of the previous cloud
camps we've done the same talk for
everyone so I thought I'd change it up a
little different so I might fall on my
face but I also get the opportunity to
40 slides in five minutes so we'll see
how it goes awesome storage socks next
it's a black box you can't see inside of
it like this wait wait I had hardware
clothes software closed again it's a
black box okay so hardware and software
actually two black boxes see hardware
box office I but why is this suck it
works me i can buy a box with
proprietary software it works at store
smiles if i can get files off of it
what's the problem it's 3m do you know
where your data is business runs on data
laughing if you're not able to push your
data to another device at a moment's
notice then your business is vulnerable
and you've just accumulate more risk
than you need why would you do this what
is transparent enough can you do what
can you do with your data if you need to
move your data where can you put it no
art zinc is not solution well sometimes
but no data should always be available
and at the ready you should be always be
there when you need it whatever you want
to do with it an accessible be any
software or hardware technology so
whether you have mounted over sits in a
fast whether you're going to rest three
going through Swift it should be
accessible to you whatever your choice
they need to be redundant reliable
replicated distributed and fail proof
avoid single points of failure so
multiple locations mama needs some of
the locations are needed site lots of
copies keep stuff safe equals locks that
used to be any other project I was that
that always stayed with me over the
years I don't happen that projects at
Stanford you look it up good
but what if you have lots of files how
do you know where they all are
California Oregon what if we save the
location date of each file that way
we'll know where to find it hmm wait is
it you skip one know what if we say the
location a beautiful get that way when
the word find it good hmm where would we
put it aha I'll create a special note
just to keep metadata for my files so we
have here file metadata server see the
way it keeps track of all files go ahead
and interesting happens as we try to
scale any guesses what happens I don't
know let's let's find out okay we get
lots of stuff coming out of the file
metadata server that's a problem because
the finally a server doesn't scale
beyond that single note mr. metadata
server becomes a sad panda how many
presentations you see that panda so no
transparency is not enough scaling is
necessary to there must be a better way
what if we stored information on each
file and that what if we stored
information about the file with the file
if we did that it would need to be very
tiny information could we come up with a
unique hash and stick it in the X adders
of every file yes we can good and could
the algorithm create unique hatches that
function as data vectors SI SE fuera go
ahead enter the elastic hatching
algorithm the elastic hash always knows
or as Monty burns would say he's asked
to care so isn't it great but won't we
have in replications of the same files
the elastic cash always knows can
calculate the shortest path to desired
data
for replicated data the location of the
request matters there's people there
people use ghost our best this is a side
note replicate data across many data
centers the location of the request gets
routed to the shortest path so what if
your data is in mobile locations on
different platforms EG amazon EBS s3
private cloud bare metal nast a bum
whatever is it possible to access all of
your data is one mounted file system
regardless of platform C safeway elastic
ash muy bueno sir so technical fail oh
that's right so now we can with your
part don't wait wait no boo zzzz sleep
oh ouch they're running on there you go
okay good okay so so what your job marks
talking about for technology that's
inside the cluster an image or adjust
their virtual appliance
file server instance today we can
actually install an improper now the
file server that can include me
including the global namespace also
includes a file server NFL
in the public mind
amazon web services go grid another
flails coming and now
file servers POSIX NFS client call
servers in the one
drive
calling now
so that's possible longer very limited
to
our nodes with the MC of hpmc sorry let
me that's there
namespace NetApp's little better there
are file servers that's going to gold
but we've taken a software-only approach
the software approach we've installed a
public cloud private cloud from a
quadrant cloud you can even do object
storage if blustered police last week
cluster of us three not three that does
the final surgery and objects are so
it's restful compliance on history and
you can now create an object and access
it with an NFS or six interface look at
files and object execute on those modern
update news files have them as an object
or if you have be run quieter you can do
that
that's three mark if you like so that's
what we do here's here's what we do from
the object respective disclosed object
you can access it from NFS our sense of
cluster f s which is like pms familiar
level and get in just let's just say
their fate of their photos to naming
temperature lots of pictures right here
we're going to go ahead and change the
10-day tour the color one phone
you can go back
ok
no more time but its mario another
regarding second tree house green i
would say instead exactly watch the
press releases to watch the news that
okay I try someone to mention open us on
and we'll see some very interesting and
its object an integrated bonded together
so another man
