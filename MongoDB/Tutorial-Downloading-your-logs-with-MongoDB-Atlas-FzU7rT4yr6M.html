my name is Jay and I'm a developer
advocate I'm here to teach you more
about getting started with our database
as a service atlas today we'll go over
accessing your Atlas clusters MongoDB
logs
MongoDB Atlas makes it easy for you to
retrieve logs from your cluster for
troubleshooting without concerning
yourself with SSH commands on a server
sometimes when you build that you need
to see more details from the server-side
and ensure you're getting the best
performance you can also use log data as
a way for testing for your index
efficiency so we'll log in Atlas and
then we'll go to clusters once we're in
clusters we'll see that I'm using an M
30 now for you free tier m0 users our m0
cluster does not permit access to these
logs so you'll need to use an atlas
paint cluster so let's begin by going to
our cluster clicking on its name and
after we click on its name we'll go
ahead and see that each node is
represented here now what we can do is
click on the primary because this is
where all of our rights are occurring
here we'll see some metrics and a bunch
of charts for our individual nodes what
we can do here now is click more and
within war we'll see download logs this
is essentially what we need to do to get
our logs so we'll click download logs
and then we'll pick our time so I just
launched this cluster within the last 24
hours so I'll just click 24 hours of
activity and download our logs great so
as you can see now our logs have been
downloaded now we can go ahead and open
the file so once you click download logs
you'll get a gzip file and this gzip
file should be able to be open on any
major operating system using a double
click and decompressing the file however
I prefer to use a terminal so that's
what I'll do so I'll gun zip our cluster
0 file great then I can open it with my
favorite editor so I'll just look up the
file using vim so we'll go into cluster
0 we'll look at it and this is a really
great way to check your indexes
efficiency by just looking up call scan
and that refers to a collection scan so
as we can see here we've got a few
collection scans and probably my indexes
aren't being used properly so remember
that all rights are saved to your blog
and that's where your primary is going
to store all these types of log messages
so you'll want to check your primary
first then you can look at your
secondaries and see how they're
responding one of the most important
things you'll remember is there are
additional tools out there
like M log info which is a part of the M
tools package that you can use to
analyze these logs
if you're running into any issues with
Atlas contact our support team at any
time click the support button in the
lower left of your Atlas screen or go to
MongoDB comm slash contact thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
