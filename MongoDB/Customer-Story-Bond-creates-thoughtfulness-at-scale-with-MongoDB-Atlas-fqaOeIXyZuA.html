marketing social media banner ads and
direct mail the personal touch is more
important than ever my name is Sam bro
I'm the head of product and technology
at bond for the last three years we've
been creating digital products that
enable our customers to send beautiful
thoughtful handwritten correspondence
from their computer or phone we knew
that our product was taking off when we
started receiving tens of thousands of
note orders and had to quickly figure
out how to keep up with that demand we
believe that most companies want to do
really nice personal things for their
customers but the real reason people
don't or the businesses don't is because
it's a scale problem what we were out
solving a scale problem for our
customers we actually ran into a scale
problem of our own when we initially
built our product we built it on a
relational database we ran into an issue
where we were getting so much data that
we weren't able to ensure consistent
writes because of how many reads we were
doing it became clear that we were
running into scale issues when our team
was focused more on our infrastructure
than they were on building the product
we investigated a handful of options for
our new database some required too much
infrastructure some didn't have enough
availability but MongoDB fit right into
our scope what was important to us was
consistency of data and availability
without having to worry about
partitioning one of the things that
concerned me when we began talking about
switching from a relational database to
a no sequel database was the complex
queries I knew we had to run for our
reporting especially across collections
fortunately MongoDB is aggregation
framework allowed us the same
functionality once we made the switch to
MongoDB we were able to double the
number of messages we sent in only two
months from the number we had sent the
entire year before we wanted our
developers focused on building out our
products and not messing around with
infrastructure we decided to go with a
third party hosting solution but we
began running into problems with
encryption and flexibility the third
party vendors we were using for our
MongoDB instances didn't give us the
flexibility to tune our settings exactly
to our needs we heard about MongoDB
Atlas pretty much right away after it
was launched and we decided to build a
prototype do a proof-of-concept and see
how it worked
we loved the results and we almost
immediately began switching our
infrastructure over to MongoDB Atlas
MongoDB is not only helping us solve
scale problems with our customer facing
products but it's also helping us solve
fulfillment scale problems that we have
with our robotic fleet and our internal
filmin system now that we've switched a
MongoDB Atlas we're in a much better
place to be able to meet the demands of
our customers at bond we believe
everybody wants to be more thoughtful
and that we can create the technology
and the tools that make that easier it
helps people communicate better it helps
people be nicer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
