managers on the core database server and
I'm Jason carry with me a lead engineer
all right as you guys know MongoDB is
developing multi document acid
transactions well I'm going to be a
distributed system so applications that
are backed by MongoDB can scale out
automatically as the data grows beyond
the size of one node and they can
automatically be resilient in cases of
node failure however the implementation
of transactions and distributed systems
requires non-trivial coordination and
consistency across these nodes that
standalone systems just don't have to
worry about we wanted to deliver
transactions without sacrificing the
rest but we didn't get here overnight
the engineering effort and the path to
transactions has been spanned many many
years of engineering effort there's been
many projects along the way that are
interesting and fundamental to
transactions and one of those as logical
sessions what which is what Jason is
going to talk to us about today so I'll
pass it over to Jason okay thank you
alright so as Elly saying I'm talking
about logical sessions it's a feature
that we deployed in 3.6 that enables a
couple of interesting use cases and sort
of an important part of our long term
transaction story and I guess I want to
sort of start off with talking about
what transactions are how they're
represented and then walk through a
couple of use cases for where we're
using in them in 3.6 and as I'm going
through those use cases I'll talk a
little bit about how they're implemented
and what's sort of interesting about
them in our system and so let's start
from the top
logical session IDs are very very
lightweight identifier is that we can
tag to other sort of resources and
operations in our system and they're
made up of two major parts the first is
an ID which is a globally unique
identifier and sort of like as the the
technical term gooood I a range of bytes
that are generated generally from a
source of randomness there's a couple of
different schemes to generate them and
they're meant to be something that you
can generate local to your machine and
still end up with an identifier that is
never going to collide with any others
that are generated in your distributed
system and then secondarily we also have
a UID
that is a shot 256 digests of your fully
qualified username and so this means
that clients they're generating the ID
portion but they're always fully
disambiguated from all other clients
this has some sort of important security
and practical implementation details
that we'll talk about a little bit later
right and it's important that the
clients are able to generate these IDs
from a performance perspective right so
you don't have to reach out to the
server in order to get this ID
absolutely we wanted you to be able to
use logical session IDs with every kind
of operation and the server in 3.6 and
so we didn't want to add more than just
the 48 bytes of sort of overhead that
this scheme is providing and avoid you
having to go to a centralized server or
synchronize you do extra no trips
anything like that great and so that
gets us to our sort of first use case
which I'm calling easy administration
and so in order to really describe what
I'm talking about I'm gonna walk through
a little bit of MongoDB sort of
deployment architecture as a distributed
system a couple of common use cases in
that system and what logical session IDs
bring to the table that wasn't there in
3.4 and so to begin with I want to talk
a little bit about the two kinds of
distributed NISS that exists in MongoDB
um the first one has to do with high
availability and it has to do with
ensuring that data that you write to our
database survives any particular node
failure and so we call these replica
sets and they are what's in sort of
inside of these boxes here and you'll
notice that we have three things called
Mongo Dee's in this case those are
database server processes meant to live
on different physical nodes and some of
them marked essence of mark peak there's
one p in each particular set and that
indicates a primary or the others or
secondaries and it's worth emphasizing
that being a primary or secondary is an
ephemeral state for a node isn't
something that you're started with it's
startup and live with forever rather
nodes sort of all start out equal and
there's an election that takes place
where one of them becomes the primary
and this can change over the lifetime of
the cluster during node failures or
network partitions and so that's a
replica set and this is the way that we
ensure that you don't lose data we write
to a primary and then replicate that
data from
two secondaries and once your data is on
a majority of those nodes you can
understand that even in the event of
node failure your right will still be
durable but there's another half of the
story what if you want to store more
data than fits on any single physical
host and that's where sharding comes in
where replication provides a set of
nodes that all have exact comp well not
exact opposite have full data sets
sharding instead means that the
individual shards have slices of the
overall data and so the way this works
is that you have your app and so that's
one of these red boxes up here and you'd
let's say I'd like to do a write so this
is you're writing a document for the
first time so you go out and you're
right goes to a Mongo s and then it
picks some shard where it's going to
write the data based on a routing table
that's available to all of the different
long glasses so it's going to write your
data though then later on you might come
through and you might talk to a
different Mongo less that has the same
routing table and you might want to read
the data back and sometimes the date of
the year reading isn't necessarily on
the same notes this is sort of a
distinguished based on a shard key
that's in either the document that
you're saving or maybe in the query that
you're using if your query can be you
can figure out which shard the data will
go to you don't have to talk to all the
shards you can talk to just to the ones
where the data could live so you might
have read that goes out to these two
particular charts so this is a query
that might span multi date like multiple
documents that don't necessarily all
live on the same chart absolutely and
one of the things that these reads do is
that they well first there so they do
two things they open two types of
interesting sort of artifacts on the
servers one is that there are jobs that
are running we call these operations and
so you might have an OP and then
additionally you can have and these are
things that are actively running so it
might be an administrative Quran command
that you're in the middle of executing
or it might be about going to disk and
fetching the i/o to actually do the work
go for the query so those are the
absolutely active and then secondarily
you have these other things which I'll
call cursors and a cursor is sort of
can be downstream of an operation where
we do a find open a cursor and then to
6:00 to fetch successive batches you
issue get more commands against that
cursor which return you more information
and so the cursor has both a batch of
data to return as well as instructions
about how to get the next batch and
cursors are going to sort of be
interesting a little bit later and sole
keep those in mind and I'm gonna talk
right here about how things work in 3.4
in the event that something goes wrong
so let's say that you start off a
command that you thought or a fine
command that you thought was actually
going to be easy because you were
planning on targeting an index and then
you realize that you actually screwed up
and now you're talking to all of your
shards and you're scanning through all
of their data what you can do can be
more or less limited and in particular
you're in a bad place if you're Mongo s
just goes away maybe it crashes
something else happens now each of these
cursors they're just gone there's no way
to really talk about them assuming that
you set a timeout on them they will
eventually timeout but that'll happen
individually and Norma's amount of work
might occur to fill them up with their
first batch of data and there's no way
for you to get at them and one of the
big things the logical sessions add ads
in 3.6 is that all of these commands now
these are this right path and then also
these reads there now tagged with a
logical session ID and so that means
along with all of the messages that
we're sending in to the server along
with the regular payload we also have
the logical session ID and that means
that these cursors and these ops are now
tagged
they're not regular cursors they're
cursors annotated with a logical session
ID and you can list session by users
right like you can list your sessions
that you have by user ID you in a
certain way you absolutely can there's
both well they're sort of an
implementation detail that we'll get to
a little bit later about the global
notion of the sessions table but you can
also look inside of any particular Mongo
D and you can list all the sessions for
running operations that are available
there it's the dollar list local
sessions aggregation stage so you can
use that for instance to find all the
sessions for
user if you'd like absolutely and what
this allows is it allows you to go ahead
and now we have the exact same scenario
where we have this read command that was
going off that's going off the rails
maybe you typed it in manually from the
shell and you realize you've made a
mistake now you have a way of cleaning
it up
what you do is you issue a kill sessions
command and you can kill either by a
specific session or all the sessions for
your user
and that'll propagate a kill command
that will go to or let's say in this
case let's say this was an errant
process in this app is Rachelle oh sorry
about that just talk to one of them
we're gonna do a kill command and this
kill is going to go out to every single
line of these shards and it's going to
say please kill this logical session ID
and it's going to find all of the
operations that are in those processes
that have matching LS IDs and they're
going to if there are running operation
cancel them if they're a cursor close
them and so in this way it's very easy
in 3.6 to ensure that work is always
cancelable it so he's stoppable you
don't necessarily have to have the same
sort of administrative privileges to do
this work that you need in 3.4 where
we've sort of lost track of who owns
these objects and so you need someone
like you have to go find a DBA to fix
your problem now you can fix it yourself
and so that's the story that we're
calling easy administration which leads
us onto sort of our second story which
feeds into more what logical sessions
means to transactions and to other parts
of our system which is distributed
garbage collection and so in the same
way that you might want to target some
of those resources be they long-running
ops or
long-running queer or cursors you may
also want to be able to clean them up
automatically and today there's only a
local notion of time out for instance
you can make cursors that have timeouts
or don't have timeouts and what they
timeout based on work that happens on
those individual nodes rather than work
that's happening anywhere in the system
and so in order to fix that problem
we've introduced a new notion here we
have a client
and a MongoDB process in my process I
mean among goatee or Mongo s anywhere in
the system and then we have a thing over
on the side called a sessions collection
and we're gonna leave that sort of a
little bit of ephemeral for the moment
but it'll come back around and fill that
out and so for every wire protocol
mission message that a client makes into
a mangu process they pass the nella
sighting a logical session ID and the
controller records that they did this
and on a 5-minute interval it goes out
and syncs it to the sessions collection
and so what this means is that using a
session in MongoDB UPS updates sort of a
global state for that session and the
thing that we're updating it with is
over here
it's the LS ID which is your logical
session ID and also a last use time
which is a timestamp and the last use
time is important because our sessions
collection also has a TTL index on that
last use field and we use that to track
all of the logical sessions that are
more than 30 minutes old and we actually
delete them at that point and what that
means is that other controllers on other
processes can look to that global
sessions collection and they can see if
this the sessions that are associated
with the long-running objects that they
have inside of their process if they
have a record that's in that global
sessions collection even if no one's
used to them locally recently they know
that they're still in use somewhere else
and this is super important for
transactions because there is a new
piece of state that we've added in three
SiC 3.6 which is when you do a right now
in addition to some of the other
artifacts you can also do a retrial
right and a retrial right I won't talk
about that feature too much in this
particular presentation but we're tribal
rights allow you to check whether or not
you actually did a right if in the
events of a network failure and there's
a little bit of state that lives on
every single node that was involved in a
write and so let's say you did like an
updates across many nodes where you
inserted many different documents it's
possible to see where it actually landed
or not and we have to keep State around
in order to
make sure that that retry ability that
promise can still be honored and so the
way that we still want to clean up that
state we don't wanna keep it around
forever and so we use this distributed
garbage collection mechanism in order to
ensure that we can actually clean up
that were tribal right state when the
session that was doing the retrial right
actually finishes the controller is a
local view of the sessions I've seen the
sessions collection is a global view of
all the active sessions obsessor
and the last piece time is the time is
that the session was less reported by a
controller to be active absolutely so
that would be like on a five-minute
cadence right so it's not the precise
time I lost use that session it's the
last time someone reported my session in
use exactly okay and yeah so in addition
to being able to clean up retrial rate
state this fix is another long-running
problem we had had specifically with
aggregation and shorted clusters where
we're trying to assemble some
complicated piece of data where we may
not talk to any particular shard for a
long period of time because we're doing
some work or returning results from
another shard and so generally you had
the choice of either making sure that
your query finished everywhere within a
relatively short timeframe or setting
the cursors to no timeout where you
would risk losing track of them in the
event of a failure and so this this also
sort of closes that out by giving all
cursors that run into a logical session
and implicit time out of the session
lifetime and yeah that's sort of how
logical sessions work in our system and
we have plans to add more transactional
State to this distributed garbage
collection mechanism and it gives us a
real level of confidence to know that as
we develop more distributed features we
can keep track of the lifetime of these
objects with one core sort of central
mental abstraction rather than having to
solve it on sort of a per item basis
awesome well thank you Jason
