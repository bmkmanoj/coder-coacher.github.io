fantastic I think MongoDB world is a
great program to attend because it
really is international there are people
here from China I lived in China and
Baidu is here speaking I'm so excited to
see that there is a great diversity of
women it's so wonderful to see not only
women my age you know late 20s early 30s
but like our predecessors women who have
been in for a while one of the other
diversity scholars has been in sync for
20 years and her company chest moved her
over to MongoDB and just to see how
excited she is about this new data
structure and to hear about her role as
a developer in the past and how she's
transitioning it's been really wonderful
for me as a young female developer to
just hear her stories and the women's
lounge has been really great for going
and meeting a lot of women who had
basically made the path for us younger
woman's to come in and do
so ask the experts have actually been
really really good for me i did a
pre-conference class on ops management
and it was fantastic and i actually gone
really wild my facilitator and then i
realized my facilitator was also an
expert so I signed up for a session and
we went over mongo monitoring system
even warned death and why that is better
than perhaps you know nagios and things
of that sort he was so knowledgeable I
could tell him exactly what i needed for
my company I'm like okay this is what
we're looking for we're small we're
startup this is what we need
and he could help me understand the
overall architecture and really
understand what I needed to meet my
needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
