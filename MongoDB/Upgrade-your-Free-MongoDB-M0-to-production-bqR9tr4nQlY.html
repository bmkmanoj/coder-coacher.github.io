tutorial series my name is Jay and I'm a
developer advocate at MongoDB and I'm
here to teach you the ins and outs of
using our database as a service mago DB
Atlas today we'll discuss how to upgrade
your free m0 MongoDB Atlas cluster to a
production ready cluster
MongoDB Atlas provides you with a simple
and easy way of launching your databases
in the cloud
Alice provides you with a free cluster
known as the m0 which you can use for
evaluation when you're ready to upgrade
your m0 to one of our production
instances you can do so with just a few
clicks
so to begin I've gone ahead and created
an m0 cluster that I will move to
production next what I'll do is go ahead
and click the green upgrade button
you'll be brought back to the
configuration window which will permit
you to begin selecting the instance type
which I'll here I'll pick and m20 then
we can pick our cloud provider now be
aware that if you already have an AWS
and you switch to Google cloud platform
you're gonna see a different URI or
connection string created for your
cluster be aware that this happens
because our host names are associated
specifically with the cloud provider
that you use in this case I'm just going
to stick with Amazon Web Services and
I'll stay in North Virginia u.s. East
one so next I'll continue to payment
I'll click continue to payment and here
I can go ahead and enter any credit card
information I need in order for me to be
able to pay for my new cluster so after
you've finished completing your
modifications to your cluster and
clicked upgrade you'll see your upgraded
cluster go through a process like this
that takes about anywhere from seven to
ten minutes any subsequent updates to
your paid clusters will require no
downtime this process that happens will
copy the data from the free cluster to
the paid node this configures
replication and moves your dns to the
new compute nodes on the cloud of your
choice and once it's completed you'll
see your cluster go back into this three
node with your primary and two
secondaries you won't see any more
downtime like you did during the upgrade
process during future upgrades and this
is because we'll do this in a rolling
fashion like we said before you won't
see any more future downtime
all downtime is associated with the
migration from a multi-tenant to a
single tenant hosted cluster
