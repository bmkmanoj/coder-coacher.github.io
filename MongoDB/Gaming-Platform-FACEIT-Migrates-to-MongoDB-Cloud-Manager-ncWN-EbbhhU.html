competitive gaming platform we integrate
with online multiplayer games such as
counter-strike dota 2 league of legends
smile and World of Tanks when we start
to face it back in 2011 that we knew
that we needed a database that could
support our operations and that could
grow and adapt according to our needs we
started with a MongoDB as a service
provider that could allow us to focus on
our product development and take away
all the complexity related to
infrastructure and operations as we kept
growing and growing it we realized that
we need more control on our set up
especially for query fine-tuning and for
analysis of the performances of our
database and also the exponential growth
of traffic and audience forces us at a
certain point to look for alternatives
so after months of query analysis and
fine-tuning we decided that you have a
very busy week we moved from the online
as a service solution to MongoDB cloud
manager which runs on Amazon Web
Services migrating to why target has
been beneficial for two main reason one
is the optimized compression allow us to
save more than fifty percent of our
storage space and seconder the fact that
the lock is done only at document level
instead of collection level it allowed
us to improve my performance by more
than thirty percent the move away from
database as a service to mongodb cloud
manager set up on AWS at the tremendous
impact on our business as well we've
gone from few hundred thousands of
online users to more than 4 million
reducible users in all in two years and
today we can integrate with the top game
publishers as well as a weed top
parlance such as Microsoft Xbox and
preach and to scale our operations
worldwide I know I can count on MongoDB
to
our business and to provide our growing
use of a cell with the features they
want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
