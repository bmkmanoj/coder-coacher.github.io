my name is Jay I'm a developer advocate
and I'm here to teach you more on
getting started using our database as a
service
Atlas today we'll go over how you can
whitelist a public IP or an IP range for
your Atlas cluster we have a running
MongoDB Atlas cluster but we need to be
able to ensure that our computer running
our shell or application is able to
access it first we can click security
then we can click whitelist as you can
see so far we don't have any addresses
listed or security groups so nobody can
get into our MongoDB Atlas cluster quite
yet we have a few options we can work
with once we want to add I piece to our
whitelist entry we can add our current
IP which is the IP of the computer we're
using so you can just click add current
IP address you can allow access from
anywhere so you can just literally click
allow access from anywhere and that will
allow any server from anywhere to
connect to your MongoDB cluster via the
network now be aware that you still have
username and password authentication
enabled so they can't just get in but
they will be able to access it via the
network you can go here and leave a
comment on what IP ranges you're
specifically leaving information for so
let's say that our network administrator
said 12 1200 16 is the specific office
network we can just click confirm and
we've gone ahead and added that AWS
users who have peered their VPC with
MongoDB Atlas are also able to use their
logical security group names so let's
say the security group is SG one two one
two one two
great then we can just leave a note that
says security group AWS click confirm
now if this security group does not
exist
AWS will fail if this security group
does pass you'll get massive response
see this isn't a real security group and
because of that we're going to get
reenter group failed that's only because
I've used a demo one if we were to get a
real security group name from AWS
this would say active much like our IP
address if you're running into any Atlas
issues contact our support team at any
time click the support link in the lower
left of your Atlas interface or go to
MongoDB comm slash contact thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
