with multi document asset transactions
in forw
and we put this little video series to
walk through some projects on how we got
here one of those projects is creating
safe secondary reads I'm Allie Cabral a
product manager on the course server and
I have Diana with me an engineer on the
core server and she's gonna walk through
this project Thank You Allie yeah
so let's define some basic concepts
concepts about what a replica set is and
a shard before we go into project
specifics because we need to know what
they are alright so the replica set
consists of a primary and some number of
replica sets the primary can accept
reads and writes and secondary is
basically just they replicate the data
they don't do anything else
if they're therefore if something bad
happens to the primary it crashes we can
elect one of the secondaries with all
the same data and have new primary and
keep going so the concept of a shard
comes in in a cluster when we have a
cluster of replicas sets we tend to talk
about the replica sets as a shard B so
and each shard owns a piece or partition
of the data yes so you have a collection
of data and we take a little piece of it
and we stick it on a replica sets and we
call that a shard because it has a shard
of the data so here is a shard so along
with the concept of a shard and now we
have pieces of data all over the place
we need to know where it is so we have
this concept of a routing table which
says this replica set or shard owns this
piece of data so if a query comes in it
can look at the writing-table or we look
at the writing-table
and we direct it to the correct shard or
it might be several shards so where this
project comes in the primaries before
this project knew about the
writing-table they could service
requests and say like I have that Chuck
I don't have that chunk go somewhere
else
secondaries don't have this concept so
they are unsafe when we do data
migrations and when you fake chunk a
chunk of a piece of the data like a
smoke yes correct
so like we take a piece of a collection
of data and we split it into chunks
conceptually and we move a chunk to a
server so like our little range of the
data yes secondaries aren't they don't
have the right tables so they service
whatever requests and this is a problem
for migrations which move data around
and can create temporary - duplicates of
the data so let's go look at a migration
and show you how that can be a problem
all right so there are three steps to a
migration the first one so we have learn
off with a chunk on charnae and so the
first step is to copy the trunk to shard
B so we'll copy it over here the second
part of a migration we will go and
update the writing-table so we cross
that out
no truck lives on shard B and then the
third step we go and delete the original
data so we cross this out the problem
arises between step two and three
because we can't do this all like
magically at once it's a distributed
cluster and different servers you can't
do it at once no atomic idea there so
between two and three but data exists on
both of these No yes so what do we do or
what let's start with what what can
happen if in this situation so let's go
back to this data it's not quite deleted
yet we have the writing table that's
updated but this chunk accepts all right
so if if a write comes in say to the
system after we did the copy it properly
does a write on the new shard and now
that truck has another document or it
updated a document if and suppose it was
like a majority committed so the writer
the user really wants to make sure that
data is there a query comes in and it's
still information about where the data
is a query and you don't see that right
that happened over here so you're like
where did my day to go another thing
that can happen is if you have usually a
range query that goes to multiple shards
and we have two copies of the data you
can get two documents back and it's like
you queried for one suppose you had a
unique identifier in that document and
you got back to you kind of like huh
that's not expected so how does this
work on primaries yes
so primaries have a routing table they
they know what trucks they own so once
we copy the data and we update the
routing table we have a process for
making sure everyone knows about that
before we allow anymore
you update the writing-table the other
should have switched this query won't
work anymore
it'll be rejected and the color would be
told to go talk to shard B and then the
scenario would work you do right you to
read you see you're right
and you can't service if you do a range
query you can't do you can't get
duplicate documents all right so that
works on a primary but secondaries don't
have this so they are liable to all the
problems we talked about so why do we
want to this project take a moment for
that there are two reasons for
transactions what we really wanted was
we want to be able to extend the
features and that roadmap to secondaries
so we don't want to just involve the
primaries like we have transactions on
primaries but you can't do anything with
secondary otherwise nothing works that'd
be sad because we have cool features and
we want to work everywhere the other
thing is the project by itself is I
think pretty awesome because it lets
some applications can't query
secondaries before we did this because
they needed to see consistent data they
couldn't do with duplicates or not
seeing your own rights that's not
something they can handle so now that
we've extended the primaries
capabilities to secondary they can gain
an order of magnitude of availability so
you have four replicas sets sorry for
replicas and a replica set and now you
can query five servers safely okay so
that load is distributed so how do we
fix this
let's go down here so before the project
we only ever had on chart primaries we
would have an in-memory cache of the
round table the shard would no I own
these chunks and that was pretty much it
secondaries since they're not the
primaries they had nothing they didn't
having a memory State they weren't chunk
aware so to speak and you could happily
like suppose it data migrated so let's
see we have chunk five on the primary
and secondary small and in the cache at
the writing-table we know chunk five
doesn't belong on the shard primary so
if a quarry comes in we can will filter
out chunk five data points secondary
however it would it would just the query
would work we'd see chunk five and
that'd be bad because some other server
has it who knows so secondary is return
all data on the node regardless of
ownership at all because I think it was
unaware and then I spree three seconds
about it right so how do we fix this so
what we did in three six is we persisted
the routing table cache on a shard
primary so now it has this cute little
table here that tells it all the shards
who owns what chunk and it can same as
before the short primary can still
filter out results so again it has like
chunk five hanging out there but chunk
five right here you can see it it's on
shard be somewhere else so it won't
return those results the user and so
persistent allowed replication
so you take it away down to the
secondary which now has the
writing-table and can load it up into
memory and again service provide the
same services as the primary so now if
client create the primary what's
secondary it would safely not see this
little red chunk that's been moved off
somewhere else
he's pending for deletion he hasn't been
deleted yet will be soon and you don't
see any of the bad results so that's how
we fixed it the externally visible part
anyway it's more complicated than that
and so let's finish off with an example
of one of those nice transaction
features that we can now do on
secondaries so I'm gonna bring in causal
consistency here I'm not going to talk
about the overall project someone else
is going to talk about that but one of
the things that causal consistency
introduced was the concept of an after
cluster time so this is after cluster
time read concern so the idea was now
when servers talk to each other we have
this cluster time that we communicate
and we pass it around and always up it
so you can say I want to read on this
server after this cluster time so how is
this helpful so what happens in this
example so start with number one the
client does a write to the primary so it
says I'm gonna update underscore ID five
and have it have page four so string
some write that write will generate a
cluster time which will be returned and
step two to the client and now the
client has the time of that right so it
can go to the secondary
number three read after closer time of
that right to the secondary and ensure
that this it'll wait for replication
before it'll give you the response so
sign that page four sorry so that's like
the read will not be returned until that
secondary has caught up to the time of
the right correct so you know that the
data is there so I did it right the
client data right from the primary at
this time I'm gonna go to the secondary
and wait for that time to be there as
well and the data with it before
returning for the query so regardless of
which note you're speaking to your
always sing for it in time
yes you never see backwards in time like
before replication happened and this is
cool because you can read your own right
so you do write to the primary and now
you can read it on secondary and you
could do that before so that's why it's
cool awesome well thank you Diana for
walking through this project okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
