tell you today about TTL collections a
new feature in MongoDB 2.2 MongoDB is
pretty good at storing data persistently
not losing it but sometimes you actually
don't want to keep it forever so why
would that be the case I got my start in
90s I got my PhD in computer systems
we've spent a lot of time thinking about
caching mostly cache coherency and
hardware caches but the idea is
essentially the same sometimes you want
to keep a small amount of data in very
valuable memory and then make sure that
whatever gets access is likely hit that
cash you can build one of these things
out of MongoDB and if you do you might
want to have older data not be in the
cache and data that's more likely to be
accessed in the cache so how would you
do that now you can do that with TTL
collections time-to-live collections you
can also do that with some with it with
another technology that's been in the
database for a while which is cap
collections and I'll talk a little bit
about those two different features and
how they work together and the nuances
of them which one you might want to use
the second reason you might want to not
keep data forever is operational logging
so you have this fire hose of data
you've got the you've got these websites
that are collecting a tremendous amount
of data and what happens is it fills up
the disks if you're not careful and the
data is really most valuable when it's
new when it's fresh and so the question
is how do you get rid of that older data
in an orderly fashion + TTL collections
is going to help us with that final
example of why you might want to use TTL
collections is log in sessions so you
have a website and the users are typing
in the username and password and
typically would create some sort of
session document for that you put in the
database and you only want it to last a
certain amount of time and you probably
want to time it out when there's been a
period of inactivity and the user hasn't
hasn't used the website for a while so
how would you do that within within
MongoDB so first I want to go over
something that's been in MongoDB for a
while which is cap collections
cap collectors are similar to TTL
collections but in sand in some cases
better match for the problem but for a
lot of these cases that we just went
over there not quite right and I want to
go over that so in a cap collection you
can kind of see it as a ring it was a
fixed number of slots and data is put
into the ring into an open slot and then
when you run out of space what happens
is a spot a slot gets reused so let's
think of our first example which is
caching would this work well well you
can put data into this ring but the
question is would you want to always
delete the oldest item so probably not
in the sense that with a cache you
really want to delete the item that's
least likely to be used right can't that
sort of an Oracle out algorithm you
don't can't do that so common algorithm
is least recently used which isn't
necessarily the item that was inserted
in inserted in eldest I'm cat
collections don't allow you to delete an
item other than when it would naturally
get replaced by a new item similar
problem for operational logging not
exactly operational logon you don't
exact you don't want to delete an item
earlier then it's probably okay delete
an item that's its oldest I mean
actually the MongoDB up log is a cap
collection but the problem there is that
when you start out and your website is
fairly new you may start you may create
a collection and say I'm going to click
I'm going to keep this many items in it
and then as the website gets more
popular what you do is you wind up
looping through that ring more often and
so initially you were keeping data for
three weeks and then after you get more
popular you for keeping it for two and
then one and then finally you're only
keeping it for a day and so we need a
method that's going to better match what
we want to do which is keep the data for
a certain amount of time and the the
user login profiles have the user logon
sessions have the same issue which is
that you probably don't want to delete
the oldest item you probably want to
delete an item that has been inactive
for let's say 15 minutes a secondary
problem with these cap collections is
that you can never update a document in
them if it would cause a database to
have to
of a document on the disk now that's not
so much of a problem an operational
logging we're probably going to write
the item once and be done but it's
certainly a problem with caching we
might want to update the cache entry and
make it bigger and then find that it
doesn't it can't be moved so TTL
collections really address these
shortcomings and cap collections TTL
collections are going to let us set an
exact duration that we want to keep
items inside the database so let's let's
go to the last example which is the
login sessions so the login sessions you
might keep the username and a session ID
which is some long random number that
the user is going to present to us
through the web browser maybe throw a
cookie when they hit the site and then
finally at last activity time which
tells us the last time at the user touch
the site if we want to turn this into a
TTL collection what we would do is add
an index to it that's it we add an index
to that last that using the last
activity is the key which needs to be
some sort of date time object and then
set a time out which in this case we put
in as 900 seconds which is 15 minutes
and if we do that MongoDB will harvest
every minute and find the older ones and
get rid of them so you can kind of see
this as a little river of documents that
are being put in at the head and then
sort of drop off a waterfall but it's
pretty flexible because if you if let's
say the user hits the website and you
want to update that last activity time
you can bring that document back to the
head of the river so it doesn't get
deleted and if you want to grow one of
those documents you can do it and and
and Mongo will automatically move it so
okay that's how that's how etl
collections work and they're a great new
feature of MongoDB 2.2 definitely
download it and try it I want to switch
gears for a second and tell you about
something else going on I also run
education here at engine and we do
training worldwide my goal is teach the
whole world about MongoDB but it's very
challenging to scale out physical
training in
training it's expensive for us it's
expected it you know the classes are
$1,500 for two day class it's a good
value but for many people it's it's it's
a lot of money so the question is how do
we address that so we're announcing
today that we're going to start offering
our mongodb classes online for the world
for free at education tengen com it's up
online now you can go to the website and
you can sign up for one of the classes
we're announcing two classes we're
announcing our mongodb for developers
class taught by richard quarter our
director of consulting engineering and
our mongodb for dbas class which is
going to be taught by Dwight Merriman
our CEO and co-founder and what's really
great about online education is that we
can use our best instructors we can use
the most knowledgeable people to teach
people worldwide about MongoDB these are
going to be a seven week courses you're
going to get a certificate of completion
when you're finished with it there's
gonna be assessments built-in video
lectures you can sign up today the
classes are going to start in October
we're doing this in conjunction with EDX
the nonprofit consortium between Harvard
and MIT and berkeley we are going to be
collaborating with them we have what
we're using their technology stack to
deliver the classes and enhancing it so
that not only do we get the benefit of
the improvements but so do students who
take classes at Harvard at Berkeley and
MIT it's pretty exciting for us so
please go online and sign up for some of
these classes and give them a try we're
very excited about that and that's about
it I want to bring Elliot back up here
to answer your questions and give some
closing remarks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
