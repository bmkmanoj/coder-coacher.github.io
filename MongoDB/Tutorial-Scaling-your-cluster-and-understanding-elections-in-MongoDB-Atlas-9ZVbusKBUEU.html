tutorials my name is Jay and I'm here to
teach you more on how to get started
using our database as a service Atlas so
it will go over how MongoDB Atlas
handles primary election during a
scaling event MongoDB Atlas provides you
the ability to scale up and down from
your MongoDB Atlas cluster without
having to make any modifications
manually to your actual cluster from the
command line
what you have to do is either select a
new instance type scale to the point you
want to be at and then click confirm and
deploy you'll never have to modify
manually your primary your secondary or
anything like that it'll all be done for
you automatically there is no specific
option to elect a new primary however if
you make a change to Atlas such as the
instance size or the available disk
space your modification will occur in a
rolling fashion ensuring your
application stays online so what we'll
do is select nm 20 confirm and deploy
and it will begin the process of
deploying our changes if we go here
we'll see we our primary is currently 0
0 node that'll be eventually flipped to
one of these secondaries as the primary
will be the last one to be upgraded as
you can see here one of our nodes is
reporting is down and that's because
it's currently upgrading that individual
node and making sure the other two are
still online during the process and
during this upgrade process we're
actually able to continue to review our
metrics so we can go to the metrics
section right here and we'll see the
actual moments where these individual
nodes were upgraded and as you can see
there's been no election yet since our
primary still online so as you can see
here upgrades completed and we've gone
from @m 10 to @m 20 and you can actually
see now that our primary has been
changed there was an election to the
secondary as during the process we went
ahead and upgraded to the new one so
that's pretty much it if your
application was configured using the
full connection string you can actually
see that here then you'll be able to
ensure that all three nodes stayed
online the entire time during your
upgrade process that should keep your
application
up and running without any intervention
required by you if you're running into
any Atlas issues contact our support
team at any time click the support link
in the lower left of your Atlas
interface or go to MongoDB comm slash
