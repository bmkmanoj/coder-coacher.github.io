long road from Python to closure
thanks to Paulo and Stu for for starting
the day off up everyone's conscious
going all so far and everyone's travel
well well I'm glad my talk is is really
on the first day so I get to stop
worrying about it and enjoy everyone
else's talk the rest of the time so a
little overview of what we're gonna be
talking about today as usual we'll start
with an introduction but we'll move on
into why how data stacks started
specifically the product I work on and
and how we started with Python and why
we started with Python and then how we
at why we decided to bring closure into
the mix and why and why we're continuing
that journey of moving from Python to
closure so a little bit of an
introduction about me I work at data
stacks specifically on our ops center
product I'm a big fan of closure been
using it for six years now if you don't
know anything about data stacks we were
heavily involved with Apache Cassandra
and I run the Austin Cassandra meetup
and I'm from Austin so if you have any
desire to talk about any of those topics
throughout the rest of the Khans come
come find me and we'll chat a little bit
about data stacks we develop a database
we call data stacks enterprise or DSC
for short it's built on top of Apache
Cassandra and combines other things like
spark graph technologies and search ops
center which is the product we're gonna
be talking about today is a monitoring
and management tool for eight stacks
enterprise
and it is built with Python enclosure
which is you know the topic of today's
discussion the other thing to keep in
mind is that both DC and opsin are our
shipped software not hosted software so
you know things were shipping out to
customers
run in their own infrastructure so this
talk is kind of our experience it's an
experience report with Cassandra or with
closure so it's not super low-level
there won't be a whole lot of code
examples or things like that but more of
a high level of how closure has been for
us how we've migrated away from Python
onto it and what the future holds if you
know this should be especially
interesting if you are a Python shop and
you're interested in closure if or if
you are you know can have a Python
application that you would like to maybe
move to the JVM so starting from the
beginning a long time ago in a galaxy
far far away which is actually is
actually not true it's actually a long
time ago in an office not far away the
Deus Ex office is about five blocks from
here could probably get there and back
before the end of this talk if I wanted
to but we set out to build a database
monitoring tool and so data stacks as a
company was just founded brand-new
company built kind of around Apache
sander and we're building a monitoring
tool for it so I don't know how familiar
the room is with Apache Cassandra our
distributed databases this is a typical
diagram you would see of a Cassandra
cluster or a DSC cluster it's a scalable
database built to scale from you know
four nodes in this example to thousands
of nodes typically you'll see it modeled
as a ring like you do here and so the
first step we took in building some
maybe you know a tool for monitoring
this database is we built a web server
so this is going to be a web application
from our area and specifically we built
it on twisted Python that's the logo for
twisted Python so in case you weren't
aware
and so that's responsible for talking to
the database serving up visualizations
monitoring and data and things like that
I mean you might think to yourself okay
but why why would you pick twisted
closure exists it's out there in the
world you could have picked that and you
know today I would agree with you but
this was you know five years ago I could
mention so this is 2010 dates taxes 10
person company at the most the people
working on this product in particular
there was one one friend front-end
developer one back-end developer and the
back end developer knew twisted so if
you've ever been a part of a small
start-up I think you probably already
know that the most important thing is
getting stuff out the door as fast as
possible so twisted was kind of the you
know logical choice from that standpoint
so we have that that's great but Prada
complexity grows you need new features
as with any monitoring application it's
quickly discovered that you need some
sort of agent to run on the things that
you're monitoring so logically the next
step would be developing an agent we
already have twisted Python let's write
it in twisted python that's why we know
that's that's the the next step and
that's where things start to go wrong
and the reason being the JVM it doesn't
really play nice outside of the JVM I
don't know if any anybody here has ever
tried to monitor and interact with the
JVM application from something like
Python but it doesn't work really well
their Java has this thing called them
java management extensions that make it
super easy to expose operations and
information but only to expose those two
other JVM applications anyone else is
kind of just out of luck so that's not
working
and that's where closure enters the ring
I set up that ring metaphor earlier just
of landis pun but keeping in mind this
is still five years ago right so we
quickly knocked out this twisted agent
and even quicker realize that it wasn't
going to work for us and we needed
something else so what did what are the
responsibilities of this agent well it's
actually extremely limited in scope at
the moment right it just collects some
metrics and it sends them back to our
twisted process that's running and
that's just literally all its purpose in
life so what are the other requirements
outside of that limited scope of
responsibilities well it needs to
interact with the JVM which we've at
this point already established means it
needs to run on the JVM and the other
two really requirements we had were it
needs to be maintainable and it needs to
keep the developers happy so that kind
of leads into our list of contenders all
of these are on the JVM I am fairly
certain most of you have an idea of
which one we picked Java was at the time
kind of the leap contender really
because we were monitoring a database
was already written in Java so we had
Java experts and you know the main
reason we didn't go with that was
developer happiness right so we had a
development team you know we're used to
working with Python and liking Python
and not really super excited about the
prospect of writing Java so there was a
list closure one the the simplest reason
was it was the one the developers
enjoyed the most so the others were kind
of experimented with but it was the one
that was enjoyed the most and this was
such an isolated piece of the
architecture that the one we landed on
wasn't super important at the time right
so all of them could interrupt with the
JVM in the way that we needed we liked
closure
if it for some reason turned out not to
work pivoting and moving to picking
something else wasn't you know a huge
deal at the time so now we've got this
new architecture we're running closure
you know for four years pass and you
know we get the results of our
experiment and the results are that it
you know is a great success we picked
this isolated piece of our project to
run closure it fit all of our needs and
it continued to fit our needs as the
project expanded it turned out to be
just a fantastic recruitment tool and
I'm sure you know as you can see by this
this giant conference closure inspires a
lot of passion and even by the people
that you know we didn't recruit
specifically to work on closure they
picked it up and and ran with it quickly
I want to give you a quote from someone
on our team
regarding learning closure just to kind
of emphasize really I think the passion
that the closure inspires in some people
so this is a quote by a guy on my team
named Philip doctor he runs the Chicago
closure meetup so if anybody's from
Chicago or passes through there and gets
a chance to go to the Chicago closure
meetup I highly recommend it and then
one more note on on hiring I mentioned
the closure was you know a great you
know recruitment tool and turned out to
be the right choice for those reasons I
think specifically in our case that you
know this may or may not apply to you
but data stacks is a distributed
engineering organization so you know we
hire people you know and let them work
from wherever they're currently located
so right now you know we have quote
engineers working on closure who are
located anywhere from Hawaii to France
so that was one key thing I think I'm
not sure if we would have experienced
that if we had had
it office-based culture where we
required people to relocate so you know
take that with a grain of salt depending
on on your specific situation just a
couple of the the rough edges if you
know closure worked out great the there
was a few rough edges at least slightly
worth pointing out this was 2010 like I
mentioned at the time we would have
played on 1.2 and immediately hit the
pain of migrating to 1.3 and dealing
with the the explosion of the closure
contributor how many people were around
with with and had to deal with that but
it was a giant pain at the time when we
were still a little unsure on closure it
was a kind of a warning sign and the
other thing we noticed was that there
was you know the JMX library which is
kind of specifically what we picked to
why we picked closure right to interact
with other JVMs was unmaintained but the
solution to that was simple I just
became the maintainer it gets about one
patch a year so the work workload is
fairly low and then at the time this is
kind of a problem that was only revealed
in hindsight the you know libraries back
then were far less mature than they are
today like a stew is just been sitting
mentioning you know Corie Corie sink was
and wasn't a thing back then there was
no component or mount or other any of
these libraries to kind of help you
while you're building a closure
application so earlier if you were
asking yourself you know why did you
pick twisted now you might be asking
yourself okay you you you had a an
application with two pieces written and
twisted and you decided to rewrite one
of them why didn't you just rewrite the
whole thing well I think that's a valid
question and
you know wish I had we had done that
five years ago but hindsight's 20/20
right so while we were rewriting this
small piece of our application we were
still a tiny startup and full speed
ahead on on everything else
so at the time it seemed reasonable with
with the benefit of historical
perspective you know something we wish
we had done so that brings us to date
Stax continuing march towards closure
back to the future ish so that brings us
up to you know maybe one year ago or so
so what's changed from four years ago or
five years ago what's changing that that
past four years so like I said closure
was a great recruitment tool the team
has grown you know starting from to
developers to a team of you know 20 or
so developers with you know multiple
layers of management and and all that
thing all those types of things our
closure code base itself is grown by
leaps and bounds right so we've moved
from an agent that is responsible for
simply collecting and reporting
monitoring data to an agent that is
responsible for taking backups and doing
restores and provisioning and
configuration and a whole host of other
things right so while we initially
envisioned some tiny piece of closure
that we could run and you know rewrite
at a moment's notice if we needed we've
now got this this large application that
you know is serving many different needs
beyond that you know data stacks as a
company has grown in the JVM has been
become somewhat of a standard across
most of data stacks products with the
exception of the one we work on that
still incorporates Python for for a
large piece of it and just I'm sure
anyone here who has been working with
closure for a while has
as you work with closure your your love
of other languages kinds of fades so we
didn't we didn't necessarily dislike
Python but if we had a favorite child
closure would be it on on the App Center
team so so the time comes and we need to
kind of re-evaluate the the big center
you know monolithic piece of our
application so we re-evaluated our
agents and put them in closure now it's
time to reevaluate the the Damien piece
and so that that was driven not just by
a you know a love of closure but also by
actual you know business concerns on our
end so you know as we've grown from a
two-person team to you know data sex
being a 500-person company you know the
scalability requirements of our product
in general have have grown from you know
typical sizes of five node clusters to
you know thousands of nodes in the
cluster and so the needs of OP Center as
an application kind of have changed and
kind of an artifact of that is use we
start started running into kind of the
limitations you can't you'll run into
with Python specifically with a single
process right so CPU usage became a you
know a significant problem for a lot of
our customers and and even beyond just
those problems we started noticing that
having an agent that is expanding in its
responsibilities as well as this central
Python piece expanding they started to
overlap a lot more than we initially
planned on in you know our initial
evaluation right so whereas before they
had distinct roles and responsibilities
now we're pulling in things like you
know a Java library on the agent for
interacting with Amazon s3 and the
Python equivalent and the Dame
because they both need to have that
interaction so now you're learning two
different libraries pulling in multiple
things and so you're kind of generating
you know a lot of overhead by having
multiple languages in your stack so I
mean the result of the you know the
reevaluation was that you know as a
company we wanted to move towards the
JVM specifically you know on our team we
wanted to move towards closure and we
needed to address the you know the
immediate kind of scalability concerns
we had with our product so there's you
know there's lots of ways to approach
that problem these you know these were
the ones that we considered obviously
you can stop and do a rewrite which is
what we did for the agent in 2010 you
can switch to multiple processes and
kind of slowly pull pieces out of Python
and into something on the JVM hopefully
closure and then there was a third idea
which we kind of came up with which at
first kind of was almost dismissed out
of hand but after some some some thought
we decided to at least look into it a
little bit more so you know the rewrite
completely option has the benefit of
letting you design an application with
five years of historical perspective
right and so you can kind of upfront
avoid a lot of the mistakes you have
made along the way while you were in
start-up mode and cranking things out as
fast as you possibly could
but on the other hand you know that's
five years of code that needs to be
rewritten it's at least one or more year
pause and new feature development and
inevitably you're going to introduce new
bugs or bugs you've already fixed when
you take a large application like that
and just rewrite it so you know it had
it's one option it has some downsides
the option to split into multiple
multiple processes you know avoids the
problems you have with a large rewrite
in terms of kind of time time intensive
Nisour introducing a lot of bugs at once
but multi-processing specifically in
python is difficult and I don't know how
many people have dealt with twisted
before but twisted itself is a a well
it's an event-driven language and it's
very interdependent so pulling pulling
things out of a a twisted application
just kind of piecemeal and trying to put
them into another application is it's
not as simple as it might sound it would
almost essentially be somewhat of a
rewrite in itself and then you bring on
the complexity of doing things like
adding IPC and keep in mind this again
is a product you know we're shipping to
customers so every process we add to
this the software is additional burden
on the customer and running and
maintaining that process and keeping
things up so the last option port to
JSON so this option you know is
theoretically completely behind the
scenes right you could ship this
application and customers could in
theory not even know that it has
happened it also has the bennett benefit
of getting you on the on the GBM and the
shortest path although not necessarily
using closure but on the downside column
you see that out-of-the-box support for
twisted which i thought was was not a
thing i mean we knew specifically that
it did not work you're essentially
introducing a third language - is you
know a Python
like language but it's different enough
that you'll go have problems and then as
far as I know no literally no one else
has done this right so it's kind of the
road less traveled sounds very poetic
but it's not necessarily the thing you
want to be doing while you're developing
software so without too much suspense
basically we took the JSON path right so
and the reasons we did were we decided
was it was the benefits of being
immediately on the JVM and doing it in a
way that was some under the hood
somewhat in terms of customer impact
we're at least worth exploring so we did
a proof-of-concept discovered that the
the time it took to get twisted to at
least run on the JVM was about a week
which wasn't unreasonable and from there
it was worth the investment to slowly
fix all the things that it we broke
while getting twisted to run on the
junior so that's the approach we took
this is what our application looks like
today right if you go download it right
now but if you know they just you know I
skipped the one year phase in between
there so let's talk about that a little
bit so these are the four easy steps for
migrating your application to joy phone
it's four steps how hard can it be right
so so step one make twisted run on JSON
it's an extra this was this is the step
that sounds harder than it is really it
just boils down to getting a stack trace
fixing it
rinse and repeat and it actually happens
that with the release of Jeff on at the
time which had just been released there
were the only problems that really
existed were some decorators that JSON
didn't
understand and some references to two
pythons operating system libraries that
we weren't even using so a little bit of
hacking there got things up and running
the next step is the most time intensive
by far well I guess it depends on your
application but any Python library that
uses the C extension is just not going
to run on jive on for obvious reasons
and there's a lot of them so and very
common ones like pi open ssl and so you
know in our case replacing pi open ssl
pi LDAP the python sequel Lite library
pi crypto all of these things need to be
replaced with the jive on Java
alternative so you know that takes time
depending on you know your application
it can be more or less time and then the
other thing we ran into is that - does
not implement the sub processing modules
that python has so anything there needs
to be also ported to the Java equivalent
step three is is the least fun of all of
these steps of migrating yourself to Jai
thon if I had to compile a list of the
bugs that developers nightmares are made
of
this would probably be the list so in
the process of making things run on Jai
thon these are some of the highlights at
least of the bugs we found enjoy phone
we filed maybe 15 or so bugs but these
are some of the good ones so debugging
deadlocks and GC deadlocks and socket
leaks and all that stuff is not exactly
easy and/or fun but we made it through I
won't actually do want to mention that
this is not a criticism of JSON itself
the developers they were extremely
helpful and
and willing to help us work through
these problems a lot of these were were
based on the fact that we were running
on twisted which they never told us to
do we just decided to do and they
probably would have told us we would
have run into these bugs but we fixed
them one note if I've seen lots of
complaints and about these and if you
thought stack traces and heap dumps are
bad in closure wait till you're running
closure on top of JSON and you'll really
get the full experience you'll enjoy
your your heap dumps from closure after
that so once you make it through that
then comes the fun part right so you you
can have closure running and you can
have joy phone running and they can be
running on the same same JVM but once
they start trying to talk to each other
they they get all confused so closure
doesn't know what the hell - is jonathan
doesn't know what an i persistent vector
is everyone's mad but luckily if
everyone speaks Java right so I put a
link there and I did include the actual
code but there's a link to our our
translation translation layer it's just
a single closure file that puts
everything in a Java format before
sending it between between closure or
Python so go check that out so this is
where we are it's I think an apt word to
describe it would be Frankenstein II
it's not it's certainly not pretty or
elegant but it works right and so you
know in terms of whether or not I would
declare our our path to closure via Jeff
on a success or not I would say for us
there was some bumps it took way way
longer than we thought it would but in
the end it was the right choice if we
had to go back and make the same
decision again I would I would pick the
same thing so our that's our present
our future hopefully lies in the the
glorious land of closure and looking
something like this so the takeaways for
this talk should you use closure as as
Phil would say open yourself to truth
and beauty you should absolutely lose
use closure should I not use Python well
no no one said that but if you are doing
anything that is interacting with other
JVMs then probably not I would say you
should not use Python should i migrate
my Python apt closure of the edge I
thought well maybe do you really need to
do that or does it just sound kind of
fun because if it sounds kind of fun I'm
not going to recommend it plus I already
got the con stock so you're not gonna
even get that out of it so the other
thing to consider is you know what
Python app are you migrating right so if
you're doing scientific programming with
numpy and Syfy those are essentially all
see and are never going to run on JSON
and don't have a job equivalent so I
would be a exercise in futility to try
and run those on Jai thon and I can't
guarantee that in this process the data
stacks team has discovered all of the
hairy deadlocks and socket leaks and
just generally bad things that exist out
there so if you're not you know brave
and willing to venture into Jai thon
land itself I'm not sure I would
recommend so that's the talk I think 5
minutes or so for questions if there are
any</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
