big report is awesome happy 420 what
does that mean you go over here lure bed
other together in a lot of this that
you're handsome use we use for work
we're fortunate enough to also get work
awesome a couple notes first we have
boot stickers as you can see we have a
hood cool logo night on that's courtesy
of our employer is a little cat new
boots makes ova century and we have a
singer so if you have questions American
down a question will be in the talk but
feel for a BCS the pulse aside pester us
with your your trickiest questions
that's a hundred comments saying how
people answer questions and learn new
stuff so good pretty populist and we
have got the stickers too and they're
double glazing me do the sticker because
I put on your laptop or some people put
them on require actually a new thing I
mean it could be advantage is putting
them on newborn children maybe that's
the thing we want to do the final though
is we're gonna do a lot of interactive
demonstration coating which is fairly
dangerous always so as a precaution
we've done a couple
turning Wi-Fi office machine prepared
two screenshots of code but most
importantly our friend and associate hey
Darwin's in the audience after any
catastrophic failure this pass when we
start to slope eye I just asking to join
him and we playing the moment anyway
I'll let me check forget the
rehabilitation yeah a new bill tool
another one such analyst yeah but uh I
mean anybody who makes applications out
is involved with you know complicated
things web applications especially they
seem so simple but when you actually get
to the bottom of any start deploying
them they end up being pretty
complicated in the build is surprisingly
complex and difficult to do you have
like five JVMs running way to make files
and all kinds of things but you know
being closure people people interested
in floor anyway we recognize the need to
manage complexity that's why we use
closure it provides us abstractions and
all these ways that we can manage
complexity but the bill tooling it
hasn't really kept up with that there's
no ways to make you know small modules
that we can compose manage complexity
encapsulate things so the real problem
in our opinion is that builds which
already me alright we are unanimous that
builds our processes they're not
specifications in other words like you
can't make a program applaud your
program that's just a big map things you
wanted to do some big specification and
you know will generate some program that
will fulfill all your wildest dreams now
you have to process it you know does
things sequentially basically and most
of tools that are out there now maven
and whatever all they are oriented
around trying to make a declarative
specification for what you want your
outcome to be greater election time
inception through familiar
it's sort of the boot of the dollar sort
ish ish but basically we're programmers
you need to be able to program we don't
we don't want something to generate a
program for us we want to be able to I
mean lips gives us all the tools that we
can use to generate our own programs the
way we want so boot is what we developed
to solve our own problems fulfill our
wildest dreams and the main idea of it
is that you can make small parts that
each do one thing they only do one thing
and they do that one thing well and if
you look at tools like lighting a nerd
maven or whatever if you have a really
successful plugging it ends up evolving
into a build tool of its own doing
everything and it's much better to do
tab with many things that each do one
thing that you can compose yourself the
user can compose themselves then have a
monolithic program that have now made
all these choices for you and although
the like small things it doesn't really
help you can have many small things and
you can't compose them uniformly so you
know that's why you end up having a big
monolithic composition of them because
that's the only way you propose I'm
section works so basically our school
empowers you to take these small pieces
put them together on apply to make a new
build process pretty normal that is
amazing maven for dependency resolution
so all the things for you know for these
other systems maven and letting it will
work and we use it to build closure
enclosure at ads urk heading this
website you can go there you can ignore
us right now I just go to look so way of
separation for the interactive stuff one
of the cool things about
is that you can third building things
and using it without really having any
kind of descriptor file or project files
our notion of a project at all and this
example products I know this enclosure
project so we chose Java now we all need
to build love dog software that's
probably not true maybe it is but for
the purposes of demonstrating facilities
of boob we chose to make a small java
Brown so there's this Java HelloWorld
side and the process that Java converts
java source code into jvm bytecode it's
kind of representative of all the things
that build schools do even if they're
not job in the web's you know domain
we're doing various transformations on
CSS preprocessors converting it off the
lights and javascript so we just show
Java kind of representative of that
thing that vocals too which is they turn
one handed thing into a no exact thing
so we should showing off now is a little
boot command line action you type in the
book man and emits a tremendous amount
of things which is it's still scrolling
through but on you know smaller font
size that's actually fairly readable and
well-organized and I supported and it
shows all of the options and tasks and
so on that it did supports and one of
those tasks that you can run is the Java
Sea fest and what you shows up there is
that every single pass also supports
this vast dash gauge option so every
tasking that you can access
man line will have some possibly know
like well we definitely have my
education of documentation making sparks
in case of Java Sea just showing us that
we have a nonsense there's also boob
dash B which will show you the version
of boots and various relevant boot
pieces of information so we're going to
do is start working on this Java project
on the command line we're going to start
compiling some java source code so in
the source directory is our java file
and who is going to be she's going to
inform loop about the source file by
adding the source directory to what we
call food source of resource packs and
that's kind of like adding that
directory to boost class back then we're
executing the task show and show the
past that comes in with food and sort of
a diagnostic past it's kind of like a
task that you can use to see what food
is doing the middle of a pipeline or a
series of tests in particular the dash
left option on arm show will pronounce a
five-set and final set is the the builds
context or the set of files that the
build is currently operating on now
these are showing us chained together
these packs so we start off by informing
boot about our separate groups that's a
particular source so dad s takes a
source directory then we call the show
task which prints the file set her
program you guys so good
then we tied it to the Java Sea task
which compile Java and then we showed
positive now the difference between the
first Paula set and the second file set
is the stock class while clearly a job
as been compiled and there it is about
55 so we have a slide to show a little
bit more about sewing all the tension
either way as it's pretty typical this
is how pretty much every group in
location works you build up a pipeline
so you can see show NSF Java Sea shoma
SF what gets injected into the beginning
of the pipeline is your source file and
that becomes a file a sentence we'll
talk about a little bit each task takes
a FAFSA as input does some kind of
processing either adds removes modifies
files to create a new files that new
immutable fileset object and you pass it
to the next task and so on this will be
familiar you're you're familiar with
like ring the middleware pattern so to
install each other so we're just going
to keep rolling with adding past some
design doing more and more doing one
more thing so right now we've got our
Java project compiling and maybe we want
to turn it into the jar pilots
executable cuz it's a sentence important
program someone else inside our business
land overlooking cases so what we is
doing is he's introduced the palm pass
palm is a task that takes a number of
options like Daphne
project that should be is the version of
the project those are the two pieces of
information and permission program needs
to make a comics ml file an abominable
model is that the scripture that goes
into Nathan perfect then he's piping
that to the jar task which takes all the
things in the file 07 puts them into a
jar a job archive line and that takes an
option dash cam and that specifies what
is the main class in the artifact which
in our case is moved my java class so in
one fell swoop he has compiled Java
created a profile created a jar file
specified in the jar file with many
classes and insulted his local maven
repository now at this point we can um
def scene we can supply the daddy option
to boot now what dash he does is it
takes a name an artifact this could be
something like low charge or can be in
this case something local and then run
another test and one of the task
Academy's rep not start to boot grapple
so we're going to context now where
Buddhism is informed about our booth
demo artifacts which was installed
locally and now from the repple there's
a little song and dance you need to do
to college I was siding method main
method but turn out that class existed
on the classpath when we just compiled
in and solve just trying to composure so
yeah
yes so now we have added the source
package again the boot and we went
straight into the ground oh man I'm up
hired today oh yeah so he's in around
and the dash has often I said it adds in
the file set or inform food about
resource locations are one of the
principles and food is that everything
you can zoom and I should be possible to
replace the person well it's not really
possible to go direction but we tried so
the set n function will take the various
options that inform you know to set an
altar of global build context and the
source path is one of those things so
that said any quality just made is
analogous to the dash S options past the
Google when you were trying to reduce
attack so now that goop knows where our
Java code is we can actually create them
and initializes food pipeline from the
rapid using this boot macro which also
takes a series of tasks of course the
colonization of attacks is different
than it isn't like man life is no these
are fairly functions we're calling and
it's straining together of the results
of those function calls somehow but
nonetheless it works and does the same
exact thing so we would be open another
up around and move dash be read by the
same result we could add this penalty
which is installed locally to our our
rebel what I say yeah so if you look at
what the sun's java segment we're
calling a function what is that but we
can call it without the boot macro and
we'll see that it is it's a function
call anything to return another function
and by itself also a function varies
we're generating these are closed for
functions a function it is a phone
hey so what we're going to do macro and
what we were doing a command line we're
both actually function composition
strike slightly different syntax used to
perform the composition so we actually
have yeah so yeah yeah so what we did
just now is we built up this pipeline
and we did it in the command line at
apple and it's important you'd be able
to do them both ways because when you're
building it you need to explore a bit
and so this is what the peplum looks
like it's kind of similar to what you
would do in UNIX you know your juice is
really powerful for having you know it's
well known for the power of small tools
and an interface between the small tools
that you can chain it together different
different ways to do with a large number
of things and that's what the food
that's what who provides with the boot
executable and the boot macro or in the
if you're in the round and basically
what what's being provided here is click
the abstract the process abstraction and
they're connected so you need to have
these little processes that all
communicate meaning they that they take
the same kind of connective object as
input and they emit the same kind of
Miss pop so you can connect them all
together and unix the the process is a
program and they pass text between each
other with boot you have the task which
is a function especially at a function
and the thing that it has between
themselves is this immutable file set so
here's what a task looks like basically
it is a task is a function depth ask
actually returns a function it's just
add some metadata so it's basically def
up what's meta data takes an argument
which is how you configure that time to
parameterize tasks so the command line
options left there the yellow is where a
task can actually can have accumulated
state so it's sort of like a stateful
transducer you know about those are you
know if you had a middleware factory you
could have state there and then the
green
blue is the standard middleware pattern
where you have a handler that passes
after processing the file set it passes
it to the next Gambler and son continues
so you have layers as it'll work we have
a little macro that allows you to
simplify this in a lot of cases
sometimes can't use this but this is
this is essentially what a task is doing
you have simulated state handler so now
we have shown how we can compose
pre-existing tasks but we chose have to
type in that composition multiple times
now command line repple and he might be
sewn with the stagecraft images again so
we're going to introduce a new thing so
it's def pass which is on the slide that
death is a way for you to name
compositions either existing things or a
new functionality so defining a past is
like creating a plug-in or extending
like I said you can use it to compose
different things or this is the place
where you might implement new
functionality here we're just composing
the existing things like we did before
but we're just giving this whole process
a name build now we notice the long
options that the task and circular
functions are taking like colon
projector pulling me those are the same
options we were passing on the command
line they're just a long option so mood
support short and long option
man line and in the repple all of the
options are keyword arguments that are
another match up with the launch so did
you get new document still yeah so one
of the things def hats does so that's
our regular functions but we prefer
using the duck past macro to create them
just because they have metadata on them
that boot can use the form itself about
them it here is the music showing that
the build task has a documentation
screen and reports dash 8 which was
functionality automatically provided by
deafness and all the other has also can
be research admin or at the record
singer so we have a problem with a thing
no worries I RL wrap nice yeah so the
problem is that the projects or the palm
fast needs in addition to the name of
the project means the Virgin really
supplied the name of the project so
peach is going to provide version long
option 0.1 don't worry about that that
morning is totally cool totally normal
its network it's going to work I don't
watch watch see told you some more
not according it's going to be awesome
warning so now we've created our only
pet name fast you don't actually do
anything new it just imposes existing
things but for a lot of projects that's
exactly and only what you need to do a
cool thing is that this new task we
created this for spots in the sense that
you can call it compose it just like any
of the built-in fax here Misha has
composed it with the watch tax which is
one of the built-in past week but it's
impossible than this is back not
particularly special the watch has
leopard is the fact that like any
function that falls as middleware
economy shows inside the innermost
function which is the piece of code that
actually shows the logic tasks have the
opportunity not to call the next pass or
to call it multiple times what the watch
back does it has a handle to that next
handler and it is monitoring source
directories and when the source
directory is changed it calls that
function so because have some functions
that's totally it's even fun to do
honestly so that we've been doing a lot
of typing in the repple of command line
and stuff like that but the more astute
of you will say ah what if you could put
that out of five that you've really set
and it turns out that yes it's occurred
to us to the first thing you might want
I the original idea for you just take a
screenshot of the robberies I keep
telling you but something that way
so we have a screenshot here yeah it's
pretty sweet beautiful that's not how
you do it all right so you kind of who
does actually support just making you
know an ad hoc script with closure and
you have access all the boot the boot
library stuff so you can actually make a
build like this shebang at the top make
the file executable you have a main
method down there I can take arguments
and you can you can build your project
like this it'll totally work but what
you give up here is that you have to
process the arguments yourself you can't
be composing different tasks on the
command line like this if you if you
have just an executable where you're
handling them the things in the main
method so Boop does Google will look for
a possible movie in the project
directory and it'll evaluate coming in
there and then it'll take your command
line options and build a pipeline out of
them so in other words it generates the
main method for you at runtime when you
when you call it and so you can use this
to define tasks and things like that in
your bill do you menus from the command
line so we want you getting this so the
first cool thing now that our passes in
a file isn't a goal dog poop which is
this extension that food somehow
magically
we can do boo bash each and the task
that we created will show up right
alongside all the boatman's house with
the documentation string a poor
documentation any lotus there is
actually new line there between built on
ones and ones in your project so
typically you know will create these
don't files for project cars and their
self document to the extent that it
least the user sometimes butta eh
discover the past couple it's a lot to
your aunt Chelle whatever um yes there
we go and that's ago so the same way
watch at the rebel to compose with this
thing at the command line it also
composes doing all the same stuff we
just slightly change the format or
soaring build programs and build up in
five so again we can you know make pull
type lines that show things and pretty
sweet let's take into casts guys so this
point we only compose new existing
things and give it a name for that
composition but one of the more exciting
things about them with us is that it
into the tools you need to create new
kinds of texts so for instance one thing
you might need to do is extremely
important in some businesses you need to
convert java and support
this is actually a little known but
check Wikipedia for transsexuals an
uppercase version unfortunately this is
kind of a controversy so we haven't
built assassin the boot yet opportunity
here to great job of portraying
transpiler group or your size yeah let's
talk about the file sent a little bit
because we're going to be dealing with
it in a minute files that can be the
main the main purpose of the file set is
it provides an immutable abstraction
that we can use to pass information
between tasks why is it you debility
good and i know there's somebody out
there playing a drinking game and every
time i say immutability has to like
drink so i'm sorry dude but i say to few
more times I mean a bodybuilder a model
to be wasted by Sonia so immutability is
great because imagine you have this
pipeline tasks right and each task gets
a file set and it does some things
creates a new file set that it passes on
to next guys so it can hold on to this
file set if it's immutable and use it
later which is key so otherwise you have
a situation where you have a vote to
where they're passing where the file
system is mutable right so what happens
when a task wants to take this dot Java
file and make everything off the case so
you were typing your editor happily you
press the build button and now
everything's fortunately you'll
understand right so good I know yeah the
mobility is key because tasks need to
have full ring to modify any file
because what we had achieve in long run
is have
tools doing more on us than less parts
will need to be able to mock anything so
the solution here is look at get you
know listen to me now believe me later
it's like it there's real files
underneath because the Java class path
is real thing all of JDM tools use the
class have but we provide a an immutable
snapshot of it and that's the
information that gets passed it to me so
it's immutable it has an idiotic wearing
it meaning you can say what's in the
file set and it will give you these you
can either get XO file objects or just
relative path and life in the class that
you can add and remove things which
returns a new immutable fileset object
and if you can commit which is a
mutating function that mutates it makes
the underlying files the file system
like the immutable thing so it's like
restoring from backup or you know
checking out and commit and get the
underlying piles are like the working
set which nobody has access to but the
internals of group and you interact with
that by making commits just like an get
to this file object oh this is my part
fell asleep wake up yeah um yeah so here
is a they are expanded build up in our
porch oh that includes our Fortran
strength pilot that's actually yeah so
we have an up k step past actually that
acknowledge me call for train next for
the next presentation so we're creating
a duck pass up case and it has a
documentation string and that would be
the documentation ceramic say if we did
up KH next we have an opportunity to
configure the task so maybe our fortune
of files go by another name there dot
PHP or dot c video also for
okay so yes we are so this is where you
can add add options that somehow can
configure refer and arises path so
competitive jobs now inside disclosure
this for this let expression we
mentioned earlier the place are passing
accumulates take and what we're doing
here is we're initializing a resource
that's indications of this past school
and use the store intermediate state
this is kind of what your file system is
between gift notes this is the place
where you're doing the working you
prepare things and when you're ready to
mention to the file set but in between
those two times is when you need to work
with sort of a live animal thing that's
ten now this is the way we're works with
transient enclosure you know nobody care
as long as it happened inside function
next inside the innermost function of
the step of this task is when I'm
calling apply a question pop up Case
Files and if we look at up case files
appear take some directory working
directory and I'll list the files and
inside there it calls a function up case
bank now this is such a useful thing to
do that actually I created and push the
clothes dryers a little i drink it's
super sweet in other cases things could
you use the install task and everything
yes yeah yeah it was pretty crowded so
unfortunately you all run around the pot
when i did it those ragazza so inside
this past we're calling this function
and this is really difficult a
conversion so far their existing things
that have been written to convert one
kind of file to another whether it's
uniqlo descriptor SCSS or whatever and
we write fast to wrap and sort of santa
claus that functionality such that we
can compose these things together
finally at the end oops we have on i
mean at the end of this task so that
that is not its work it all up case
files on strap
you've handed a bunch of files in our
working directory just dirt and now what
we do is we add this record to the
powell said this is the sort of
analogous so it gets add hold by a gift
to men we're adding things and file set
value committing it and preparing it can
be patched for the next pass in the
change to thursday which is great works
awesome it actually maybe run that one
with an airline yeah let's do that
there is word
well if I default boot wells dump the
final file set now either a rather it
synchronizes the final value for every
target directory and there we have it
for training there's a problem holy
please give food show Dutchman's execute
look at these dependencies looks very
big penalties are many we scroll up I
like that x animal library 190 boss so
the course of an update
so when I was writing this function
uppercase strings I found me this truly
listed on another library so I got every
one directive amazing and bloggers and I
brought them in which can address what
do you go yeah a lot of people are like
me bring us a pod anyway so we amended
this thing we recently first tell me
crawl oh yeah that's right in fact we
probably don't need insane actually sort
of original idea yes you saved us all
for dependency hell and so the idea here
is that we have a program enclosure and
we have other things while he's familiar
but we can't use them as they have all
these dependencies that interfere with
the things that are in a program and the
way they interfere is basically if you
have a jar file that has a class of the
same name as something that's already in
jbm already in the classpath you have
crumbs so what you do is you create pods
which are isolated runtimes which can
have their own set of dependencies and
you can evaluate expressions in there
which is really useful you can even like
you know expand a macro in there so you
have a macro that has crazy that's easy
yeah cool things it's easy to create
bring code inside of them their first
class so you can have a function that
produces a pod you can have a function
that takes posits arguments and returns
pods all things you can do with regular
first class things enclosure although
unfortunately some things can't be
passed between cause because of the done
nature of closure each instance of
closure each closure on top has
dynamically created protocols interfaces
and all these things that you can mutate
inside the runtime so it's really not
possible to pass things created by
closure to each other but on the other
hand closure is really well designed you
can print just about everything that's
useful all the data that you that you're
going to need you can read it and print
it or make a tag literal and that's just
fine and pats dreams so anything you can
move you can experiment with pause or
any of the food API is right and Misha
said that father first class was not
constructed so that you can create a pop
value and it's kind of like I was
thinking on this kind of a little
containers little docker containers that
they're like will be ends here on
arbitrary children side of it and that
closer will not affect the program holes
I said think I should recently one use
of pods enough and work project was I
was calling out to the aim of the Amazon
SQS API which are partnering and all of
amelie both of Amazon's CPI to all kinds
of other services unrelated test US and
elsewhere that for a product that was
using a different version with the
Amazon a pil running all these in Korean
multiple logging libraries all kinds of
things it really goes your program so
instead of doing these different things
in different ad atoms which is you know
memory consumptive with the damage prone
to error just run all these different
things that are pots so what this is
doing here is you define the product
called and the booth ipod namespaces it
some structure with pop the pod takes an
environment which
a map describing the environment that
pod should start up it's kind of like a
doctor five pots familiar now what he
did is in this pod there's closure 115
on the product kind of you know retro
closure version a lot of cool things
enclosure one by one but certainly don't
use it anymore but maybe we're using
some library that requires something in
which one I want again if I wasn't ever
happening poacher look nose in there
here an expression clutter that version
which is a function call prints on the
Persian then meet back in the parent
environment which is the rebel here and
close a virgin and you know we can see
that we're in close upon success at the
top level plus you're sweet sure so here
we do the same thing that we did before
only we're running allen's awesome code
in a pod so we don't have to deal with
the consequences of all those
dependencies so the first thing we do is
we define the environment that the pot
is going to have so this pot is pause /
end there is the environment of the
parents so this is you know there are
current environment and what we want to
do is going to have the current
environment but with different
dependencies so we're setting that pod
to have a dependency on an Alice library
and then down here this is some
accumulating state that our class is
going to have its going to own its own
pot and this pot is pretty cool it said
we make an anonymous pot I'm it local
you know lexically which is that in the
closure of our closure with an SM our
task it's pretty pretty listing so here
we we added a tough perimeter to the up
Case Files function which using the pod
and you're welcome sorry
oh yeah so I think at the at the enemy
we commit it and what it is I don't know
we should run fair enough
so this is a thing but now did the
pothole so we need to boot show now to
look at the dependencies and there's no
seas so to be clear it's not like our
project has no dependencies it's just
that those penalties are isolated the
place is in the old process where we
need them yeah with that another
probably ten minutes maybe even shows in
the hotbox often get some questions sure
you guys questions rule definitely ask
them so so this is something that I'm
actually doing for hop on which is a web
frameworks which doesn't use react I
know your mom is out of this like oh
they have a real cool doesn't know
trailer look people they're gonna drink
a lot to you the reacts to react
drinking game people to react
so what we have here is this is the
build-out boot for hot blonde at i/o
which I'm doing some work on and because
hop on that iOS am it's a website a lot
of content and so doing content in it
with hop on you everything Lisp in
actual ax expressions so a list program
the actual markup is a list program and
join content and list in s expressions
is surprisingly unfun but there's stuff
like handle which are basically
admitting s expressions but they do it
without the punctuation so that means
you don't need to escape anything but
you do have the intent of things right
and so I wanted to incorporate handle
into my so I wrote a little handle task
which takes my version of hamill and
emits s expressions from it which
becomes a hot one sore spot you should
show some of the source okay
sufficiently my goal I think it would
not go over say it so this this is a
pretty sweet box let me should take it
work yeah so here's a handle west thing
where you know these the percent means
making us expression with this thing as
the car ahead the operation and so
there's a seal J macro this is actually
is getting called which incorporates all
this stuff which is text to the hell
editor as it slices these expressions
into the final product oh and actually
wrote a class oh oh oh yeah well cool
the point here is that we were able to
take our existing workflow and shim in a
thing that takes Hannele and you know
basically we're doing a multipass build
where each pass is totally independent
from the other so I can have a use have
all that I can take them aloud and the
rest of my bill told you actually we're
using you can see it on my persona its
marked down inside a hamel inside of
closure that gets converted the closure
script for kissing her at the JavaScript
which you know around the problem the MV
is actually a macro ebony is a macro
which compiled down to an AST which is
basically closure script s expressions
and it's a syntax highlighting using
using pigments in j python
