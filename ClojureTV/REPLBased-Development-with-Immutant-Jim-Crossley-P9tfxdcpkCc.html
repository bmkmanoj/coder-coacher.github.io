from the title we are going to build an
application from
and a ripple connected to an application
running inside a mutant s Stewart said
Jay crossly three on Twitter and IRC and
github work for red hat mostly on those
guys yeah torque box and mutant so let's
talk about you because there's really
two potential audiences for this talk
right there are those developers
familiar with the modern java
application server and then there are
those developers who enjoy the benefits
of a incremental development at a
closure repple the intersection of the
those two groups is maybe a little small
right now but I'm having a good time in
that place and so I'm hoping to
evangelize a little bit for you guys
however you guys are probably clearly in
that rebel group right you know all
about the ripple so if I'm not careful I
run the risk of making the cover of the
magazine so for this talk I'll be I got
a little happy with the application and
we're going to show off some of the
mutant features that should be more
interesting to you guys so what is a
mutant well like everything we build in
our industry it's a box with other
little boxes inside of it little words
right now really what it is it's built
on the jboss application server jboss a
yes so it makes available to
applications deployed to it a number of
commodity services right there in the
JVM in the same process so why might you
want that two reasons among possible
others one is it simplifies deployment
or at least makes deployment of your
applications consistent and not only of
your applications but of the services
they rely on too because it's an
integrated platform an integrated stack
it clustering is kind of built in so you
scale your services this
anyway you scale for example your
messaging service in the same way you
scale your cashing service and that's by
adding more nodes to a cluster hopefully
we'll see a little demonstration of a
two node cluster if I can get that
running but we add some more on to jboss
is right we had some libraries around
those services that engage those
services through side effects the
functions in those libraries and we
provide native support for Lanigan
projects so that there is no packaging
step there is no uber war required no
war followed all required when you
deploy your app your Lanigan project to
a mutant you're you're telling it where
your project clj file lives and so a
mutant will then create an isolated
closure runtime with an effective class
path that matches the dependencies
you've specified in your project clj so
those dependencies are resolved at
runtime there is no packaging step there
can be but by default during development
you wouldn't need it so that's a little
high level what a mutant is the
challenge for this talk is we want to
eliminate the distance between your
development environment and the target
environment on which your application is
going to run right because it's that
distance that necessitates things like
mocking techniques or special purpose
testing libraries the need for which
kind of goes away when you are connected
to a ripple in that app server and so
you have access at your fingertips to
everything your application is going to
have access to at runtime in production
so I want to build an app for you guys
that'll kind of demonstrate that and so
what we're going to try to build today
is a poor man's prismatic and prismatic
I have no affiliation with them but it's
a neat service if you don't know what it
is it's a content discovery service
that I'm sure uses very sophisticated
algorithms to analyze your social graph
and present you with content from the
web that you're probably going to be
interested in our poor man's prismatic
or pores matic as I'm calling it will
have no such sophistication all we're
going to do is connect to the Twitter
streaming API will we'll get some tweets
matching some search terms will find
links in those tweets and then we'll
verify that those links contain the same
search terms a high number the same
search terms that we originally gave a
Twitter now the use case we're trying to
address here is when we search for
Justin Bieber on Twitter as you know we
all do we want to see some hard-hitting
critical analysis of his musical and
cultural impact to society we do not
want to see yet another photograph of
someone's nether regions claiming to be
Justin Bieber right so we want text we
don't grab we don't want graphics
necessarily social crisis so so here's
kind of the data flow for the app this
is what we're going to build will have a
web UI into which we can enter the
search terms will distribute those
search terms over a messaging topic two
components they can reconstitute
themselves in response to receive in
those terms the components will be the
Twitter demon it's a producer of our cue
he's connected Twitter gets URLs puts
them there and this scraper guy will
consume those URLs off that cue fetch
the content from the internet count up
the terms right the results back in the
database for the web UI to display we
are going to try to create a little
cluster at the end it's a pretty
ambitious app by the way so I want to
show off two things in that cluster 2 to
a mutant features the Twitter demon will
be implemented as our H a singleton
highly available singleton all that
means is in a cluster of a mutant he's
only ever going to run
one of the nodes but if he goes down for
whatever reason he'll be started on one
of the other notes to back him up
contrast that with the URL scraper the
little green guy we that we want we get
automatic load load balance distribution
of messages across the nodes in our
cluster so we want to be able to achieve
scale and find more justin bieber
critical analysis just by adding another
node to our cluster so we'll see that
now we're going to try some live coding
here i'm going to use emacs and slime
and mutant supports both in ripple and
swank endpoints and the in revelry max
client is getting excellent ur every day
I'm just a little bit more comfortable
in Slam I should say as you might
imagine I've already written this app
and it's it's up on github within in my
account pours matic so you can follow
along or you can look at in more detail
later let me get this
hold on make sure I got a browser all
right ready in you max I like to keep a
lot of shells open one of which just one
you start in the morning is line of
mutant run that's just firing up the
mutant he should come up in a few
seconds we do all of our interaction the
easiest way to your interaction with the
mutant is through the line again plugin
that's the line of mutant so he's up he
came up me toggle that make it a little
easier okay so now i'm just going to
create my new line again project matic
we're just used we're using lining it
too by the way I'll show you a couple of
features in lining into that we like we
support line again one maybe so all
right before i deploy this app this
brand new virgin app nothing on it I
want to do one thing and the project clj
and that is tell a mutant to start up
that Swank port or I could optionally do
the in rebel port right there so when I
deploy him he'll start that up
and we could get going so that's also
through the
that mean
so I'm running line of you can deploy
now all that is doing is creating a
little deployment descriptor we call it
just a little file it's putting it in a
directory that line that a mutant is
monitoring so he's seeing it he
recognized that flowers put their starts
up our Swank server and we're deployed
right we're not doing anything but we're
deployed just if you want to see what
that deployment descriptor looks like
just a glorified symlink this is just
telling the mutant where our project
lives alright so now we're going to
commence to coding so what's that
development cycle where we're in we're
oh no wait we're not in it hold on I was
about to give you the big reveal now
we're in it so I got some mutant
namespaces I should have I'm just using
slime connect to connect to that guy
that a mutant just deployed so in a
mutant cute let's so now let's start
building the app right so I need a
persistent store we're at the conch what
persistent store should I use thank you
we'll do that so all we're doing is
adding dependencies to our project
actually why we're in here let's do a
couple more things let's use line again
profiles in our development profile
which is active by default that's when
we'll start up our swank port right and
we'll also but in a production when the
production profile is activated instead
of the start on the site port we're
going to give him a function that a
mutant is going to run that's our entry
point into our application that starts
it up with regard to de Tomic i'm going
to use just a means of configuration
here to say will tell de Tomic to open
his connection to the in-memory database
in development and the free transactor
when we're going to simulate our cluster
to
10 minutes oh we got plenty of time all
right so so I save that I go back to my
rebel I require a very handy namespace
and mutant dev you should not use it in
production one thing it does is provide
a handy function that that will
basically reload any changes you've made
to project clj so you can you guys
already understand this but for people
who were steeped in that app server
development tradition it is a very
powerful thing to be able to we're
building our appt seeing it run as we go
you know that's the whole thing I'm
really trying to convey the changes
we're making we're persist in those two
source files right but we're evaluating
those forms were put in those source
files in the actual repple again I
realize you guys know that okay so what
do we do now we've got day Tomic let's
build a quick schema and a models file
to encapsulate that schema because it's
in my class path but Lanigan didn't
create it for me I'll put a Resources
directory here into which will create a
schema DTM file yes now pretend I'm
doing a lot of typing man boom all right
so so so you're not gonna have to watch
me do a lot of type in here actually
this is going to be more of a code
review than an interactive ripple thing
so I this is simple I'm not gonna going
to a lot of details here this is just a
place I need to store my search terms
and my URLs that I end the counts of
those search terms in them again you're
going to look at this on github you're
more interested so okay yeah alright so
let's create the models file that's
going to use that schema lots of type
and boom all right so actually let's
kind of wrap that up okay so we so at a
top level you can kind of see we're
using that configuration this this
registry is in a mutant registry
namespace it just allows me to we
associate the the line again hash the
representation of your project we
associated with that project keyword so
from that registry you can get that so
we can get the day Tomic URI we need so
we're just usual top-level side effect
here to establish that day Tomic
connection that the functions down here
we'll use we won't go through them but
it's just you know crud functions i can
add and delete a term show the terms add
the URL so when I control C control k to
evaluate and compile and load that file
and go back to my rebel can you guys see
that now I should be able to have some
model stuff right I can get my terms
which returns an empty lists I can add a
term I can tight so we got foo and now
foods in my list so let's so we're using
our end memory database we have stuff in
our model and we also save those files
so when we we have this project as we're
going so let's build the configuration
distribution topic thingy
big alright so config I don't even need
to roll him up he's pretty simple
because what he is is just a very thin
veneer over mutants messaging namespace
right to where we can register handlers
just functions that will call back when
people publish things to either a topic
or a cue topic in this place in this
case so our web web UI is going to call
notify and our Twitter and our scraper
guys they'll call observe passing in the
function that the topic is going to call
whenever those terms change terms will
come in via this config thing now
messaging endpoints in a mutant our
cluster abell and transactional so they
require some resources inside the
application server in order to start
them fortunately we're inside the
application server right so we have no
problem calling these and we not have no
problem constructing tests that use
these so let's do that since I haven't
written any tests yet so nobody judge me
let's first let's contrack compile mode
that will use some closure mode stuff
control CT takes me here and I need to
make my directory because it doesn't
exist and boom all right so here's a
test this is just testing that my
notification and observation works
notice though that I'm calling start I'm
calling stop two things that I must call
inside the container so there's you know
unit tests and integration tests and
acceptance tests all that stuff when
you're inside the application server you
care less about the distinction between
Anna mutant and a mutant and a unit and
an integration test all you really care
is that your tests are fast and clear
because you're going to have to use them
to later understand what the hell you're
it's due and when you're trying to
change it most importantly though your
tests are testing the resources that
your application is going to really use
when it's in production right what do I
want my tests to verify I want them to
verify that my app is going to work
correctly when it's supposed to which is
when it's interacting with customers so
I like this ability now I also want to
have that ability to easily test these
things on a CI server that may not have
a container available so I'm going to
show you a way to do that as well
that'll be the last thing we show 2008
and I'm making great time here all right
we're almost there so oh I should run
the test verse maybe we're not quite
there control C oh ok let's do this
lesson let's load it first let's get the
right mode activated troll see boom oh I
should probably have this up so you can
see it i had to rappelled down down in
the bottom you know yeah ok so we can do
that again and you see that output again
at the bottom you can also do it old
school and run them off or namespace a
lot of this has more to do with your
client capabilities than anything
immunes doing I just like the fact that
i'm using the that I'm that I'm
accessing things that are really in the
server when I show my tests when I can
strive my test so wait so let's let's
let's let's take stock of where we are
for a minute okay as you recall a little
diagram let's see if I make that work
all right we did that and we just
finished this even with a test we're not
gonna do any more tests I don't have any
time I got three more things to build I
got to build a web UI I got to build a
Twitter demon and I got to build a URL
scraper each of those three things are
going to bring in additional
dependencies then I'm going to have to
put in my project clj and reload in my
rebel now I don't want to restart
my rebel what's the point right I want
to have my rep blow up all the time but
it's already got classes loaded in it
right it's got day Tomic and all the
many day Tomic transitive dependencies
that it pulled in with it odds are that
if I pull in some more dependencies with
their transitive dependencies I'm going
to run into some conflicts so I don't
want to do that well yeah I don't want
to have conflicts so I want to use the
line pedantic plug in to let me know
whether I am going to have any conflicts
so let's do that let's go back to
project now let me enter in these and I
want to talk briefly about them you know
what composure and hiccup is that's what
I need for my web UI what porpoise is
all purposes is me not being sure what
my network connectivity is here today it
mimics the api's of the other two
libraries i need twitter api and clj
HTTP and if it can't use them it will
attempt to use them and if it can't
it'll fall back to a local corpus of
tweets and URL so you guys can see the
data so you get it right poor asthmatic
and corpus all right all right so we got
those in there let's compile it no no
let's invoke a lion pedantic to see if
we're going to have any conflicts now if
everybody crosses their fingers and oh
wait before you cross your fingers I'm
gonna show you how to invoke line
pedantic it's just run line depths the
line Depp's task will do that that line
depth tree if everybody's crossing their
fingers then this is going to come green
it's going to say you have no conflicts
with any of your previous dependencies
or the new ones you want to add
obviously somebody wasn't crossing his
fingers because it's red which tells me
that there is a risk
that the classloader associated with my
application inside a mutant may have
already loaded a class from a jar that
is wrong when I make it right okay so so
we're going to talk about the decision
will have to make but first let's make
it right pedantic gives me great output
to help me know how to remove my
conflicts I'm not using any of that
output now because I happen to know that
through a combination of reordering that
and correct typing I canopies it to 12
to 14 ok finished green were good here's
my decision because I've got a running
context in my rep aright I've got
running context and I know because when
I just appended my new dependencies on
there I know I've got a potential
conflict whether I just fixed it now or
not all I really did fix it now is when
I reload my project in my rep oh I'm
going to be making the classpath right
I'm going to be making it different but
I still got stuff possibly loaded in
that class loader right so i can either
take the red pill which is to accept the
sadness of our reality
and Henry deploy my app and that will
shut down the rebel it'll bring it back
up I reconnect to it and I rebuild
whatever context that uh that I had that
will take all of 20 or 30 seconds much
less time that it's taken me to tell you
what the hell we might even do so or I
could take the blue pill for those of
you don't know the blue pill is to be
blissfully ignorant of your illusion and
that's what we're going to do because I
don't want to restart my rebel now but I
know there's potential for conflict so
as I go forward I'm looking out for
linkage errors or classcastexception or
field not found errors and when I see
those things I will not be afraid
because fear is the mind-killer all it
does is tell me that I got to take the
red pill it just tells me I got to read
the point my app reconnect to the Red
Bull you know I lost my bet that's it
wait too long to explain okay so so
where the hell was i oh we've got to
build the web app 250 I got 15 minutes
all right cool uh yeah I feel like
Darren McGavin and christmas story when
he gets a flat tire like timing right
this is what we're going to do
web boom boom boom yeah we're going to
talk a little bit about this one we are
not going to look at my unstyled hiccup
code you're not going to judge me just a
form for adding in search terms and a
form for each term that I can delete it
and I'll put in a list of the URLs that
we count you'll see that in a second
before we get to that let's look at our
routes I can I can my main route context
is where I'll call that home function
and then I can add a term and delete a
term we'll look at those two functions
in a second I want to say this Web Start
in lieu of that war file creation step
that I said you didn't have to do what
you do instead is you call this little
function and that mounts your ring
handler on to whatever context you want
in your application that's just an aside
now here we go what's that web UI doing
right he's manipulating two different
completely different separate resources
he is publishing something to a topic a
message broker a co hornet q4 if you're
interested and and he's writing summer
day Tomic database we would love for
that to be atomic we would love for
those two actions to be in the same
transaction and the mutant provides
support for distributed transactions how
many raise your hand if you know to
distribute transaction is that is
awesome closure is so close to being in
the enterprise with that many hands
being up for the spirit raised edges the
so distributed transaction yeah okay you
know you know that's great okay in a
mutant message brokers messaging caching
through the mutant cash that in finnish
band datagrid and any jdbc resource that
you create in a mutant those are
automatically transactional they can
automatically participate in a
distributed transaction you might be
looking at this and saying Jim you're
using de Tomic
you mean de Tomic implements X a
resource and it can participate in a
distributed transaction well no and it
probably never will and I respect that
but rich and his generosity hipped me to
a neat technique which if you only have
one participant in the transaction that
does not implement X a resource then as
long as you have him do his business
last you get an effective distributed
transaction right so in a mutant you got
just about every service you need in
there except a database so often it is
the one thing it's very handy to
incorporate messaging and database
persistence in distribute transaction
you know that's probably the common the
most common case for using distributed
transactions at all anyway notice that
because he's last if he fails and tosses
an exception that X a transaction is
going to catch it and roll back anything
that's been done with a real ex a
resource so even though that notify is
called before I add the term the
notification doesn't actually go out
until the transaction commits now notice
I can't do that right because if he
succeeds but then this guy fails the
rollback message that the ex a
transaction form will send the Atomics
not going to do anything with that so
without distributed transactions what do
I have to do I probably it depends on my
app but I've probably got to write some
sort of compensatory logic that deals
with the fact that my runtime components
could be out of sync with my persistent
state right that's usually code code
needs to be tested and maintained we all
know that we prefer to write code that
doesn't have to be tested or maintained
so distributed transactions are a handy
tool to have in your box for a large
class of applications that's my little
transactions rant let's seriously oh oh
we saved the project
but I didn't reload it so I got to get
my got to get my dependencies back into
my rifle this is the blue pill we just
took the blue pill now it should be to
compile and load it all right so got two
more things were oh let's let's see the
damn at okay what am I pours matic with
start oh ten minutes okay I can do
this oh sorry thank you I compile the
wrong file now go back here wait a
minute start he should be up we should
be able to get to him hey Mon style form
so you got food still in there I'm a
database from where I put it in there
bass and you get the idea don't judge me
from a lack of style okay okay so all
right I got five minutes to get the
Twitter and the scraper will go really
quick through this you can ask me
questions about it later when did you
get here does anybody know he's not now
okay twitter twitter CLG all right three
quick things on a real i want you to
talk about here UL extractor just a
couple of high-order functions in that
demon not demonize URL extractor returns
a function that candy structure a tweet
and get the text off of it and get the
URL off of it oh it's all it's doing it
pass to it handler I just need a way to
find links reconnect is the thing that
responds to those search terms come from
that topic right that's the handler that
out that I passed to observe he's just
closing the existing stream and opening
a new stream with the new terms demon
this is the immune the demon demon eyes
needs a name and a start and stop
function right if you're only one a
mutant are your only one peer and a
cluster that starts up that start
function is going to be executed
asynchronously immediately but if you're
not the only node and a cluster
and this tweet URLs demon is already
running you may or may not get your
start function called depending on
whether he dies and the H a service
decides that you need to back him up so
that's kind of the demonized thing so
let's compile and load him let's go look
at the scraper scraper is a little bit
he's the most complicated he's got the
most collaborators to deal with so let's
look at him one at a time fetch has
Colin clj HTTP right and that returns a
hash that it represents the response
coming back and and the body is one of
the things in that in that response
we're memorizing him we are doing it
using we're doing it using an impending
data grid through our mutant cash memo
function here that is possibly overkill
for this particular application but I
can do it so I'm going to do it it's
easy the next three functions are
composable functions that just take in a
hash and return the same hash with an
additional key on it one for the count
just using frequencies one for the title
that we get from the body one for the
URL that we get from the trace redirects
because all the Twitter's URLs are
shortened but we'd like to see the real
justin bieber URL search URL for is
where we're composing all those
functions to create our scrape function
and we get the side effect of him
writing the road to the database if our
count for that term is greater than zero
we are starting up our scraper and he's
creating that function the reconfigure
is the guy responded the topix guy he
gets the terms in and he maps those
terms over the save you RL force will
get the side effect you know he's one
function that looks at all of them he is
invoked right here as the listener of
that you are elves cue he gets a URL and
scrapes it we by default he's just
single threaded but he will be i/o bound
waiting on those fetches to return so we
give him a few more threads with
concurrency and the configure were just
passing that to observe so it gets
called whenever the search terms changed
stop
five minutes I can do it all right no
questions but y'all come to our
unsession if you have more questions
and/or will figure that out stop oh
right so start returns a couple of
things that I should really shut down
cleanly so I expect my caller to pass it
back to me at some point that is not
totally required in a mutant when your
application is under ployed he will
cleanly shut down whatever resources you
were using however when you're at a
repple it's very convenient to have
those complimentary start and stop
functions so I can exercise some
predictability over my development
experience that's control right there ok
now let's use core despite Chaz's
reluctance to do so Flanagan gave it to
us so we'll use that as this is the
entry point into our application right
this is what we call start start up our
web app our URLs q or scraper we are
telling that demon where to publish
those URLs each time he gets one we say
publisher the URLs Q and the start is
what's going to order the scraper we're
telling him what Q to consume prom so
not controlling that now we should be
able to see it run I got to go back to
my mutant buffer that's where my outputs
going to be so he started the tweet
service he's searching for bar and bass
he actually found something for bar in
bath and you see how our Twitter our
Twitter demon is echo and the tweets
that it finds with with links and then
the scrapers fetching them and then
should be counting them you should see
bar and bass with whatever counts he
found so we come back to our page yeah
and we see that I think prismatic would
be proud right there recruiter is
probably gonna be calling me tomorrow
okay so yes thank you yeah wait
how much time four minutes all right
let's start a cluster let's just do a
cluster for the hell of it I want to
shut that guy down I just happen to have
a cluster running that ah dang it dang
and I knew that was going to happen hold
on I can do this hornick you has a
problem with local host on a mac to
where I need that all right just forget
you saw that okay well bring that guy
back up okay here's what i doing i got
to know these clusters are going to come
up there going to discover each other
these two nodes they're installed in two
different directories on my laptop i am
going to use this shell and deploy the
app to them line see that minus p prod
that's how i'm setting my lonegan
profile some saying when you deploy this
guy activate that prod profile that's
going to cause him to call my entry
point and go on so let's deploy him we
should see him come up on node1 that
bridge that means he found his peer i
should also say that i have de Tomic
running the the peer over here and this
so the trans actors running so he's
going to use that one now so you should
see log messages of him creating his day
Tomic schema there you go at some point
he's going to be up we can do this let's
be ready to see him because i have two
servers on one left i got to give them
separate ports so they don't conflict
alright let's search for some old
passwords not yet coltrane safa and
elvis now because we're going to assume
the best we assume that Twitter's got
some taste right and he actually does
right we're getting some hits from that
actually while we see those hits let's
bring them up on no.2 no.2 is going to
help the scrape it
and we'll see him right there down at
the bottom of the screen he should
detect there he goes so he's going to
come up and he'll start joining in the
fray of node 1 node 1 is still up still
searching how many minutes do I have one
all right we'll write a blog post about
the testing thing I was going to show
you and we'll move on but I want you to
see this let's start searching for
Bieber let's get it let's just get it
over with sorry so now look at them you
got both of them running right they're
both scraping I see scrape messages in
both buffers but I only see the tweets
in the top buffer right now let's shut
so that's our that's our automatic load
distribution right just as peers join
and their consumers of the queue they
get to participate so that's cool so I
don't a seal the Bieber tweets all right
screw that so so I turn Bieber off just
so it doesn't scroll off the screen here
I want to show you just one last thing
I'm going to kill node 1 and you should
see no to take his place right down here
no to see what he did starting tweet
service he just detected that
automatically he decides he's got to
become the master because he's the only
Pierre left and our robust Twitter demon
continues the only other thing I wanted
to show you and I can do it really quick
because the red lights flashing the only
other thing i want to show you was line
a mutant test that's a way you can run
those in container tests on your CI
server on Travis or whatever because
it's going to fire up Anna mutant and
it's going to deploy the app with an in
ripple service configured use bolted to
discover your tests and then invoke
those tests and report the results back
that's what I was going to show you all
that awesomeness but I guess I should
end now and if y'all want to see that
and come to the unsession tomorrow we'll
go over that I guess that's all I got
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
