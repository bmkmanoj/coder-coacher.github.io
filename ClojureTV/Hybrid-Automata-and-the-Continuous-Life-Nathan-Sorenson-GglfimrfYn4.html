spark fund and we do financing for
energy efficiency projects so I'm gonna
start with a timeline of events 2008 in
Surrey British Columbia Canada a grad
students working on modeling the
psychological effects of playing
difficult video games on video game
players and they had a model that
involved continuous variables that
changed over time and discrete finite
state machines that could transition
instantaneously and they they knew how
to deal with continuous variables from
their undergraduate calculus courses and
they knew about finite state machines
from computer science courses but they
never actually seen how to combine these
into one formalism so they went ahead
and did what most grad students do and
followed their heart and just sort of
made something up that seemed reasonable
and got a paper published next we go to
2011 downtown Vancouver here we find a
software engineer working on software
geared towards young children so the
animations had to be snappy and the
interactions had to be smooth they
wanted to incorporate ideas from
functional reactive programming into the
program which worked great for the
animation side but didn't seem to be a
perfect fit for the interaction side so
they mixed and matched ideas from here
and there just sort of making something
up and just shipped it TM finally in
2015 we find a software developer
working on financial software modeling a
certain type of contract called a
waterfall rule and in these you pay
certain investors when certain
properties hold until the finances
change in which case you pay different
investors according to different rules
and this was all well and good but it
seemed every time I knew one of these
rules entered the mix there is a
combinatorial explosion of complexity so
they started doing what we all do mix
and matching ideas to come up with some
domain-specific something rather to
express this notion in a compact with
combinators but then an important
discovery was made now of course I was
the victim and perpetrator in all these
cases and I'm here to share my discovery
and the common thread in all of these
cases was a formalism that I had ad hoc
Li and informally specified boolean
did two and a half times and that is
hybrid automata hybrid atomic is not a
new idea or a particularly obscure idea
but it was new to me so I'm just gonna
share I share what these are about
because I find them really useful and
and really explains a lot of things I've
wanted to do in the past this formalism
comes from the electrical engineering
community so it's used quite often to
model things like thermostats and other
robots that control the physical world
these are cyber physical systems which
we've just heard about if you happen to
be joining us from the room next door
it also can be used to model
communication networks or anything where
there's resources under contention
things like traffic problems also growth
problems so epidemic models urban growth
chemical reactions and a whole host of
other other other things so they show up
all the time and I won't also want to
say that not only this is a good tool
for thinking of problems I think that it
it implies a good way of programming
similar types of problems and so that's
where I'm gonna talk about hybrid
expression which is a library we've
written at spark fund for programming
with these sort of systems it's not open
source yet but it will be quite soon the
reason we like hybrid expression is that
it's based on an actual thing now
there's no there's no problem inherently
with writing a specific problem that
exactly is tailored to your use case but
it's nice to know if you're building
something that's been used by a lot of
people now these these reactive dynamic
systems have a lot of pitfalls so if you
are using one if you're basing this on
something that has been in use for 20
years odds are someone else has run into
the exact same issues you're facing and
there's words to describe these problems
we know naming thing is hot naming
things is hard so why not just use names
that have already been identified
it handles edge cases for you so like
the waterfall rules which I mentioned
which are so some examples of and
there's also nice properties that
compose when you use hybrid automata one
nice property that we like and and when
writing some financial software is that
in certain situations you want money
neither to be created nor destroyed so
transferring money between bank accounts
like it as we may booking profit based
on software bug is
a viable business model so when we when
we have these two hybrid atomic we know
when we compose them the composition
will likewise not create or lose money
so we don't have to re reason about it
every time we add a new rule and finally
to evaluate these systems you have to
choose some notion of logical
concurrency we got two picks we chose a
deterministic one and this is nice a
nice tool to have for just modeling
business logic that is conceptually
concurrent so for example you get paid a
certain day every month and you have to
pay other people certain day every month
this is logically concurrent you don't
actually need to use threads or core
async to talk about these logical
business processes and you don't need to
worry about non determinism or
computational efficiency you just want
some logical notion of concurrency so
you get that sort of as part of the
package so I'm going to describe how we
model a simple system with hybrid atomic
so we have here a bucket with a certain
amount of water so W represents the
volume of water in this bucket now we at
a certain point want to open the valve
and release the water and we'll see that
we're assuming water is as leaving this
bucket at a constant rate and we'll
describe that constant rate with a
differential equation so here DW equals
minus 1 during this period so that's
just saying the water is leaving the
bucket at a rate of minus 1 you can
think of this as units of water per
second there's lots of different
notations for for derivatives AOC DW
over DT W prime W with the dot and those
all mean the same thing for this in this
context now at a certain point we can
close the hole start filling the bucket
up again and the differential equation
here will say DW equals +1 so again it's
the bucket is filling back up at a
constant rate so we can describe this
system with a hybrid automata with two
what are called control modes so if you
see in fine state machines it's the same
sort of idea the system can only be in
one control mode at this at one time but
there is logical time passing while it's
sitting in a control mode so here the
logical time passing is described by
what's called a flow condition which
differential equation so while the
system is in this mode water is leaving
the bucket now at a certain point we
want to switch modes and so we can
transition across one of these edges and
we're allowed to do so when we satisfy
what's called a jump condition and these
are sometimes called guards so here it
says when water gets to be less than two
units were allowed to switch into this
next state now strictly speaking this is
what's called may jump semantics so so
when you annotate an edge like this it
means you're allowed to jump when this
condition is true if you want it ok so
it goes up like that and then we have a
jump that lets us go back so you want to
talk about when you must jump you have
what's called an invariant condition and
that's saying you have to leave the
state before W is less than 1
essentially so this this this allows you
to talk about non determinism in the
formalism it's important to keep in mind
this doesn't mean random or like you
don't get to ever pick it just means its
unspecified how the choice is made so
you could just by Fiat say we're gonna
jump as soon as possible all the time or
you could say we're gonna jump as late
as possible
quite often when you're modeling a
system you want to say some evil demon
is choosing the worst possible time to
jump and I want to prove that my system
still behaves well given that situation
so this doesn't mean it's a random jump
it just means at this point where we're
leaving it open to interpretation so we
can have systems with multiple variables
here we've got two buckets connected X
describing the volume of water in one
bucket and wine Y in the other and we
can imagine that when we let the water
flow we're going to see X decrease and Y
increase until they reach steady state
at which case they stay constant so this
is a hybrid otamatone with two control
modes one where water is leaving one
bucket a rate of one unit per second and
and entering the other at a rate of one
unit per second and one where it's at a
steady state and the thing I want to
point out here is that this is where we
see that conservation of resource
property waters now I've never created
or destroyed and we can see that in the
equations because each control mode the
differential equations sum to zero so
that means for every water coming out
of the X bucket it's going in equally to
the Y bucket and like what 0 plus 0 is
also 0 so that's a that's a conservation
of resource property that we can inspect
visually I also want to show fancier
differential equations so here we have a
growth equation so here the the
derivative of X is proportional to the
value of X so so DX equals 0.2 times X
and this can be a case where you have
exponential growth for example bacteria
so if you imagine this to be a petri
dish where bacteria is growing now if we
start without any bacteria there will
actually act that the Val value of X
will always remain zero so at a certain
point somebody has to sort of dump a
spoonful of bacteria into this dish at
which point now that the the population
is seated it will proceed to grow
exponentially and you can do the
opposite and scoop some bacteria out and
it will proceed to still grow at this
exponential rate so this is always this
is always one constant equation
describing this growth so how do we
describe these these events of adding
and taking away so we can model that
with these these selfloops that stay in
the same mode but are allowed to sort of
do something along the edge so so here
we can see we're allowed to set the
variable X to X plus 1 as we transition
along this self-loop and this is a
different equal sign so this is your
sort of standard a mutable variable type
update and this is something you can
only do instantaneously while going
along one of these edge it doesn't make
sense to reset something while you're in
a state of continuous motion so likewise
we can have another edge that represents
taking something out and that is a set X
to X minus one so this is like decrement
X and there is a connection between
bacterial growth and application we
often find ourselves in which is
modeling bank account interest which
works the same same way so the more the
more money you have in the bank the more
interest you're going to get for a month
now
bank accounts don't tend to give you
continuously compounding interest it's
usually based on some periodic interest
compounding period and that's a fine
thing you can do so hybrid atomic I
don't have to be with respect to
continuous time they can be with respect
to a discrete periodic notion of time so
in the same way when you when you do
this you usually switch the derivative
notation to this Delta and the
differential equation becomes what's
called a difference equation but it's
the same idea
so here time goes in these jumps the
jumps representing the compounding
periods of the interest rate and it
grows again in this in this discrete
notion so this just shows that this is
this is the thing you're allowed to do
with hybrid otama
so just to recap all the features you've
seen you've got continuous motion
described by differential equations that
hold in a control mode you can do jumps
instantaneously along edges you have
multiple variables that interact and you
can mutate those variables in a state
transition and time can be continuous or
discrete I think I was maybe saying that
one behind that was the animations there
so so I'm gonna move on to onto fancier
examples and these are these are the
waterfall rules so here the situation is
if we imagine we have three investors
pitching in $100 each to a project and
they're expecting a little bit more in
return so you know this project might be
an energy-efficient upgrade and there
will be savings generated so so each
investor is expecting a little bit extra
back so investor a is the most
conservative investor they only want
$108 back but they expect to be paid
first because they're taking the least
amount of risk so if something goes
wrong and there's not enough to go
around
they want their money first opposite is
investors see who wants the most but
they agreed that if anything goes wrong
their last last in the list to see their
money so if you imagine this as a set of
stacked buckets the first state our
first mode we're going to be in is
adding adding water to the first bucket
and subtracting from P which is the
money from the project and that will
fill up in a state of of one unit per
time
yeah at which case it gets the gets the
money they expect and we move into the
next state he fills up if at any point
we've run out we have this catch-all
mode that says there's not enough money
left to go around and we leave this
state but if we had enough we could
continue giving money to investors see
and so again you can see here all these
derivatives differential equations sum
to zero so money is conserved and we can
do fancier waterfalls so this one we're
still giving preferential treatment to
certain investors but we're not giving
all of the money to investor a and then
only giving money to B we're giving a
little bit to everybody just
preferentially so if something runs out
everyone would have a little bit of
something so here I've made the buckets
different widths so even though the
water level will rate will rise sort of
at the same rate a wider bucket will get
more volume per second so that's the
intuition there so we start our first
control mode is everybody getting a
little bit of something so a is getting
the most so they're getting three six
units per logical second and B here is
getting the slowest they're getting 1/6
these all sum to one so so it's coming
out of the common bucket at the same
rate we go until a is satisfied and then
we continue on just giving to C and B
and then finally C is the last one when
you do the same thing the opposite way
so this is sometimes happens when people
get out of balance and need to be caught
up stew to act to be equal with the rest
of the investors so here a we want to
pay them back first until they're caught
up with B in which case we pay them both
up and so on so you can imagine if
you're writing a lot of code that does
this manually you start to feel like
there should be a pattern here they
seemed like built out of some notion of
simpler building blocks that there
should be there should be a solution to
this so
so what I've shown you is hybrid
automata the the exact formalism that
you would find in an engineering paper
so they're they're a great tool for
formalizing this type of logic but
they're not yet a great tool to program
with and the reason is as I haven't
shown you any notion of composition like
all the examples have sprung forth fully
formed all defined and there's no idea
of building up a bigger hybrid atomic
out of a smaller one and that's sort of
an inherent problem with the formalism
so that's dealt with one way of doing
that is to take what's called an
algebraic view of it and that comes from
a couple papers that are libraries based
off of one is algebraic calculate
calculate for hybrid systems and the
others differential dynamic logic for
hybrid systems and I don't need to get
into the details of what it means to
look at something as an algebra but the
takeaway for us is that you get a recipe
you can follow to give you a nice
well-behaved language programming
language for a thing so concretely that
means we can get away with three atomic
expressions that describe really basic
machines I sometimes say machines
thinking of finite state machines but I
mean automata and for combinators that
you can use to compose and build up the
structures so I'm going to talk through
each of these one by one and you might
have a sense of deja vu as I do so and
that's because you might be familiar
with the connection between regular
expressions and non-deterministic finite
automata and so just your your standard
regex correspond to finite state
machines so if you know that
correspondence that's justified by an
algebra in a really similar way so we're
doing that trick here and I only
mentioned that to give some
justification for the naming of our
libraries so we're thinking of these as
the these are the regular expressions
for hybrid automata but you don't need
to worry about that to use the library
so this is this a first atomic super
minimal machine that we want to be able
to have a a piece of code to represent
so this is a hybrid automata that does
nothing but makes one jump to update the
state instantaneously and then does
nothing else
so I want to have introduced sort of a
notation for talking about what I mean
why by saying and nothing else and so
I'm gonna draw another circle in here to
represent a terminal mode now I'm
putting up a little warning sign because
this is not strictly something you can
do in hybrid automata this is just how I
visualize it the papers I talked about
justify how you can think of a hybrid
atomic as terminating and so I find it
helpful to have a visual notation for
expressing that so just to not confuse
you too if you're looking at papers and
not seeing this notion of termination
that's why so it's just for me it's
helpful for me to visualize if it
doesn't help you you can ignore the
pictures and focus just on the code that
is fine as well so the code that
represents this super basic automata
I'll also try to call them hybrid
process two because strictly speaking
automata don't terminate but I might
slip up and still call them automata so
I'll say this this hybrid process can be
described as with the constructor update
offset and this takes a regular closure
update function or any function that
describes how you want to update your
instantaneous set so offset and is the
word we're using to describe the value
of the variables take at any point in
time so I like to see the type it helps
me know that there's nothing up my
sleeve
so update offset is a constructor that's
giving us an H expert which is a hybrid
expression so this is not hybrid atomic
but it's it's a piece of code or syntax
you can think of it that way which is
just data that describes hybrid automata
and it takes in a function that updates
an offset an offset is a associative
data structural mapping variables to
their values so here it's a map where
the variable X is continued 300 and so
if you can write a function that can
update this structure you can represent
that as an update offset expression the
next thing we want to talk about is flow
conditions so here is a simple hybrid
otama that is subtracting you know for
thinking of the waterfall example
subtracting from the project account and
into the investor AA's account at a
constant rate the trick here is that we
you know in this this algebraic view we
actually want to move away from thinking
of properties of control modes we don't
actually want to talk about control
modes at all and just think about what
becomes true via a process and the
reason we want to do that is because
processes compose you can think of what
it means for running two processes in a
row that itself is a process however
control modes composing two control
modes is not necessarily itself a
control mode so they don't line up in
the same way so the perspective we're
taking is is moving to thinking of
everything is true via some process so
again I'm gonna put the little warning
alert up and say we're gonna start
thinking about this not as a property of
a control mode but something that
becomes true via a jump again this is
not strictly speaking hybrid otamatone
thing to do but it's it's a justified
way of looking at the same same types of
systems and that's nice because this now
has the exact same shape is our last
atomic expression so instead of update
offset now we have update flow and again
instead of setting the variable values
we're setting their slopes essentially
so here we're saying be repeated
decrement at one point six units per
second and eight increase at the
corresponding rate and the type looks
the same this is a constructor for a
hybrid expression and it takes a regular
closure function that updates flows to
flows so so that's the core library
associated with that with that anonymous
function so a flow is likewise an
associative structure mapping variables
to values and I just want to highlight
one of the fancier fancier derivatives
here and this is the growth rate so we
provide a fixed set of expressions for
describing growth rates you could
imagine maybe wanting arbitrary closure
functions here and that's something you
could think about having but we get
benefits by allowing just a restricted
subset of equations here essentially
that lets us do closed form solutions
and to get exact exact answer is sort of
very efficiently
and the final atomic piece we need to
express is the idea of a jump condition
so this hybrid atomic jumps when X is
greater than X greater than 8 and it
must jump when W is greater than 8 so
this this this is sort of a limited and
any confusion or non determinism this
there's only one way you could possibly
evolve chalindo that looks like this and
we represent that with the until
expression so again you can see this is
a mapping of variables to values and the
values here are a restricted set of
predicates over the values they can take
and we use the restrictive set for the
same reasons another thing to notice
here is we've removed non determinism by
construction so there's simply no way to
express non determinism for hybrid
atomic built from these hybrid
expressions and the type again this is
just a constructor for his age
expressions so now we're moving to the
Combinator's the first natural thing
you'd want to consider is what would a
hat what would it mean to run one hybrid
process after another so I'll call these
a and B and we want to think about what
it is to join the terminal mode of 1 to
the initial mode of the next machine so
so you can think of you know when we saw
that until expression that represented
something that took a logical duration
of time it was waiting until W was
greater than 8 which could be some say 5
seconds to do that so we can think of
the process executing as some sort of
thread that takes logical time this is
not computational time or wall clock on
your CPU time and we can represent the
composition of these two as a times B so
this comes from the the algebra view and
it corresponds to sequencing in a
regular expression and that means this
composition will take begin when a
begins and ends when B ends and you
represent this with expression sequence
a and B and any list of h expressions
can be sequenced in this way
the next thing you might want to do is
repeat something forever so that's
connecting the terminal mode up to the
initial mode we call this a Omega you
might be you know be aware of a star or
the cleany star from regular expressions
this one means something slightly
different so the a star means repeat as
many times as you want but you have to
finish at some point this one means you
have to keep going forever so if a takes
some duration a Omega will go on forever
and this is repeat a and the final thing
you want to do is have some notion of
doing two things at the same time so the
waterfall is doing exactly that it's
paying back to investors possibly at the
same time and again this is not
something that you can really represent
explicitly in a hybrid atomic notation
so there's two ways to do it one way is
called lazy parallelism so if a and now
I'm almost thinking in these processes
as threads if a takes some logical
duration B takes some other logical
duration the lazy parallel combination
composition of them will sort of end
when the very first composite ends so
you can think of a corresponding the
correspondence to lazy sequences it's
doing just as much work as you have to
to to root to do something productive
here it
here the lazy parallelism is is doing
just as much as it has to do tell
somebody he terminates and the opposite
of that is strict parallelism where you
wait for all of the processes to
terminate so the most the lengthiest one
now you're probably a little bit worried
at this point because I've just
mentioned shared state and concurrency
and so on so what are the semantics of
that so considering strict parallelism
if there are some instantaneous events
happening in a and other events
happening in B the ones that don't
conflict are easy those just map to
happening in their logical sequence but
the ones that happen at the exact same
instant are important to talk about
so again if we're using TVs to model
like I'm getting paid every every
fifteenth of the month I'm also having
to pay bills every fifteenth of the
month there's a finite resource that I
have
my bank account for one of these has to
win or have to pay two bills is maybe a
better example in the same day of the
month I have to make a choice of where
that money is gonna go so that that
amounts to resolving this this two
things happening at the same instant
so we resolved that deterministically as
left most wins so a will happen
logically instantaneously before being
so that's just a choice we've made so
it's always deterministic if you put
something on the left that means
instance resolved to it first
and so you that's just the that's the
deterministic rule we've used in this
library so again these seven
constructors let us build up all of the
hybrid otamatone examples we've seen up
to this point so I'll walk through the
code of how this one ends up looking so
this is this an example where we're
giving money back to a first because
that investor is the most behind and
then eventually giving two to all three
so let's focus first on the leftmost
mode here where we're giving money just
to a and drawing it from B FMP and this
is an update flow expression and the
function will pass it is taking a flow
and updating the value P by decrementing
it by 2/6 and incrementing a by 2/6 we
could have used an associate it to the
to the flow we wanted but it will make
our lives easier if these are additive
because then we can stack them on top of
each other and then we also want to say
in this expression if we ever run out of
money so that's until excuse me until P
is empty then we want to update the
flows to zero and so these are all
sequence one after another we can
abstract this into a function since this
is just this is just a regular data
piece of data that we can define an
associate variables so we would define a
function called pay which is the same
code except extracted over the variable
and the rate so we can use this to talk
about each
step separately so I've shifted the
shift in the moans off the screen a
little bit to make space but you can see
that one way of representing this is
doing all these three things in parallel
the first one is paying a right away the
second one is waiting until a has enough
and then paying B final one is waiting
until B has enough than paying C and so
it's abstracting that pay that pay
expression using it in three places and
and we know because pay is agnostic it
always sums to zero no matter how many
times you add it we know this
composition will not lose track of money
in this example and again before this
happens we can have a sequence on update
offset to initialize the original
variables so to get an answer out so
this is sort of the top level API to to
run these things we have something
called init which takes a hybrid
expression and puts it in its initial
State and then you can call steady state
which evaluates it to its termination
state so I've talked a lot about
mutation and threads and shared state
but this is all pure it's a pure API so
it's all just logical mutations so you
can think of your thread in macro it
kind of looks like mutation but there's
no actual mutation going on under the
hood and so this returns what we call
the hybrid state so that's got the
offset like you saw which is that the
values of the variables at a point in
time and the flows it's just some other
other diagnostic you type things so
that's in it steady state you also have
run which lets you evaluate a system
there's a certain number of logical time
steps so if you're using this for
animation for example you might want to
see how things change over time and draw
a picture and make an animation as
opposed to just getting the final final
result
so there's a really close connection to
hybrid automata and functional reactive
programming and I don't know how
familiar you all are with FRP but this
is the biggest thing in the back of my
mind is evaluating you know these seem
almost identical like what's what is the
difference between them and I think this
could you know probably merits its own
talk but if you if you permit me a
little bit of hand waving I'll just kind
of say how I have started to see the
difference so I see hybrid a table is
kind of a subset of really well-behaved
systems these are systems that are
mostly defined by differential equations
except for a few instantaneous points
where they can jump around now the model
of functional reactive programming is
talking about any function of time so
this could be includes those ones but it
also be quite arbitrary functions that
are really unpredictable and have no
closed-form anything so in some sense
FRP is more general I think you could
implement hybrid atomic constructs on
top of FRP but I also think you lose
something kind of important when you
when you go to such a general space and
that is because you can emit any type of
function of time at all the only way to
inspect these function is to sample them
at specific points in time so the more
accuracy you want the more you have to
sample at some point and so this just
means either you have inaccurate results
or they take a long time to compute but
it seems like the wrong type of tool if
you're looking for exact numerical
results so for hybrid automata because
we can preserve closed form derivatives
we can you know when we ask how much
money each investor has it's a quick
calculation that calculates just the
interesting points and does it basically
the same type of algorithm you would do
on paper
whereas FRP would have to be sampling
for example on the penny scale and
looking for when to switch rules or
something there's ways around that
obviously but my my gut feeling is that
as soon as you've got something
satisfactory and FRP doing this type of
use case I think you'd be have something
similar to hybrid automata at the end of
the day for games and animation you
clearly care only about the motion you
don't care about the actual numerical
results so that's maybe not a concern in
that
hybrid automata also and this is from
hybrid automata when created with our
hybrid expression library give you a
different notion of composition as well
so an FRP the the units the data that
you're composing are time varying values
whereas in hybrid automata you can now
compose processes so processes can
actually be consuming and adding two
different valuables as orchestrations so
it's a different a different unit of
composition especially when you're
dealing with States and resources under
contention so for our use case this is
essential complexity that we have the
model so not even thinking of a side
effect of giving people money but even
promising someone money has a side
effect if you can no longer promise that
dollar to someone else so so not double
counting in an accounting algorithm is
actually a side effect so somebody has
to represent the fact that you've now
promised this to a certain account you
cannot promise it again
FRP is pure which is a good thing but
that means it doesn't model state for
you you have to there are ways to do it
but you have to you have to decide on
how to do that so that that idea of
these processes that are working
together on some finite shared set of
state I think is a key key reason you'd
want to use something hybrid atomic like
because otherwise otherwise you're on
your own
so so that's that's a quick overview of
our library again it's not open source
yet but it will be soon well when it's
done it will go up on our company github
page and that's what I've got for you
today
so thanks for your time
so I think I think we've got time for
yeah we got time for Christians yeah
did we talk to the gambling industry
okay
that's sorry that's our next pivot at
the back on the yeah
yeah yeah so the question is why would
you ever want non-determinism
um so yeah we've erased non-determinism
because we we want these to specify
processes and we don't want them under
specified but quite often in papers and
engineering stuff there they're writing
specifications that you want your
systems to adhere to right so there you
can be a little more loose to say you
know it has to leave in this range a
satisfactory implementation will do
something correct but you're not
actually over specifying the
implementation so that's sort of looking
at hybrid automata as a spec as opposed
to our use case which is an
implementation we want it to serve as
the implementation so that's why we
don't I use case I thought about is
maybe if we thought of hybrid automata
almost to parse behavior so if you saw a
mouse moving and maybe gesture
recognition you would try to parse that
into a hybrid automata in which case you
would maybe want to recover that non
determinism so something to think about
but that's that's not how we're using
them
does the library support higher
derivatives so like so like a second
order derivatives and so on yeah so so
the trick to do that is is like ordinary
differential equation trick where you
have two variables so you have one
variable representing you know velocity
and the second one acceleration is the
value of velocity multiplied by by
gravity or whatever so so you can build
up high order derivatives by giving them
each a name basically and that's sort of
a standard trick to do that yeah
Oh interesting um I feel like you've you
probably have all way more than that
already because you have state you can
rate to I haven't really thought about
that so so like you can set a variable
and you can like hold the number three
in somewhere you know I mean so like X
could hold the value three and you can
do a transition and put four there so I
feel like that's a lot of power already
so having a list maybe that would give
you more I feel yeah maybe I feel like
if you can loop and put numbers I feel
like you would almost have infinite
power at that point but you're right
maybe there are extensions where you
could get a little bit more and it might
be more natural to program with those
things not sure what it mean would mean
to have a list that has a derivative but
there's probably some interesting ideas
there cool great well thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
