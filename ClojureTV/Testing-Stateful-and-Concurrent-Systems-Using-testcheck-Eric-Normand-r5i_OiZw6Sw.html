would have been unthinkable ten years
ago more people than ever an amazing
number of people are happily employed
writing lists and doing functional
programming I think that's awesome more
people than ever asking how do I develop
a functional mindset and generative
testing is a really good answer to that
question there's nothing like generative
testing for forcing you to think about
the properties of your system as a whole
and there's nothing like Jenner testing
for honing the functional thinking and I
am honored and privileged to teach it to
you today the title of this talk is
testing stateful concurrent and async
systems using test dot check my name is
eric norman i run a company called
purely functional TV there's a
newsletter it's free you should sign up
it's meant to inspire closure
programmers it's weekly to about ten
links every week I also have a members
section with over thirty eight hours of
closure instructional videos so if
you're interested in learning closure or
you need other people to learn closure
at your company
check out my offering get in touch with
me if you have any questions so a map of
the talk first we're going to develop a
few example based tests that we can then
pick on as a strawman then we're going
to use those same tests but rewrite them
generating the data instead of
hard-coding the data then we're going to
develop tests that test a sequential
basically generate the whole test and
then we're going to add parallelism to
this so we can test for race conditions
a show of hands who who tests their
system okay that's just about everybody
see people weren't paying attention who
uses generative testing
right maybe a half half of you okay cool
well I hope that the half of you that
don't use it start to use it at the by
the end the half of you that do use it
learn some new techniques for doing this
all right so let's start with our system
that we're testing it's very simple
system because they only have 40 minutes
it's just a key value database this
database might be on another server and
you're sending messages over the network
it could be on the same server using
like IPC or something and then it also
could be in memory doesn't matter what's
important is to interface it has these
operations you can create a new ones
empty then you can clear it that just
gets rid of all data in it you could
store a key value delete a key
fetch a key and get the value out and
then ask for the size okay so there's
five operations pretty simple does what
you expect
so let's write some text using closure
test we can define a test called store
contains we want to store a key and see
if the database will fetch it back out
for us pretty simple test so we created
database create a key and of value store
it fetch it out and then assert that
it's equal to the value that we expect
another test this one is that the second
store is going to overwrite the value
for the first score so we create a key
and two values store them both in order
and then when we fetch it out we expect
it to be equal to the second value make
sense okay clear empty after I clear
there shouldn't be anything in it so I'm
going to store something in it just to
make sure that I do actually clear
something then I'm going to clear check
the size should be zero
I don't want you to feel bad about these
tests I write tests like this too but
you should feel bad about these times
and I know when when I say feel bad with
testing there's a lot of shaming going
on with TDD and like whether you're a
real programmer if you don't do TDD and
that's not what I mean
I don't mean you should feel guilty I
mean you should just be scared these
tests are not doing very much they're
testing a very little bit of your system
just to put this in perspective you
might think well it's a very simple
system there's only five operations
possible and like it's not that critical
right let's compare it to a system like
this this is a cockpit of an airplane a
lot of switches and dials and gears and
legs and you know other things you can
you can do and what if I wrote tests
like I did for the key value database
but for this so I say I'm going to press
this button and then flip that switch
I'm going to test it it did the right
thing okay now I'm going to flip this
switch and turn this knob and tested it
did the right thing and then I'm going
to you know turn to move this lever and
put that switch and test if it does the
right thing would you fly in this
airplane if those were the only tests
that I ran right and so this system
looks complicated it looks big there's a
lot of possibilities here and it's a
very dangerous you know critical system
but what is the size of our system this
database that we're writing let's just
ask a few questions and think about so
how many strings are there but if my
keys and values are strings that's a lot
of different inputs that are possible so
infinity how many unicode characters are
the thousands
how many key value pairs are there a lot
infinity
how many operations are there five how
many pairs of operations actually 25
five squared
how many triples of operations 125 and I
mean it goes up from there
right so this is actually a really big
system but what is different is compared
to the cockpit is that the description
is small right it's only five operations
and you can kind of explain it in a few
sentences so we want to be able to
capture that small description in our
test which we haven't done if we just
write all the examples so I've had three
tests you could expand that out 225
doing the pairs of operations still you
wouldn't come close to testing the whole
description all right so let's get into
generative testing first idea you have
to know is generators generators are
objects that generate random data of a
given type so the data we need are keys
and values and we'll just say their
strength so this is saying keys are
random strengths and values of random
strings we can sample our generator and
get 20 values out into what it looks
like this is just random you run it
again you'll get different stuff but you
notice already we've got way more
interesting data than our dinky string
with a character in it we got an empty
string that's really interesting usually
a good corner case we've got some
characters that I don't even know what
they're called or how to type them you
got this like over score one over here
kind of like that one divide sign that's
nice
anyway there's much more interesting
rich data here okay now we're going to
set up properties which are kind of like
saying we can translate our tests our
original tests into properties
properties our DISA certian on
on our system we're using the Deaf spec
which hooks into the closure test test
runner store contains it the name of our
test and we're going to run a hundred
tests or didn't generate a hundred
different types of this so we're using a
prop for all macro and what this is
basically saying is select a key from
that generator and a value from that
generator create the database store the
key in value and then fetch it out and
compare it to the right saying it's
basically the same code as before and
notice it returns a boolean that the
Ariel if it returns false and the test
fails you don't have to use the is macro
alright next test store overwrite this
one we're going to set a que and two
bees store them both and then we fetch
it out and compare it should be equal to
b2 same code this one I'm not going to
go through line by line but we're
storing the random kV and then fetching
ID and clearing it and checking the size
alright what is a failure look like
failure you'll get a map that reports
what happens if we find a failing case
it's got Kiev results false because we
returned false when they eat when
they're not equals store contains is the
name of the var that's interesting
failing sighs there's a bunch of stuff
in here that I don't really use that
much I'm not going to go over it but
this is the K and V that were generated
for this failing test case notice it's a
really long crazy string that failed I
don't know what to do with that
I can't debug that why did that fail I
don't know
but what luckily what test check does is
it will shrink it for us and what
shrinking means is it takes that string
like say this K and it removed the
character from it and sees and reruns
ITAT and says does it still fail
okay and if it does then it removes
another character and then runs the test
again and sees does it still fail and it
keeps doing this until it can't find any
failing another thing that we'll do
besides just removing characters is it
will decrement the character code and
try that string and so it keeps doing
that keep doing that until it won't fail
anymore and then it returns the smallest
one that still failed and notice how
small it is so with this I can go in and
debug and it turns out that there's a
bug with that Ashe character that was
special character and my code went
through a code path that you know
checked for that and crashed and it
gives you the feed so you can rerun the
same test I just use you know I just
checked the test bar figure out which
one failed and then the smallest to see
if I can reproduce it you can also take
this smallest and turn it into an
example based test so you don't have a
regression on that test okay but the
thing is we could sit there and write 25
tests like this generating random data
but we're still not capturing the
description of the system that I was
talking about that really small
description what we want to be able to
do is describe the entire behavior and
test it in one go okay so how do we do
that it's actually quite easy the first
there's four steps okay
the first step is we're going to build a
model of our system it turns out that a
key value database the properties that
we're interested in is the same
properties that hashmap has all right
keep all your database stores keys and
values hashing have source keys and
values same overwrite properties same
clearing property everything's the same
okay step two we're going to take the
operations and reapply them and what we
want to do is run these operations on
our database run them on a hashmap and
then at the end compare
that they're equivalent that we got the
same answer so we're going to make
generators for all of our operations or
turning them into data we're using the
gen return generator which just always
returns a constant value and so we're
returning a tuple that starts with the
keyword clear with the same thing with
size it's just a constant tuple with the
size because there's no parameters so we
just need to generate it next thing is
we have store store has two parameters
so we're making a tuple that starts with
the keyword store and has a random peon
value in it same with delete except we
just need the key and then fetch tuple
with the constant keyword fetch and a
key then we can make a generator that
generates a vector of these and we use
the one of generator which chooses a
generator from this collection and then
chooses a random value from that
generator so in the end we're going to
get a vector of operations let's sample
it to see what it looks like so we could
have the empty vector so no operation we
see one with clear another empty one we
see one with a fetch and a clear or
clear a fetch a clear fetch and a side
side so we're getting some really weird
tests we would never write these tests
but that's interesting right we didn't
have to write them they're just
generated for us automatically alright
now we need to make the runner to run
these operations on the database and
then once run them on the hashmap let's
start with the database takes a database
and a vector of operations we're going
to iterate through these operations
we're destructuring so we're getting the
name of the operation and the qiyan
value if they exist we're going to
dispatch on the name it's a clear we're
going to call clear if it's size we call
size and they're all the same right
we're just calling the corresponding
function
for our hashmap runner because it's an
immutable value we're going to use
reduce so notice where our initial value
is the database that we're getting it's
a hash map but we're calling in the
database and we're reducing over the
operations you're going to destructor it
same thing but this time I have to say
we're only we're only interested in the
mutation properties of these operations
right so we're going to compare them at
the end we don't care if intermediate
fetches are giving us the right value we
could care but in this example we're not
okay
alright so clear just sets it to the
empty map size does not mutate so we
just returned the hash map we got store
is like a socially disliked dystocia and
fetch doesn't modify it so we're just
going to return the hash map alright now
we can define a property we're calling
it hash map equiv we're going to
generate a sequence of operation we're
going to run our ops on our hash map and
create a refresh database then run our
ops on the database and then compare
them that they're equivalent we don't
have that function defined so let's
define it a quiz what does that look
like
take the database in the hash map first
it compares the size of the hash map to
the size of the database make sure
they're equal and then it's going to go
through every key value in the hash map
and make sure that the equivalent can
value are in the database
okay there's a problem with this though
I'm developing this incrementally I'm
writing the naive code and then making
it better each time
the problem is when we're generating
keys we're generating random keys each
time we generate keys so it's a bit like
so we have this set and we have a store
and each one is getting a random key
it's a bit like I asked 10 of you in the
audience to choose a random star in the
galaxy
and expecting that some of you would
choose the same star right we want to
test that if I do a store and then I do
a fetch or I do a store and a delete
with the same key that there's some
collision right we're not testing that
they're the same teeka sort of very
unlikely to choose the same key so what
do we need to do what we could do is I
could choose a solar system in the
galaxy and then ask you now the 10 of
you choose a planet out of that solar
system and because the solar system is
really small I I can guarantee you well
there's a higher probability of having
key collisions all right so we want to
still possibility that there are no
collisions but it's much higher
probability that there are so we want to
encourage these key collisions how do we
do that really easy trick so these are
the same it's just the same generators
there's no parameters but here with
store we have keys we're changing it
from a generator to a function that
returns a generator so this function
takes the set of keys it's like we're
passing in the solar system to choose
from we generate a tuple and notice the
keys here is selecting a random element
from that Keys collection we do the same
trick with delete we are selecting a
random element from the keys collection
that we
sin same thing with fetch now we have
this helper function that takes the keys
it generates this vector and notice
we're passing the same keys that we get
an argument to the individual functions
so all of these are going to be
selecting from a small set of keys it
encourages collisions and then we just
here's where we generate our solar
system our small set of keys the non
empty vector of keys and then we pass it
to jenoff star and that will give us a
sequence of operations with a good
number of key collisions we can sample
now these won't have collisions because
they don't have two operations with keys
but this one has a collision notice
whether you loved twice this one has a
collision so I just wanted to double
check that I'm getting some collisions
in there so I get curious about like
what am I actually testing how big is
this system that I've got so just using
the repple I've um made this query like
how big is it if I generate a hundred
sequences of operations what's the
biggest one how big am I getting here it
turns out I got 91 when I generated 100
random samples of op sequences the
biggest one was 91 long what about if I
do a thousand I got 96 so I think
there's some like diminishing returns to
like the size of what you're doing I you
know there's a normal curve here and you
get out further and further you're just
getting like these smaller and smaller
outliers but just out of curiosity if I
have five operations ninety one long how
big is that system four times ten to the
63 there's a really big system and I'm
only generating country
how does that right so it's it's not
like I'm covering like the whole system
here but what is interesting is when you
get something that long you do have a
lot of those pairwise interactions
triple wise interactions going on right
ninety one operations you're getting
some interesting interactions going on
Oh what does the failure look like now
we rerun our test with these new
generators here is a failure this is the
operation sequence that we ran it's
actually 49 long this one this one
crashed or broke then in detail to meet
our expectations but look at the
smallest look at the shrunk size like
that I can actually go in and debug I
can look I'll look store broke when I
passed it this string and in fact that
is the exact bug that I introduced so
it's really easy to debug
okay so we've we're able to describe our
system we're basically saying it's like
a hashmap
very short description but we live in a
multi-core world this thing is going to
be accessed in the network what about
race conditions how can we test for
those generative testing can do it so
what we need to do is make a runner that
runs in a new thread so the top function
here just starts a new thread and it
calls DB run all right so it's just
running our thing in a new thread and
then we can have a vector of op
sequences and we just run bang our
running thread over all that so for
every op sequence in there we're making
a new thread and running them all but
it's more complicated than that because
we don't know when the threads are going
to finish so we can't just compare them
equivalent until all the threads are
done so we need to do this trick where
each thread creates a promise and then
after it finishes its DB run it will
deliver on that promise and we return
the promise from the function so then
when we do our thread run we have to
remember that thing so we're doing a map
map is lazy so we have to do run it to
start all the threads and then we're
going to run bang d ref on it which is
going to block until all the promises
are done okay there's another problem
because if we have a lot of sequences it
could be that we start the first thread
and it finishes before we even get to
the end of the list and start the last
thread we want them all to start at the
same time so there's another trick it's
called a latch like a latch you're
saying you know like a latch that it's
going to release the the gate that all
the horses start at the same time right
you want all those racehorses to have
the same chance of winning so we passing
the latch up at the top and then right
after we start our thread the first
thing we do is we blow
on the latch okay so when we do thread
run we create that latch we pass it here
to all of the run and threads we start
all the threads then we deliver on that
latch they all unblock at the same time
then we wait for them all finish okay
now we have to write our property that
uses this new thread runner we generate
two op sequences a and B you can
generate more but start with two we're
going to combine them into one sequence
and we run our hash map with that off
sequence we create a database do thread
run with ops a and knob speak and then
we check it they're equivalent okay this
won't work okay we need a few more
things we've got the same problem again
where now we're independently generating
two op sequences and there's no key
collisions between them so we'll never
have a store in this thread and a delete
in this thread of the same key right so
we need to solve the same problem again
which is really easy so we'll make a
function that will generate n sequences
for us we're going to generate that set
of keys that solar system of possible
keys then we make a tuple of the Gienapp
star where we're passing in the same
keys to all of them so now we use that
gen op sequences to we'd be structure it
into into two variables and now we run
it and we have two collisions between
threads
okay the next problem with this it won't
work yet I need to explain graphically
so we have these two threads and let's
say that they're just running two
operations each how and we're sending
messages to the database so they're
getting queued up in a certain order
they're received at the database in at
certain order what order they received
we don't
could be that all of a is come before
all B could also be that B's happen for
a or this one or this one turns out that
they're six and it's like a tree so if
you choose at any point a is going to
happen next or B is going to happen next
you can you know left and right make
this binary tree and there are six
possible interleavings of these things
and you can't know what interleaving
happens or you can't control which one
will happen because that's the nature of
threads in on the JVM so the best we can
do is say that well we know one of these
happened and so is is the plus is what
we got equivalent to one of these any of
them we don't know which one so we're
just going to say as long as it is
equivalent to something that could have
happened we're good this generates all
possible interleavings I'm not going to
go over the code but it's basically
doing that tree building out the whole
tree okay so instead of combining
naively the two opt sequences you think
can cat like I did before which only
puts A's always before all the B's this
is generating all possible interleavings
we create the database do the thread run
and then we're going to compare it to
all possible ones running on the hash
nap and see if at least one is is valid
it is we pass okay so this will work the
problem is very often race conditions
are about which interleaving actually
did happen and so you'll run a test and
it fails and you run it again in passes
that's like a heisenbugs right so how do
we suss out those highs and bugs the way
that
that I found that works and that is also
in some of John Hughes papers John
Hughes's is the creator of quick check
the original generative testing system
what they do is they run it ten times
they just run it ten times and they
check that it passes every time if it
fails once then the whole system fails
for the whole test fail and that repeat
repetition happens during the shrinkage
- so it turns out that in practice ten
is good enough to find the bugs that you
need to find okay so now there's this
other problem and if this will work but
when you get it you might get a failure
like this that won't shrink this is the
shrunk version it's so long you're like
what is it doing it's doing like a fetch
and the lead of something that isn't
even in there another dilly wide impact
shrink away and you read John Hughes
paper and you figured it out it's a
timing issue when you have something
like this it's a timing it's doing a
whole bunch of operations just to get
the timing right because it takes time
to do a fetch it takes time to do a
delete and so thread B just needs to
wait a little bit of time so what do you
do well you need to make it so that this
can shrink to like a weight so we need a
new generator for a new operation called
sleep and it's a tuple with the sleep
keyword at the beginning and then it
just chooses a number of milliseconds
between one and a hundred
don't make it too big or your Tesla
Marisha stop right so now we have to add
sleep to this jenoff star so that it's
selected as one of the possible
operations and another thing I did was I
reordered them because now we're
thinking about shrinking I reordered
them from least destructive to most
destructive because it turns out that
this one of generator will shrink to the
a beginning of the collection so from
you know the right-hand side to the
left-hand side and so now the most
destructive thing is going to or the
disruptive things are going to shrink to
less destructive things I don't know if
that really makes a difference but makes
me feel better okay so we're going to
add thread the sleep to the DB runner
and it's actually going to do a thread
sleep easy now in our hashmap runner
sleep doesn't even touch the database so
it's not going to modify it so we just
return that map and now when you run it
and it shrinks this is what you get it's
shrunk to sleep sixty six inches will
shrink to sleep sixty five they needed
sixty six milliseconds exactly and what
it turns out is this bug was that if you
store twice and then delete in another
thread it gets the wrong answer so this
sleep is enough time to do two stores in
thread a less than that and it could get
interleaved between the two stores or
you know happen before the first store
so now we can see the problem right it's
very clear because there's not much
noise okay so I wish I had more time to
go into the async stuff I know the title
had a sink in it
and I just don't have time like this
this was already like a lot but there's
two two questions remaining how do you
test the system where you don't have an
easy model like a hashmap
that you can just use like already and I
bet a lot of you have that question the
other question is what about async stuff
there's no a sink in here notice all the
operations were synchronous I did a
delete and I just waited for it to
return and then I could guarantee that
it was done when you have multiple
systems multiple you know like over a
network and they have latency and stuff
you have an eventual consistency model
maybe you have cache
right so I sent I write something gets
written to my cache and sometime later
it goes to the server and then gets
inked down to the other clients you have
it's a much more complicated system but
it turns out that the answer to both of
those is the same which is to develop a
richer model and it's actually not that
hard there's papers about it it's this
model is still very has a still a very
small description and I would love
afterwards to sit down with some pen and
paper and sketch it out for you
please please do that but right here
what I want to show is on the Left we
have 25 tests that are written in you
know regular example based testing style
and they each test the two operations
and then some make some assertion and
this is all the code we developed in
this talk right nothing till now so not
only are we like way less code but we've
also modelled a much more complete
notion of what the system is supposed to
do we've captured its behavior and we
can generate as many tests as we want we
can run this over night we can have it
running in our CI server for hours like
all the time basically
we'll really change them like the model
of paying for CI servers right because
right now they're they're relying on us
to write really small short tests that
take like seconds to run and now we were
saying well we can generate tests all
all day long interesting ok so if you
want more talk to me but if you're not
here you're on the if you're on the
recording go to this URL and you will
get more talks about generative testing
and about how to do the more async stuff
and develop your own model there's there
was a talk at closure cons of 2015 where
Benjamin Pierce
talks about doing this for dropbox so
it's good for existing systems and even
black box systems where you don't even
have control over what it's doing or any
introspection into how it's working so
