is hiring juniors past experience does
not equal future success
so hello I am Marla Brazil and I am a
software developer from the wonderful
city of Denver Colorado thank you all
for being here today I am really excited
to be giving this talk even if this was
my initial reaction when I found that I
would be speaking to you this afternoon
very glad my computer is behind a podium
so you can't see I live on the internet
as Marla Brasil just about everywhere
you can feel free to direct your
compliments or complaints to me there
and this is me probably running away
from my computer this is how I like to
spend my free time when I'm not at work
enjoying Colorado's beautiful mountains
and when I am working I work for a
company called democracy works we are a
nonprofit nonpartisan civic tech
organization dedicated to ensuring that
no American should ever have to miss an
election however this talk is not about
this instead I'm going to be talking
about this so I'm curious how many
people in the room today consider
themselves to be junior developers okay
so a couple of people for the rest of us
I'm going to assume that we are more
senior developers and that is precisely
why we need to talk today but before we
get started I have a confession to make
for you or to you I consider myself to
be a junior developer as well I've been
writing code full-time for about two
years been working in tech for about
eight years or so and prior to my job at
democracy works I had never written a
single line of closure so I've been
around the block when it comes to junior
developers so today I'm going to share a
little bit of my experiences with you
and specifically we're going to talk
about hiring junior developers but more
specifically than that we're going to
talk about the following things first
we'll talk briefly about why why junior
developers and why hiring
helps not only you the person doing the
hiring but them as well and we'll
explore why we want to hire these people
now and maybe why we don't want to hire
them now in a few cases and part of that
Y will also include talking about who
when we're talking about junior
developers who exactly are we talking
about after we go over those things will
dip into the how we'll talk about how in
the sense of how we want to hire junior
developers especially when in many cases
they have not written any Clojure like
myself not that long ago we'll also talk
about the post hiring house once we
bring them on board how are we going to
level these people up and set them on
the path to becoming senior developers
and then lastly we will revisit why and
we'll get a bit deeper into this
question talking about why it's not only
beneficial to someone seeking a job but
to us as well as we seek two ways to
better ourselves our companies and the
closure community at large now I want a
caveat that the term junior developers
itself is pretty broad there are a few
different ways that people can get into
code maybe they're studying CS at
college or they're self-taught or
they're going through a bootcamp but
we've only got so much time before I get
kicked off stage so we don't have enough
time to cover everybody so this talk is
going to focus predominantly on the
bootcamp variety of junior devs
and will be a little bit less applicable
to CS grads so let's get started why
junior developers well in order to
meaningfully understand the answer to
this question we first have to ask
ourselves what problem are we actually
trying to solve so a show of hands
really quickly I'm curious who has ever
posted a closure job and then found that
it's kind of difficult to find a group
of senior closure developers to fill
that position okay so you know what I'm
talking about I'll give you a hint
this is probably not your problem
but this might have something to do with
it this is a survey showing the most
used languages in the workplace there
are a couple of these floating around
they're highly unscientific but the
general point here should be pretty
obvious closure is awesome
that's why we're all here but it's not
that popular in the workplace relatively
speaking generally speaking when we post
a job looking for another closure
developer we're looking primarily within
the closure community itself to fill
that opening and as we just saw that
community isn't that big relative to
some of the other bigger language
communities in fact nearly 1/3 of us who
filled out the 2016 state of clitter
survey indicated that hiring is a major
source of frustration for us as we are
trying to grow our teams so assuming
that our most immediate goal right now
is to fill our job openings our focus is
naturally going to shift to ways that we
can broaden that applicant pool now I
would hope that the majority of us here
are interested in community building in
some sense of the word since you're not
typically gonna spend your time and
money attending a conference if you
don't actually want to talk to anybody
else who's there if that were the case
we could just stay home and watch they
watch the recordings from the safety of
our couch but community building
naturally is going to entail welcoming
newcomers into the community the key
word here after all is building so we
could try to do this by appealing to
senior developers who maybe haven't
written any closure yet and that's not a
bad tactic that we should dismiss but on
its own it's not going to be enough the
demand for senior talent is already at a
fever pitch across the board and there
are a lot of other languages besides
closure that are competing for these
people's attention so on its own that
strategy is not going to get us quite to
where we want to be but if we look at
the data it actually suggests that we've
begun to embrace that notion of
community building whether that's
consciously or not this is from the
state of closure 2015 survey and you'll
see that nearly 40% of the survey
respondents he
said that they've been writing closure
for a year or less and if we look at
that two-year mark that number jumps up
all the way to about 60% or a solid
majority in assuming that some of the
other trends in these surveys are
holding true a lot of us that are in
this room right now myself included are
actually at our very first closure
conference so we've proven that despite
the relatively small size of our
community closure is an attractive
option for people who are looking to
explore in your language so let's use
that information to our advantage when
crafting a development team it's
generally a good idea to comprise it of
more than just senior devs who have been
writing your chosen language for a
number of years organizations as a whole
tend to be healthier when they're made
up of individuals with a wide range of
skill and experience levels and people
are happier at work when they can
clearly tie their own learning and
growth to that of the organization so
luckily for us there is no shortage of
junior developers who are looking for
their first or second job that we can
use to round out this mess so at this
point we need to figure out who these
junior developers are so that we can
understand where we can find them this
isn't necessarily a straightforward task
as the majority of juniors today are
learning JavaScript or maybe Ruby or
maybe some combination thereof if we
recall from earlier that survey of the
most common workplace programming
languages remember that javascript is
sitting comfortably at the top and Ruby
isn't too far behind so it makes sense
then that junior developers are learning
generally one of these two languages
Ruby and JavaScript are known for being
beginner friendly and a lot of juniors
are coming out of code schools who are
staking their reputation on being able
to find their students jobs after they
graduate so these programs are largely
incentivized to teach to where the most
jobs are for the highest likelihood of
success right so we need to understand
how we're going to appeal to people who
have generally only been exposed to
these languages and maybe are less
familiar with closure we can start to do
this by first considering what junior
developers might be looking for
so last year the collective code school
industry in the u.s. graduated somewhere
in the neighborhood of about 10,000 new
developers the majority of these people
who are going to these code schools were
coming in after having spent some amount
of time doing some other profession
maybe totally unrelated to code so
consider what it takes to make that
switch first you have to quit your job
it might be a job that already pays you
nicely you're living comfortably and
then you pay tuition for some of the
shorter term or maybe part-time boot
camps this can be a couple thousand
dollars and it stretches all the way up
to twenty thousand plus dollars for some
of the longer programs then you forego a
paycheck for three to seven months while
you're in school plus whatever length of
time it's gonna take you to find a job
afterwards
that's an enormous sacrifice and it's
multiplied if you consider that a lot of
people have to think about kids or a
mortgage or a partner or something like
that so people aren't going to make that
change lightly instead people are
motivated to make high-risk changes when
they perceive that the risk reward ratio
is going to be in their favor in this
case somebody makes that enormous
investment because they think the career
payoff is going to outweigh that upfront
cost so junior developers when they're
looking for a job they're looking for
something that is in part going to
signal the start of that payoff but a
lot of juniors know that landing the job
is just the first step in their career
and that there's still a ton to learn
after that initial amount of schooling
the beautiful thing about career and
software development is precisely if
you're doing it right you're always
going to be learning something new I
know this you will know this and junior
developers are especially aware of this
this is the do-or-die moment for them
where the right job is going to keep
them on that path of accelerated
learning and the wrong one might stop
them dead in their tracks so they're
looking for a job that's going to help
them continue that momentum that they
perhaps started to enjoy in school and
see that the investment is worth it and
while this continuing growth is a big
driver in how junior developers are
selecting their jobs it's important that
we don't forget about the more personal
motivations that led them to pursue
coding in the first place this will vary
between individuals but it might say
have something to do with wanting to
make a difference in the world and
seeing code as an avenue to get there or
maybe people want to get more involved
with some of the cool technology that
they're using in their lives or maybe
people feel that they have stagnated in
a past career and they want something
where that's less likely to happen so
the point of all this is that you've got
to find your hook when you're reaching
out to people we know closure is awesome
but there's only so many people that
you're going to hook on language alone
right out of the gate especially when as
we discuss a lot of juniors are not as
familiar with closure instead find a way
to speak to their other desires first
democracy works where I work for example
we've had a lot of success reaching out
to people by emphasizing the civic tech
nature of our work people are really
excited to improve elections access in
this country and they get excited about
learning closure as a means to solve
that problem so this is a good time for
us to take a step back for a minute and
think about what we are looking for as
somebody who's hiring junior developers
the one thing you don't want you to take
away from this talk is that you should
all just run out of here and hire all
the junior developers and you know
assume that we're gonna figure the rest
out as we go instead the rest of his
talk makes the assumption that you can
enthusiastically say yes to the
following things first you're ready to
take on the challenge of mentoring
someone newer to coding and you
understand the or want to dig into what
that challenge entails exactly and
secondly you're ready to level up your
own career by taking on this challenge
and committing to helping someone else
level up in other words you're not
interested in hiring a junior developer
because that's the only budget that you
could get for another salary or because
you really need somebody with experience
but that job opening has been out
flapping in the breeze for a while and a
warm body is better than nobody these
are not great reasons to hire your
developer but assuming that doesn't
apply to any of us let's talk about how
we can go about hiring and not yet
for a closure job though it's not
necessarily straightforward as we just
said it's also not as tricky as you
might think the ticket here is
understanding what you're actually
trying to assess in an interview a
junior developer with no closure
experience is not gonna be your most
experienced hire and that's totally fine
but you can't vet them the same way you
would a senior developer when we're
hiring senior developers you're hiring
somebody on this ability to come in and
execute from day one right but junior
developers you're hiring based on their
potential so you need to look for the
following things when you're
interviewing them do they learn quickly
can they understand high-level
requirements and demonstrate an ability
to maybe start translating that into
something more technical do they ask
questions when they get stuck if these
things are yes then it's highly likely
that picking up syntax and tooling is
not going to be a problem in other words
the potential here is high so how would
we go about asking those questions well
you have a few options one way you can
do this is by presenting candidates with
a code challenge enclosure that top
touches on a topic but they've likely
encountered elsewhere in a different
domain a to do list is a great example
cred apps are the bread and butter of
code schools as you're talking to
somebody they should have these concepts
down pat so this is your chance to one
verify that and to see if they can apply
them to a different syntax instead of
idioms another option you have is to
pair program with them on something in
closure like the cones as you do this
you can look for the following things
like are they asking you questions as
they go through the exercise do they
seem to get the hang of it as you
progress
are they having fun or you can take this
a step further and do something similar
to what pivotal does in which you work
together on maybe something that's
slightly more involved and still in
closure and you drive to handle the
specific syntax concerns while you let
them work on fleshing out the actual
logic or if you don't want to do that
you can pair a program on something else
entirely
invite them to
your problem to you in a language that
they're more comfortable with you can
pay attention to things like whether
they're comfortable what they're tooling
or how they go about explaining the
problem to you somebody who maybe is
less familiar with that language do they
make an effort to collaborate with you
how do they respond when you're asking
questions or if you don't like any of
those suggestions you could review with
them some code that they've previously
written look for attention and care in
details that tend to transcend any
individual language like have they
written any tests are there commit
message is good or are they something
like oh fix this bug is there a readme
or can they iterate on the work they've
done these are the kinds of things that
demonstrate good habits that aren't
applicable to any particular language
and are gonna come forward as they join
your teams so let's get in our time
machine and fast forward in time a
little bit you've hired somebody who
seems super promising and it's their
first day and oh crap this is where your
hard work really begins or how now
becomes how do you go about leveling
them up and getting what they need to
succeed so I want to do another exercise
with you for the experienced programmers
in the room I want you to try to recall
the mental gymnastics that you perform
the first time you ever encountered a
map that unfamiliar data structure sit
there and really try to relive the
anxiety and frustration of trying to
wrap your head around this concept
what's a map what do I put in it when do
I use it is it the same thing as a hash
is it vector what am i doing here the
fact is the more experience we have at
something the less we remember about
what it's like to struggle and therefore
the harder it gets for us to relate to
somebody who is actually in the middle
of that struggle right now this is what
makes successfully hire engineer
developers so it's difficult
successfully integrating them onto your
team and leveling them up requires this
constant empathic practice so we're
going to talk about two different kinds
of empathy that we need to practice in
order to succeed here
the first kind of empathy is technical
empathy and it goes
back to what I just mentioned the more
experience we have programming the less
we remember about what it's like to
struggle to build that most basic mental
map of fundamental concepts so we've got
to anticipate likely sources of friction
here and talk about where people are
gonna struggle so that we can help them
out so to reduce the obvious first
you've just sired somebody for a cloture
job and they don't actually know any
closures so what are you gonna do
getting them up to speed here is gonna
be the first challenge that you have to
overcome so time to study should be
baked into the workday at the beginning
it might look something like pair
programming with this person as much as
it possibly makes sense and maybe
leaving little bits of study time at the
end to help review concepts that the two
of you have gone over earlier in the day
longer term it might be something like
the 20% time that's been popular with
Google or cognate Act at democracy works
for example this means that every Friday
20% of the weekday for a newer developer
is spent studying maybe starting with
the cones and then working on to
something more complex it's a good idea
for you to keep a list of ideas in your
pocket to help people out if they get
stuck but ultimately you should let them
own this process this allows them to
develop a sense of ownership over their
work from the beginning and they will be
able to evolve the difficulty as it
makes sense tooling is another one it
can be a hurdle for anybody embracing a
new language but it's especially true
for closure land of the endless
parentheses right and let's face it
Emacs is not exactly known for being
beginner friendly please don't force a
new developer into Emacs land if that is
not the tooling set up that he or she is
already familiar with he makes is a
really steep learning curve and it
shouldn't have to compete with closure
for valuable brain space fortunately
it's no longer the only game in town
take advantage of this to create a
tooling setup that is accessible and
minimizes the light
hood that somebody is going to be
frustrated and overwhelmed don't forget
to involve your new teammate in this
process after all it's their computer
right impostor syndrome is another one
that gets all of us but beginners
especially so the fear of asking a
stupid question is magnified if we don't
even know what the question should be or
how we're gonna phrase it to help
counter the sphere we can create an
environment where questions are not only
encouraged but actively solicited on our
parts this is most effectively done by
constantly asking somebody what
questions they have and inviting them to
engage with you then simply telling them
once yeah you know totally cool if you
approach me and then just assuming that
they were gonna feel comfortable enough
to actually come to you when they need
help more concretely we can carve out a
space that's actually devoted to
questions at democracy works we have a
slack channel called closure beginners
and it's for exactly what you might
expect it's a place for anybody to ask
basic questions or maybe not so basic
and anybody who's around is welcome to
answer at any time finally don't lose
sight of the fact that you hired
somebody who's new to closure but not
totally new to programming in general
instead you should be finding ways to
leverage what your new teammate already
knows from a different language for
example writing closure script requires
a knowledge of JavaScript take advantage
of the fact that somebody already knows
JavaScript or as for closure don't
forget that it's got a robust set of
higher-order functions for working with
collections that are very similar to
rubies a numeral little class drawing
these types of parallels between closure
and a previously studied language is not
only going to help concepts stick and
build that confidence from the start
it's also probably going to challenge
you to consider how you are to stretch
how you consider the language and you
might even find that you're learning
something new along the way here too
recently I was debugging some closure
script when a colleague of mine and I
suggested that we throw the JavaScript
debugger into our code so that we
examine what was going on at a certain
breakpoint and his response was I'm
sorry what is that and I was blown away
because this person has many times more
experience than I do and here I was
teaching him something new to solve our
problem the bottom line is that
different things are going to be obvious
to different people using the JavaScript
debugger was a tool that I had reached
for a hundred times and it was totally
foreign to my colleague who has much
more experience than I do we're all
capable of being rubber ducks for each
other here and the broader or the bigger
the spread between our different
experiences the more we potentially
stand to learn from each other so we've
talked a bit about technical empathy but
we should all be familiar with this
thing right computers are easy people
are the hard part
hiring a junior developer doesn't mean
that you bring someone on board you slap
a book down on their desk and
everything's going to be totally fine in
a few weeks in other words it gets a
little bit trickier so we're gonna spend
some time talking about that second form
of empathy which is emotional empathy as
we mentioned earlier the feeling of
being a beginner is like an extreme case
of impostor syndrome again it's hard for
us to recognize this maybe if we've been
in the fields for a little while as the
memory of what it's like to struggle
earlier in a programming career is far
less vivid maybe than it once was but
there are concrete ways that we can help
our new teammate track their progression
and start to feel good about the
contributions they're making to the team
and what they're learning from the start
the first one might seem a little
obvious but it doesn't happen nearly as
frequently as it should you should be
holding regular one-on-ones with your
teammate
during these check-ins you need to be
doing two things one asking how it's
going and two providing feedback to them
not just critical feedback but
especially positive feedback you see
junior developers frequently lack that
framework that's provided by past
programming jobs to be able to act
really understand their own performance
in this case no news is not actually
good news
don't make somebody draw their own
conclusions about how they're doing I'm
always amazed when I talk to other
junior developers and they're utterly
convinced that they are just terrible at
this and they're gonna be fired at any
minute and maybe they should just go
talk to their boss because I'd rather
quit than be fired and they go and they
say something and the response is oh
you're doing great and nobody ever
thought to tell them that and just left
them to run away with their own
assumptions the newer the person that is
to programming the more frequently you
should hold these check ends it's better
to check in more frequently and or too
frequently and just have to back off a
little bit then have that opposite
pattern and find yourself start from the
side of the highway secondly you should
be setting goals you should introduce
this process but your new teammates
should really drive it it's a chance for
them the goal setter to identify the
ways that they're hoping to learn and
grow in their careers and it's also an
opportunity for you to stay in sync with
what motivates them and what they're
hoping to learn so my favorite
methodology for goal setting is the 666
model in which short medium and long
term goals are identified and they
correspond roughly with a six week six
months or six year timeline these should
be a mix of hard technical roles like be
able to write a basic day Tomic
migration without referencing the docs
and other more career oriented goals
like give a talk at closure west
even though public speaking sort of
terrifies you there's no real set of
rules you got it there's no real set of
rules on how to write these though the
short-term ones are going to be
measurable and specific and the
longer-term ones are going to be a
little bit more vague don't forget to
actually review these goals as part of
your one-on-one doesn't you know if you
write them down you don't review them
kind of useless they should be used as a
jumping-off point for conversation to
see how somebody's feeling about their
work they're doing but they shouldn't be
used as a hard-and-fast performance
metric
but above all it's important to realize
to really actually fully realize and
internalize that in hiring a junior
developer you're making this long-term
commitment to somebody else's growth in
other words it means that as part of
this process the word mentorship needs
to be a part of your job description
before you bring somebody on it doesn't
mean that you are suddenly a manager
management and mentorship are not the
same thing but it does mean that you're
not going to be typing alone for eight
hours a day either and you're probably
not going to be working at your normal
pace at least not for a little while so
keeping an appropriate ratio of junior
to senior developers is a key part of
being able to appropriately handle this
commitment three seniors - one junior is
generally the ideal here you might be
able to get away with something slightly
smaller than that but the more people
that you have able to help honor this
commitment the better off everyone's
gonna be in other words hire one junior
developer to start not five so why are
we really here well at the beginning in
this talk we touch briefly on the why
question why do we want to or invest
time hiring and supporting junior
developers hopefully it's clear that
yeah it helps us grow our own careers
through mentoring and we may pick up
some new language knowledge along the
way and it's definitely easier to help
somebody teach somebody who's newer to
programming good habits that we use on
our teams then maybe try to change the
habits that we don't like of somebody
who's been around for a little longer
but it's also clear that this is indeed
an investment there's no getting around
the fact that hiring juniors take
significant time and effort so we want
to know how this investment is going to
benefit us long term in addition to the
ways that we already talked about so
let's take a look at some numbers
according to a 2014 USA Today survey of
about 180 US and Canadian universities
only 4.5% of yes degree recipients
self-identified as black and only six
point five percent self-identified as
Vanek while nearly 61% said that they
were white and according to a different
survey of Stanford CS on the grads
nearly 70% of those survey respondents
indicated that they were male so in
other words the vast majority of CS
degrees are still going to someone who
looks more or less like well a lot of
the people in this room but code schools
on the other hand have been extremely
successful at attracting students on the
premise that's switching to a new career
is entirely feasible regardless of where
that individual might be at this point
in their life or what their background
might be so consequently a large number
of junior developers if they're coming
to this point we are coming to this
point here the code school route are
career changers having discovered
programming outside of that traditional
understanding of school their previous
career experience doesn't just disappear
overnight even though they're now
writing code the skills that they
already have from other jobs such as
specific subject matter expertise from
an industry that they were working in or
all of the other non-technical skills
that are required of a good programmer
are an asset to your organization as
they join your team learning syntax is
the easy part
there are rules and patterns to follow
but there aren't rules and patterns on
the other skills like how to be a good
teammate but luckily software
development is about more than just
writing code we work on teams and these
teams are generally made up of other
human beings project management skills
communication skills the ability to
deliver critical feedback in a
constructive and positive way these are
not the sorts of things that you get
better at simply by writing code and
they're not the only only strengths that
you can pick up just in a software
specific context so the right junior
developer is going to be able to bring
these things to the table from day one
and they're likely going to help you
grow in this area as well and these
outside skills offer this diversity of
perspective here that begins to touch on
a deeper reason why we need to do a
better
of hiring people from a variety of
places diverse candidates those who come
from underrepresented backgrounds bring
additional perspective to bear if we
think about how the junior developer
population is largely made up of people
who have traditionally been turned away
from programming careers then it makes
sense that welcoming these newer
developers on tour teams is going to
strengthen all of us by exposing us to
different experiences this translates to
richer software software that is going
to account for the needs of a broader
swath of people who are going to use our
tools in a variety of ways that we
couldn't possibly anticipate if we were
to stick to hiring people who have all
discovered programming in more or less
the same way now I can't move on before
I do bunk the idea here the only way to
find underrepresented candidates is to
look to the junior developer pool that
is patently false please don't fall into
the trap of thinking that a junior
hiring strategy is on its own a
wholesale diversity and inclusion
solution indeed senior women people of
color and other minorities are
frequently assumed to be junior in their
skills and experiences simply because of
how they present rather I want you to
leave here today with the understanding
the junior developer segments can be
especially rich in a variety of
different people who have different
experiences and if we go back to the
original idea of community building then
this is our ticket what we're really
trying to do here is enhance the
community and we do this by learning and
growing from each other sure this is
primarily done through code but if we
consider that code as a mechanism for
storytelling
then our understanding of code can only
be broadened and deepened by exposure to
many different stories so if you take
nothing else away from this talk I hope
you at least have a better understanding
of who junior developers are how you can
successfully integrate them onto your
teams and why this investment will
benefit you your company and the
your community at large so with that
it's time for all of us to get to work
