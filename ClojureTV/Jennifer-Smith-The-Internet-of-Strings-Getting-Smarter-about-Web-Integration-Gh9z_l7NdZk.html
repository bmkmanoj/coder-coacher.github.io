complicated I've actually moved away
from London to Melbourne so technically
inaccurate but only by about two weeks
so I might like to travel ok so what I
wanted this works I want to talk to you
a little bit about what the world was
like when I started developing web apps
that's where my background is is in and
when we were when you know way back then
I won't tell you how long ago it was and
we weren't many concern with this thing
here this web app now ok sure we make
some HTML we'd send it to the browser
and we might try and get some
application state and put it into a
database over there but really the web
app was where the exciting stuff
happened and ok sure we sometimes had to
talk to other systems we didn't act in
isolation but you know that was kind of
like a side concern you know might have
to talk to a web service or maybe
something putting data into our database
and but over the last few years and I'm
noticed obviously there's been a bit of
a change so one is this rise and rise of
JavaScript I mean JavaScript used to be
like how you used to do pop-ups and
client-side form validation yeah times
have changed and also stuff which should
shouldn't we shouldn't have had to have
discovered along the way but has we have
discovered for a you know for the better
stuff like logging metrics monitoring
dashboards just understanding what's
going on in your site and with that scum
a lot of kind of stuff as a service
you're talking to a lot more systems
than you were in in in the past
alongside that as well there's it's kind
of move to avoid this monolithic
monoliths application that does
everything and start to move to kind of
smaller parts and services fought for
right or wrong but there's it you know
there's this shift from big web app to
big system so you know it actually
becomes more helpful to talk about my
job to define the thing I concentrate on
us not being this web app this piece of
java code or C sharp code or whatever em
to actually talk about building systems
that talk to Eileen oh this is this
series of connected components for some
definition of the word connected and
these systems they sit with in other
systems they talk to other systems that
talk to other systems and so on and so
forth all the way up the staff until
well you kind of a guest get the
internet and but what I'm what I'm
interested in and when and what kind of
what I mean when I talk about web
integration is what's holding all these
systems and all these different bits
from components together so instead of
talking about the boxes in our
architecture diagram and I'm talking I
want to talk about the lines what are
these what is this stuff that we're
using to communicate backwards and
forwards and and it's kind of its kind
of strings isn't it in a lot of cases
okay you know let's let's argue at one
later it was just a clever talk title so
it kind of you know make it sound
interesting but you know it's kind of
true you know we're building these web
applications and we're sitting on top of
like the Internet stack as I guess you'd
call it and we're dealing there's its
various levels of layers of protocols
but where we come in is at this
application level and at the application
protocol level quite a lot of those
protocols that they're text-based and
and you know what do I mean by that well
it's you send some strange you get some
strings back so just sitting there
sending strings backwards and forwards
and it's kind of cool because it's kind
of transparent we can we know what's
going on as as much as the program we
write to interpret it so you know we can
we can access this stuff and type in
commands and check our email via telnet
and stuff like that and of course the
most common application protocol
certainly in my worlds we could argue
edit I can actually find any hard
statistics about this and the most the
most common is HTTP and so that includes
lots of things this media types content
negotiation you know you can decide what
format you want to send your stuff in to
find a
a common set of verbs sport for cash
encoding authentication lots and lots
and lots the HTTP spec is quite big but
why want to focus on is that request a
response the whole structure of the way
the messages work I you know so HTTP
requests you send over there and you get
HTTP response back so starting from
first principles what does that do to
our kind of messaging into it like
exchange so we could start rather
naively with a custom protocol and I'm I
say we've all done this it's quite fun
to do you know sitting write some stuff
directly to a socket and read some stuff
back off you invent your own error
checking and recovery and stuff like
that and you're kind of working with
your own libraries as soon as you add
HTTP you've kind of you've kind of had a
bit that stuff taken away from you you
don't have to do as much work for
example at your dressing saying I want
to get the cities from Bob's weather
service and there's a kind of standard
way of returning returning about the
response that standard again so we can
read and understand it it's not it's not
anything language-specific it's not
anything library specific but there are
libraries available to do that you know
enclosure we have ring and closure HTTP
that allows to talk HTTP and step three
we can enhance there and we can start to
use more standardized content types of
which there are many available as we
heard earlier and what whichever one you
choose for whichever reason most of them
have this benefit that they're alive
again there are libraries available for
them like whether they're
self-describing or not whether they're
particularly optimal for what you're
trying to do it's a standard format so
once you've got this data in Jason
there's a library I can use in my
application to read it so that's cool so
HTTP content types and they give us this
kind of common language for messaging
change get put post and things like that
and also away a common language for the
message contents as well so we're
talking about this scenario where we've
got two application
she's talking to one another they're
integrating is that enough is that
enough for us to effectively do our jobs
well kind of so let's take the scenario
this is what I'm this is a structure of
the message i'm expecting back from
Bob's Weather Service it's got a name
temperature and it's gone outlook for
today and tomorrow you can see why I
moved out of London and but that's but
you know that's fun I've written my
program to expect that I read out
today's outlook and I put it on a big
screen um but there's nothing
guaranteeing I've deployed my
application is sitting out there on the
wild west of the internet running
there's nothing to guarantee that Bob's
Weather Service isn't in a start instead
send me a picture of a cat there's you
know I mean what do i do at that point
do I you know I have to kind of like
code for all these scenarios and write
all this elaborate guard code to make
sure you know that I'm getting why I
expect um and and that's it's not just
the messages the content of the message
is where stuff and go wrong we've also
got this problem that resources can
change like addresses might you know I
might have been able to access before
return 200 now and a 404 or 402 or
whatever that one is about making a
cover for the I'm a teapot protocol
African which which status code that was
but yet the point is that stuff can
change and shift under our feet um and
why this is is what HTTP gives us this
common language it gives us this
protocol but it doesn't it doesn't allow
us to describe our expectations so
there's no way of saying these was also
available these operations are available
this is kind of what the message looks
like all this is kind of why expect
message to look like and we want these
spaces codes so number one we can't
describe that there's no language to
describe that within HTTP and there's no
way of checking that that's actually the
case of verifying that and I just like
to say obviously not nor should there be
HTTP is not really meant for that um but
because we don't really there's not
really a good way to do that we end up
with this kind of slightly crappy state
where there's distill these ambiguities
and
tested paths because even feel like if
you're writing an app that's consuming
another web service and taking something
taking something from that and pushing
out to somewhere else and putting it to
database if something goes wrong in one
of those messages you could end up with
this kind of garbage in garbage out
effect and then just garbage flowing
through the whole system end up in this
kind of weird weird path and you know
you have to write a lot of God code to
stop that from happening and you also
have to have like a lot of trust in the
service providers to do the right thing
so you've got to trust them to migrate
you know not near to provide backwards
compatible versions of stuff to not
suddenly disappear things without
telling you and in most of these cases
because it is this request and response
thing the consumer the one making the
request is generally the one that
suffers at the end of the day if
something goes wrong and even if you are
kind of a conscientious service provider
upgrades are just kind of a bit of pain
because you you don't know you've got
all these consumers sitting out here
you're not entirely sure which of them
are using which parts of your message of
which using which operations so even if
you want to do the right thing change is
really hard um obviously we're not we're
not stupid or you know we're trying to
our jobs we do try and address these
problems and try and attack the
ambiguity thing one way we do that is by
distributing client libraries so if you
are writing a service you might
alongside it write a client library in
Java or something and and distribute
that out to your clients and say hey
guys I know it's not clear what our
service does but you know you just use
these methods on here and it will be
fine and that is fine until stuff kind
of goes wrong they upgrade things and
you've got up before stop grade your
library and it's also you know you're
coupled to this this service because
you're in it in a way because you're
using it but then you're also kind of
relying on them to write your client'll
code for you as well not always a good
situation and there's also a platform
problem as well if there's no
implementation through your platform
you're kind of screwed there's also
automated contract tests which is is
kind of
way of flushing some of this out so you
know you write series automated tests
that check the check that the service is
doing what you expect and that works but
they're kind of a pain to maintain and
they're also you know people say test
the documentation sure you know it kind
of works but you're kind of skating
around the edge of defining this
contract by writing a bunch of tests and
no it doesn't to me it seems like it's
solving half a problem but not quite
there and we we can also solve it by
ourselves using people which is things
like consuming API documentation and so
me as a person who's should be doing
better things can be like going and
reading some documentation online and
figuring out exactly what status codes
are going to come back from this thing
and what I should do in each case and
then if there's no api documentation we
have informal chats email a lot of trust
and maybe some crossed fingers you know
this is kind of doesn't it doesn't feel
that safe and and to me the problem is
that we have this thing here we have
these like implicit contracts I if I'm
writing a consumer application there are
certain things I depend on on that
service we might not highlight them we
might not bring them to the front but
there's a list of things I expect you
know this URL to return this status code
return messages they look like this
there is something there it's just maybe
it's not really very apparent and one
thing one problem I one way I think we
can solve that is moving to may be more
explicit contracts and and more useful
contracts to to you won't once once
you've brought these things out and
you've made them real you've stopped
documented the operations a message
isn't a machine-readable way and you can
use them for verification monitoring
documentation all sorts of things you
can make these things useful but I kind
of feel like we may have been here
before I don't know if this sounds a bit
familiar to anybody and the reason it's
familiar is that I may be mr. slide off
my initial brief history of web app dev
as taught by me
which was how do we how do we do it back
then in this oh no had it had we managed
to integrate with other systems and and
okay so there's lots of technologies
were used but one of the ones we used
certainly when I was I was doing it was
one of these and yeah and yeah yeah boo
hiss come on phone all right I feel your
pain guys come on come on the sled out
it's all right it's gonna be fine um
yeah so what was this dealer let's just
take step back from the kind of the pain
we all feel and it was kind of doing I
said it we're defining an interface with
spining the things that can go wrong in
a fashion we're defining the kind the
shape of the messages that go in
shea/for the messages go back and awk
you know we kind of gonna you know we've
got all those things that we didn't have
in this kind of world I'm describing we
also had its friend it's kind of
complementary XML format so x SD is
there to describe exactly the form of
every message that you're going to send
to the letter with no no ambiguities no
nothing your XML is only going to look
like that and that's it um I like I say
it can't just dafair with me here right
it kind of it kind of did what I said
what I said was kind of missing it
described the operations and the
messages being passed back and forth we
had tools to validate this stuff was
being like these things being met well
actually we didn't have tools our
applications would stop working if like
he upgraded the wisdom you know was you
know that's to me kind of collating
um but um obviously a kind of a major
expense which is why everyone's laughing
in it you know it's it was kind of
painful so there's a high coupling
effect so your your service had 20
operations that it broadcasts on this
interface you had to know about all 20
even if you're just using one likewise
if it was returning a data type that had
20 fields on it and you only use three
you needed to know about all 20 as soon
because you if you're using that
excellent that x SD to violate it to
check what was coming back which most
web services stuff kind of did and you'd
find in this case where if the service
started it changed that definition added
more stuff you had to upgrade your
client there's no fun um because of that
that high coupling and this like really
hard change you know it was really hard
to change stuff we'd end up with this
like big upfront design of contracts
even before the systems are written
you'd you sit and decide what that
interface was and likewise with schemers
I mean I I can't believe like how many
in my early stages of my career how many
kind of schema design meetings i SAT
through to design xml schemas like
between between like parts of an
organization or between different
organizations is yeah that was a lot of
fun um any data format as long as it's
xml so you know you're restricted to
your data formats and and for as much as
i said that we still was giving this one
at what we needed it was normally
generated I don't remember hand editing
wisdom unless one of the tools i was
using had gone majorly wrong you didn't
you didn't own that document it wasn't
yours to come play with him right tools
off you could but it was a fairly
impenetrable format and it was we're
still too it's an help so let's go back
to http integration now let's go back to
that the world that we live in now
because we know so much more but how can
we how can we get smarter about that how
can we how can we attack call some of
those problems that I've said with the
ambiguities and not renounce going on
and making change hard what can we do so
one thing but I think we could do is
maybe have some
two contracts and when I say smart
contracts i I'm I'm not advocating going
back to the dark days of wisdom please
don't get me wrong what's the smarter
contract because the problem is that
there is a contract there there are you
know there is something that you rely on
you're just kind of pretending it's not
there so can we just make make these
things explicit make them real and just
get them to work a bit better so what
would be better would be flexibility so
you know there's a lot going on there's
a lot of things that we're doing we
don't always need to have that level of
kind of control of what's going on
what's coming back in in a request and
response we have we want to be able to
supply them where necessary none
complete which I don't think is quite
the right word what I mean is those is
that kind of hostels law being literal
and what you receive and they've got to
be a tool to be used for us so there
could be a plot applicable pre pre hot
candle that's really a word we hope pre
post ad hoc thing we've got to be able
to do to create a contract for an
existing service or maybe create one
before or service exists or or create
one at a time just a debugging try and
find out what the hell's going wrong
with something we don't have to use them
in all those all the hawks and we want
to have it we're going to have a choice
of content types to like restricting
yourself particular content type is just
not useful like you know as kind of talk
went on earlier that there's a that
there's actually some really interesting
stuff happening there I don't want to
restrict myself to Jason or engine even
though that seems to be the most common
thing right now I don't want to restrict
myself to it like just like we didn't
want to straight to sales to xml and
then it should be supporting tools that
make our lives easier and we're still
just you know it felt like this kind of
thing too constraining us and making
things hard to change III think we
should have contracts that let us drive
tools like I say testing monitoring stub
generation and I think they should come
from the consumer where appropriate I
took a little bit about that later but
why closure why my why am I talking
about this now not not least for the
fact that we need it we are working in
this
world of muddy integration and
ambiguities and but why is it something
I think we could start to think about so
I say date was a first class citizen I
think I wrote that quite late last night
I mean is that that you've got this kind
of these structures that are readable
from whatever format you choose their
readable as a human and that also you
can transform them and they are
extensible there in a map you don't have
to think about every single key in a map
just look at the stuff you're interested
in transmittable I think I just meant
you can go and save that to a data
format I'm going to send it off
somewhere else and someone else can read
it they're not necessarily enclosure but
they we can we can write to share data
formats and we also have libraries that
integrate well together so a lot of
these things are going to be around
looking at HTTP and looking at different
data formats and we actually got this
huge huge advantage because they're kind
of integrating libraries enclosure is a
case of taking some data structures from
here and putting them over the hair oh
it makes things mark if you compare it
to other kind of framework e approaches
it makes it really easy to say take
Liberator which I think it's going to be
mentioned at some point in the
conference taking taking a liberator
resource and plugging it into ring just
just kind of works it's just flying maps
around so it makes it really easy to
start to combine these tools in
interesting ways I want to say
interesting ways I think there's really
dangerously good ideas around testing
and verification going on and so got the
generous with testing and her that's not
similar we were talking about last night
it's similar to the Haskell quick chek
idea it's this all day around property
based testing and stimulant and for kind
of that's around like testing symp like
running simulations across your system
right um schema which again I hits we
talked about later and around like
testing the your data is in a particular
shape I think is the way that works and
then this kind of really quite
interesting experimentation around
typing and like it
it's me to me it's really interesting
that we could start to use it's not to
use typing rather than you know roots
start to apply types of things and be a
consumer of typing rather than having
enforcement by the language for 20 years
I think that's just quite an interesting
idea around verification there um and
then I just wanted to add one more idea
in which is this library myself and a
colleague you've been working on and
could Janis so love hina central idea
genesis if you can represent your
contract as data we can make tools to do
useful stuff with it like I said
verification monitoring documentation
and then this whole idea of sub
generation when I say that I mean
actually using that contract to create a
version a sort of safe disconnected
version of the surface just a note just
in case anyone wanted some history
lessons Janice's that yes the Roman god
of doors gates trade beginnings and
endings and lots of other stuff and
maybe web integration too he's he's kind
of depicted often as this this God
looking that way looking that way and if
you think about something that's
providing a way of using contracts to
verify upstream services and also to
support other dick to you know test the
consumer he's kind of quiet good mascot
I thought it's quite a clever name I
didn't come up with it so I'm just going
to show you or try to show you wish me
luck here and a quickly demo of the kind
of the kind of things I'm talking about
so we did we'll go start with I've
create a little web service here it
doesn't do very much it tells me the
temperature in three cities i've been in
recently and those readings are changing
every so often as well so it's taking
supposedly live data and broadcasting it
and updating its internal state so
that's what that's what the cert that's
what the web service i'm interested in
it's doing so I'm a consumer and yeah
it's not done great with the line
endings there and I'm a consumer and I'm
interested in integrating with this
contract
we're sorry integrated with this service
and and this is the content this is the
terms on which I want to integrate so
I'm saying this endpoint here if I make
a get request to it I should get
response the 200 status this header
Jason Jason content type and the body
should have cities and each one should
be should have a name of type string and
temperature of type number so far so
we're looking a little bit like XML
schema but so one thing we can do the
obvious thing we can do is actually to
use that contract the date that this
kind of verified data version of a
contract and use it to generate some
tests of that upstream service which we
can do and you see kind of see up there
it passes fabulous all right great we're
doing well here we've got a service that
meets the requirements we need so we're
going to use that now to make a simple
where the dashboard here we are I'm not
known for my UX skills so this is quite
an achievement for me and and we consume
that so we're consuming that feed and
we're nice heads-up display which we're
updating periodically as the data
changes i will so doing some fancy
shading and coloring that took about
three hours to actually get to work and
I was like why mice why my wasting time
on this yeah so let you know I I just
kind of said oh look it runs and it
passes that that's fabulous but you know
that you don't have to believe me so one
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
now break that contract so I've changed
that way that I've changed the service
that I've seen service now there's a
there's a bar gore or by bike kind of
intentionally they've removed the name
from from the cities and if we go back
to the dashboard its kind of broken and
the reason it's broken is because I'm
not particularly good at checking for
noel's and I'm upper casing that name
that names not there boom right service
broken
and if we wanted to maybe diagnose and
figure out what was going wrong we could
Rivera Phi again so we retain that
contract we've got and verifying it
against upstream service and again it's
not it's not too clear this these
messages could be better but it's saying
well we expected you to have a name to
be non no on this object it's not so
something's gone wrong so immediately it
kind of gives you so you're trying to
fix what the hell your your applications
broken it just gives you it just gives
you something to be able to just
diagnose the most likely cause because
if your code hasn't you know you're
seeing that your code hasn't changed its
been running in isolation if something
suddenly goes wrong and you haven't
touched it it's probably it's probably
an outside party doing something funny
and in this case it was so I'm going to
reset that again and just check it so
working again yet so we're now back to a
decent functioning service and there's
obviously other things we can do to make
it go wrong I've now switch the content
type to HTML instead of Jason pretty
fundamental change and unsurprisingly
you get a whole heap of errors about the
content type and stuff like that well I
think we're back to normal now let's
have a look yes cool all right but you
know not all changes are bad I've nail
change that service and i've added on
some more additional things about the
outlook and if anyone knows melbourne
that's actually true because it is a
crazy place it's like raining one day
then hot next actually writing one hour
hot the next hour the so you're seeing
there that actually it's still it still
passes our test even though we've added
that extra data and even though we've
popped in this extra day to it passes
our test and that's good because also
our service is still able to consume
that data that that's right client
application is still able to consume
that data so calling ups that live api
might be expensive he might be slow it
might cost money there may be minimum
Regina
you only make three requests an hour and
stuff like that so this is where the
idea of simulating comes in its source
you know it's a very good way of
actually running that contract and
testing whether it works so we just got
a similar just all the simulations and
stimulating does is take that contract a
poor and some other bits of
configuration and then just sets it up
running so we can run that service and
it's taken the information that we've
given it and said all right so you want
some cities and there's gonna be a
string temperatures got to be a number
right cool all right there you go it's
yeah you know it's done what you said
this computers aren't that smart that's
that's kind of all they can do um so we
just just a test that the circle is
complete if we run that verification
again it's all it's all hitting the same
port makes it easier and obviously it
passes the verification of the contract
it's trying to simulate cool and so
let's go and look at that in the
dashboard oh it's kind of there's a few
problems here and number one is that my
lovely shading that shaded it from that
Confederate carretas has kind of broken
because these numbers are either Steve
Lehigh or Steve lilo I don't know much
about you know other not sure I'm much
about science we were talking some earth
scientist this morning they could have
told me this but I don't think you can
get temperatures that high like I don't
know I just seems yeah possibly not um
and also if you notice it's starting to
kind of crawl about because we've not
really applied any constraints to say
well yeah so you want a list of cities
but how many city and know how many is
too much so I've actually set to stop
the thing breaking I think it only just
will any list it will kind of go between
zero and a thousand items in that in
that list it doesn't go crazy because I
had it I had it up at like sixty five
thousand and it broke my own browser
so so this is this is where this is
where I think the idea of contracting
and starting to pull that out as an
entity that I'm right gets really
interesting because you start think so
what what are the constraints of my
system what what what what what's the
limits of the data that i can accept
before completely breaking stuff now you
can either make your code so it drops
say you know you easily with the cities
to just take the top three off that
response and not worry but another
alternative is to set some constraints
on the contract so I've revised this
contact now and i just added a couple
more directive from said length between
0 and 10 and that name that that string
name should have a length between 5 and
20 I clearly think I'm write JavaScript
there because there's a comma and then
we come to the number and we're saying
that really we expect a reasonable range
of temperatures to between minus 1 and
45 and so we've now applied some some
additional constraints to that contract
that we didn't actually realize that
that we thought what you know is until
that went live and we started getting
weird numbers out we wouldn't have
realized that constraints or an issue so
we can we just restart we go back so
real real service again and we rerun the
concert so this is running the one with
with with additional constraints and
obviously it passes it's fine we can now
pop up simulator again and it doesn't
look that pretty because it's still it's
using the data generators the the things
that test generative uses to create lots
of random strings and integers it
doesn't look that great i could have
constrained what characters are there
but the temperatures look kind of right
and already the dashboard starts to look
a bit nicer it starts to reflect more
what we saw when we're integrating the
real service so that whole exercise is
that allowed us to kind of narrow in on
exactly what we need to and what what
what stuff that this display that this
client application needed from the
upstream service so you know there was
this some implicit requirement for the
temperature to be in a certain range
that we didn't have in our contract and
now using the simulator has kind of
forced us to think about it and I think
that's kind of interesting I like that
because it's something that you know you
can see it's applying arbitary
constraints but that's that that's its
suffering like I sometimes think as a
developer I do sort concentrate on what
you called happy path might you
concentrate on things data being nice
and conveniently shaped when you realize
in the real world you could get anything
so i think is anything that gets me to
think about the constraints of where I'm
working it's all good so I mentioned a
little bit about consumer consumer
contracts consumer-driven contracts and
as you saw there all that contract stuff
I was doing from perspective of the
consumer and that's yeah if you can read
this article that talks more about it
but it's kind of quite a good idea
around quite quite interesting powerful
I do like you if you get the consumer to
specify the contract and it reduces
coupling and because the consumers now
able to just say I need that that that
mat and it's a lot more explicit what he
needs and it kind of rebalances the
power a little bit from the service and
the consumer so although I see the
service has the ultimate purpose it's
the one putting out yet you know it's on
powering the API and controls what it
does the consumers able to say look you
know I need you to do this and it taking
it to its conclusion you could end up in
situation where actually the service
contract is not you don't explicitly
write that it becomes a union of
consumer contracts and in imagine some
crazy stuff with checking compatibility
does this consumer contract match that
consumer contracts it sounds like a fun
problem Janice is obviously a work in
progress there's a few things you need
to do one is just using existing
libraries more so I've you know all that
stuff is right he's using its own
checking stuff where there's all these
test frameworks that do a far better job
than we do of writing assertions so
trying to figure out a way of
transforming a contract into assertions
would be a really interesting thing and
then the other directions wanna go is
apply to mod situations different data
formats not just Jason and
then there are other formats and maybe
looking at test testing for other things
in hello caching directives quality of
service would be cool if you could test
this service should return this data and
it should respond within 20 minutes or
20 seconds whatever your quality of
service is and then perhaps going beyond
HTTP HTTP to as well as like applying to
all situations make contracts more
useful to more nuanced simulation
there's so much more you can do there
with state and returning sensible values
and then obviously extending out to
monitoring documentation so I kind of
done now but just a couple of puzzles
and a couple of things because I said
getting smarter about web integration I
didn't say that I have the answer
unfortunately I'd love to and the first
question I have is do we need to have
this kind of rarefied contracting for
every every integration for every line
on this diagram and the answer is it
kind of depends sorry it's not you know
there's no hard and fast rule it depends
maybe on how important that integration
is is it happening kind of an user time
is it when one of your when your when
your customers is connecting to your
website does it hit this web service is
so I'm going to die or lose something if
if it goes wrong and how reliable is
that upstream service as well so you
know does it go wrong a lot you need to
kind of add this in just to help you out
how easy is it to figure out when stuff
goes wrong and how often do things
change if things don't change ever maybe
you don't need to have a contract is you
know it's there it's working if things
are changing like rapidly again that's
too much overhead but as maybe a sweet
spot in the middle where this approach
makes sense do we need a standard
contract definition language we stall
for the HTTP age no I don't think so I'm
not I'm my personal opinion I don't i'm
not sure standards of that helpful for
what we wanting to do i want us to focus
on talking about contracts again getting
kind of getting over the trauma of
wisdom and like signs just you let's
start the conversation there's let's
build tools work with contracts however
we decide to represent them I don't
think we can all agree we all can't
agree on what a good tasting cup of
coffee is we're certainly not going to
agree on what contracts look like that's
my opinion but you may have others so
when it said the internet strings it was
a quiet just a punished talk title but
you know one question I've had is well
do you want to just apply structure to
everything is it is it about timing
things and making things consistent
predict predictable but that kind of
top-down applying constraints from the
top down mode a do is construct this
structures this like lovely wonderful
chaotic system that you know it is kind
of amazing and I just would feel that's
not my goal for a start it's impossible
and it's also just not yeah it's not in
the spirit of things and my real goal
though is to recognize what we need to
do is recognize accomplished contract
exists whether we like them or not there
are services integrating together and
have these implicit contracts and I want
to turn these contacts that are fuzzy
and unknowable and confusing into
something real and tangible and
something we can start to reason about
and do that we create tools to make our
lives easier it allows us to focus on
doing more interesting stuff having more
dangerous ideas and making more
dangerous architectures so thank you for
listening to my rambles
