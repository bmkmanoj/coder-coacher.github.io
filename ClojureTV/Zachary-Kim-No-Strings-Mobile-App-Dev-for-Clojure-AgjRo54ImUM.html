talking about my experiences with native
mobile app development enclosure first a
little bit about me here's a picture of
me thinking about closure I've been
working in the industry for about 16
years mostly in the consumer space I
worked in San Francisco at a start-up
right now but I've also worked in
enterprise and in health care on the CTO
at zarley which is a place where you can
go to find great home service providers
I've been using closure since about 2010
so this is like I think this is like pre
line again days we had to like download
a jar and then run at the command line
yeah it's crazy and I run the closure
docks project which some of you may be
fired with it's a it's a community
documentation and examples for closure
so I'd like to get a little bit of
audience participation at this point
trying to get a sense for what your
backgrounds are and what kind of
development you're funny with if you
consider yourself a back-end programmer
and you can you can choose more than one
if you consider yourself a back-end
program or please raise your hand so
back in a lot of back-end people okay
front end or if you work mostly in the
browser great and then finally mobile
any mobile yes yes we got some old
developers which is terrifying I'm
really I'm really interested to see what
you guys think of this I'm not a mobile
developer I would consider myself more
of like a back-end front-end generalist
kind of person uh it was about three or
four months ago I really will the way
back up so I feel like maybe my
experiences is representative a lot of
people's experience where I would like
to do mobile development but the the
barrier entry is just too high right if
I want to go learn iOS I'd have to go
spend the time to really get into the
tooling get into Xcode get into the
libraries on the frameworks you know get
my head around objective-c and and you
know manual memory management all in
yadda yadda and then if I also wanted to
do an Android app then I'd have to go a
kind of context switch into a whole
different set of tools hold set of
different libraries but anyway so that
yeah about three four months ago I
really wanted to finally cross the cross
the divide and do some mobile
development and more specifically I want
to I want to do my mobile development
enclosure and unfortunately that was not
a really easy thing to do there's a
couple of different ways you could do it
it was you know mostly mostly loading up
closure script on a website and either
sticking that in a hybrid app a webview
or just loading up a web page in the
browser and will kind of get into those
those approaches later but if we want to
back up here for a second and really
talked about what are the approaches
that I could have taken to do a mobile
app really there was four that I had
kind of considered right so you have the
native we talked about that a little
already objective c and java and xcode
eclipse IntelliJ respectively you know
each one has its own simulation has its
own kind of way of shipping and
maintaining the app we've got the cross
compilation mechanism this is where you
want to work in us in a language that
you're used to and that you enjoy Sega
States closure you would cross compile
that to either machine code on the step
on these disparate platforms or compile
it into actual source code so you know
the kind of kind of a source translation
type of thing we got the hybrid approach
this is probably the most i would say
the most popular non-native and i'm
going to in trouble a little bit because
it's technically you are running a
native app and you are using native API
is but the UI itself has done in html5
technology so you've got your JavaScript
you got your html5 and you're rendering
your you eyes too
webbing right or maybe a set of web use
in your in your app and and are able to
still use the native api's but still but
you don't really get that kind of like
native feel of your app let's see and
then finally the the last one on the
list embedded compiler interpreter and
this is when you have a interpreter
running directly in your app live in
your app alongside the native code kind
of accepting inputs and running code and
creating these creating native elements
and we're going to talk about that a
little bit more in a second we're first
I have to stop I have a confession I've
gotten you here under false pretenses
because I click baited up the title of
my talk a little bit it's it's no
strings mobile app development enclosure
that's completely wrong there's a ton of
strings there are many many strings so
many that the first slide should
probably look a little bit more like
this you're going to want to read that
fine print and that is to say any of the
four approaches that I outlined I'm
gonna I'm gonna I'm going to try to
champion one specific approach here not
to say that you can't build great mobile
apps with any of the other three
mechanisms or three approaches but
ultimately the thing that was important
to me was building great great mobile
experiences like I want I wanted it to
be so the person using the app could not
tell that it was not a native iOS or
native Android or native Windows Phone
app but really you can build great
mobile apps in any technology it's
really about the end result and it's
more like just being it's more like
being in a relationship right there's a
certain everybody's crazy at some degree
and and you just got to find the kind of
crazy that you're that you're okay with
in the end I don't want to go full
native I think we covered this a little
bit I didn't want to go full native
because I wouldn't be able to use the
tools and the ecosystem that I love to
use I don't want to do a cross
compilation because frankly it didn't
and I think doesn't exist I didn't want
to build it I don't wanna go hybrid
because I wanted more of a native feel
to my apps and luckily that so that just
leaves that fourth option right embedded
JavaScript interpreter or embedded
interpreters running in your app and
luckily there's a project who's crazy
was just right for me and it's called
titanium it's put out by a company
called appcelerator and it implements
this embedded JavaScript interpreter on
a bunch of different platforms and we'll
get into that here in a little bit it's
been around it's open source I think
it's patchy license been around for five
or six years and it's pretty stable as
far as I can tell it's got great
documentation searchable they have their
own kind of stack overflow ish type site
it's imperative meaning that you
imperative ly build up your your UIs and
your code and we'll see that a little
bit later and takes a lowest common
denominator approach to kind of the
cross-platform stuff so what that means
is when you've got we give a button in
titanium you have a corresponding
heavyweight button in iOS which i think
is called the UI button and an Android
which is called a button and it used the
same JavaScript class to interact with
these things I'll try to interact with
the button now if you have a programmed
in swing this might make it a little bit
nervous but it's actually it's actually
okay because they take out they take
like a plus approach to this right where
even though it's the same button you're
using the same button on the JavaScript
side you have the ability to configure
platform specific things about that
button and so you know for example on on
iOS there on iOS there's no or excuse me
on yes on iOS there's no there's no back
button and so the button can't Beast be
selected by like a rocker switch or
anything like that and on Android that
is the case right so on iOS on Android
you can specify certain options about
that directly in your code that are
Android specific and for
cases where there isn't parity between
the platforms for example on iOS there's
something called a navigation window and
it's a way that iOS manages kind of the
back button in your app there's no kind
of corresponding concept over on the
Android platform and so there's just a
there's just a single class on the
titanium sorry for that sorry it's it's
a that makes it seem really complicated
it's actually a lot less complicated and
it'll become clear when we get into some
of the code of course there's react
native now this wasn't kind of available
when I was looking around but it looks
like it's going to be a really really
great option here right now it's it's oh
yeah again same embedded interpreter
it's for iOS only right now but they're
adding android support your UIs are
built declaratively and I think a lot of
us in this room have had had a chance to
work with react on the web and seen it
as a transformative technology so really
excited to see this project kind of like
mature a little bit and hopefully i'm
hoping the accelerator people on the and
the react native people can kind of get
together and cross-pollinated a bit
because there's some really great things
about titanium there's some really great
things about react native and and we all
win in the end if they can kind of get
together on that a little bit of an
overview on okay well excuse me back up
so so this this approach kind of really
ticked all the boxes for me right
there's a solid solid closure to jas
compiler which we all know and love I'd
have access to the closure ecosystem the
standard library all the great tooling
and the great community around closure
we could run a ripple in this you know
because we have this live JavaScript
interpreter you can run a repple in
there you can live code reload you can
introspect data as you're developing
your app and really what this gets you
is really tight and and rich coding
cycles right you have an idea you change
two lines of code you hit save and the
thing refreshes and and you can see if
it worked or not and people seem to love
to embed these things in their platforms
right like I mean what's in what's a new
technology that came out excuse me few
few new technology platforms come out
that don't have the ability or on
JavaScript it's just it's just
everywhere so it's got an element of
future proofing of course it's not all
benefits there are some trade-offs you
are running in a single thread and then
you just don't have the same performance
potential that you do with the true
native app right you don't have your
other threads you don't have you don't
have like the ability to do manual
memory management and I'm not saying
that that's a better way to build apps
I'm just saying that you can all things
being equal build more performant apps
it turns out these aren't really huge
problems though you know we have things
like Cory a sink which help us manage
concurrency and end time in our
applications we have and titanium itself
and react native have the ability to
they have an escape hatch to kind of
drop down to the native platform when
you need to so if you have a use case
for something that's very performance
sensitive you can write a native module
for that and interact with it with your
JavaScript code of course you have to
write that in the native in the native
language and using the native libraries
but this isn't the this type of approach
isn't meant to give you an excuse to not
understand your underlying abstractions
right you always need to know kind of
what's going on under your app or under
your code it's just it's a way to speed
up your development process yep
so what's it look like well we've got
we've got a JavaScript interpreter say
we wanted to create a button this is
what you do you create a button you have
a title give it some properties and what
that does on the java scott is
JavaScript side is call over to the
native side and create the native
equivalent or whatever this JavaScript
object right and then for the lifecycle
this object excuse me this JavaScript
object there's also this corresponding
native object that's that's live for
that same amount of time and the end the
framework or the platform kind of
manages that life cycle for you you you
can get in there a little bit it's just
it's really really ugly but it's but it
is possible it's not just for UI
elements we can also we also have access
to things like geolocation the HTTP
stack we there's a web sockets
implementation you know camera any any
native API anything you can do in a
native app you have access to with this
type of approach for example this is
what how you would get notified of a
user's location they pass it a call back
any time the user location is updated
then you get you get that back and so
what I've done is really not that much
to be honest with you it's I've added us
kind of a very tiny closure library on
top of these tools it's something you
could probably recreate in a couple of
hours or at least you could you could
play around with yourself and that is to
say it was really interesting to build
this on top of titanium or this
interpreter JavaScript or embedded
JavaScript interpreter mechanism highly
recommend you trying it out but
basically this is what it looks like
right so you create this provide you a
nice closure interface with idiomatic
closure things to build these mobile
apps and we're going to go into that a
little bit later I'm going to do a live
demo
and then I've got some demo apps I've
got some videos of the mobs to show but
right now just a little bit more about
this later so it's got titanium bindings
it's and you know like i said this one
looks like here's a window with a red
background there's a one button in it
and the butt title the button or the
text on the button is greets and when
you click it it pops up an alert dialog
right in addition to the x and you know
there's bindings for the event stuff for
all the native API is and that kind of
stuff there's Ruppel integration so
there's a ripple I've got a rep learning
in your app and it supports kind of like
incremental compilation and so whenever
you save the file it basically just send
your code over to this thing and
restarts the app there's some state
management stuff so if you're familiar
with writing react apps or our own apps
or you know the other react options and
closures will be very familiar with you
feel familiar to you it's not as good
it's but it's I'd say it's about half as
good but it basically allows you to say
here's an atom or here's a piece of
state mutable state and when it changes
I want to do certain things right so for
example in this in this one same window
with the red background this one has a
label that when you click on it in
increments counter and the the text of
the label auto increments there's some
message based dispatch stuff which kind
of allows you to like decouple the
disparate parts of your application but
still share context between those parts
you know words that's not that doesn't
really be anything but but you kind of
get it when you see it and that's kind
of it you know it's about 2500 lines
it's really small and and it's really
powerful okay so you guys want to should
we do some live coding is anybody else
nervous I'm pretty nervous we gotta get
me get set up here for a sec let's see
so I got to do close that let's see
sorry I just got to unhear this thing
we're gonna mirror this thing here real
quick okay yes good slides good okay
how's that look never see that okay
perfect so on the left here I've got or
yes on the left here I've got the iOS
simulator right on the right here very
very simple piece of code basically what
I've got is this github I've got like a
starter github project that I whenever I
want to create a new app I just clone it
this is something that I'm planning on
releasing as an alpha so that everybody
can kind of like jump in and see if they
like something like this but basically
it just gives you the skeleton of the
app right so so what should we do so say
we want to build an app that maybe shows
you a picture or something or maybe
shows you a label or a box or something
like that so right now we got hello
world is the text so this is a window
its backgrounds white I can change the
background to read kind of like we were
talking about in the in the first one I
can add instead of a label let's let's
you know let's change us to white
because it's a little difficult to see
now and then say we want to add a click
event
let's say breeds so let's do that
example that I had before message hello
closure west and then maybe we reformat
this a little bit more right so as you
can see I'm just I'm just writing code
I'm just writing code and it just shows
up in the simulator it it's like it was
mind-blowing the first time that I did
this because I if you're a mobile
developer and say your iOS celebra which
again remember I'm not it seems like
what you have to do is shut down the
simulator and restart it every time and
granted there are options in Swift and
and and potential avenues where you can
go with this but this is a real this is
this is this is a real way to that I've
built these apps that I'm about to show
you and that's basically in a nutshell
right I can get a little bit more
complex with things like he can add
animations you can say let's add say we
want we want to when we click on it we
actually want oh you know what I didn't
even show you guys that when you click
on this this thing happens okay so great
hello closure Wes so and say yeah yeah
and then instead of when instead of
popping this alert box let's like make
it like fly off the or let's make it
animate up to the top and like bounce
around a little bit right so I've got a
so it's too we've got the label here
let's move this label to and let's
animate the
top position 20 like 10 and then spring
does it spring something well let's just
try that let's see if that works well
we'll see who I was not great let's see
what else we got here instead of a
spring animation we was just do an
animation I'm just label to the top
let's do a tener and so you can see that
you know like that first animation
didn't really work right and and I was
able to find out immediately you know
short turnaround time that one is a
little bit better but it's still kind of
stiff maybe we should add some using and
see what that see how that works maybe
we want to click on it maybe we just
want it to like start animating though
this is going to be rough on I got to
import got an import core a sink here
and this will be the last one because I
gotta I gotta move on here but it's
import so just imported core async and
instead of that I just want just at the
beginning the app on a weight like three
seconds or two seconds and then I want
to animate I want to animate this label
to the top right so let's just do
I had a go tune here and timeout two
seconds and then I'm going to see I
anime and actually I think I ready have
that here somewhere no see I animates
the label and top 20 right so I don't
know this going to work but we'll see oh
so it worked and that's half the fun not
knowing if it's going to work until you
try it anyway so that's probably enough
that's why enough of that as you can see
there's you know it's it's it's just
like easy to get in there and try out
new ideas you just try them and see if
they work you know you have to wait for
a long time you don't have to do any
heavy weight stuff you just get in there
and try it you know it's it's basically
a what we're used to on the web
enclosure for mobile app development so
those are really kind of like that's
really yeah not now a depth of that
example so sorry on second
how we doing over there ok and then
let's play that ok good everything look
good ok so let's look at some maps right
so i'm going to show you four apps here
maybe less because we're about to run
out of time but uh first one is a mobile
hipaa-compliant chat app I'm calling
Curie I used to do some health care
stuff and one of the problems was that
doctors and nurses and EMTs can't talk
to each other because it's illegal or at
least against regulations definitely you
heard it here first it's illegal for
those people talk to each other no it's
illegal for them to talk to each other
without the correct kind of security and
regulatory controls in place and so it's
a it's a very tough thing to do so I
thought hey why don't you play is that
playing okay sorry so sure yeah totally
yeah I totally change the password yeah
but this is a this is the full most
full-featured of all the absolute i'ma
show you right it's it took me about two
months it was the first one that I did
so it's kind of developing the tools
along with the app so it's a little
rough on that side it's got a durable
WebSocket connection which is which is
cross-platform it'll work on iOS Android
and the web it's got some DB interaction
it's got a cool onboarding process which
I think you're seeing right now calls
out the twilio sends you a text and then
you type in your code you know stuff
they were all kind of used to on mobile
camera will access you know photo upload
and and it's got some read receipts in
there so yeah how far along is it
it was played up how about this one you
telling me you tell me if it starts
playing no oh okay okay good so this is
feedback this is feedback it's a it's a
way to provide feedback on on mobile
experiences so you take a bunch of
screenshots and then you can kind of add
it annotate them in the app and and you
know you can send the people and they
can look them up on the web and stuff
like that this is a game that I started
working on called word search and the
slide ignore the list there because
that's all wrong but it's basically you
know it's like a word game right so word
search when you're a kid you would you
know select thing this one has the added
kind of wrinkle of collapsing the board
once you select a word creating you know
exciting new possibilities and now
they're not they're not well it's funny
you mentioned that because I was having
trouble debugging the what is a valid
word algorithm right and so one of the
things that was really cool about this
app is that it was tough to do it in the
simulator because I would have to like
restart the app you'll pick a bunch of
words and just to get back to the point
where I wanted to test and then and then
test that thing and if it worked great
if not you know it was like 10 or 20
second turn around time when granted i
could change the the code to just set me
up in that spot but since this is
closure script and since it's
cross-platform why don't why deny you
know i thought why deny use a larger
canvas right so i ported the code i mean
it took like it is like five or six
lines porter the code over to web is
gonna be really hard to see but but what
this is is all the possible states of a
game laid out on a single screen right
so instead of going through and like you
know touching all of them basically you
just put them all on the screen at the
same time and look at it make sure
they're they're good and enemy if you
take this this mechanism farther you
know one of the one of the pains for
mobile app development
and at least from a QA process is like
does this thing work on all our devices
right does it does this thing fit on all
our screens and you can buy you know for
iphones and you know 22 android phones
and then have this cool setup where you
just like you know you're like a
switchboard operator in the 1930s or you
could just render them all to the screen
right and visually check that that they
all work so this is a this is a database
i pulled off the internet of android
phone screen sizes and so i just pulled
that in in excel i didn't use Tom's
library but I should have and and just
like spit that into the into the layout
algorithm and just lay them all out
right so now I now if I make a change to
something I just checked this like dude
does it work on all the android phones
yeah and it takes you one second the
point of this is that there are some
really like when you break it when you
have a platform with the reach of
closure you can do stuff like this right
and it's just really really exciting and
then the last one so this is one that's
probably closest to production it's an
app store approval process right now so
it should be out sometime in the next
three months it's called end up is it
playing ok it allows you to create a
OneTouch to create a link for people to
track you on the internet right and so
you know the cool thing about this is
that it's like literally it's 533 lines
of code code on the front end it's 200
lines of code on the back end this is an
app that's going to be shipped to
production and I am considering charging
money for and and it's like less than
seven hundred lines of code it and so
yeah like I said it's going to be app
store soon so hopefully that will be
there for you to to to check out I'm
sorry Apple I didn't mean to imply that
process takes three months you're the
best seriously they are they are really
nice anyway and so that's that's
certainly that's the last demo I have
and that's kind of it unfortunately you
know I wanted to come today with hey
here's the github project hey go
download I hate play with it I just
couldn't get there it's closed though
and it's something that I need help with
right this is not something that I can
just build by myself especially if it's
going to become something that we can
actually ship apps with its if it's
going to be something that we can that
is a benefit to the community it's
something that I think that we're going
to need a lot of people to contribute to
to make it to make it really great so
yeah so wha you know hoping to have
something in the next couple weeks if
you want to be notified of that just
there's my twitter I'll probably send a
link out on that I'm ZK on github del
that might be a good way to do that too
and yeah that's my talk
thank you and yeah again thanks for
being here is are there any questions
yes yeah yeah yeah it's a great question
so the question is how did you know
there's some magic going on there when I
was saving and it was showing up on the
device how does that work so there's a
WebSocket server okay so where do I
start let's start on the start on the
back end so there's the closure compiler
right it's actually using the same
underlying technology the fig wheel uses
there's there's a project called closure
script build by the same author so that
does the compiling after the compilation
is done we track which files have
changed and then send that over a
WebSocket connection to the interpreter
running on the device right another way
look at this so device when I when I run
the simulator device starts up
immediately makes a web sock WebSocket
connection to the server and then from
then on anytime a file is compiled it
gets see realized and sent over to the
interpreter to be run it's a it's a very
similar experience to fig wheel right so
you've gotta start apps a function you
gotta stop function or actually fig will
have reload but there's a stop at
function start and stop functions that
that you do your setup and teardown in
so basically like that does that answer
your question cool anybody else yes
Oh on a production now I am NOT but more
because I'm I don't want to like I don't
I don't Apple would get really mad if
you did that and I really don't want to
piss them off that might work on Android
it's totally doable right and in fact i
wish i could show you right now but i
can literally load the app up on the the
app on my phone hit save here and it
changes on your phone because it's a
WebSocket server right and it's a
javascript interpreter running in your
app it's yeah so there's definitely
possibility there doable I dangerous
though right if you screw up a screw up
Oh deploy or whatever and kind of break
the core part of your app you're Sol but
yeah totally doable and it's actually a
lot of fun and o compilation modes boat
it works both with simple or none and an
advanced there's a little bit of a
performance thing there oh yeah
excellent question excellent questions
so I guess the way that I visualized in
my head is that it's kind of a sliding
scale right and a 1 / scale is the
amount of percentage of closure script
code in your in your app and the other
side as the percentage of native code in
your app i would think that games would
be more on the like more native app code
less closer script code personally I
haven't run I keep thinking I'm going to
run into a case where I think that's the
best way to do it I would say it's more
cultural right like if I you know like
at work you know we have Iowa great iOS
developers and so i would i would not
recommend this for them because they're
really good at writing native stuff but
if i was a positive start up getting
started using closure I could have one
developer do crime back in and mobile
Android and iOS like that's pretty
that's pretty compelling
does that answer your question yeah cool
yeah yeah I haven't run into I haven't
runs the case where I would use where I
would do native full native but I'm
pretty biased so yeah anybody else good
yes the way short answer yes long answer
is none that I was I wasn't able to
overcome without with minimal like
without having to do crazy stuff the way
that you want to structure these apps is
that any like any type performance stuff
you want to do as a native library right
and then you want to kind of control
that from the JavaScript side I do only
have a limit I mean these are the four
apps that are built with it right so you
know definitely might hit a wall there
at some point but kind of conceptually
there's nothing I can't think of a way
that that you couldn't get around
something like that by used by building
a native module for it somebody do two
more
yes yes that exactly i'm sorry i've been
horrible to repeating the questions so
the question is how does like is there a
way to write your own native code and
then expose that to the JavaScript side
the answer is yes and that's that's the
saving grace for this platform right if
there wasn't that mechanism then you
would be limited by what the titanium
people could put into their platform
yeah all right way else good all right
well yeah well thank you that's been
great yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
