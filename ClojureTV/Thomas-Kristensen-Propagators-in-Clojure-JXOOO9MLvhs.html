thanks for coming especially so early
after the conference party as I said my
name is Thomas Christiansen i work at
you switch in London where I get to hack
closure every day so I'd recommend it
the cognitive crew was kind of to let me
come here today and talk about a about
my experiences implementing a
declarative programming model in
enclosure the model I'm talking about is
the propagator model it's been handed
down to us from the slightly more
academic part of the list community
where we put a bit more applied here and
before we get going the sign remind
ourselves what declarative programming
is actually all about so one of the
articles that this work is based on
defines a declarative language as
something that requires only the
statement of relevance relationships and
the computation organization is
specified separately or performed
Wallace automatically that sounds a bit
abstract but some point stance you are
you're saying the what not the house so
we want to specify what we want to know
and we don't want you to you care about
how it's calculated so we're all touch
the sequel's brilliant example of doing
something to creativity in the closed
community there's a supreme well-known
recursive library out there mainly a
politic might roll Taylor out with it
it's big built on Kenan since described
in this spook the recent schema I'm
already seeing some hold on to this
conference I'm a lot fun hanging out
with co logic soft sexy the slide the
hard problem of solving an operative
puzzles logic puzzle it makes it much
more difficult in that now I had to
write a budget program to solve a logic
puzzle sir it's quite entertaining you
should definitely give it a go if you
haven't already touched quality
when you work with quadratic solve so
strange it's all star thinking too
difficult figure was going on there's
this metric box that you pour in your
constraints into and your soul have to
define your constraints using this
slightly different notation and social
seems like magic and stuff comes out
it's all very transparent model as such
so put put stuff into your magic box and
you pull stuff out with your metric mugs
it always felt like there should be some
easier way to define this stuff and just
sort of model my mind then I saw
Sussman's talk we don't know how to
compute it strange group last year year
before maybe you can find online and
interview it's great stuff and in that
he describes a model the propagator
model for doing declarative programming
but my sword main takeaway from this
thing is it's very important to be very
explicit about the Express ability of a
very trying to describe we're not only
trying to start the computer to do
something we also trying to describe
something super Future program is
looking at our code when we doing
closure programming we are very focused
on everything being very transparent we
want want mutable data structures we
know what's going on we shouldn't
shouldn't throw away that transparent
even doing declarative programming seems
good for waste should be able to reason
about the soul stuff so I dug down into
what this stuff was actually you can
trace it back to this article from 1981
it's called constraints such a system in
Anchorage for expressing almost directly
coldest descriptions and in this Sussman
and steel describe this is true for
modeling different relationships and the
main the main application in that paper
seems to be on modeling electrical
circuits and sort of figuring out what
is the current different places in the
circuit notice attacked and to use that
system as a eight ET tube and it's also
the main subject in steals PhD thesis
I'm starving to side real quick
hopefully which is called a dissertation
on research concerning the definition
implementation of a computer programming
language intended as a platform on which
degree
it systems for computer-aided design of
engineered optic space and constraints a
model for commutation combining a simple
declarative antics with a vivid
intuitive polarization as a network of
simultaneous x of physical devices
computing parallel without prejudice as
the direction of flow of data using
technique of local publication argument
by dependency directed backtracking
forward to sexting and this all in
global consistency stylist it's very
descriptive it's just exactly what it is
and some of the things we should pick up
this one is just like it said its
intuitive by this visualization it's
tough you have to this thing promises
you that you can see what's going on
right you should be able to inspect your
system figure out how come these values
are what they are how come the current
ears is one of this this this thesis in
the work was from a long-forgotten time
when people sat down and spent hours and
hours carefully hand crafting drawings
to model stuff and explain what's going
on this is the in terms of a clock and
see there's a different hierarchies
where the components work together
sometimes the sexy stuff that goes
across these heretical components very
fascinating stuff again you feel if your
modeling like physical systems she was
very interesting so after this working
out the winds of AI happened and didn't
really hear a lot about constraints then
in 2008 the Arthur propagator came out
it's a module and suspends paper
describing an extension or a new take on
the constraints publication model that
was described 30 years prior
and it's also the the topic of those
pasty thesis which has a fairly short
silence only publication networks a
flexible and expressive substrate for
computation like it's a the focus this
is more on taking this this propagation
model and is sending it with new value
types and then supporting wall general
computation I hope text again the
audience the Davis kind of to point him
out to me yesterday so thanks Dave it's
brilliant right so let's jump into what
propagators actually let's let's do the
sort of teaching technique of showing
you something you already know and
trying to stack the done to the new
stuff we're going on we're going to look
beyond quadratic I'm going to look at
this relation in figure out how can we
describe that in kinetic and what's the
same team described it in in propaganda
the park into library I've released for
closure so in politic news finite
domains and state that a new logical
variable P should be the product of a
and B the sum of P and C should be D and
anything us all start filling in numbers
here and when there's sufficient
information if we read out d will see
the deep comes 10 and actually if we
want to not the same thing as
propagators is the semantics are almost
the same we're stating that the product
of NPS upp some pc CBD and we add values
to these placeholders and as these are
declarative languages it doesn't matter
which way you shop with these
expressions on you're just setting up
constraints on your system and some
until you try to pull out information
large system that'll actually actually
matters which only did it so not the
same that the main difference is solved
under under the hood it's a this is how
this thing works so let's take a look at
our progress we're not going to explain
our quadratic works because that's to
our talk it's a super instead of a
quitter
soham propagators the main computational
unit is sales so a cell either hold on
to a value or hold onto no value so the
gray one does not want anything and the
green one result something and the
important thing is as soon as a cell
takes on a value that's that's the
that's what is going to happen once the
thing is Queen you know come anything
else than green I once a cell has a
value is to move home they're on the way
we put values into cells aside by just
setting it as you saw before or using
propagators so a propagator is a diamond
here that listens to one or more cells
and whenever the value of a cell is
updated the propagator is informed it
can then perform some sort of
computation and it can in turn set the
value of other cells which might trigger
another Papa Gator and so on so forth so
there's an extremely simple model costs
are some tricks to it but this is pretty
much all you need to understand so
pretty pretty simple stuff if we look at
this thing again XD propagators don't
have products and some rules in the same
way as quadratic does you have to put
them in yourself actually but luckily
it's icing quite simple you can use a
function for lifting a normal closure
function into a propagator so here we
define a new function plus which is
defined using the normal plus operator
this thing the first thing will return a
function that when invoked on three
cells say observe the two first cells
and always ensures that the product the
sum sorry it's in the the last one so
this ring will create a relation that is
propagated between these three cells
simple stuff minus works the same way
there's a bit of a trick in that if we
want to we don't want to care about
which cells were actually put values
into we need to make sure the durations
also go the other way we need to play it
backwards run the programs backwards
such a lunatic to do that we just go
just ensure that the symmetrical
relationship is there so put up two new
propagators to maintain that that cell
up there is this other cell- that's so
and so on and so forth right so no just
just free propagators to ensure that all
this is consistent all right right we
can do the same thing with product by
using no times and division and define
products if you go back to our example
from before that's all we need to set up
the racing scripts between these cells
that's all the code you need basically
put in the values pull out the values of
D and you'll be ten if you try to put in
a value of T that is not what the system
knows it is you just get exception and
the the system hasn't changed altered
state all right so yeah it's pee pretty
simple stuff so this this is the method
in which you sort of extend your
relations in the language try to you
take normal closure functions you just
lift them up to foggy the severe tight
and turning your own co logic functions
or relationships you will you'll love
this because it's so much easier ok some
of you have operators there's a
different way of extending these things
so you just extend extend extend
propagators / left in function is easy I
do but other box it only supports sort
of
basic basic social values and you can't
really do anything extremely interesting
what's interesting is is taking and
students start to find new values in
your system so when I said before that
once a silver screen would remain green
was actually actually selling bit of a
line so let's see what it means myself
we can define new values so let's say we
define a record type to find describe an
interval so the interval is something
described by a low number the high
number and all the numbers in between or
that's that's our int'l right now if we
this does an example you can do any case
typing two sets or maps or datetime what
everyone do if you have an interval in a
cell and we come home with the new
interval and try to put that into the
cell we are going to succeed if and only
if the intersection of the two intervals
is non-empty and if it's not empty the
new value of the cell is going to be
that intersection so here's three into
insoles see the intersection is the
first one here and that was successfully
getting to ourselves over two intervals
with the dmt intersection we're not
going to buy rent or sell stuff right
and we can define normal retina
combinations a desktop let's say the
product of two intervals is the part of
the lower limit of high limit so every
you take any number from the first
interval and multiply with any number
from the signal you'll get a non prevent
essential I pretty crazy stuff so now we
define your operator we can lift it into
a propagator I can start making some
some interesting interesting stuff so
this one good example from the altered
propagator I really like which is about
measuring building heights so going to
go through that real quick and hopefully
I'll give you an intuition about how how
easy is to set this stuff up so in the
parameter puzzle you're giving a
parameter so you won't know what the
parameters is for measuring atmospheric
pressure
we're going one of those we're given a
building and we asked to measure the
height of the building all right so you
have any idea how to choose that in
suggestions yeah yeah so we give it to
the caretaker the building and say could
you please tell me how tall this
building is peace that's one way that's
not the way we're going to do here
unfortunately so bribery is out of the
question another interesting way of
doing it we can we take up around sir
I'm going to take the elevator to the
top of the building you can hold the
perimeter or the edge of the building
let go and will plummet down to earth
and hit it the satisfying sound so if we
do that and we measure the time from
letting go to it's hitting the ground we
use that time to measure the height
light it's just a amount of space it's
reversed that's that time period it's
all the same so the same equation
yesterday in the vehicle example I just
just half the acceleration due to
gravity times x squared right easy easy
stuff we can we can quickly set this up
using our function from the vault
product and kinetic is just important
product so the full duration relation
states that the relationship between the
time and the height of the building is
basically will have up here like it's G
times one-half times T squared this is a
helper cell for holding that product to
the right we just set up all these
things when it comes to putting in the
gravitational force acceleration here we
put an intro on set because we don't
know what it will be where we all work
because this isn't the constant across
the earth again solid yesterday in your
talks brilliant it's just like you
perfectly off this one we don't know
what is we're going to model this
insurgency and say we know that is
somewhere between nine point seven eight
nine and nine point eight three two we
don't know what it is so we put in
intervals to bottle on certain see from
on our world and when we actually use it
going through the same thing again makes
themselves for holding
building heights in a full time we set
up the relationship just by calling our
function it's just functions I think
nothing special we measured the fall
time to be somewhere between 2.9 seconds
and 3.1 seconds because we're not that
accurate it does have a stuff much and
we've only human if we do that we put
into us into our thing we're getting
towards out like we know that the we got
the answer that the building is
somewhere between 41 and 47 which is
tall all right it's pretty it's pretty
cool interesting stuff is when we start
doing like other ways of measuring the
building guide using parameter so we
could bribe not going to bribe we could
could stand deeper I'm surprised it's a
small thing down here and look at its
shadow so the relationship between the
shadow of the perimeter and the height
of the parameter that ratio is the same
as the ratio between the building and
the building shadow by is just a model
of a building and its shadow it's
basically stating that like H prime the
hydrant of the browser is aspiring to
set off the perimeter time some ratio
some unknown ratio we don't know depends
on the time of day right where the Sun
is if it's if it's still light out and
likewise the height of the building is
80 times s times s times r where r is
the same ratio right because the same
time of day yeah pretty easy stuff we're
all you need to put it to a shop around
to the terms because we're using
declarative programming so information
flows both ways so you just say I just
need this relation to be true at this
relation to be true and the unknown here
is going to be the height of the
building this age but no that's just
somewhere here we don't really doesn't
even matter where you put it but that's
one of nice things about the cars
program it doesn't matter where you cut
your relationships as long as you define
all your relationships so here we just
have the HU and the last position and we
use it then we're going to put in some
uncertainty because even though without
on earth we might not be good at
measuring stuff might not be like good
at measuring height of this parameter
all the two shadows so we're going to
say that the building shadow is around
55 meters using SI units again
and the browser is about 30 centimeters
to 32 centimeters and the shadow at the
moment so is somewhere between 36 and 37
centimeters we put this in we get out
new height right cool it's not the same
as before so we have a new estimate so
what do you do when you have two
estimates are something you can reach
them or you can combine them line lab we
have two intervals the stuff we know the
intersection is going to be a better
semester to post of them and if we just
put in the two relationships the full
duration and the similar triangles
relation at the same time we get an
estimate that is better better than
either right just falls out implicitly
we're not being explicit about taking
intersection is just falls out of our of
the system we're building the
relationships with any putting in so
this is just to the code from before and
wondered statement before the fall time
estimated building heights be 41 s 47
meters and shadow length 4448 the
intersection is what we get out corey
force force em all right speak cool
stuff we didn't ask that but it's the
propagators automatically makes our
estimates better by revisiting values
and trying to take intersection of new
intervals or no again like it merges
them every time there's new interval it
merges them and alerts propagators and
once the system stabilizers it stops
doing it all right this is very cool
what we can't see because i haven't
uploaded value is that information flows
backwards in the system are without us
asking for it this information feedbacks
into original estimates right so we
estimated the height of this parameter
we estimate the time it took to fall
down the perimeter fence of the building
now that have a visitor estimate that
data can actually flow back into our
estimates and improve those so if we
read out the fall time the bremser
height we see that the fall time is now
like somewhere between 3 and 3.1 seconds
instead we've half hour our uncertain
see
and all of a sudden without asking for
it we get a better estimate from what we
actually put into the system SP that's
pretty cool just by adding known
information without doing anything so
let's make sense yeah yes miss a few
cool stuff is it cph be excited right so
now you can use of this whole stuff
modeling particular good modeling source
netiquette equations and doing doing the
stuff we saw yesterday with driving a
motor and measuring your system and
trying to fiddle with your with your
inputs it would be really well-suited
that's all stuff let's take a quick look
at how it's actually implemented so in
the original article two yarns are
propagated from 09 there is a scheme
implementation scattered around the the
article super straight read write and
the scheme implementation soft pasties
mutable values all over the place has
cells it goes and writes these cells if
you want to do something like that
enclosure you're going to resort to
something that is safe so my first
imputation of propaganda I used
references right so you have references
free celly cel holds onto a reference
and whenever you put stuff in there
you're doing a do sink and another
propagators solve my family system it
all happens in the STM whenever tries to
merge values that's what merch appears
it needs to have access to some function
to do so as you need to do a global
binding whenever you start doing all
this stuff it's a no it's not extremely
nice to be honest as a lot of downsizes
you have globally bound functions that's
not nice need to do stuff in a to think
but there's no there's no inherent thing
in this solution to stay said it's
rupiah then this technique the state's
it has anything to do with with software
transactional memory at all these cells
immutable I if you read them at some
point and you eat them again one second
later you have no idea if it's in a
stable state you have no idea what's
actually going on you can't see the
propagators like the propagators are
hidden somewhere once in while they
executed
in some magical cell somewhere and
there's no closure kept support right
because you're lying on lifts something
it's not very nice so I took the Tokra
saldi the theories behind this thing and
and gave a nice shot basically so we all
of us who do closure we know we know
that what we were looking for is
immutable stuff we don't want to have
like magical values floating on a system
it's weird everyone once served values
that we can hold onto and inspect and
play around so a more closure is way of
doing this would be to take take your
propagator system and make it into a
value right so instead the closures way
you just make a system and then you
start prodding at that system putting in
value is putting in propagators and then
pull out the values afterwards so this
means that the merge function is now
inside your system it's it's bound to
this thing it's not magical globally
global binding your propagators are
securely locked into that are not
floating around in some weird place new
program you don't need yesterday many
wine you can you just take your system
and I'm prod at it like no functions
noise TM is immutable it's an immutable
thing you can take snapshots of this
thing you can say at this point in time
my world look like this then I did some
stuff but at this point I'm it look like
this also having snapshots is actually
it was just naturally fall so I'll doing
this is actually like one of the major
things that I enjoy all of the
propagator the article is doing so
snappish everything and retracting facts
and putting them in again and trying out
different things it's a real hassle
strikes implemented but just falls out
naturally of doing like this if you have
a snapshot so trivial a sudden have to
be any work or sudden just to get that
if you if you want to do like exchange
stuff of course you just make a system
and and also that well if you need to
synchronize two systems at the same time
there is as possible and you can do this
thing but it's up to you do you want to
do that probably not forever you're
doing and if you try to provide it with
with inconsistent values like
before we know d is 10 we would try to
say ds9 you can exception the system is
still stable nothing is nothing bad has
happened it means you do experiments of
each of these blue circles is a stable
system you can take your system and try
and put in a value then at this point
you can try putting you know one
propagator here I maybe another
propagated here or maybe this is a value
and you so just recording what happens
you can always backtrack and start doing
doing other stuff right in experiment
and give you use of the opportunities
actually experimentally wrong with this
thing you can also get an audit trails
going on right we want this to be a
transparent process we don't want you
know a magical box to just go out there
do some calculations and give us an
answer this in this diagram the blue
circles or staple cool system swipe a
cool because they cool down there's no
inertia in them whereas if we put a
value in there we might actuate
propagators which makes an unstable we
made some hot might add new propagators
the need to be one first which makes
them hot but if we keep all systems
around like system values around and ask
the propaganda library to do this for us
we get an auditor I was actually going
on we can go back and inspect which
values were in which sells at what point
in time doing my calculation so stable
time if we so this is running in a bar
so this is a this uses enclosure scripts
in imitation propaganda which is
basically it's the same notation
actually to model the problem we saw
before so this is this is measuring the
height of a building using using
propagators see we start with putting in
the fall time here's at aldi suggest
putting in propagators building your
system without actually putting in any
values in there then you start putting
stuff in it comes on staple you put in
the fall time a estimate for the full
duration props up here on saw before I
lost my mouse we did and then it cools
down and it's ready for us to put in a
building shadow a parameter height and
then actually the parameter shadow gets
the first estimate like we didn't put in
this value up here oh by the way the
span of these it's a range of the
interval so it's scaled to all our sins
holders
we didn't put in that branch each other
up there that just magically appeared
and we had no idea before we actually
started looking into the audit trail
having an auditor is super awesome I we
didn't we didn't know that it needs to
put this in we did no put in a more
refined value up here which in turn
gives us a better building height liston
it and then in turn gives the best
estimate for a full timer its height a
bound on the fall time of you know what
i was doing anything and you can inspect
when this happens and we can you know
branch out where any of these things and
try doing other stuff sweet so you
should be asking yourself now okay so I
know CoreLogic and just there's this
nice cool thing coming on called
propagators what are the difference is
actually I what's the pros and cons of
doing these these things so I'd say
Kohler is great at modeling discrete
stuff so you're trying to model a budget
passo or some sort of set of ancestral
relationships or an entrance system or
something like that it's great that
store stuff can be quite painful to do
athletics in it I think and most of the
stuff I do is metic so for doing it this
way on the other hand program is really
really bad at doing discrete stuff it's
not McDonald's the very bed was stunned
alias intuitive to model logical puzzles
in it you need to start merging sets and
it becomes quite hairy or I can do your
own backtracking algorithm which can be
solved Harry collage Acastus opaque
efficient search algorithms is quite
good at doing a breadth-first search and
giving us nice result extremely quickly
but you know if you if you're not bird
or Nolan you have no idea was actually
going on and then is just adjust this
magical box that put stuff in a magic
comes out and go run it backwards
whereas the public and the model is it
means it's very intuitive very easy to
reason about and it's very easy to
inspect what actually went on at each
step in the calculation and values
applegate around from cells or cells so
on the other hand it's not incredibly
efficient like
because there's no there's no decisions
made to avoid running propagators that
might not have any effect if you there's
no scheduling mechanism for removing
propagators that are queued for
execution if they're not if they don't
really make a difference it might be
interesting to look into so I'm not I
didn't come here to to persuade your
from not doing quadratic stuff oh my
objective was to show you this other
declares his stuff than the logic
programming out there and propagate is
just one of them does like a multitude
of Java libraries for doing constraint
programming and if your if your problem
you're trying to describe in your
everyday work if it's very difficult to
actually model that using core logic but
it's all luck slike a thing that declare
to program would be good at maybe just
using the wrong tool like maybe if
you're if you're doing mathematics or
stuff like this maybe you should look
into a different declarative model that
would be better suited for for modeling
the stuff you're working on don't throw
away core logic but body horizon and try
try some other stuff also there's a lot
of academic work out there I just I just
stole this work I just went out and read
the scientific article and found
anticipation set down implemented stuff
without having to come up with all these
ideas right that's a lot of stuff out
there and this is story hook before this
if you if you read our tubes out there
and if you try to make them in your own
scheme or closure in a new and exciting
way maybe stuff for South that I we got
an audit trail for free we were able to
do experiments we have to do all these
cool things we're able to run it in a
process where like of course that you
can all this client side you don't have
to actually deployed anywhere and and
all these situations like that they've
written for people like you like people
who do programming as a living right and
doesn't assume any prior knowledge it
goes through all the basic steps you
haven't going and when you use closer
just to give you hit leverage you get
all these in google data structures for
free you get extremely and extremely
supportive community as well yeah this
sir it's pretty awesome so as I said
this is this is a library that's out
there now it's called propaganda it runs
on the JVM and once enclosure script
there's a couple of tutorials for
setting up this building hi problem with
intervals but is that you can use any
taste up you can use sets where when you
merge two values is just intersection of
the sets for example this one way of
interpreting that we can use more exotic
data types you can use like Joe daytime
and interval so to do that's s all stuff
and there's a couple of tutorials for
that out there as well so go out have a
look yeah let's look at that and this is
my twitter handle thanks
we have plenty of time for questions so
except from you of course yeah yes yes
it runs all the directions you like like
you are in our exam like if you already
knew the building height if we started
out with with bribing someone using a
parameter and we didn't want to
sacrifice our precious Persephone and so
by dropping in from out there but you
still want to know what the fall time
was you just putting that information
and read out the full time instead just
don't don't put values into the stuff
you want to know about and see what
falls out yeah exactly yeah and does
matter which order you specify these
constraints you just you know put in the
stuff you know and see if anything falls
out if you haven't put in enough
information the system will tell you I
don't know what's in itself because you
haven't told me enough stuff for me to
derive anything about this value the
whole time it is put in you know the
height as well otherwise this otherwise
this so it's just going to be empty so
it's you know CoreLogic both ways yeah
yeah it's good question so the question
is what's the most significant problem
I've applied this to so the moment you
know spin I mainly use it as a toy but
we're looking into doing some back
calculations in some fairly hairy so I
made it I work for you switch my way we
price comparison side and sometimes you
want to put in you don't know how much
how many kilowatt dollars you use for
years you just want to put in your
current plan and your usage and see what
falls out as I see some quite hairy
computations because you're so lying to
you have model goes one way it's very
easy to coverage how much your energy
bill is going to be based on how many
kilowatt hours you have but the other
way backwards is quite difficult now we
only need to model it like forwards and
we can get that out backwards and we can
use our model both to estimating your
new price and extracting the hours you
used on your old chair so that's a solid
sinner in the plants is a flying insects
or stuff yep yeah
yeah so the question is on any
situations where there's no convergent
co-sponsor infinitely that does happen
you need to need to be careful this old
stuff if you are if you're doing stuff
that keeps converging and it just
consumed and you just get rounding
errors that makes it a that never
converges that that can happen right so
you need to need to look in links in
supposed to figure out if your model
means false we can see numbers regard do
I need to terminate whenever something
is in within an epsilon border of course
something or you can just use if you use
big decimals or fractions you can you
can curran reduce doing that instead but
yeah that can't happen yeah but it tells
you about something such a yeah there's
no convergence here yeah yeah that's
good so the question is is this is
possible to not refined enormous going
backwards so yes or so dr. efficiently
yeah if so actually you you would like
to be informed that that you put in
information to assistant that is in
conflict but what's already there right
you're like to actually get an error
there I would have hoped because if you
put information that contradicts was
already there please please let me know
right so it's from not decipher but you
can you can't put in like constant
public Gators to just always ensure this
cell as this value and owned this value
this is as possible or doing your
customers like you can extend it with
this with I owned by you types you could
define a value type of this this radio
type cannot be altered I never talk too
much anybody type with it just blows up
right that is quite a useful trick yeah
good question
so we're happen if you have a circle
relationship so these propagators are
going to be alerted every time something
happens right every time a value changes
from the existing that you to a new
value if the value does not change to a
new value there's a reason to alert any
propagators because it can't possibly
influence the system anyway so circle
relationships are safe basically right
if you have a circle and comes back and
tries to put the same menu into the same
cell again you know stop using to
evaluate any propagators is fine just
just stop your your propagation so don't
worry won't blow up doing that look that
particular thing will not blow it up
yeah cool yeah one last question maybe
yeah yeah
so lazy evaluation ourselves as
interesting and for that you you would
be able to merge delay but you wouldn't
even get a stable system than the
concepts or breaks down you can treat
your system and then for anything about
it because you have no idea what the
public is going through influence when
they actually check out later without
having some inferiority assumptions
about your system
that the might might be but you know
without route in an explicit model of
which propagators influence which cells
it's not possible to infer that
knowledge and basically do this you
could just queue up the work of course
we should run in science and reading
anything and then execute all upon read
but on that I don't see any way of doing
that so sorry alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
