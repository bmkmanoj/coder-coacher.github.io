Bureau closure in Catalonia I'm here to
talk to you today about closure bridge a
project with the aim of widening
exposure to the closure language and
recruiting more people to the closure
community my name is Ali King and I'm a
developer in the data team at fanjul the
market leader in online daily fantasy
sports which is something that's bigger
than America than it is here I'm also
involved in coding education and
diversity initiatives in Edinburgh where
I live including your geek Scotland and
learn tech Edinburgh an informal learn
programming group and I serve on the
board of the closure bridge organization
and help mentor event organizers so what
is closure bridge closure bridge is one
day coding workshop aimed at introducing
women to programming enclosure the
workshops are free to attend with the
venue refreshments and any other
requirements covered by sponsors there's
also an install festive event the
evening before so everyone can get set
up so they don't spend the actual
workshop code so they spend the actual
workshop coding and not troubleshooting
although the principal target audiences
women some workshops have a policy that
men and welcome to attend if they do so
as a guess of a woman and the aim is to
cover the main concepts of the closure
language and have the learner write a
small application by the end of it we
also hope that they enjoy this enough to
continue learning closure after the
workshop has finished and join closure
communities in their location and/or
online the workshops are organized by
people from the local tech community but
the workshop format and contents adil
developed collaboratively and shared
internationally among all workshop
organizers before going any further I'd
like to say a bit about diversity as a
concept most diversity efforts focus on
women because they're the largest most
obvious group which is underrepresented
in programming communities they half the
population and this is pretty consistent
wherever you are and they usually easily
visually identify it and although the
workshops so far have been aimed at
getting women programming and clay
they can be targeted towards any other
groups which are underrepresented in a
local closure community this might mean
minority ethnic groups the LGBTQ
community people with disabilities or
from economically deprived backgrounds
some workshops have included gender
queer and gender non-conforming people
specifically in the entry requirements
as well as people who identify as women
and it's also an option to target one
group and encourage applications from
people who belong to multiple work
marginalized groups and many of the
workshops have explicitly specified that
trans women are welcome and some other
feminist organizations and events have
not been inclusive of them in the past
and for the remainder of this
presentation I will be mainly referring
to women post both trans and cisgender
and but much of it is applicable to
other groups in September last year the
first closure bridge event in Europe
took place in a dress code base at the
UK's largest technology incubator not
the prettiest building but full of great
tech startups and with a pretty
spectacular view of the castle we talked
20 women to programming closure with the
help of volunteers from the local tech
community and support of our sponsors
the event was organized and promoted
through girl geek Scotland part of the
International gilgit dylan's network and
if the first time we'd run a coding
workshop but using the organization's
network and financial setup helped
enormously in promotion and handling
expenses and we receive financial
sponsorship from github Scotland is
which is the industry body for the IT
industry in Scotland an entrepreneurial
spark which is an incubator accelerator
program NCR and Scott logic and code
base gave us a venue free of charge and
we were also able to give everyone who
attended lisp cast videos and copies of
si si be distilled curtains courtesy of
Eric Norman and Tommy hall and Anna
Solley souvenir tote bag full of goodies
from the sponsors and organizing and
other organizations and supporting women
in tech and I think one of our helpers
of the
owns and chris is currently modeling one
of these bags I hadn't run a daylong
coding coding workshop before and I
wasn't hugely experienced foreclosure it
was a matter of enthusiasm over
experience but I spoke to people who
knew more about these things and put the
word out set up a Twitter account and
people hadn't known previously step
forward to help out with organization
sponsorship and teaching so if I can do
it so can you so how did I get involved
with all this in august 2013 i attended
a one-day conference in edinburgh called
mostly functional which was
unsurprisingly about functional
programming and it was my first real
exposure to the topic by the start of
the next year i started learning closure
and in march 2014 i attended an event
called closure launchpad a one day
introduction to closure programmers
already at proficient in the language is
this was great but like the conference
before it I was one of only a couple of
women attending and I spoke to the
organizers afterwards and suggested
running a workshop targeting women and
they agreed this was a great idea I
looked online and discovered that
closure bridge already existed as a
concept which was fantastic because I
didn't have to write a provide
everything from scratch and and a few
months later I found myself organizing
one these motivations turns out to be
exactly the same reasons that Sarah
Allen and Sarah Mae founded railsbridge
in 2009 the attended Ruby events and
conferences in their local area and
found that they were very frequently the
only women there and decided to do
something about it Bell's bridge was
originally a series of free one work one
day workshops in the Bay Area teaching
women beginner programmers to build web
applications using the Ruby language and
the rails framework from the workshop
guidelines and bridge the gap from an
aspiring developer to contributing
community member through mentoring
teaching and writing we also bridge gaps
across communities between people who
have access to tech and skills and
people who do not between people who
feel excluded and
people who live and breathe this stuff
with joy it was successful in bringing
more women into participating in the
Ruby community and soon expanded across
the world I attended a railsbridge
workshop in edinboro in 2013 which was
organized to currency coincide with
Scott ruby conference and the
railsbridge format started spreading
into other languages in areas and so the
bridge foundry was set up as an umbrella
organization and so closure bridge was
born the first ever closure bridge was
organized by Bridget Helia in april 2014
in durham north carolina carolina and
this was followed very quickly by ones
in san francisco brisbane australia and
minneapolis and then after a couple of
months break than there were there were
more including one in edinburgh and in
jun 2015 we're running currently at 15
workshops with the 16th due to be held
this weekend and in in minneapolis and
17th in a couple of weeks in berlin for
march on was ravaging me to a month
worldwide as you can see from the map
the european ones have been mostly in
Northern Europe the UK Germany and
Scandinavia there a couple more UK ones
bit currently being planned in
Manchester and Bristol and I was going
to first show of hands but I can't
really see very well in a light sea of
it and I know there are some people here
who have been involved in in closure
bridge workshops before could you
possibly raise your hand and make a bit
of noise perhaps yep I can see it won't
ever see yeah there's yep
yep it's great to see and and so so we
have some people who run them before and
as you can see for the map there was
plenty of countries that are still
currently uncovered so want to ask for a
bit of more audience participation and
so I just want to ask what country are
people from and so who is from Catalonia
and Spain race out hands yep got a few
there France yep good for you and let's
see Poland yeah there's a few poles are
up and Italy yep okay and so that's a
that's a that's a good start and I'm
sure that there are people from from
plenty of other countries too and so um
I think that that's a very good possible
is it you could be running a closure
bridge workshop in the near future so
since the rails ridge in 2009 and there
have been several similar international
initiatives running workshops to attract
more women to specific programming
communities rails girls were started in
Helsinki in 2010 and currently runs
around five to ten events a month
worldwide railsbridge runs events at a
similar rate it had to be more us
focused in terms of locations where as
real skills and possibly because it
starts outside the US has more presence
in the rest of the world and Django
girls was launched last year and had has
had over 40 events the date again with
good geographical reach and what's worth
bearing in mind when comparing closure
bridge to any of these is that they all
sprung from larger longer established
communities and although rails dates
back to see wassup 2004 ruby goes back
to 1995 and python began in 1991 and
that both Python and Ruby 0 in the top
10 programming languages in use by most
measures which means a lot of developers
to choose from who might organize or
help out as a workshop and considering
closures current situation in terms of
community sighs I think we're doing
pretty well so far
although obviously a local of the sea
closure bridge except expand much
further it's well as established that
women are underrepresented in the tech
industry particularly in engineering
roles functional programming has
historically had lower female
participation than many other
programming fields and perhaps due to
functional programming academic routes
people have a perception of being a bit
dry more mathematical than other
varieties and so therefore really hard
and complicated and I'm not really sure
if it's applications and benefits and
functional language communities also
have a reputation for being hostile to
beginners and where people ask questions
and and I told to rtfm or have people
answering the way that underlines their
inexperience and this can be
tremendously is deterring for anyone
starting out on the road to gaining
programming knowledge and women are more
likely to be assumed by default to have
less technical knowledge and be
challenged to prove their programming
credentials and when you add into this
impostor syndrome and it's easy for
someone to believe that maybe they're
not cut out for this and go and spend
their time elsewhere if we as a
community want to expand our membership
we need to examine our behavior for
anything which might needs us needlessly
drive away people who want to contribute
at closure bridge Edinburgh we
introduced a set of social rules used by
hacker school in New York which runs an
immersive program to help programmers
all levels improve their skills it's now
renamed to their weaker Center partly
because students arriving from abroad
telling us emigration that they were
visiting to attend hacker school didn't
go down too well the these rules are not
designed to be strictly applied but to
allow people to gently point out when
someone is engaged in unhelpful behavior
so they can avoid it in future they
could be applied to in any group
learning setting which would cover most
closure meet of events feign surprise me
here means a put-down of someone's
knowledge or abilities freeze in a way
that suggests they should have a great
experience for example I can't believe
you don't know what a monad is
and well actually is where in response
to someone's largely correct statements
the speaker lays out in what
circumstances it would be incorrect
large is an excuse to show off their own
knowledge we also discourage backseat
driving giving someone unsolicited
instructions said of letting them work
out themselves and less obvious the
discriminatory comments and like you
know you code well for a girl there are
a bit these are behaviors that I'm not
much more about how that the speaker
feeling superior to the other person
than being helpful beyond any purposely
challenging behavior sometimes people in
a group can unintentionally exclude some
of their members this might be by
assuming that an experiences universe or
when it is not or drawing attention to a
difference this might be referring to a
mixed-gender group of programmers as
guys and recruiting foreclosure guys or
telling someone that it's really unusual
to meet a woman programmer I think we
already know and this could also trigger
what's known as stereotype threat where
they will perform worse because they're
anxious about conforming to stereotypes
and they're being less competence if
you've seen that that's XKCD cartoon you
suck up math Gil suck at math it's
basically that feeling that people's
opinions on the group to which you
belong will be confirmed and their hopes
let down because you you're having a bit
of a mental block solving a problem then
there's the continual continual cases of
mistaken identity is common for people
with tech events to make incorrect
assumptions about what you do I've lost
count of the times I've been assumed to
be a marketer recruiter or other non
technical roles it's also particularly
common for black and latina women to be
mistaken for an administrative custodial
or catering staff I used to be involved
in a running club when I lived in
Glasgow
like many tech groups it was majority
male with a smaller number of women
attending one night we had several new
women joining us and they opted for the
shorter distance groupers who were
relatively new to running and so the
drug leader in charge of the group led
us away we crossed a footbridge over the
motorway into a poorly lit park in a
slightly dodgy area of Glasgow and we
didn't have many lights between us I
felt slightly on edge and I imagine that
the new runners were were failing even
more so and with a bunch of people they
didn't know in the dark in some weather
they probably wouldn't hang around and
particularly since women often told to
avoid yes or get going around out at
night was for obvious reasons the group
leader had chosen the street because he
was fine with it ran it all the time but
hadn't considered that others might not
be as comfortable he recognizes him safe
and we agreed not to run that route
after dark and future your comfort level
in this situation is not the same as
everyone else's and situations and
comments that you and the existing group
are happy with can still be off-putting
for newcomers with a different
experience in life so how welcoming it
is your closure community everyone who
is a member may be happy with things as
they are but anyone who isn't anyone who
isn't comfortable with the situation and
probably either than stick around or
didn't join in the first place it's easy
to assume that people in a group with
one thing in common enthusiasm for the
closure language for example will share
the same values sensitivities and
behavioral norms however this is often
not true and some people may do and say
things intentionally or unintentionally
which make others uncomfortable this is
where a code of conduct comes in useful
this lays down what is considered
inappropriate behavior and how any
situation of this nature will be dealt
with I can make people who are concerned
about things like sexual harassment and
feel safer it's great to see that this
conference has a code of conduct
and closure bridge events use the bridge
foundries code of conduct and circulate
this to people participating it can be
difficult to reach out to the people who
aren't in the room and to you know who
aren't coming to your meetups to find
out why but if you're able to get their
input perhaps through an anonymous
survey this can help with identifying
areas you can improve to make the group
more inclusive that way you can maximize
the game of any work to recruit more
diverse people to the community and by
making them more likely to feel
comfortable and valued and stick around
a lot of coding education initiatives
aim to get the learners producing
websites in the shortest possible time
this often involves the use of
frameworks and minimal use of the
language holding everything together it
look it also means that learners spend
more time grappling with the
architecture of these frameworks then
learning the mental modeling of problems
and thought processes crucial crucial to
grasping the essence of the language
closure bridge is not meant to be a boot
camp at all but a day spent hopefully
igniting the learners interest in
programming enclosure in functional
programming and programming more
generally many closure developers are
well experienced in other languages and
so know well that closure is a joy to
programming compared to what they've
used before however when you're
encouraging people new to programming to
give it a try they don't have the
necessarily the same frame of reference
you know if you tell them about
concurrency and you know Java libraries
and things then they don't really see
why they should care I asked about this
in the closure bridge mailing list and
this prompted a lively discussion why
should someone spend time learning
closure is it the first language they
should learn is it the only one the main
answers people put forward were word is
its bonds so it doesn't have hangovers
from previous architectures like say
cedars there's not a lot that you have
to learn in terms of keywords and syntax
so you can get going very quickly
functional programming is arguably
easier to grasp than object-oriented
programming and so if you're learning at
first then that's that's a good thing
closure is best known for running on the
JVM but there's also closure CLR for.net
architecture closure script and and
close your Android as we had the
presentation about yesterday and and
lastly the repple a simple interface
that gives you immediate feedback and
allows you to build a program
iteratively on whether it should be a
first language closure was not designed
specifically as a teaching language and
it has some features which make it it
let's begin a friendly for example what
happens when there's something wrong
with your code you a java strats that
trace which is not the most helpful
thing for someone who's genuinely new to
programming my opinion is that people
should learn it alongside of the
languages to absorb the functional way
of thinking and then when they realize
how much better is the languages then to
switch over to it as a as a main
language if if they're able running a
closer bridge event can be a great way
to energize and grow your local closure
community and it's something anyone can
do you can become an organizer of a
closure bridge workshop in your town or
how to do that in a minute and if
someone's already organizing an event
near you you can volunteer to teach at
one it's really good for improving your
own understanding of programming
teaching other people to program and if
your company has a budget to sponsor
tech events you can support a closure
bridge workshop financially and and the
bridge boundary also now has a central
funds to and to help run events in
locations which aren't tech hubs will
find that harder to and to get
sponsorship so I think you can you can
contribute to to that to kind of you
know
put your contribute in the more
distributed way and if you have ideas
about what and how we teach at closure
bridge you can also contribute to the
curriculum on github there's a
particular challenge in running
diversity programs where there is a very
low existing participation rate from the
local from their target group the idea
would be to have the workshop run
largely by by women doing organization
facilitation teaching and so the
students have lots of role models there
however it isn't always possible to find
many women clothes Arians in every
location so it's a bit of a chicken and
egg situation you know it's kind of why
we need closure bridge because we don't
have its of it enough women and people
from other minority groups in the
community and so in this in this case
then of the women that you are able to
and to recruit then use them well and
make sure they're in key roles so that
the students can conceive them and yes
see them as a role model and you and
feel that closure is for them and ask
women who have experience of other
languages if they'd be interested in
learning closure so you know someone
with who's a recently experienced
programmer should be able to pick up the
basics of closure enough to teach in the
workshop and fairly quickly so i think
various closure bridge workshops have
had good success with recruiting former
and former women women from the veil
spiritual workshops and invite women
closure experts from nearby cities
paying their transport costs course or
time the event to coincide with a
conference where when lots of great
programmers will be in town the
railsbridge eventless i attended in
Edinburgh was timed to coincide with
Scott Ruby and so it meant that there
were lots of great Ruby programmers who
could come and
teach it and then go to the conference
the next day and also we hope that
people run multiple events so i know
that particularly minneapolis are about
to hold their third event and if this is
the case if there's going to be kind of
a regular thing that it means that you
can recruit women who learnt closure at
a previous workshop and bringing them in
as as teachers at the next one if you're
interested in organizing a closure
bridge workshop your first stop is the
organizing repo on github and here you
can find guides covering all aspects are
putting together an event and you can
get an idea of what to expect and what
to plan for and it's also the google
group way you can join in a discussion
with others and once you let us know you
you're planning a workshop will put you
in touch with a mentor someone who's run
a workshop before we can show you the
ropes and you may think you don't need
this of course if you're very
experienced at running coding education
events and but it's still helpful to
have a designated point of contact if
you have any queries and something worth
mentioning is the importance of running
training for your teaching volunteers
the training session for the teaching
assistants TAS as we tend to call them
for short and takes place usually a few
days before the event this covers how to
interact with the students and making
them feel comfortable and capable and
not afraid to ask questions and it also
looks at how to tell when the pace of
the workshop isn't right for people so
picking up on your body language and
things like that to you know when people
aren't properly engaged it's
particularly useful if as is often the
case your teaching assistants are
programmers without professional
teaching experience it's also good
particularly for men who don't have
experience of diversity work as it helps
them identify behaviors which might have
an unintended negative effect on
students the discussions around could be
a real eye-opener for people who who are
well-intentioned but hadn't considered
the effects everyday language can have
the teaching to the teacher training
materials we're using currently are
borrowed from railsbridge but we welcome
it if anyone was willing to fork them
and add more closure specific contents
so what does a closure bridge in full
swing look like and here's a photo from
the first closure bridge event in San
Francisco in me last year and here's the
most recent European one that saw
Lincoln in Germany less than two weeks
ago there's another one coming up in
Berlin and a couple of weeks and the
organized a the organizers have been
working together to coordinate and share
resources in order to maximize the
likelihood of workshop attendees
continuing to learn the programming
enclosure ensure that they have
information about the sources of support
available mailing lists and Google
Groups slack teens and local meetups
foreclosure and programming more
generally and it's also a good idea to
have a feedback survey so you can figure
out what could have been done better the
organizing materials are continually
evolving based on the experience of
people involved in running workshops
there's also ongoing discussion through
mailing lists and chat channels so that
we quickly get feedback on what works
and what didn't go down so well the
initial curriculum turns out to be a bit
too long to get through in a day and the
end application which involve getting
data from the World Bank API was not
that engaging to some learners we've had
better results with a new curriculum
which involve involves drawing using the
quill library if you're interested in
more details on this and how you're how
and why we change the curriculum Yoko
Harada did a great talk on it at closure
west which you can find on youtube the
main aim of closure bridge workshops is
to improve the diversity of closure
events there's also a knock-on effect
that even if the learners don't continue
with closure as their main one of their
main programming languages the
functional thought processes they've
learned will stay with them and they
might come back to the language later
another benefit of closure bridge events
is the energy and community links they
generates when I started looking for
people interested in helping with
closure bridge in Edinburgh I was taken
aback by the enthusiasm of the
volunteers and sponsors coming forward
to make the event happen we didn't have
a regular closure meet up in Edinburgh
prior to the event but the workshop
volunteers and other enthusiasts step
forward to make it happen and I also met
some my current work colleagues through
closure bridge and we now host the
Edinburgh closure ians meet up at fanjul
now you may think that running courses
to teach people closure and increase the
diversity of the community is a very
noble and altruistic thing to do you'd
be right of course but there is another
benefit at the moment many of the
closure enthusiasts I know our
programming and something else and their
day job and I think I've spoken to a few
people here who are in this in the same
boat votes in the and I'm currently
working on getting closure into my into
my job so one of the key factors in
choosing technologies a company uses is
how easy it is to find developers able
to work with them so making a concerted
effort to create more closure
programmers and makes it easier for
companies to hire closure programmers
which makes them more likely to use
closure which means more closer jobs
this in turn provides an additional
incentive for more people to learn
closure because they can get a living
out of it this is already happening of
course as part of the natural adopts
adoption cycle of a programming language
and however it is in your power to
accelerate this process to help more
closure programmers to live the dream
for more information check out the
closure bridge websites and
organizational github and the google
groups mailing list and i'm also happy
to chat with anyone who's interested in
organizing in events it's great to meet
so many people from all over europe and
beyond and does anyone have any
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
