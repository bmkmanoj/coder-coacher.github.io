someone's having trouble getting their
computer connected so I don't want to
take any time at all on that role
because I think people are here to to
get the content and get the real people
I will try to say insulting things about
people while they're getting set up
though so just to get started this is
Stewart Sierra he is not the tallest
Stewart in the closure community he's
capable of writing a closure book but
not without help from someone else and
I'll let him take it from there
thanks Stuart
and are you gonna take you have one
I'll keep this I can actually just
interject additional insults and
comments yes so I have a mic is it on
alright fantastic
first try alright good morning everyone
welcome to closure cons number two so
you're here at the cons in Raleigh I'm
going to assume that you have read all
the closure books out there that you
have done every exercise on foreclosure
you have a million points on
stackoverflow you spend 12 hours a day
on IRC you might even have dyed your
hair blue and after all that you've hit
a brick wall you're wondering what's
next what is the next cool thing I can
do or learn about or experiment with
enclosure that's going to melt my brain
blow my mind and just make me fall in
love with it all over again and I have
no idea but I'm gonna try to give you in
this talk some ideas for new things to
explore things you can try out and areas
of closure you might be familiar with
might not be familiar with new things
that you can check out and with each
section a handful of project ideas for
things you might want to try work on
talk about I don't have any context or
background on these other than
suggesting them so these are just ideas
for you to take as a starting off point
number one the reader the reader is what
makes a lisp a lisp the fact that we
have a reader and a printer so you
probably know that the reader and the
printer together can form a simple
serialization protocol you can take any
data structure and print it to a string
save it on disk somewhere and then read
it back you probably also know that
there are two printer functions in
closure the PR function which prints
things for consumption by the reader
consumption by a computer and the print
function which prints things for human
consumption later in fact they're both
the same they both have the same
mechanics underneath the only difference
is the per function binds print read
ibly to true when print read ibly is
true then you get stuff printed that
when read back will be equal to the
thing that you printed so print prints
things with no guarantee that you'll be
able to read the thing back PR prints
things guaranteeing that the thing you
print when you read it back will be
equal to the thing you printed but it
will only be equal it will not be
identical it might be a slightly
different type for instance that map
there could be read in as an array map
or a hash map if this other special var
print dupe is true then you are
guaranteed you will get exactly the same
type back that you printed now in order
to make this work there's a little trick
in the reader the hash equals reader
macro this is the secret backdoor into
the closure reader anytime the reader
encounters this it will evaluate the
expression inside actually compile it
and evaluate it and insert the return
value into the stream of what it's
reading so it's a backdoor here I've
evaluated an expression and that becomes
part of the thing that was read now of
course there may be situations where you
want to read a piece of closure source
from a trust a source that you don't
necessarily trust or a source that you
don't know if it's correct so in that
case use read eval to make sure that the
reader will not obey the hash equals
reader macro that ensures that reading
is safe and free of side effects so
these are the three basic VARs that
control how the reader and the printer
works and notice you do have to choose
you can use print dupe to get the exact
same type with the exact same metadata
before and after reading and printing
something or you can have read eval set
true or set false to ensure that reading
is safe
you can't have it both ways the other
thing you can do with the printer is
extend it to new types enclosure
enclosure cord up core print you will
find these two methods print method and
print dupe they're very similar they
both dispatch on the type of an object
and print method is called for normal
printing print and PR print dupe is
called when print dupe is true
frequently they will be exactly the same
so if you look enclosure source code at
core underscore print you will find lots
and lots of these method definitions for
lots of different types including a
bunch of prefer method declarations to
ensure that even if something implements
two interfaces as most things enclosure
do that you can actually print it as you
want it to be printed so you can add
these methods for your own types other
Java classes things you want to be able
to print and read back so where this
gets interesting is when you can use the
reader in your program as a way to load
data without actually evaluating it as
code and one good way to do that is with
resources Java has a concept of resource
files packaged along with your source
code that are not compiled they are not
code if you're using maven they go in
one set of directories using line again
they go in a different directory but the
end result is they will be added into
the jar file or the war file or whatever
the target object your build is
producing then there's a function
enclosure enclosure Java IO called
resource that given the path to any
resource on your class path can return a
URL to that file the interesting thing
about the Java jar format although it's
not the most efficient compression
format it does have this ability to
address any file inside the jar with
random access so once you have that
resource URL then you can open it with
the reader function and get a reader
stream to read the text from that file
then you can wrap that in one extra
thing a Java IO pushback reader this is
a requirement in order to pass it to
closures read function read expects a
pushback reader IO reader returns a
buffered reader turns out you can't have
something that implements both so you
just have to wrap it in a push back
reader in order to read it once you do
that you can read and get the forms from
that file without evaluating them so
here I opened core dot C LJ as a
resource and read the first form from it
which not surprisingly is the namespace
declaration as an example of this I use
this technique in the tool that I made
to help set up configuration for
continuous integration test jobs on
closures build server so this is a
simple project it's on github and the
first thing it does when it is run is
load a resource file called CI data and
inside CI data I just have a big map of
input to this program that I wrote it's
in one map so that I can read it with a
single call to read it's a single data
structure and then I have some comments
explaining what it is I have a list of
versions and J decays to test and a list
of all the different closure contribute
in the new contribute including their
owners people who have permission to run
the builds and releases in Hudson so I
could have put all of this data in the
code I could have had just a big global
var somewhere that had this data
structure in it but I like the
conceptual separation that this gives
this says this is input to my program
this is not part of the code of my
program I also have one advantage that
this is not going to be evaluated it's
only going to be read so here where I
used strings for the user names I could
have just as easily used closure symbols
they're not going to throw any errors
because they're not being evaluated as
anything now one popular way to deal
with this kind of input data or saving
data as
is to use JSON but JSON is a vastly
inferior serialization format compared
to closure data structures I mean it's
very very limited JSON is certainly not
going away it is the base language of
web interfaces but when you have the
option of using closure data it's a much
richer set of types that you can work
with and define your data with so here
are some ideas things you can play with
you can write your own reader it's not
hard there is an example enclosure
script of a reader written in closure
and you can then change the behavior of
that reader to do something different
someone asked on the mailing list a few
weeks ago can I trigger it can I set a
flag in the reader to make it read big
decimals instead of doubles when I have
a floating-point number and the answer
was no the reader doesn't support that
but you could make your own reader that
does do that and then use it to read in
your input data for your program you
could play with Rito macros if you're
into that sort of thing the other thing
you can do is make readers and printers
for other data formats for example the
json library that i maintain for closure
follows the same api structure as the
reader and the printer so when you can
represent any other data source as just
data to be read in and data to be
printed out lots of programs get much
easier everything is just closure data
and all you're doing is transforming it
to one kind of text format or another
now the one thing I forgot to bring with
me was a water bottle excuse me
step2 extending interfaces extending
closure the language itself closure is a
language built on interfaces if you look
at the closure source code you will find
all of these and more written in Java
the interfaces that are the foundation
of the language and all of closures
built-in functions things like cons
Assos merge they're all implemented in
terms of these interfaces so if you want
to write your own data type your own
data structure that supports closures
built-in data manipulation functions you
have to implement these interfaces the
hard part is figuring out which ones so
for example if we take the class of a
vector and call ancestors on it we get
this huge set of interfaces and classes
that are the super classes of persistent
vector so this is a little hard to read
so I threw together a couple of small
functions to help this out don't worry
about the details of what this does
basically it finds all of these super
classes of a given class and then does
some looping around to print them in a
nice tree structure like this so here's
another example this is the inheritance
tree of persistent array map I've
highlighted the concrete classes in blue
and the interfaces in brown so if you
want to write your own data structure
that behaves like a map these are all
the interfaces you have to implement you
don't have to worry about the actual
concrete classes just the interfaces so
going from there you can figure out how
to implement these interfaces by looking
at the functions you want to support so
if we start with for example the
associate of the core data manipulation
functions in closure and we look at the
source code to it we see essentially in
the base case a single key in a value
this is calling a method in the closure
lang
aarti class it is calling RT Assos it
turns out a lot of the core methods in
closure are actually implemented in this
RT class in Java because they're part of
the bootstrapping for the language our T
stands for runtime by the way so if we
go and look at RT Java we can find the
associated and see how it works we find
ok it does some initial checking to see
if the collection is null and then if
it's not then it's just going to cast to
the associative interface and call the
assessment
so that's the third layer of indirection
we started with the closure a sauce that
called the RT a so smething and that is
calling the assessment of the
associative interface so then we go look
at the associative interface and we can
see how a sews has to work for data
structures we can see that something
that is associative also has to support
I persistent collection and I look up so
it has to support all those other
methods in order to properly support the
sauce but the associate itself is pretty
basic it takes a key and a value and
returns a new associative thing so as an
example of doing this a long time ago in
fact before the DEF type def protocol
syntax had been finalized I wrote some
code to do tuples tuples are fixed size
vectors they behave exactly like vectors
in every way but they only have a set
number of elements represented as fields
in a java class as a result they can be
in some situations more efficient than
working with lots of small vectors now
again the actual syntax for this won't
work anymore because the syntax has
changed but if anyone wants to dig up
this code and fix it to work with the
new def type syntax it would be a fun
interesting little exercise the
important thing is that tuples in this
case behave exactly like vectors there
is no difference between the behave
of vectors and tuples so if you want to
write your own data structure that
implements the built-in functions you
want to make sure that it has exactly
the same behavior in every case if it's
not doing the same thing as the built-in
data structures and it's not really
fulfilling the contract that those
interfaces imply so when you're looking
at implementing your own data structures
make sure that you're not just reusing
the name of a built-in function you
might want to do that but then you're
creating your own function with its own
unique semantics for your data structure
the idea with making your own data
structures that implement all of the
built-in interfaces is that you can
provide a data structure that is a
drop-in replacement for one of the
built-in data structures where the only
difference is perhaps some different
performance characteristics that make it
a better choice in certain situations
part three closure makes concurrency
easy so I want to make it hard again
actually closure has lots of great
features different data structures and
types for dealing with concurrency but
it's not the complete story there are a
huge number of things most of them under
the java.util concurrent package that
are really useful for dealing with
concurrency and offer you even more
options for how to design concurrent
programs one of the most common ones
that you'll run into is executor z--
this is the basis for the thread pools
that closure maintains her agents and
futures but you can create your own
executor z-- that have different
characteristics different ways of
allocating threads one of the most
useful I think is the scheduled thread
pool this allows you to create a pool
and then submit functions for it to run
either repeatedly at a specific time on
a schedule anything like that this is
where it becomes especially convenient
that all closure from
actions implement the java.util
concurrent callable interface so you can
just pass a closure function directly to
an executor and it will know what to do
with it the atomic references are part
of a whole set of atomic types that
java.util concurrent provides the atomic
reference in particular is the
foundation for closures atom an atomic
reference just says okay you have a
pointer to some thing and in a single
operation you can atomically compare and
set that value to a new pointer you can
change it to something so the
implementation of atom is basically a
wrapper around atomic reference that
adds this loop it adds this spin loop
that says if I wasn't able to update the
atomic reference once I'm gonna try
again immediately that's what closure
atoms do but there are more specific
types of atomic classes in java.util
concurrent in particular the atomic long
which represents just a atomically
updatable integer value so you can use
an atomic long equivalently to using a
closure atom with a number inside it the
difference is and the JDK documentation
is a little vague on this point but they
suggest that atomic long where possible
will compile down to machine
instructions lots of modern processors
because we have to deal with atomically
updating counters all the time lots of
modern CPUs have an actual instruction
to atomically update an integer
somewhere in memory and again the JDK
won't promise anything but they say if
your platform supports that they will
try to compile these atomic long
operations down to those special machine
instructions and if you run an example
like this for several million iterations
you will eventually see a small but
measurable performance difference
between these two
next is the countdown latch this is a
thread synchronization mechanism this is
the basis for closures promises a
countdown latch basically says maybe
several threads are doing something but
then they all have to wait for some
other process to complete you initialize
a countdown latch with a number and then
from some thread you call countdown to
decrement that number when it gets to
zero all of the threads that have called
a weight on that latch are allowed to
move forward so you can pause any number
of threads in your program and have them
wait on something else with a countdown
latch so a closure promise is basically
a combination of an atom and a latch
that's how it works
there are lots more things in java.util
concurrent some of them far more
esoteric than I can even come up with
examples for cyclic barrier is another
kind of latch mechanism semaphore is a
way to signal occupation of resources by
certain threads exchanger I don't even
know what that one does then there are
the concurrent collections and these are
really interesting so Java has its
built-in collection types list map set
and so on and then it has utilities that
will return synchronized versions of
those collections synchronized map
synchronized set and so forth but the
synchronized versions all work by having
a single exclusion lock the synchronized
collections say only one thread can be
using this collection at any one time so
if you have lots of threads trying to
read or update that collection there's
going to be a lot of contention for that
one resource the concurrent collections
promise that they can be used safely
from multiple threads but there is no
single lock controlling access so a
concurrent map queue or list can be read
and modified simultaneously from
multiple threads and those threads will
not interfere with each other so this is
a different kind of mutable collection
from what closures mutable reference
types give you a closure ref or atom
basically says there can be one change
at a time and any number of readers to
that collection at once the concurrent
collections are mutable but they are
also thread safe these might be
interesting for a shared cache some
piece of mutable state that you need to
keep track of from multiple threads
where you don't need the strict
concurrency semantics of refs or atoms
similarly the blocking cues these sort
of go in the other direction these are
data structures that you can use as
synchronization mechanisms you can
enforce different characteristics
depending on which type you choose as to
when a thread has to wait maybe it has
to wait to put something into the queue
maybe it will wait to take something out
of the queue these are again shared
mutable thread safe data structures you
could use them for work queuing you
could use them for passing messages
between threads lots of possibilities
with these queues finally at the bottom
you do have access to Java locks and
there are situations where you might
want to use explicit locking the locking
macro is basically the same as Java
synchronized keyword with a little extra
insurance that the lock gets released so
putting anything inside a locking block
ensures that only one thread can be
inside the lock occupied by that code at
any given time only one piece of code
can mess with that object that you are
locking on there are also more elaborate
kinds of locks in the java.util
concurrent locks package read write
locks reentrant locks other more
elaborate locking mechanisms that may be
useful in some applications then there's
volatile
volatile is probably the least
understood feature of the JVM brian gets
who wrote Java concurrency in practice
also wrote an entire article online
about how to deal with volatile fields
and how to use them correctly basically
a volatile guarantees exactly one thing
it guarantees that if you write to a
volatile field from one thread that
value is immediately visible on any
other thread that looks at the volatile
variable it won't be using an old value
from the cache however it does not
guarantee any kind of atomicity of
update operations so anytime you're
doing a calculation where the new value
depends on reading the old value
volatile doesn't work it will not give
you enough guarantees it's only good
when you are writing a new value and you
don't care what the previous value was
but there are still situations where
this turns out to be useful for example
sending a flag to update a process that
is already running or maybe recording
the last value of some state of
something where the previous value
doesn't matter and you don't care if it
gets overwritten this doesn't get used a
lot but it's a useful trick to know
about because it can be faster than
using locks or atomic references finally
there is the unsynchronized field type
this gives you no guarantees whatsoever
it is a mutable field which could be
totally different in different threads
and you have no way of telling when it's
going to get updated it's kind of funny
that closure makes you go to a lot of
work to get an unsynchronized mutable
field in a type in Java it's the default
so it's lots of fun to play around with
this stuff it is also very hard for the
last year I've been working on a
personal side project at just a fun
experiment that I called clique
which was an attempt to make a new
concurrency primitive something I called
a notifier that's a little bit like a
promise it receives a value and then you
can dear effort to get the value out the
difference is it also supports callbacks
so when a value becomes available it
will invoke the chain of callbacks that
we're waiting for that value this is as
I said an experiment I don't suggest you
use it especially because I found a bug
just yesterday so this kind of stuff is
very very hard but I mean you can spend
hours trying to wrap your brain about
the exact semantics of what's going on
when you mess around with these raw
concurrency bits and pieces so here are
some things to try ref history is
actually a feature of closure that is a
feature of the multi-version concurrency
control that controls how many old
copies of a ref we keep around this has
some performance implications when lots
of threads are trying to read the same
ref and there's a lot of contention it's
not very well documented or well
explored but it's an interesting thing
to explore and experiment with Christoph
grande who's here wrote an interesting
article about the problem of partial
locks how to have a reference to part of
a data structure and modify it without
having to lock the entire data structure
or encapsulate the entire data structure
in a transaction
there's always interesting active
research and distributed locks and
transactions this is another very hard
problem it's been 14 computer scientists
for years and there's some very
technical papers about how to do it but
it's a definite need people often want
the ability to do this thing in a
distributed way and so there's I know
some active work going on there in the
closure community that's really
interesting and then maybe just
exploring other ways to deal with
concurrency different primitives with
different semantics closure has var atom
ref and agent maybe that's enough but
there probably is room for more more
types that have different semantics for
different specific applications
finally a few things outside of closure
out of the language itself that you
might find interesting to explore the
first is closure test generative written
by Stu Holloway on the floor over there
close your test generative yeah that's
true he didn't write it just now he
actually wrote it a year ago and didn't
tell anybody but it's on github you can
find it and so this is the the semi
official announcement closure test
generative is built on top of closure
test so it uses the same mechanisms for
finding and running tests but what it
gives you is a way to write a test
function here called a spec and specify
what the inputs to that function should
look like so in this case it's a custom
integer function that returns integers
in a particular range then you tell
tests generative how long you want the
test to run and how many CPU cores you
have and it will start generating random
input data to feed to your function and
generate as many as it can in the time
that you've given it and run your
assertion function for each of them so
this is a different style of testing
from unit testing it does take some
getting used to
but it means you can cover far more test
inputs to your function than you could
if you were writing all of them out by
hand it basically allows you to make
assertions about Universal properties or
invariants about your code and then try
to verify that they're correct
if test generative finds an input that
causes your test to fail it will report
that and say here's where I found a
failure this was inspired by some
functional language testing frameworks
like quick check in Haskell which are
actually some of them much more
elaborate quick check for example will
actually try to find the smallest for
some definition of small test case that
causes your test
to fail closure tests generative isn't
that elaborate yet but that gives you an
idea of where this could potentially go
another thing you'll probably be hearing
quite a lot about at the cons this year
is core logic written by David Nolan and
Ambrose and some other people this is
essentially prologue or more
specifically it's a variant of Prolog
called Mini Cameron and it allows you to
do logic program premise that logic
programming to write your program as a
series of statements of facts and then
ask questions are these facts consistent
is this fact true I don't actually know
how it works it's on my list of things
to learn so I don't know what this
example means but it's I really do think
logic is the next step after functional
programming it is even more declarative
even more divorced from implementation
and it's it can be an extremely powerful
technique especially when you can
combine it with the rest of closure as a
feat as a full programming language so
then there are all sorts of interesting
areas of the JVM that you can explore
class loaders are black magic class
loaders are actually what allows closure
to compile source code into bytecode and
load it into a JVM at runtime they are
both the mechanism to load byte code
into the JVM and the mechanism to
control visibility of classes across the
JVM so any java application server or
framework like JBoss or tomcat they're
using class loader tricks to control
which parts of the application can see
each other like I said it's definitely
black magic but I believe there's a lot
of interesting work to be done with
class loaders in the context of a
dynamic language like closure most of
the class loader stuff from the Java
world stuff like OSGi is all tied to an
idea of a static compilation cycle
dealing with dynamic languages
introduces a whole other set of problems
and we're still trying to solve them
with regard to building deployment and
updating running code on a server
environment
next the Azzam library ASM this is in
closure this is an open source library
that closure uses to generate Java
bytecode and Java bytecode is lots of
fun because it's really small there's
only I don't know fewer than 200 byte
codes op codes in JVM bytecode and a lot
of them are redundant so you can learn
the basics of JVM bytecode in a few
hours and then start generating your own
bytecode and do all kinds of tricks you
can do optimization compilation tricks
all kinds of fun stuff by playing around
with bytecode J and I and J na are Java
native interface and Java native access
these are two different ways to get at
native code code written in C or any
other object compiled language J na is
supposedly slightly easier to work with
j'ni does require you to write a little
code in C in order to make it work but I
think it is actually better in the long
run it is more slightly more efficient
and it gives you explicit control over
what's happening at the boundary between
the native code and your JVM codes such
as closure so I used in one project j'ni
to interface with syslog the basic
system call for syslog and that ended up
being about a hundred times faster and
more reliable than the pure Java library
to do the same thing that we had been
using and it was literally one function
call that I had to implement jsb C is
probably not very well known it's an
Apache project I think it stands for
Java service container and it's
basically a combination of native and
Java code that allows a java program or
any JVM language program to integrate
properly with the UNIX operate
system which of course is the only
operating system that matters it allows
Java programs to do the things that UNIX
programs do and are good at things like
forking taking and dropping user
privileges execu to replace processes
with other processes it is a really
useful thing if you are deploying JVM
applications in a UNIX environment it
makes your life so much easier it's way
better than shell scripts finally I am
going to end with a brief rant to just
go out there and make stuff make
applications make libraries please do
not make frameworks
I think closure this is only the second
closure Cange closure is much too young
for us to know how to write frameworks
yet frameworks arise out of experience
with writing the same app over and over
again so go out there make applications
find the common patterns find what you
have to repeat over and over again make
it easier with libraries and then once
you've done that for three or four years
then we can have frameworks that

to say thanks to Chris Allen neh OCO and
Andrew everyone else who helped make the
cons possible this year they've done a
tremendous job and thank you for coming
and enjoy the conch
