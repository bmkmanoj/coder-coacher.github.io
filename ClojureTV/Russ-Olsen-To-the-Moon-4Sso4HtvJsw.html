you can that didn't just make this any
harder so thanks for that
so as the man says I am the I'm the very
recent VP of consulting services which
means I am managing I don't know how
many consultants we have these days 20
21 22
software developers coaches designers
that kind of thing so may God have mercy
on my soul so I have kind of a different
kind of talk for you today and it's a
talk that Karen sort of paved the way
for with her story the other day
yesterday because I want to tell you a
story I want to tell you a story that is
really close to my heart and I think
it's a fun story I think if nothing else
we'll the last session of this
conference will have some fun and we'll
sort of enjoy a good story but I also
think that this story is a story that
can inform the things that we do every
day as software developers as people who
build things so here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna tell you this story and then
I'm gonna circle round that at the end
and try and make the case that this
story is relevant to what you do every
day in little ways and in really big
ways so here goes here comes my story
it's the summer of 1969 and it's hot I
mean it is really hot and when it gets
hot like this the world kind of goes a
little crazy people kind of go a little
crazy so here in the summer of 1969
there are all kinds of things that are
going crazy and I'll tell you one of the
craziest things is that regular people
here in the summer of 1969 regular
people are starting to put air
conditioners in their houses I mean I'm
not talking about rich people and I'm
not talking about movie theaters or
supermarkets I'm talking about regular
people putting air conditioners in their
houses can you believe
that it's just the strangest thing and
you know what else is crazy here in the
summer of 1969 you better have that air
conditioner in your house because you
know how much a coke costs nail a coke a
bottle of coke has gone up to 10 cents
10 cents for a bottle clicks glass
bottle with some soda in it and it's ten
cents I mean it's just nuts and then if
you want to go for real nuts the New
York Mets those bums have an expansion
team they've never had a winning season
and here in the summer of 1969 these
bums are beating everyone there's even
talk I can barely say it there's even
talk that they might go to the World
Series it's just too awful to
contemplate but what is awful here in
the summer of 1969 is that the cold war
has entered its 25th year there's us
over here and the Russians as we call
them the Soviet Union over there and we
have been locked in this not quite peace
not quite war thing for 25 years in
Berlin they're on one side of the street
with their tanks and whirl and what the
other side of the street with our tanks
the guns are pointed at each other and
everybody's just been sitting there
waiting for the other person to make the
first move or make the first mistake or
to sneeze and you better hope nobody
sneezes because they have tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons we have
tens of thousands of nuclear weapons and
let me tell you if those bombs start
flying we are all dead if those bombs
start flying if somebody pushes the
actual button we have 15 minutes to live
because that's how long it takes for
those bombs to get to their targets so
we are living here in the summer of 1969
15 minutes at a time but for once it's
not the New York Mets it's not the Cold
War it's not even the heat that is
filling up all the papers in this here
in the summer of 1969
for once it's something else it's Apollo
it is the project to land a person on
the moon but don't get me wrong
Apollo is all about the Cold War see in
the early 60s in the late 1950s the
Russians were making us look bad they
were doing everything in space first and
they were making us look bad and when
you were involved in this conflict where
you are trying to tell people all around
the world be on our side were the smart
ones we're gonna win you can't afford to
look bad in something like space so the
Russians they launched the first Earth
satellite they put the first person in
orbit they got the first picture of the
far side of the Moon really crappy
picture but it's a picture nevertheless
so it was like a chess game the Cold War
is like a chess game they do something
we do something so they were first in
space and all these things we had to do
something so John Kennedy was president
back then and he reasoned that if you're
behind in a race the way we were behind
in that race it's better to be behind in
a marathon than it is in a 50-yard dash
why because you can catch up in a
marathon there's lots of time to catch
up so Kennedy just decided to declare a
marathon he got his advisors together
and he said where can we go in space
that's really far away that'll be hard
to do that'll be a marathon and this
advisor said well the moon's pretty far
away and he said okay we're going to the
moon it's completely arbitrary goal and
we need a timeline we need a deadline
1970s a nice good round number radio to
moon by 1970 completely arbitrary goal
completely arbitrary deadline no one
here has ever experienced that have they
so Kennedy got up in front of Congress
and he said we're gonna send the person
for the moon and bring them back safely
before 1970 a funny thing happened right
after that people started looking at
each other and they would say wait a
minute yes it's all about the Cold War
we all know it's all about the Cold War
but wait a minute
yeah work on another moon yeah I mean
we're going for the food I mean people
have dreamed about going to the moon for
thousands of years and it's gonna be us
we're gonna be the people who do it how
cool is that and carrots for the Cold
War this is really good and so you could
tell a few months after that first
speech you could tell Kennedy made a
second speech and you could tell he
caught a little bit of a fever he caught
a little bit of fever because in that
second speech he said we choose to go to
the moon not because it's easy but
because it's hard it's an interesting
way of looking at life well how hard is
it to go to the moon but really all
depends on how far away the moon is
right so you know I have to do this
right you're always whenever you talk
about astronomical distances you need
your little analog right so I got
tennis-ball here okay and then if this
is the earth then I got this little
rubber ball see how small it is no wires
get this little rubber ball here and if
this is the earth then this is about the
right size for the moon so now I want
you to think about your sixth grade
physical science textbook there'd be a
picture of the earth than the moon how
far apart are they I think in my
textbook they were like this right that
picture is more about getting the earth
and the moon on the page the earth and
the moon are not this close they're not
this close and not this close not this
close my arms aren't long enough they'd
be about seven feet apart so now here's
the key question how far you know
Kennedy said we were gonna go to the
moon and we had already started sending
people a little way up in the space now
far we had gotten in the space not quite
as high as the fun
on this tennis ball we hadn't made it
out of the fuzz yet and suddenly we're
going seven feet by an arbitrary
deadline going to the moon is really
really hard so if you're if you got this
like crazy deadline and this crazy
project how do you even start like what
do you do how do you even get going I'm
not sure what the right thing to do is
but what they actually did was
everything all at the same time they
started a whole series of projects
everything they could think of all at
once and the prayer was that it would
all come together at the last minute
right so that's always a good plan so
for instance one of the things they
decided to do was try and simplify the
job right the job is to take a person
take them to the moon lay on them safely
bring them back to the earth
well we we can't all do that all at once
so what's the simplest thing that could
possibly work well we could build a
spaceship with no person send that to
the moon and bring it back that has got
to be easier right you take the people
out of the equation it's got to be
easier okay is that the simplest thing
that could possibly work now if you're
just sending a machine to the moon and
landing it on the moon you don't have to
bring it back so the simplest thing that
could possibly work is just send the
Machine and land it on the moon is that
the simplest thing that could possibly
work not quite we need that we need to
think about what the word land means
how about if we define land let's go
screaming in at 1200 miles an hour slack
okay and we can take some pictures on
the way you know that kind of thing
thus was born project Ranger to hit the
moon with the spaceship Ranger one was
launched in August of 1961 and it
succeeded beyond everybody's
expectations if the goal was to crash
Ranger one crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean Ranger two did better Cresson the
Pacific Ocean Ranger 3 by any measure
did better it made it all the way out to
the moon it had a little navigation
problem and kind of missed hundred
thousand miles or so Ranger 3 is still
out there
Ranger 4 actually hits the moon but
Ranger Ford died on the way to the moon
it died on the way to the moon and the
stone dead spacecraft looped around then
we believe hit the far side of the Moon
that was the success of some sporm
that's c5 Ranger 5 was worried about
Ranger 3 and joined it in the great
beyond
Ranger 6 slew a flawless three-day
mission to the moon takes about three
days to get to the moon and it's certain
at a certain point you know on that
third day the people behind Ranger 6
realized that neither God nor Isaac
Newton was going to keep this thing from
hitting the moon and the spacecraft was
working and the only thing left to do
was have the TV cameras come on so that
they could see you know the moon getting
closer and closer and closer so they
commanded the TV cameras to come on and
they didn't and so they crashed a blind
spacecraft into the moon almost razor
seven actually worked
Rangers seven actually flew the moon
took a bunch of pictures and hit the
moon and you can imagine there are a lot
of corks popping and champagne being
drunk after Ranger seven except those
people had to be standing there thinking
my god it took us seven tries in two
years to do the simplest thing that
could possibly work how in God's name
are we gonna do a rest of it and the
answer is again they did everything all
at the same time so one of the things
they realize is they were building these
huge going to the moon rockets but they
were not going to be ready in time to
train the astronauts so they built a
whole separate thing just the train the
astronauts this is Gemini is a 2-page
person spaceship and it was built for no
other reason than to train the
astronauts train people in the things
you needed to know to go to the moon so
astronauts would go up and practice
astronaut e going to the moon things in
Earth orbit and they learned a lot
from Gemini they learned they learned
something about the little steering
rockets on a spaceship every spaceship
has these little steering rockets that
point it make you know nose-up and
nose-down kind of thing an airplane does
with flaps but spacecraft don't how many
air they learned what happens if one of
those Rockets malfunctions and goes on
and stays on it just keeps firing and
the answer is your spaceship starts to
spin faster and faster and faster and
they learned that when that happens the
people inside the spaceship can no
longer see because their eyeballs are
getting you know sloshed around but the
other thing they learned is that if you
have an astronaut with dead calm nerves
who was well enough trained that he can
work the problem while his spaceship is
tumbling out of control and knows the
inside of his cockpit so well that he
can find the right switches to throw
without being able to see this is a
survivable accident and they survived it
that's something good to know he also
learned something about spacesuits they
weren't too worried about spacesuits you
know in a rubber suit insulate it put a
helmet on it some oxygen send the guy
out of the space what they discovered is
if you take a person put him in a rubber
suit insulate it put a helmet on it send
the mountains face and have them
exercise he gets hot it gets so hot that
he starts to edge up towards heat
exhaustion I mean who would have thought
right insulated rubber suits right and
also I does the person doesn't just get
hot they sweat and so the suit fills up
with perspiration so it's yucky as well
as dangerous that was something to know
while all this is going on my lair
continuously trying to hit the moon with
dead spacecraft while they're doing all
this other stuff they are building these
huge workshops and they're building
these huge workshops so they can build
these enormous going to the moon
yes and this is the result of all that
this is the largest rocket ever built it
is 25 stories tall
it weighs millions of pounds if the fuel
and that thing goes off in an accident
it'll be the explosion the size of a
very modestly sized nuclear bomb and the
whole thing only has one purpose the
whole thing it's only purpose is to
throw the very tippy top the very pointy
bit that you can barely see in this
picture see it better here at the moon
because the result of yet another
project is this thing the very pointy
bit at the top which is a spaceship
designed to take three people on the
trip to the moon let them spend some
time in the moon and have them come back
it has the air of the fuel the oxygen
and teach shields parachutes everything
you need it is a marvel of 1960s
technology there's only two things wrong
with it thing number one is a killed its
first crew they weren't even flying in
space they were just practicing on the
launch pad let's pretend to be launching
and a fire broke out inside the
spacecraft it's some kind of electrical
problem who knows three times the ground
crew tried to fight their way in to get
those people out three times the flames
and the heat and the smoke drove them
back on the fourth time they managed to
get the hatch open or so nobody left to
save that's thing number one but here in
the summer of 1969 those problems have
been fixed we've fixed the problems in
this thing we're pretty sure 99% sure we
fix them yes we're in a hurry the other
problem with this thing is that with all
the food in the air and the heat shields
and the parachutes it's actually too
heavy to land on the moon it can go from
the earth they can go to the moon it can
word it around the moon it can come back
but it can't make that last 30 or 40
mile journey down to the moon it's just
to have
so for that we have this this
bizarre-looking contraption is a fragile
very specialized spaceship its only
purpose is to take two of the three
people so one guy gets left behind and
the mothership kind of watch the store
take two of the three people down to the
moon it's actually fairly complicated
spaceship it's actually a two-stage
rocket there is an engine and fuel tank
to land and there's a separate engine
and fuel tank to come back up which is
important only because if you're landing
and you change your mind and you want to
go back up there's a fairly complicated
procedure you need to go through to do
that and you'll see why that's important
in a little while so these two things
will go out to the moon carrying these
guys this is the crew of Apollo 11 there
are the first people to attempt to land
on the moon
this guy closest to me is Buzz Aldrin
Buzz Aldrin is a pretty good guy to have
on this trip because he is one of the
key people who fix the problems with the
spacesuits guess you know what he's
gonna wear one right so he was probably
a pretty good guy to have won this kind
of trip we've already met the guy on the
far end he's the other guy who was going
to attempt the light actually land on
the moon he's Neil Armstrong and he was
the guy in that spinning spacecraft who
managed to write it without being able
to see what he was doing
can you imagine why they picked him the
guy in the middle is the guy who's gonna
stay on the mothership and he's got the
suckiest job in the world in the
universe his job is not sucky because he
doesn't get the land on the moon
although that's part of it his job is
sucky
because of the what s what if the other
two go down to the moon he can't come
back up what if something happens to him
on the way down to the moon what if
something happens to him on the moon
Colin's job the guy in the middle his
job is to leave his friends behind and
make the three-day sigh
sad journey back home has gotta be the
suckiest job in the universe it is July
20th 1969 so Sunday it's about 4 o'clock
in the afternoon a few days ago Apollo
11 took off they've had a textbook
journey to the moon a couple of hours
ago there's two spaceships separated the
mothership stayed in orbit and the
little Lander this weird-looking
contraption has been on its way down to
the surface of the moon for the last
couple of hours and they are about to
enter the critical last 10 minutes what
NASA calls powered descent the last 10
minutes of the trip down to the moon
back on earth in Mission Control there
is a room full of people who are arming
for war a lot of these guys are in their
20s they have spent a substantial
portion of their adult life waiting for
these 10 minutes it's oddly silent in
that room and they are deadly serious
the door is locked there's an armed
guard on the other side of the door no
one is getting in or getting out until
this thing is over they've locked down
the circuit breakers on a lot of their
important equipment they would rather
risk a fire than have the lights go out
at the wrong moment their job is to
watch the data streaming down from the
spaceship and be the 3rd 4th 5th 27th
pair of allies to make sure that that
weird-looking little spaceship is doing
what it's supposed to be doing across
the United States there is this blanket
of tension everywhere the streets are
eerily empty because most people are
inside glued to their TVs it's right
around now right around 4 o'clock in the
afternoon that something weird starts to
happen with the cars that are on the
road they start to pull off and city
streets they find a place to park on
highways they pull off under the
shoulder on rural roads they simply stop
the drivers cannot listen to their
radios
listen to what is going on above the
moon and drive at the same time now row
house in Philadelphia a ten-year-old boy
and his dad are watching the coverage on
TV so right around now they're both
sitting on the couch with us right
around nail that the bad gets up walks
about halfway to the TV and gets down
into the sort of catcher's crouch and
puts his hand on his head and that's the
way he'll stay until it's over they're
watching this guy it's a Walter Cronkite
he is like the god of TV news men they
do public opinion surveys what public
figure do you trust the President of the
United States regularly comes in second
this guy wins Cronkite is one of these
like nothing bothers some kind of
reporters he in World War two when he
was a radio reporter he flew on bombers
just so he could say you know tell the
people back home what it was like even
though those bombers were getting shot
down at a rate of 10 percent permission
many people remember Cronkite with just
a touch of sadness in his voice telling
the world that John Kennedy had been
murdered
it is 405 p.m. it's a great at the
beginning of this last 10-minute flight
down to the moon Armstrong and Aldrin
are at 50,000 feet they've gone through
about a quarter of their fuel to get to
where they are right now and they are
playing a 1960s hi-tech game of can you
hear me now because the radio isn't
really working they can talk to the
ground for a few seconds and then they
get these huge blasts of static and they
don't know why or where the static is
coming from and even worse it's not just
the voice communication all their data
is dropping out too and they need that
second third fourth fifth sixth set of
eyes and so Armstrong and Aldrin have
their heads down then they're playing
with the channel and they're trying to
adjust the antenna angle and doing all
the things that you might do to try and
fix a radio to make your radio work and
fortunately they have time to do that
because they are not actually flying the
spaceship
is a new technology a new cool thing
that is flying that spaceship it is
called a computer and the computer in
that little spaceship ISM it's just a
brilliant piece of technology it can do
ten hundreds of calculations per second
and it is the reason they have a
computer is that they're not just trying
to generically land on the moon they are
trying to land at a particular
pre-selected spot
on the moon now when they were planning
the mission there is a lot of
controversy over where exactly they
should land on the one side there were
the geologists and the scientists who
study you know the moon and rocks and
things like that and they were like yeah
yeah it's the Cold War but this is the
scientific opportunity of a lifetime we
have to land someplace geologically
interesting on the other side there are
the astronauts in the rocket scientists
and they're like cool what's
geologically interesting and the
geologists are well a mountainside or a
valley or Canyon maybe the rim of a
crater
in the end it was the astronauts and the
rocket scientists who won the argument
because you know this was about the Cold
War and you're not gonna win the Cold
War with your little spaceship sliding
down the side of a mountain area so
Apollo 11 is aimed for the flattest
dullest geologically most uninteresting
spot but NASA can find on the moon and
the computer is flying them there it is
4:10 p.m. about five minutes into the 10
minute last bit of flight armstrong and
aldrin they're at 35,000 feet they've
gone through about 50% of their fuel and
good news the radio is working as
mysteriously as the radio problems came
they just go away and finally the two of
them have got to be thinking okay maybe
this is going to go well from here when
a display in front of them lights up and
it says 1202 1202 is a message from
their computer now I know no one in this
room is really that familiar with
computers they're really high-tech so
let me give you a modern version of what
1202 means
this is a closure conference this
the best part is the people in Mission
Control they see the 1202 all this data
streaming they own Armstrong gets on the
radio it's like 1202 what's 1202 because
there's 1200 of these codes and so
they're looking at each other trying to
figure out what 1202 is and there's one
guy in that room he's 26 years old his
name is Steve bales and he knows what
1202 means 1202 means that the computer
has more to do than it can actually
handle but he also knows that the
software is designed so that it'll do
the most important things first then let
the less important things fall off the
table so bales he's got like five
seconds to make this decision and it's
literally a life-or-death decision and
he says just ignore the 1202 s just
forget it just keep going
a little while later armstrong and
aldrin get start getting 1200 ones which
bails those is pretty much the same
thing and so they're just telling them
to ignore these error codes but they
can't the astronauts can't quite ignore
the error codes they can't quite ignore
them because there's a bad UI designed
they have to push a button to clear the
error code it shows 1202 and then they
have to push a button because you know
the next one might be 867 which means
something completely different and I
can't see that unless they clear it so
they again they have their heads down
and they're pushing these buttons trying
to clear these error codes and they're
coming pretty fast and pretty furious
it is 4:12 p.m. about seven minutes into
the 10-minute flight they're at 2,000
feet they've gone through about 4/5 of
their fuel and as mysteriously as they
come the 12-hour twos go away the
computer starts working fine and finally
finally Armstrong has a chance to look
up and look out the window he's got this
little triangular window in front of
them he looks out the window now they're
at 2,000 feet if you're going the
cleveland and you're at 2,000 feet that
means that like the plane is coming in
to land probably the landing gear is
down the flaps are down you know 2,000
feet you're almost at cleveland
Cleveland's all around you you can look
out the window at 2,000 feet and see who
has a swimming pool and whether it's
trash day 2,000 feet Cleveland's not
that place you're going to next week
it's a place Armstrong looks out the
window and for the first time in human
history the moon is not that late up in
the sky it's not this geopolitical we're
gonna kick the Russians butts by getting
their first thing it's a place it's all
around them you can see the ground
scrolling beneath them you can look in
the distance and again see mountains and
the mountains were higher than he is he
they are you are pretty much there when
you're at 2,000 feet now certainly when
I was a kid and probably even now I
sometimes imagine what it would be like
to
him to look out that window right step
into his big bulky space suit boots rate
and look out that window and I think if
I were looking out that window at that
moment there's only one word that would
come to my mind that word begins with
the S and rhymes with hit the moon is a
place it's the wrong place he looks out
the window Armstrong has been studying
maps and photographs and they actually
made plaster models he knows exactly
what he should see when he looks out
that window and you know what this isn't
it and furthermore he can't see the
right place from where he's looking all
he knows is it's the wrong place and
then it gets worse because on that
window there are the markings and he can
use those markings as sort of a gun
sight to tell exactly where on the
grounds the computer is going to have
them land and he looks he lines up on
look on the right marking and see if
that or something like that a very
geologically interesting crater
and even worse the crater is not that
big but the crater is full of boulders
the crater is full of car-sized boulders
and there's a debris field murmur crater
is like an asteroid hit right there's
stuff all over the place and the crater
is surrounded by this very large debris
field of boulders Armstrong looks at
that for probably five seconds and then
he makes a very Neil Armstrong decision
he makes a very Neil Armstrong decision
he clicks off the autopilot and he does
two things
he kills most of their downward descent
and he guns it forward because on the
far side of this boulder field he can
see that there might be a decent place
to land and he has got to get there
before they run out of fuel back on
earth the people of Mission Control they
can see all of this they can see him
click off the autopilot they can see him
kill the downward fall they can see him
zooming forward and they do something
really remarkable they do nothing and
they shut up and in fact the guy running
the show at Mission Control a guy named
gene Krantz tells the people at Mission
Control he doesn't want anybody talking
to the astronauts anymore he only wants
them to send one bit of information up
periodically
how much fuel do they have left how much
time do they have left before they ran
out of fuel it is 4:14 p.m. about nine
minutes into that 10-minute flight the
astronauts are at three hundred and
thirteen feet they're down to five
percent of their fuel and they are just
passing over the edge of that boulder
field they don't know how fast they're
going because no one ever expected them
they'd be going this fast for this this
fast that low to the ground so their
speedometer is packed
it's 4:16 p.m. eleven minutes into that
ten minute flight they are at 30 feet
and aren't strong they are over the
boulder field and Armstrong is slamming
on the brakes to get them the stop so he
can
lower at the last little bit they've got
three percent of their fuel left and the
first ominous warning comes up from the
ground just two words 60 seconds you
have one minute of fuel left
Armstrong barely hears them because he's
now lowering the thing like a helicopter
down to the ground that a certain point
they lose track of how high they are
because they're kicking up the huge
cloud of dust but he can feel it it's
it's down there he knows the ground
that's down there somewhere and as felt
this moment that they hear the second
warning thirty Seconds for God's sake
Landis think Aldrin is looking out the
window and he reports that he can see a
big shadow on the ground this is a
shadow of the spaceship they are really
really close and then Aldrin looks down
at this instrument panel and there's a
little light low amber light right in
front of them and it's labeled contact
and as he looks at that light it comes
on it's a contact light contact light
means that the sensors on the landing
gear are this weird-looking little
machine have touched something hard
contact light means they've landed
contact light means that Armstrong and
Aldrin are not going to die and better
they're not going to fail contact light
means that these two guys all the people
at NASA the United States of America
that humanity has arrived it's for 1741
but aren't strong and Aldrin are not
quite done the plan had been for them to
shut off the engine just a few feet
above the ground and let the thing fall
the rest of the way but they were too
busy not dying to do that and so now
they're sitting on the ground burning
their last of their fuel picking up
rocks and dust and what-have-you and
they need to go down their shutdown
checklist and it's something the two of
them do together because it's really
important to get it rights of a pair
astronaut so
so one of them will read the staff and
the other one will do it or the first
one will read the step and the other one
will do it
so Armstrong starts it by saying shut
down and Aldrin says ok engine stop
and then Aldrin says ACA out of detent
Armstrong says out of detent Auto and
they go on through all this sort of
technological mumbo-jumbo meanwhile back
in Mission Control they can see that the
little Lander has stopped and they can
see their version of the contact light
come on and then they see all the
systems clicking off and they can hear
Armstrong and Aldrin going through this
checklist and you would think that at a
moment like this you know someone would
say something momentous something
profound but that's not really how
people are so the guy on the ground
who's talking to the astronauts he
radios up words to the effect we think
you landed doc really
Armstrong is sort of still at the end of
the shutdown checklist so he clicks off
the last thing on the checklist he says
engine arm off and then pretty much in
the same breath he says the words that
he had practiced the words that he had
made up the words that he wanted to be
the first words from another world so he
says tranquility base here they had
landed in a place on the moon called The
Sea of Tranquility we think we're almost
sure the Eagle which was the name of the
little spaceship has landed and with
those words with those words those
highly disciplined nerdy guys in Mission
Control with their white shirts and
their skinny black ties and their pocket
protectors as a group stand up and start
shouting you can imagine there's
probably some shouting going on in those
cars what would you do tell them the
steering wheel a little bit maybe feel a
little silly if somebody sees you
certainly there was some shouting going
on in that rowhouse it takes the
ten-year-old boy just a few seconds to
realize hey they've done this this is
over they've done it and then he
realizes that his dad is no longer
in that crouch but as that is jumping up
and down that's shouting really loud
shouting louder than he's ever heard is
that shout before and he realizes it's
not just this dad shouting so people
next door and it's the people on the
other side and this the people across
the street and it's the people in the
back Street the whole neighborhood is
shouting and it's the kind of noise that
you don't exactly hear as it you sort of
feel in your stomach and it comes in
waves it'll be really loud and then a
little sort of trail off and you think
it's going to end and then no it gets
really loud again and amidst all the
shouting the boy focuses back on the
television and sees the second
incredible thing of the day because
they're on TV just for a second camera
cut away but just for a second he saw it
he was sure he saw it there on the TV
screen was Walter Cronkite crying that's
my story I
what I want to say something to you guys
I said that was my story but it's not
it's your story okay you get that story
for being one of us
that everything that I told you was done
by people like us done by people who
live in breathe technology who live just
to build things who live for the next
cool thing and I don't care if you grew
up in the United States like I did or
Germany or Asia or the old Soviet Union
or Russia if you are one of us this
story is part of your heritage your
cultural inheritance so it's yours and
one of the reasons I try and tell this
story is often as I can is to kind of
give it back to remind everyone that
this is really your story but I said
that what I would do is try and talk you
into the idea that this story is
relevant to the things you're doing
today so let me try that can we learn
anything from the story I think we can
learn all kinds of things I think we can
learn little things and I think the
little thing that we can learn is that
little things in a complex technological
project can kill you okay let's think
about the little things
why did their radios stop working for a
while all right there's an interesting
question turns out that a few months
before Apollo 11 took off the the rocket
scientists who are responsible for this
thing got worried about the steering
rockets not that they would go on and
stay on like they did in that early
mission but that they would burn through
the side of this thing some of those
steering rockets were pointed pretty
close to the skin of this thing and this
was very flimsy and so they put these
shields I've got one of them circled in
yellow here they put these shields to
keep the Rockets from burning through
the side so the shields would deflect
the rocket exhaust
they also made great radio reflectors
and it's certain angles they would
reflect the radio and screw up their
communications guess which angles that
was
in minutes 10 and 7 of the flight down
from the moon
why did their computer crash their
computer crash because it had three
modes and there was a switch you could
select the mode mode number one was
tracked the mothership right they used
that mode when they were coming back up
right mode number three was landing on
the moon mode and that just tracked the
ground they don't care about the
mothership and then there is mode 2
which was just used very rarely which
was the track both of them
well they had it set in mode 2 the
computer was trying to track both the
grounds and the mothership and that
ancient computer couldn't really walk
and chew gum at the same time and so it
crashed little things can kill you but
you know what well-designed software can
save you the only reason they managed
the land was because that software was
designed to do the most important thing
so that they managed to get past that
one even more interesting is why were
they off course they had this pinpoint
landing what happens for that we have to
go back a couple of hours the one the
two space ships were connected together
when these two space ships were hooked
together there was a sort of tunnel that
ran between the two of them so the
people could pass back and forth and
when they got ready to separate they
closed the hatch at one end then they
closed the hatch at the other and they
made a sort of dead space and the
astronauts were supposed to pump the air
out of that dead space and then separate
well maybe they were in a hurry maybe
they had other things on their mind they
quite don't get all the air out of it
so when they separated there was a puff
of air that changed the speed of the
little Lander by one foot per second
here is one foot per second okay that's
one foot per second what possible
difference could 1 foot per second make
in a spaceship going more than 1,200
miles an hour
let's do the math one foot per second is
60 feet per minute
it's 3,600 feet more than half a mile in
an hour and this was 2 hours before they
landed this problem festered for hours
and threw them off course by a couple of
my
else little things can kill your little
puff of air can kill you but you know
what else if you look at those two
spaceships between them they had two
million parts if you tried to worry in
detail about every single one of those
two million parts you'd probably be
ready to leave for the moon about now
write it the key is not to worry about
every single little detail the key is to
try and locate the details that are
likely to kill you and be ready to deal
with the failures that do occur I think
that's one of the lessons that when you
get out of this another thing we can get
out of this is the value of persistence
think about all those early failures
right
I said Ranger free is still out there
and we all laughed funny right it
probably wasn't funny to the people
behind Ranger 3 and yet they kept going
they kept going through astronauts that
were killed they kept going through
spaceships spinning out of control they
kept going through all kinds of things
and in the end they managed to do it
we'd also learned something I think it
takes leadership to do something like
this and I think leadership is really
important but I think there's something
else that's important something I like
to think of this followship right we're
all smart people in this room we all
have opinions we all want to be heard
but there are moments when the best
thing to do is to shut up and let the
person who's on the spot make the
decisions think about what happened when
Armstrong took control of that spaceship
the people on the ground did not radio
up to them Neil you've turned off your
targeting computer what's the matter
they just shut up and let him do the job
I think the lattice followship
I think you know honestly software
people right I think we could practice a
little more followership um I also think
we need to know the difference between a
leader and a hero we like our heroes
right here's a very heroic moment of
state this photograph was taken few
hours after the landing it's a very
heroic and that's the problem with it it
looks like it was easy it looks like
there was like the super guy and he flew
to the moon and he had no problems and
then he got out and took this photograph
we know that's not what happened I like
this because this reminds me of
leadership remember the shutdown
checklist this these are not the words
of a hero these are the words of a
leader of two people struggling to
finish the job at the end of a really
bad day alright and I like these words I
like these words especially because you
know honestly all this technological
mumbo-jumbo I could be saying this on
Monday it makes me feel closer to this
thing I could be saying this you could
be saying something like this these are
the words of people struggling to finish
the job and you know what else these
words are they are the first words
spoken from another world I like the
fact that they're real words they're not
made-up words they're actually something
somebody was trying to do
we also learned something about history
and the way things worked out from the
story see we went to the moon and we
thought well we kicked the Russians
butts while we're going to the moon and
we'd learn some things and maybe we'd
light up some dark places with our big
machines and the fire and everything and
a funny thing happened on the way to the
moon a funny thing happened on the way
to the moon we looked back over our
shoulder and we saw that we saw
ourselves we saw our place in the
universe I know for probably everybody
in this room maybe these pictures are
just part of the wallpaper I saw Alan
earlier and he was wearing a t-shirt
that had
picture very much like this one alright
it's just part of the wallpaper you see
it all the time you've seen it a
thousand times I would like for you to
try to imagine for just a minute that
you had gotten to a certain place in
your life having never seen a picture
like that and then one day somebody
comes and slaps this picture down in
front of you how would you feel what
would you say I can tell you you look at
it and you say holy mother of God that
is everything that is every birthday
that is every first day of school that
is every graduation it's every love
affair it's every wedding it's every
wedding anniversary it's every funeral
it's every birthday it's everything we
are it's all we have
it's beautiful it's tiny it's out there
in the black and maybe we should take
care of it
it's no coincidence that pictures like
this coincided almost exactly with
modern environmentalism as a massive
political movement you just look at the
picture and it comes to you and that
that sort of brings me to what I think
of as kind of the real lesson of Apollo
and it it's something I have I have a
hard time putting in the words and
mostly I can think of it as a
conversation maybe conversation between
you and me we go out to lunch and one of
us it doesn't matter which has an idea
and it doesn't matter what the idea is
right maybe you want to get rich selling
pet food on the internet maybe I want to
mine the sea floor for minerals doesn't
matter what the ideas doesn't matter who
had it maybe you want to cure the common
cold or AIDS or cancer or it just
doesn't matter maybe it's me now we
could talk about this idea you and I out
at lunch we could talk about this idea
and you could maybe tell me it's a bad
idea and sure maybe I'd believe yet we
could talk about it you could tell me
that it's bad for you or it's not worth
the money that it'll rot your teeth or
it'll make your hair fall out or to ruin
your eyesight and we can talk about that
sure it's you know maybe you could just
tell me the you know it'll make you fat
I don't know write all these things you
could tell me and maybe you could
convince me of them the one thing you
cannot convince me of is that it is not
possible
you see I'm familiar with the impossible
I saw it done on TV when I was a kid
right the ultimate lesson of Apollo is
that when you do something cool if you
do something difficult you do something
technically difficult and you do it with
style you do it with grace you do it
with elegance well you have the thing
right but there's the second effect
there is this wave that goes out from it
there's a wave of belief you make people
believe she can do it I can do it
he can do it I can do it
make people believe in the future you
make people believe in the possibilities
you make people believe in themselves I
can do it I know this for a fact I know
this for a fact because I am the result
of one of those ways I am a child of
Apollo I sat on that couch and my life
changed right got off of whatever path
that was on and it got on a different
path that led me the college into
engineering and the computer programming
and later on to writing books and a
little while after that to being here
with you today the ultimate lesson for
Apollo of Apollo for me is really very
little to do with space travel of the
moon or any of that it has everything to
do with belief and so for me the
ultimate lesson of Apollo goes back to
the words all those decades ago that
started it all in the beginning we
choose to go to the moon not because
it's easy but because it's hard have a
safe trip home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
