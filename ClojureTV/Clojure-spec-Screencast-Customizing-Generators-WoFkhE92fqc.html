this screencast we're going to look at
customizing generators with closure spec
when you create a spec with closure spec
spec will create generators for you at
development time but in some situations
you will want to override these
generators we'll look at how you can
pass override options to functions to
generate data and to specs themselves
and we'll look at how you can model your
domains to come up with better
generators using the bind and F map
functions from the generator namespace
to create new generators out of existing
generators we'll also look at how to
combine multiple models to fully cover
the state space of a problem to me let's
get started at the repple I will execute
closure forms and no end at the top and
you can see the results of those
executions in the window at the bottom
will be loading for namespaces the close
respect namespace with its typical alias
of s and now for the first time the
generators namespace with the alias gen
the test namespace with the Elliots test
and then the closure string namespace
just to implement some functions we're
going to test
let's start with a predicate that
doesn't lend itself well to an automated
generator so here we're defining a ID in
a problem to mean where our IDs always
have a food prefix so in order to be an
ID you have to be two things so you have
an ant spec here you have to be a string
and the string has to start with F oo -
so we can define this spec and then we
can exercise the spec and generate some
example data or at least we can try to
and we're going to find out is that
where you need an exception saying that
we could not satisfy the predicate after
100 tries and so what spec is trying to
do is generate strings of random and
then hope that it will happen into one
that starts with F oo - which would
happen eventually but it's going to take
a very long time so in order to deal
with this we need to make it smarter
generator
so let's create a generator using the F
map function from the generator
namespace F map we'll take an existing
generator and then apply a functional
transformation to it so we're going to
use an existing we're gonna make up here
on the Flies we're gonna make up a spec
called int n 1 to 100 so I'm gonna spec
a number from 1 to 100 and then we're
gonna use the S slash gem form to get
the generator for that and they're going
to pass that generator to F map F map
will take the generated values and then
transform them by prepending foo - so
this guarantees by construction that
this generator is going to make data of
the shape that we want then when you
call functions in spec you can pass
overrides so here exercise again we can
pass in the name of the specular when I
exercise the number of exercises we want
to perform and then additional options
now here the additional option is that
when you want to generate ideas you
should call Fujin instead of the
built-in specular and so now we'll see
of course that we get a bunch of
generated strings that are foo - some
number between 100 as we requested you
can also specify generators when you
create a spec so we can take our
existing form here at the end string and
starts with foo and then put all of that
in a call to F slash spec spec has a
keyword args option gen that allows you
to override the generator that spec will
store for a particular spec so here
instead of taking the built-in one we're
going to use our Fujin and now that
we've done this we can call exercise and
we don't have to pass in an override
because we've established that override
with the spec itself
now let's look at a slightly more
complicated example it's often the case
that applications have dictionaries or
lookups that are passed around in a
variety of contexts so we're gonna spec
one of those we're gonna spec a lookup
is a map from keyword to string and it
has to have something in it so I specify
the minimum count of the lookup is 1 and
we can exercise that and we will get a
lot of gibberish she maps from very ugly
keywords to very ugly strings now let's
imagine how this is actually to be used
it's often going to be passed around the
functions along with a key so there will
be a half dozen or a dozen function
signatures in our application that take
both a lookup and a key and then end up
doing something with them and most of
the time the key is going to be
something that is found so let's
describe that we'll describe a pair of
arguments lookup finding K that's going
to be the catenation of a lookup which
we just Specht and K which is simply a
keyword with the additional predicate
that lookup must contain K and so the
the predicate is joined to the regular
expression of course with spec and and
we expect that we're going to see
something similar to what we saw before
which is that exercise is going to have
a difficult time picking maps at random
and then picking keywords at random and
having those keywords actually be in the
map so statistically it's very likely
that we will fail to satisfy that
predicate so now we're dealing with
dependent relationships between two
values and the most idiomatic way to
deal with this level of relationship or
even more complex ones is to use a model
for the system and then generate the
actual items in the domain from that
model it's often the case that the model
itself can double as one of the elements
in the domain that's the case here so
we're going to use gen bind bind takes
two things a generator based on a model
and then a generator that takes that
model and transforms it with additional
generation into useful things in your
domain now in our case lookup is going
to function both as model and as a
domain entity so we're gonna take a look
up which is a map from keywords to
strings and then generate a couple
then we can use gin slash return which
simply returns the value passed into and
Gen slash elements which takes the
collection pass to it and picks
something at random from Matt collection
so here we're going to return the lookup
passed in and then we're going to
generate an element element at random
from the keys of that which again by
construction is exactly what we want
we're going to get a pair where the
first item of the pair is a lookup and
the second item of the pair is a key
which is known to be found in that look
up because it was generated from the
model so with this model based generator
in place we can exercise lookup finding
K and we will see that we get bunch of
generate examples where the lookup has
some key in its look at this one this
one's going to have the key in plus F
underscore Z blah blah blah and we'll
see that that key is in fact present in
the map and of course we know that the
generated data is conformant because one
of the things that spec does is it makes
a conformant to check after generating
any data so for example if you wrote a
bad generator that wasn't capable of
generating conformant data a spec would
never return that data to you it would
always say this didn't match some
predicate after a hundred tries or what
happened
with these tools in hand we can return
to the original example from the
previous screencasts my index of my
index of takes a source string and a
search string and returns the index of
the search string in the source string
and we will just use a minimal spec here
we don't have to have all the details
that we did for the mind except expect
earlier and in fact it's a value prop of
spec that you can expect exactly as much
or as little as you want to
pedagogically here I don't need the full
spec I just need to be able to look at
the arguments what you're going to see
this time is that the built-in generator
does not fail to generate but it doesn't
generate a wide enough range of values
so if we look we'll see that generating
strings at random has no trouble finding
the degenerate case where in d string an
empty string matches at position zero
and it can find all sorts of non
matching strings because two random
strings especially fairly small ones are
not likely to have an overlap so we have
lots of non matching strings and we
would have to run this generator for a
very long time to get any matching
strings this isn't a very good fidelity
to the domain where we imagined that
this function is going to be called in
lots of scenarios where we expect to
find a match so what we can do is make a
model of the domain of strings that have
some matching substring and that model
this is going the first time we see a
model that's really not an entity in our
domain it's just a model that we made to
help us understand our domain and then
generate data in the domain so what does
this look like the model says if you
have three strings a pre fixed string a
matched string and a suffix string that
model would then allow you to generate
both strings and searches within the
strings and we can do that using F map
as we saw before we'll write a new
function gen string and substring that
takes the example of this model so it
has three strings in it prefix match and
suffix and it returns a tuple that has
in it a string to search which has the
prefix the match in the suffix and then
a string to search for which has match
in it which again by construction is
going to be a string that's found
so let's actually define the model and
now let's give this a try
we will def my index of ARDS as its own
spec just so we can refer to it easily
and then we will read F the my index F
function to have a spec that includes
the args we talked about before and the
generator that we just built from a
model and now we'll see that when we
exercise my index of we get back lots of
interesting matches so here the letter L
appears inside LA and the letters Jo I T
appear inside the first string jo I T
and of course this is always going to be
the case by construction because we
generated from a model and such that
this was true so now we have kind of the
opposite problem we when we use the
naive generator we got some degenerate
cases and then we came up with a model
that gave us an interesting case and for
our tests we would really like to cover
both of those scenarios gin one of will
let you do that gin one of takes
multiple generators and then returns a
new generator that picks at random from
one of the generators passed in so we
will use the standard generator for my
index of arts now we see the benefit of
making that a named thing instead of
tying its generator to it so that's the
generator that spec would make for you
that's just going to make random strings
and then we'll also use the generator
that we just built from a model which
makes strings and substrings of those
strings and
with those in place we'll see that if we
read F our spec for my index of using
our new generator gen my index of args
and exercise the function will see that
we have a good mix we have the
degenerate case that matches at 0 we
have strings that match sub strings we
have strings that don't match sub
strings and this is a pretty good basic
coverage of the state space or
application so where are we when you
write specs you get generators for free
and you should do as little as possible
and see how far those generators will
take you but there will be times that
you'll want to customize generation when
you do this you can build on generators
from existing specs and in particular
you can make a model of your domain and
then use gen bind or gen F map to
transform that model into generated data
in your domain admittedly this model
building is an effort but the effort
produces something of much higher value
than for example types in Java or C
sharp or unit tests that are typical and
dynamic languages like Ruby or Python
because the model directly represents
your domain and it can generate an
arbitrary amount of example data or
tests in your domain
