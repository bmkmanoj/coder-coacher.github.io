and I'm here to talk about components
and I'm here to talk about software
architecture because as we all know
every software application you could
ever possibly want to write fits into
this three layer architectural pattern
thank you thank you yes you know you
have your UI you have some business
logic whatever that is and then a
database underneath it all when was the
last time you wrote an app that looked
like that
not likely huh yeah most of the apps I
work on tend to look a little more like
this you know they've got to send email
they've got to send SMS messages there's
this other database over here in a data
warehouse and the scheduler and
monitoring you know apps have to do a
lot of stuff and if there's any business
logic at all it kind of gets splayed
across all of these different pieces so
this is the world this is what we live
with what we have to deal with and a lot
of these pieces of functionality in our
app have state in them now some of its
easy it's just static configuration but
we have to keep track of things like
database connection URLs uh API keys
usernames passwords all that stuff then
we have a lot of external resources that
we need anytime you have a client API
for some service that has a connection
object or a session object or even
something simple like a socket
connection or a file handle these are
all stateful resources that our
applications need to use and keep track
of finally we can have things that are
inherently stateful in our applications
we can create threads we can use mutable
reference types like refs and atoms and
agents we can use core async channels we
have things in our program that are
inherently stateful and somewhere we
have to keep track of that state so the
question
that sort of confronts us every time we
start a closure project is where do we
put it where does the state go and this
is really someplace where I think
object-oriented languages kind of have
the leg up they make it obvious if you
have an object-oriented language like
Java and you need a a thing you need a
foo well what do you do you make a class
that's the only thing you can do and a
class has this structure built into it
you have an obvious place to put static
configuration runtime state you have a
constructor function to initialize that
state and you may have one or more
methods loosely defined that are going
to transition that object between
different states in its lifecycle so in
closure it's a very different world in a
lot of functional languages actually
there's a lot less structure inherent in
the language if I took this code here as
a very naive translation of the Java
class on the previous slide it looks
like it's kind of the same but it's
actually doing something very different
closure namespaces are not classes they
are not instantiate an instance of a
namespace or parameterize it on another
namespace we can't treat namespaces as
modules that way and in closure if we
need a thing well what do we do we def
it that's the default thing we know how
to create stuff in closure but anything
we def is a global singleton and any
functions we write to manipulate that
whether it's an atom or a var or
whatever those are going to be global
effects throughout our program now last
year at this same conference I did a
talk called closure in the large where I
described a lot of the problems that
result from this sort of default global
behavior in closure programs
and I made one big recommendation in
that talk which was to make your state
local to make every function only depend
on things that were passed to it in its
arguments now unfortunately I hadn't
completely figured out how that would
work and I didn't articulate it very
clearly so what people ended up doing in
response to this was they would have all
the state in their application and put
it together in one map and then they
would pass that map as an argument to
every function in the program now don't
get me wrong this was an improvement
this does make some things easier to
manage now the state is at least local
to the function but the problem with
having just one of these is that it ends
up being very big and complicated you
have this deeply nested map with lots of
nested Maps and other things inside it
and in any given function you may be
reaching through several layers of that
to get it the piece of state you need it
also means if you're using the same map
everywhere that everything can see
everything every piece of state is
always available effectively this is
just another way of recreating global
State so what you end up with often
without intending it is an application
where every piece of code is very
tightly coupled to every other piece of
code because they're all sharing this
state and any piece of code might be
manipulating it somewhere another
downside to this pattern although it
does have this nice feature that you can
just sort of pass this same map through
a bunch of functions to build up the
state that you need to carry around you
still have to keep track of the ordering
there's nothing about this that's saying
that DB has to come before web server
that's just something you have to
remember you can also have hidden
dependencies between these things I just
have to know because I wrote the code
that one of these functions is going to
use some of the state that was created
by an earlier function so it's better
but it doesn't really get what I was
hoping to get out of the description
in closure in the large so I wanted to
take those ideas and see if I could
advance them just a little bit further
and actually codify this into a library
of reusable code that I could use in
lots of different applications so I
settled on building it around this idea
of a component a component is something
that I've just given this definition
this is my definition of a component for
the purposes of this talk and this
pattern it's an immutable data structure
in fact it's a closure map or record and
then it has a set of functions
associated with it and I'll call those
the public API of this component it has
a managed lifecycle consisting of a
constructor and a couple of functions
that can transition the component
between different states and then it has
relationships to other components on
which it depends now if this looks
suspiciously like the definition of an
object from object-oriented programming
that's because it is I took this
definition or I stole this definition
almost word-for-word from literature on
object oriented design patterns with one
one key difference and that is that
really with components I'm only
interested in behavior object-oriented
patterns and object-oriented programming
tends to combine data about a thing and
the functions that operate on it I'm
primarily interested in the behavior and
the processes there will be some state
that I need to do that but it's largely
incidental so the most common type of
component that I end up using and the
one that sort of set me down on this
path is a simple state wrapper I have
some stateful objects say a connection
to a database and I'm not using a nice
database like des Tomic so I actually
have to keep track of this expensive
connection object that I create once and
then pass everywhere in my probe
so I'm going to take two things the
configuration for this which is just a
hostname
and the runtime state and encapsulate
them together in this record which I've
called DB then I'm going to adopt a
convention that this object this DB
record will be opaque to most pieces of
my code they'll use it they'll have it
they'll pass it around but they won't
actually be looking inside it it's as if
this were a Java object and those host
and con were private fields in that
object except I'm not actually going to
enforce that because I don't need to so
then I'll write my public API I'll write
some functions that use this component
to accomplish some task now each of
these functions is going to take the
component as its argument usually the
first argument so these functions are
actually working with the DB component
they are part of its API they can have
side effects they can do computation
they can do whatever I want and in
particular they can use the internal
state of this component it's as if these
were public methods on a class with
private fields in that class that they
can refer to so I'm just adopting these
conventions of visibility and what is
allowed to see what that will help me
create boundaries between different
parts of my program then I have to
provide a constructor for my component
now I could just reuse the default def
record constructor but in this case I'm
going to write a little constructor
function that just uses the static
configuration to create the initial
state of the component in particular
this constructor does not have any side
effects now this is the first of several
differences between the system I
described in closure in the large and
the patterns I talked about there and
the patterns I'm talking about in this
talk and I'll try to keep track of those
differences as I go on
so no side effects in the constructor
then I have probably the most famous
piece of code I ever wrote the lifecycle
protocol now I talked about this in
closure in the large and there have been
many different versions of it people
have come up with their own extensions
and variations of this but I have a
slightly different version of it now
that I've actually put into a library
called component it's two methods start
and stop they take a component as an
argument and they will return a
component as an argue there's also a
default implementation of this that is
just a no op it returns whatever you
pass in so if you don't implement this
the default will be don't change
anything so if I'm implementing this
protocol on my database component for
example I provide start and stop
implementations which may have side
effects they can do things they can
create connections to external resources
they could create internal resources
like threads or channels and then
they're going to associated onto the
component itself this is another key
difference from closure in the large in
that talk I only described start and
stop for their side effects now I'm
saying start and stop have side effects
but they also have a return value and
that will become important later so I
have to return a possibly updated
version of the component that was passed
in and remember the component is a
record so it's an immutable data
structure I can create a new version of
it to return the next type of component
is one that simply provides a service to
other components so let's say my
application needs to send email because
every application needs to send email
and let's say I'm using some email API
service that requires these two bits of
configuration an endpoint URL and an API
key well I can put those two things
together there isn't actually any
runtime state to keep track of but I
know that in or
to send email I need those two bits of
configuration so I'll encapsulate them
together in this record called email and
then I'll write a public API function
that takes the email component as its
argument and provides the service it
does the thing that it needs to do in
this case sending an email so anyone
else who wants to send email they need
an instance of this record but they
don't need to know anything about
endpoint or API key they don't need to
know the mechanics of how sending email
works finally probably the most
interesting kind of component and the
one that took me the longest to really
figure out how to describe is a domain
model I can take some subset of
functionality in my application and
represent it as a component I can make
it into a data structure now again this
is where we start to differ a little bit
from the typical object-oriented
approach in a typical object-oriented
app like Java you'd expect to have a
customer class which would both have
data representing a single customer and
methods that define the behavior and the
operations you can do on a customer this
customers component is all about
behavior it basically represents a set
of aggregate operations things I might
want to do with customers but the actual
customer data itself can just be
ordinary closure data we like that it's
useful so what this does primarily is
encapsulate a set of related
dependencies so maybe I know in my
application in order to deal with
customers to satisfy the services that I
need for customers I need access to the
database and I need to be able to send
email so I'll put those as fields in the
customers component now I could actually
use a map here it would work just as
well but I like giving things names so
I'll call it customers and use a record
but a map would work exactly the same
way
then I can define the API for the
customers component I'll have this
function to notify a customer I want to
tell the customer something and I'm
going to do that by sending them email
so the customers component is the first
argument to this function and then it
uses those fields to get its
dependencies so it gets DB and email out
of its local state it doesn't need to
reach out to some broader more global
context to find those things then once
it has them it can invoke those
components through their public API s
now notice I haven't said anything here
about what DB and email are in this
component I haven't said where they come
from what type they are or anything else
all I know is that they will be provided
to this component and that I can call
them using these functions so DB is
something on which I can call query and
email is something on which I can call
send and that's all this component needs
to know now when I construct this
component I'm going to add something new
I'm going to use this function that's in
my library called using using just takes
a component which I've constructed using
the default def record map to record
constructor and a collection of keys and
those keys are the names of that
components dependency actually all it's
doing is adding some metadata on to the
component but I'm declaring that this
component customers depends on something
named DB and something named email in
particular I am NOT passing the
dependencies in the constructor function
this is another difference from what I
described in closure in the large all
I'm going to do is declare my
dependencies and they'll get filled in
later
so I have these components I've done
three so far and I have some dependency
relationships that I've declared between
them now I want to put them together and
I do that in what I call a system or a
collection of components a system in
this case is just really just a map I
provide this little helper function to
construct it it basically just makes a
record and for all practical purposes I
can treat that record like a closure map
the purpose of a system is to associate
components with names those names are
usually key words although they don't
have to be so I have three components
which I'm constructing for this system
and I'm assigning each one a name within
the scope of the system so the system
itself is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of the components it contains
and providing them with their
dependencies so here's how it works
system map is just a function it takes
keys and values and it returns an
instance of this system map record that
I've defined
now remember closure records are maps
they can have any arbitrary keys
associated onto them so I didn't need to
say in advance that customers DB and
email we're going to be the keys in this
system that's just what I happen to put
in it the only difference with system
map the only thing that distinguishes it
from an ordinary map is it has its own
implementation of the lifecycle protocol
built in so a system knows how to start
and stop itself and in particular it
knows how to do that by starting all of
the components it contains so when I
call start on a system it's going to go
through this procedure in order first
it's going to look at the components it
contains and see what their dependencies
are it's going to read off that metadata
that the using function added on to my
records so it sees that customers
depends on DB and email and it knows
that it has things called DB and email
then it's going to sort all the
components in order it's going to build
a graph of
all the dependencies and then do a
topological sort on that graph to figure
out what order the components should be
started in then it's going to call start
on each component in order it's going to
step through the components in
dependency order and start them all by
calling the lifecycle start method when
it gets to a component that has
dependencies like customers in this
example it's going to first associate
its dependencies into it
remember records or Maps whichever these
are I can just a sews onto them and I've
declared that customers needs DB and
email so I'm going to a so Stevie an
email from the system into customers and
once I've done that then I can start
customers so I know that by the time I
call components start on customers DB
and email have already been started and
they've been a so stay
customers so we get all of these started
components remember each time we call
start it returns potentially a new
version of the component with some new
state in it we assess the last step that
the system does when it's starting
itself so now I have my components
connected together and they're all
started and it's all happened in the
right order stopping a system is the
same procedure it just goes in the
reverse order it goes from customers
back up to the least dependent things in
the system so in this has allowed me to
connect a component to its dependencies
I've basically injected email and DB
into customers finding them in the
system now in the object-oriented
literature about patterns and design
there's a lot of talk about dependency
injection and these two sort of
competing schools of thought on how you
should do it you can do constructor
based injection where you inject
dependencies of
of a thing when you construct that thing
or you can do setter injection where you
actually mutate the thing to give its
dependencies to it when we have
immutable maps as our components we can
do something else we can actually do
associative injection so say I've got my
system with my three components in it
and I want to write some tests but I
don't want my tests to actually send
real email and I don't want them to use
my actual production database I can
create new versions of these components
that are just for testing purposes and
then if I want to include them in my
system all I have to do is call Assos
ordinary closure Essos remember a system
is a record a record is a map I can a so
solemn app so I can replace email and DB
in my system with alternate
implementations provided I do this
before starting it remember everything
is going to get connected together when
I call start so before calling start I
can do whatever I want to this map I can
replace components add components remove
components and then when I start that's
when things will get connected and start
using each other so just as an example
say I wanted a stub version of my email
service for testing purposes well I'll
do one thing first I have to take my
send function and turn it into something
that I can dispatch on I'll turn it into
a protocol in this case I could also use
a multi method would have the same
effect but I need to establish some
boundaries I swap out a different
implementation of this component in this
case I'm using a protocol so then my
original email service would implement
this protocol and I can write a stub
implementation of the service that
doesn't do whatever the external side
affecting thing is in fact what this
stub email implementation does is take
whatever calls I give to it whatever
operations I ask it to do turn them into
data structures that little map in the
there and put them on a core async
channel and then I create the channel
with a buffer in it so that I can sort
of collect any calls made to this
component and verify that they were what
I expected I can use this as a mock in
my test now for something like a
database I'm not going to try to mock
out an entire database that's far too
much work it's too complicated too many
things too many operations to support
unless of course your database is
diatomic in which case it's really easy
so but what I will do is I'll create an
alternate version of my database wrapper
component that creates and destroys a
unique copy of the database every time I
want to use it so I'll use this for
testing or local development every time
I start this it's going to create a new
uniquely named database and then it's
going to destroy it when I stop it so I
can use this in development I can use it
in my tests and be certain that every
time I use this database it's going to
be in a fresh known well understood
state now I might use a local database
server to do this I might use an
in-memory database whatever is the
quickest way to get this working this is
how I'll develop and test my application
so now when I get to actually testing
the business logic I want to test that
customers component I want to do that in
a unit test when I do that I can create
a completely isolated system in which to
run it I can start my test system that I
create for this test alone and I know
it's not going to be affected by any
other tests in the system I could even
run my tests in parallel and they're not
going to interfere with each other so I
just pull out the things that I want to
look at I pull out the customers
component I pull out the email component
which is my stub implementation and then
I can make a call to one component and
verify the results in another and
because all of the dependencies get
passed through the call chain
nothing is ever looking at global scope
that makes it very easy to write a test
that could include asynchronous
operations now this particular example
doesn't actually do that but suppose
that notify we're going through several
layers of asynchrony dispatching to a
thread pool or a channel or a message
queue or some other thing that might
happen some point later in time I don't
know when I can be sure that whatever
version of email ends up at the end of
that chain it should be the same version
that I passed in when I created this
test system here and the reason I like
this is that pretty much the only other
mechanism that I've seen commonly for
doing this in closure for substituting
in an alternate implementation operates
at the level of individual VARs you can
either use with read ifs which is global
across your entire program or binding
which is confined to a thread but in
either case both with read F's and
binding are delimited in time they
specify a scope of time in which this
alternate world is true and that can
lead to problems if I have different
notions of time in my program if I have
things happening asynchronously on
different threads or may be happening at
an unpredictable time I could have
potential race conditions in my tests
and I've run into this a lot where I'm
trying to test something that has mocks
or stubs in place and then it works
some of the time and it doesn't work
other times or my personal favorite you
run it on a faster or slower machine and
all the tests start failing that's
really annoying so you know these are
these are useful tools with read Epps
and binding both have very good uses but
if you're trying to test some data flow
that could be asynchronous they can run
into problems another thing I don't like
about substituting at the VAR level is
it really feels like the wrong
vil of granularity usually I don't want
to replace a single function I want to
replace a whole group of functions
I want to replace the database or the
email service so just by having to
replace individual VARs within a test I
have a risk what happen all the time but
I have a strong risk that I'll end up
with a test that's very tightly coupled
to the implementation if I change some
subtle detail of how these VARs get used
in whatever code defines them I might
end up breaking my tests inadvertently
so now I've got my components I've put
them together in a system I've connected
them all together so they all know how
to talk to each other what do I do with
them one thing I don't want to do is
take that big system map and then pass
it as an argument to every function of
the program that puts me right back
where I started with the one big map and
it has all the same problems instead
what I'm going to do is find key entry
points in my application and insert
specific components at those entry
points an entry point is just any place
that your code starts running the most
obvious example is the main function if
you control the main you control how
your application starts up and this is
all it needs to do then it's easy just
create a system and start it you're done
if I'm using a some sort of management
framework let's say I'm using Apache
Commons daemon or J SVC and I'm using
that as a container for my application
well that requires that I implement this
interface with these methods in it and I
might need to add a mutable container to
hold the system so I have one piece of
mutable state in my application and
that's to hold the system object so that
these different entry points at which I
get called init start and stop will all
work
the most common case though probably is
web apps and here this is sort of an
unfortunate habit that I think we've
fallen into just because it seems easy
at first and that is to define things
like a routing table or a web handler
statically this routing table and this
handler function are created by wrapping
a bunch of functions this is wrapping
say ring middlewares around a function
but it's doing that when this file gets
loaded it's doing it statically at
compile time which means there's no
place in here that I could inject any
runtime state I would have to refer to
some global variable somewhere in order
to get that state back into my web
handling function but it turns out you
can actually work around this fairly
easily I need to instead of defining
that route handler function statically I
need to provide a constructor function
to build that function here I've called
it make handler and I've added an extra
little piece of middleware that wraps
that function in something that's just
going to associate a component into the
call chain in this case I'm assuming
it's a ring
request and I'm going to associate a
component called web app into that
request so this make handler function
I'll call it when I'm starting up the
application to build up the handler
function dynamically and at that point
it can close over a web app component
that I've constructed so then I might
have a web server component that uses
jetty or neti or whatever my web server
is and when I'm starting that I will
call the function that actually creates
the route handler function that the
server infrastructure is going to use
now in this example I've assumed there's
one component called web app and it
represents my entire web application it
might end up depending on everything
else or it might not but I could do it
different ways this is very open I could
have
a different component for each and every
route in my application that might make
sense for an API type service I could
have different components for different
subsets of routes in my application
whatever I want to do I just have to
make sure they're available at the right
point and inject them into the call
stack so there are all sorts of tricks
that you can do with this the amount of
code in this framework I've created is
tiny it's really just shuffling maps
around there's not a lot to it
but you can do things like define your
own lifecycle functions you can rename
the dependencies of a component in my
example DB and email had the same name
in the system that they had in the
customers component but that doesn't
have to work that way I could use
different names in the system and the
component and show the mapping of how
they get renamed one thing this
framework does not deal with is runtime
state changes you can bring the whole
system up and you can shut the whole
system down but you can't change part of
it at runtime but closure has perfectly
good tools for doing this already if you
need something to be mutable at runtime
add a mutable reference put an atom or
of Ora ref or an agent or a channel
inside your component and that can
exhibit change at runtime another thing
I should mention is that systems are
themselves components they obey all the
same properties so in theory you could
compose systems of systems that are
nested I've actually never found a use
case for this and I'm not even sure it's
a good idea but maybe there's some
situation where you'd actually want to
do this I generally find it easier if
the systems are all flat and all the
components live at the same level so
here's an example if you wanted to make
your own life cycle I've seen some API
is in Java for example that define for
life cycle methods like init start stop
and destroy
defining your own life cycle is very
easy you just need to provide your own
version of system map you need to define
your lifecycle functions whether they're
protocols or multi methods and implement
them on all your components and then
provide your own version of system map
that calls them in the right way and
there you can make use of these two
helpers update system and update system
reverse this is how the component
library I've written actually implements
start and stop on systems update system
just takes any arbitrary function you
pass it and calls it on each component
in dependency order while doing the
associate of dependencies at the same
time update system reverse does the same
thing it just goes in Reverse dependency
order so this is very simple it's just
Maps which means I actually discovered
things I could do with these systems
after I'd started working with them one
of the most fun for me to discover was
that I could take two system maps and
merge them if I have an application that
has two three however many different
systems and let's say I'm going to
deploy them to production on different
machines they're actually going to be
running in different processes but if I
want to test them locally in a single
process I can just merge them together
remember systems or records records or
Maps I can call merge on to Maps and get
a bigger map that has all the contents
of both and if I know I'm going to do
that I can use name space qualified keys
for the components that are different in
the different systems and then use the
same names for components that are going
to be reused this is fantastic for
testing now I can actually simulate
running two different applications
without duplicating any of the code or
any of the runtime state that I need to
use them
so like I said this is not a lot of code
you could probably all go home and write
this yourselves just from the
description that I've given here but it
does have some real advantages the
biggest one being it forces you to think
about the boundaries between different
parts of your code what does this piece
of code need to do what does it need to
use in terms of services and state doing
this actually makes it easier to test
and refactor your code and possibly even
separate pieces of a program into
different programs I've actually used
this technique to take a big monolithic
application and split it up into smaller
pieces another advantage is it takes the
ordering of dependencies and makes it
automatic you no longer need to think
about which component gets started
before which other thing that's built
into the library it does it
automatically based on the relationships
that you declare as we've seen it's very
easy to swap in alternate
implementations all you have to do is a
sews onto a map it's hard to get much
easier than that and then within a
component we know that everything is at
most one map lookup away everything is
local in any given function that we need
to call but adding a new dependency into
a component is easy we just add a new
key to its declared set of dependencies
now it's not perfect I'm not going to
claim this is the only way to write apps
and it has one big disadvantage which is
that if you're going to do this it
really only works if you build your
entire app around this model it is if
you only use this pattern in one small
part of your application you won't get
most of the benefits and it's quite a
lot of work to refactor an existing
application to use this model everywhere
although I have done it and it does then
make the application easier to test and
refactor in the future another thing is
and this is kind of just a nuisance you
end up with lots of these little maps
everywhere they could be records that
could be maps it works the same way but
you're going
end up doing a lot of destruction almost
every API function will be destructuring
some stuff out of its component map at
the top this doesn't bother me
personally some people get irritated by
it you could mitigate it somewhat with
macros although I think again in my
opinion the added complexity of macros
is not worth the small amount of typing
you'd save by doing that
another thing I've run into is that the
system map after you've started it ends
up being quite large it has a lot of
repetition every component may be
repeated at multiple places in the map
now that's fine from a memory point of
view because they're all the same
persistent data structure but it means
you can't just print this thing out or
log it and expect to be able to look at
it and see that it's correct
another limitation as I mentioned is
that this only works for the whole
system at once
there is no facility in this library as
I've written it to start or stop just a
subset of the system so you couldn't
imagine you couldn't use this as a
runtime tool to bring different parts of
a system up and down while the whole
program continues to run that would
require a very different model it would
probably have to have more mutability
built into it and finally there's a
little bit of boilerplate you have to
write constructor functions you have to
declare metadata I don't think it's very
much you know there's no XML
configuration here that you have to
write so it's pretty easy and we've
reached the end of our time there's the
library you can get it you can pester me
with questions and thank you all for
