the word impossible has no meaning they
said it could not be done they said you
could not do dynamic JVM bytecode
compilation on Android but he didn't
know that so he said oh it's no problem
I'll just feed the Android dalvik
compiler into itself and run it on the
Android platform and so feed closures
byte codes through that it's like you
know turtles eating their own tails I
don't even know how it works but he's
done some amazing work and he's here to
talk about closure and Android this is
Daniel Solano Gomez thank you anyone who
can't hear me please raise your hand
excellent I'm going to be talking today
about closure and Android and there we
go also this could be called closure in
small places or a closure to go I'm
going to talk a little bit about how the
Android and its delville machine differ
from the Java Virtual Machine and what
this means for closure I'll talk about
how i got dynamic compilation to work
and i'll talk about closures performance
on android in some ways that we can
improve closure development on android
as a whole so what is android to quote
the documentation android is a software
stack for mobile devices that provides
an operating system middleware and key
applications so what this looks like in
this is at architectural at the lowest
level we have the Linux kernel yeah
built above that our libraries that are
written generally in C or C++ and the
first part of the Android architecture
its unique to Android is the end the
dalvik virtual machine in the Android
runtime and what the parts that you see
here in blue are all written in Java so
there's some core classes and then
there's the actual application framework
that developers used to develop Android
applications and finally there's the
applications themselves so the good news
to this is that we can reuse and
leverage a lot of the Java ecosystem
that exists out there in terms of tools
and libraries the bad news unfortunately
is that the Java VM is not the dalvik VM
and they difference in very important
ways so what are these ways there's some
fairly technical things that it gets
your into developing VMs some of these
things will mean something to you but
what are the really important ways for
an application developer is Android
machines are essentially you're doing
embedded development so you don't have
much in the way of CPU power or heap and
some of the really important ways that
really impact us as application
developers is that the API is provided
by Android are not quite the same ones
that you get in standard Java and most
importantly that the executable format
on Android is not the same as the one
that's used on dalvik which is called a
davek executable or add X file so when
you compile something in Java you get a
class fund the class file contains a
header a constant pool which contains
things such as class constants but also
other things such as method names and
class names and then some other stuff
which includes the
the code itself that you're interested
in running so in a given application
you'll normally have lots of these
different class files and they're
generally packaged up in a jar file one
of the problems at least for android is
that a lot of the constants in these
constant pools are repeated and from one
class to another and so they have their
own optimized file format the Dex file
that has its own header and its own
constant pool but as you add classes to
this Dex file it doesn't repeat any of
the constants so adding a B and C we
have only one copy of each constant and
this leads to a big reduction in the
application sizes I think off the top of
my head closure the jar file is about I
think three megabytes or abouts it
compiles down to about a one megabyte
Dex file so this dex files included in a
container just like a jar file which is
called an APK our android package and
this is a this is what your users use to
install onto their device and so when
that happens the user will unpack the
decks or the the the Android runtime
will unpack the Dex file and perform
some verification in optimization and
the result is an optimized the decks
filer Oh Dex file and that is the actual
byte codes that Android will run so what
does this mean in practice as you can
tell from all the steps we had to go
through this is a very heavy weight
process it takes a lot of a lot of time
and in particular right now dynamically
loading bytecode into Android from like
an array of bytes in memory isn't
supported there are plans to do that at
some point in the future but there's no
idea when that will happen or how it
will be
when that happens so this means that if
you're interested in developing for
Android you have a choice of between
strictly or ahead of time compiled
program languages such as Java closure
kavinsky Mira and Scala or you can use
interpreted languages like JRuby bean
shell or JavaScript on rhino so dynamic
compilation I think we probably all know
here why we want to do it one of the
wonderful things about closure is a
dynamic ripple driven development
typically when you're doing android
development you can spend you know up to
a minute or more depending on the size
of your application waiting for a new
change here code to get redeployed in
comparison like right here i have my
rebel running and so i can for example
say hello and so this is reading and
evaluating and you get the result now
say i'm working on the rebel itself and
at this line of code which i'm not sure
that many of you will be able to see
sets up the little prompt with the
namespace so let's try doing something a
little bit different
so now I am sending that s expression to
Android and it just compiled so I can
execute this again and we see that my
prompt has changed
let me find okay there we go so this
sort of thing I used when developing the
repple and I'll tell you what it makes a
huge difference in productivity when
trying to create an application so to
review what happens when you're trying
to compile some closure code as we all
know you have some code it gets read
into data structure and it gets emitted
eventually into a class file and what
we'd really like on Android is is to get
an o Dex file out of this unfortunately
with the stock closure we cannot do that
so how do we accomplish that right now
enclosure v there is a class called
dynamic class loader and this class is
in or isn't is tasked with the
responsibility of once you have some
emitted bike codes creating or
instantiating the class that the that
the runtime can then use so what I've
done is I split this up into two
different implementations we have the
JVM dynamic class loader which works you
know just as before and we have the
dalvik dynamic class loader which does
some extra work so what is this extra
work we have the first few steps that
come from closure itself this next step
taking that class file in creating a Dex
file out of it I do by using some of the
code that comes from the Android SDK and
so this process takes place in memory I
then package that Dex file into a small
APK that it's saved on to the file
system and at that point I can use the
Android SDK to load up that Dex file and
make it available for use so how do we
know which one of these things to use I
created a new VAR enclosure core for the
different vm types and i look at the
system property java that vm
name to see am i running on dalvik or
not and if so I can set that bar to the
appropriate value and change the
behavior of closure itself and so one of
the consequences of being able to
accomplish this is a new dependency on
that piece of code that can turn a class
file into a Dex file and right now I'm
just pulling the necessary classes out
of the dxtr that comes to the android
sdk unfortunately i have found that this
is somewhat fragile process and really a
source based dependency is a better way
to go my dynamic class loading logic can
work on pretty much all modern versions
of android only over ninety seven
percent you know can use this code and
as far as closure itself is considered
concerned you know what can you or can
you not do on closure with the dynamic
compilation aspect of android and really
you can do pretty much everything I have
found or some people have found that
some macros can win their compiling
below the stack also any api's enclosure
that depend upon api's are not in
android like the java that beans package
or enclosure 1.3 the closure triple
namespace those things won't work but
just about everything else will work
just fine and to maintain compatibility
outside of android i've ensured that any
android related classes are loaded
reflectively so that way you don't have
to include all this extra stuff if
you're not interested in running on end
on Android itself so you know how does
it perform what I performed an
experiment where I have an absolute
minimal hello world type app and
implemented it in several different
languages and I just want to see you
know how much overhead
does the language create so the first
one that that's of interest is package
size Android users are oftentimes
downloading your application over
expensive or slow internet connections
wireless internet connections so the
idea is is that the smaller that you can
keep your package the better it is for
for your user likewise once its
installed on the machine and gets all
expanded you want to keep it as small as
possible because you know these machines
don't have that much that much in the
way of disk space and usually there's
only about a gigabyte or so allocated
for applications the big thing that your
users are going to realize is that when
you want to start your application how
long does it take from the point where
they tap on the application icon and
they see something on the string and at
least on my Nexus S phone the minimum
which you know comes from Java and Scott
is about 400 milliseconds I found that
closure takes about 2.3 seconds there
abouts so whether or not this is
acceptable really depends on the type of
application that you're running some
applications are going to be taking a
long time to load anyway because they're
either pulling something off the network
or pulling something off disk and so an
extra 2.4 seconds might not make that
much of a difference but other
applications you really want to pop up
as soon as the user clicks on something
and so this is one of the I think
probably the biggest drawback right now
to closure on Android likewise as i
mentioned android phones in tablets are
generally relatively small spaces you
don't have a lot of heap available for
you and so you want to keep the amount
of overhead that comes from your tools
in your language from from beating too
big because the more it takes up the
less you have for your application and I
find that
closure adds about 1.2 megabytes to your
heap so where did all the time and space
go unfortunately its closure that core
this is something we can't really get
rid of so i did some benchmarking and
profiling or profiling our showed you
the benchmarking i'll show you profiling
and the biggest consumer of memory about
it a fifth of it is the closure core
underscore underscore in it class which
is the classic kind of bootstraps a
namespace and as i understand that most
of this is just due to all the metadata
that's included as part of closure at
course so all your doc strings and argue
lists and all these sorts of things
which don't really matter for your
application they're loaded into memory
anyway some other big space hogs that we
see here are some of the namespace
mappings themselves these are the
objects that have all the symbols in the
mappings to the appropriate VARs and one
of the things that surprised me is the
in and out these are the wrappers to
system Dutton and system that out which
are useful if you're doing stuff on a
closure rebel but on an Android
application you don't really need these
so what about time I created another
exam or another experiment where I have
a java application that executes this
one line of code which is in charge us
call ads 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and so I wanted to see
you know how long does this take and I
ran this within the same application
twice so I had a button that I just
press it and adds 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and what we
see here is that the code the time that
it takes to actually execute you know
dereference you know getting the VAR and
invoking it is very very small about a
you know listen to
millisecond but the first time that you
try it it takes nearly eight seconds now
don't pay too much attention on the
specific number this is done using a
memory are a method profiler so this is
much slower but the magnitudes are
really what's of interest here so what
took so long there it's loading that
runtime class is what took all the time
in particular as part of the class
construction and there's a doin net
method and what that do init method is
two different things one it loads the
closure coordinating space and that's
something that we need and we want but
it also creates the user name space and
imports all the binding or the binding
some closure core into that user name
space and again if you're working on the
ripple that's great that gives you your
place to experiment but on your Android
application you don't really need that
and I find that commenting out that
those lines of code and rerunning my
experiment that it did take off about 18
of that clue loading time which was
about 300 milliseconds one other thing
that you would notice when running this
benchmark is there is a lot of garbage
collection going on the concurrent
garbage collector on my device kicks off
about five or six times during that load
of closure core and what we see here is
there's an immense amount of object
churn about a three hundred percent
turnover rate and as I understand it
this is where as a result of building up
all that made of data and since we have
the are persistent data structures which
we all know and love unfortunately here
they're hurting us a little bit so what
are some ideas for improving performance
one as I mentioned at least on Android
you can get rid of that user name space
we don't need it removing mated that as
an idea that i know is out there that a
is something that some of closure core
is looking into and I think that would
help out immensely I don't know if this
is possible or not I mean somebody ideas
also to help or either maybe using some
sort of transient while you're loading
since you know that at least at that
point you should directly only be
running in a single thread or if there's
some way to just going to serialize
everything so that you can just kind of
unload it from from disk or memory or
what are into memory ultimately I think
one thing that would help a lot but a is
a very difficult problem would be some
sort of tree shaker that can analyze
your code and figure out what functions
you're not using and just make sure they
don't get compiled in but I think some
of these other things are probably
easier and more likely to happen so
aside from proving and performance there
are some other sorts of things that can
help closure development for android one
of these i think is some sort of
standard library and i started working
on on something earlier in the year
which i call neco and it mostly just is
a library to help you with a lot of the
the boilerplate that's that becomes
necessary in dealing with androids very
object oriented AP is to you know kind
of smooth it out and make it more
friendly to closures functional approach
and I'd really love i guess i need to
probably bring this up on a devel
mailing list but left to maybe see this
become a contrib library so what kind of
development tools can we improve can be
improved what kind of developmental
would help us improve the development
experiments experience one of which have
mitch's is a dynamic compilation version
of closure which is available on github
and has been for some time unfortunately
I have had the time to really care for
it and update it to closure 1.3 and as I
mentioned earlier
a better more robust dependency on the
DX jar would be better and I would love
for some of these changes to be
integrated into the mainstream closure i
have included in the standard library
some xml files that can help you
integrate with the Android SDKs build
process to just make it easier to
integrate closure into our project it'd
be really nice to see like a lining in
plug-in or something you know for that's
more closure friendly for people who are
interested in doing this sort of
development likewise I am one of those
vim users and and as I showed you that I
included a vim closure you know server
component into my rebel which helped me
in my own development and I think it'd
be really great to see like a swank
server or other such tools to help
people who prefer other editors to be
able to have the same sort of
development experience so to wrap things
up I want to mention a little bit about
closure script this is something I had
really hoped to be able to take some
more time to look into in depth
unfortunately I didn't so I'm giving you
some thoughts kind of off the top of my
head more or less I mean of course if
you're having a web app there's nothing
keeps you from using closure script
there are a number of cross-platform
development frameworks that use
JavaScript I don't know how well they
would work together with closure script
I guess it's the interrupt problem that
we're talking about earlier today now as
far as actual doing native development
with JavaScript or closure script right
now the main problem are the JavaScript
engines that are available for the JVM
there's rhino which is very slow
there is v8 which I believe has imported
to Android but unfortunately that works
at kind of a native C C++ layer so it
doesn't really give you a good
opportunity to access the Android API s
there's been suggested of using the
script Erlang scripting layer for
Android but unfortunately it doesn't do
a very good job of exposing all of the
Android API is either to do a complex
GUI with the SL for a I find you have to
use a web view so it's essentially like
writing a web app i think that overall
closure has what it takes to be a really
great first class language for android
development and in particular I think
the dynamic rebel driven aspect of it is
a killer feature it changes the way that
you develop instead of having to maybe
try to code as much as you can in so
that way you can invoice ol you know
waiting a minute minute and a half for
to be able to see what happens in your
code it's still not as fast you can do
it in a few seconds using this sort of
ripple back end that's installed on the
device itself and I think that if we
have more community involvement in
developing some of these tools that I've
mentioned then I think you know we can
see closure becoming a really great
language for Android development and as
a result I'll a suggestion from
yesterday's birds of a feather session I
have created a mailing list closure
Android to help help against this
community can have built up and start
coordinating and I'll put a posting to
the main closure mailing list to let
people know about that I am working on a
book for O'Reilly it's called
decaffeinated Android so it's about
developing android applications without
using Java
and my primary focus is on JVM languages
so we'll see Scala enclosure at least
being the first two languages that I
tackle so this will probably be coming
out sometime next year and that's it for
me any questions I guess mud the closure
rubble is available on the android
market you can scan the QR code or just
look it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
