familiar to many of you but for anyone
who doesn't know him
ciao sir is the guy who puts mean and
nasty in the closure community right
he's that guy who's out there on IRC
just blaming people not being helpful at
all just just totally vicious viciously
abusing folks along with his compatriot
focus also just known for being a terror
it all seriousness Couser is a great
resource he was hugely helpful to me
when I was writing the book
nobody would offer any feedback on the
macro chapter and and rich just laughed
at me said haha you have to explain
macros in chels are over the course of
one long evening went through it and
offered a ton of good suggestions
probably holding back only a few things
to put into joy of closure instead also
very excited for Chow sir that that he
has joined the Lona cloud team if you
have not met the Lona cloud guys they
are the purveyors of fine water bottles
and also and also cloud software and
there's a bunch of those guys here
really cool and they have a rapidly
growing closure team if anyone here is
interested in working in closure and I
have to say on a personal basis that
it's definitely at least the second best
place I could possibly have been happy
seeing you in depth so very excited for
lunar cloud and for you and without
further ado Chou's was going to talk to
us about closure script
close your script under the hood okay so
as Stewart just said I'm not at century
data systems anymore as it says in the
program I just started at law no cloud
this week so feel free to ask me
anything you want about that I won't
have the answer but you can ask so I've
given one or two talks about
clojurescript now the guys from Chicago
will remember one of those and it turns
out that I had end up having to say the
word closure a lot in a lot of different
context I mean slightly different things
so what we're gonna well here's
something that I found myself saying
recently this snippet of closure causes
the closure script compiler to produce a
closure in JavaScript that uses a
closure script protocol extended to a
Google closure type not only will I get
this wrong but it won't make any sense
anyway so I'm gonna try at least for the
period of this talk to use some slightly
different terms that will hopefully be
more clear I will refer to regular
closure by which I mean mainly closure
JVM the original implementation although
most of the things that I'll say about
that are true for closure CLR as well I
will try to refer to close your script
as clj s because it sounds more
different and then G closure fortunately
I don't plan to talk about the closure
language construct or Google's compiler
so we can just leave those out for now
all right so here is what I want to talk
about today there's a lot of cool things
going on people using clgs and
interesting ways I've heard a couple
stories already I know there's other
things going on out there I'm afraid
that this is not gonna be a slick demo
or even an overview of of clgs as a
whole there are some tutorials mark
McGranahan wrote a article recently
that's great for sort of getting your
feet wet getting you started giving you
a good overview about how it works at a
higher level and how to take advantage
of it what I was hoping to do with
something more in depth here
unfortunately we don't have time to do a
complete study of the entire system so
instead I'm going to try
take a narrow dive here starting with
the datatypes and digging on down
through the protocols that undergird
those the macros that are used to
generate the protocol code and then if
we have time we'll look at the compiler
underneath that so it's it's not a broad
survey but it's hopefully a cohesive
narrow dive through some of the guts of
clojurescript itself the one one thing I
struggled with through this talk is
trying to find some way to tie these
concepts together
I drew a pyramid the way the different
layers interact with each other isn't
really analogous with each other so it's
just a visual aid here so don't read too
much into that okay yeah we're start by
looking at data types here are three of
the collection types that have literal
syntax and clgs there's one other one I
left out which one is that you speak up
list yes list of course I left that list
good I didn't want to talk about it so
here's a vector and this is actually the
closure script vector implementation clj
has core vector and it's a data type
with two fields metadata field for
holding onto the metadata that you need
and the other is a regular JavaScript
array simple JavaScript array so it's
very lightweight to create these things
what it means though it's much less
complex than the regular closure vector
right which has structural sharing and
things going on currently in clgs we
don't have that so this is essentially
copy-on-write
in order to provide the semantics we
expect from a vector so any change if
you use a social conjure anything on a
clgs vector you'll get a whole new
JavaScript array and a new CL JS vector
around it okay now let's see if I set
this up right hopefully you can actually
try this out can you see the can you see
the bottom the top part of the bottom
pane there as well okay good you can't
not even the top part I'm sorry right
here it says a regular closure repple
can you see that line oh is it too small
scary okay that's gonna mess things up
but we'll go with it anyway okay all
right we will try to make do I'm sorry
about that okay so what we've got here
on the top is a regular closure repple
but it has loaded up in it the CL Jas
compiler and environment stuff so that
we can interact with it so we're sort of
poking at clgs from the outside and
here's a little macro we'll try to scoot
it up their little macro called Jas that
I wrote for the talk it's it's based on
code that rich had in the original
implementation and it just takes a form
and prints out what the JavaScript
equivalent of this is so we can see what
one of these vectors actually looks like
when it gets compiled of JavaScript so
there you can see it's calling the from
a write function of a vector object and
here is that literal JavaScript array
that we were talking about all right so
this is not this is not a vector here on
the inside this is JavaScript code so
this is a three element JavaScript array
and you can see that the closure script
expression for a three plus four got
compiled right in there all right
simple enough makes sense right okay so
that is
vector the next one is map
so in clgs we have two types that
implement maps in regular closure of
course we've got several that are used
in various ways array map hash map clgs
doesn't have any of the sorted
collections yet but the reason we have
these two implementations is
specifically so that one of them can
take advantage of how javascript engines
what javascript engines are good at so
abdill clgs maps whose keys are string
like and what I mean by string like is
strings keywords and symbols so as long
as your CL j s map has keys entirely
made up of those you will be using a
knob map underneath so you can see this
one has a few more fields we've got
again the metadata field we've got a
array of all the keys that is useful for
iterating since in JavaScript it's hard
to correctly iterate through an object
and then we have this trick stur object
I'm sorry I say for there's three fields
there the string object there is a
object that holds exactly what you would
expect for a map the keys are the
strings of the original object and the
values are the actual values that you
stored in it
again this is copy-on-write if you make
a change you go so sure something you'll
get a whole new observing a whole new
Straub's the reason we have hash map is
because clgs like closure promises that
you can put other things in keys in a
way that javascript doesn't handle and
it's objects right you can put numbers
you can put other collections in there
as keys and so hash map does more
complex things in order to store those
correctly the hash herbs there ends up
being a JavaScript object with keys that
are hash numbers and values are like a
bucket of
key value pairs so though both changing
and looking things up in that is a
little bit less efficient so let's take
a look at that so here's a one that has
just keywords as keys right so we ought
to be able to see you at that produces
okay so there's some interesting things
there right we've got the object so this
part is similar to vector where we have
an object that's holding essentially
what we're treating is a static method
it's a function right from AAB so here
are the two fields one is the list of
keys or sorry the JavaScript array of
keys and here is the javascript object
of the key value pairs two and five now
those question marks are my terminals
attempt to print the crazy unicode
character that we put at the front of a
string in c ljs to separate key words
from strings there's another one that
unfortunately prints exactly the same
way for symbols but that way that
there's no collision between key word
strings and symbols now down here we've
got a similar looking map but in this
case the clgs compiler doesn't know for
sure can't tell at compile time that
this expression is going to be a string
or a string like thing and in fact it's
not right it's gonna be a number so if
we look at the JavaScript for this we
will see that the compiler chooses a
hash map instead and the parameters
they're a little different here we have
two arrays of things keys and values so
from a race in this case acts a little
bit like zip map to build up the object
okay
and finally set just like in regular
closure clj set is built on top of the
languages own map type so here we just
have a clgs map currently it's always a
hash map that doesn't use the objet set
alright so those are some of the data
types that clgs provides and a little
bit about how they're implemented and
may be worth noting that those are all
implemented in clgs itself
there's clgs code that implements those
using deff type in an early version of
this talk I was going to walk through
all that but then we don't have time for
more fun stuff later so what we do have
time to look at though is how protocols
undergird all of those data types in
clgs and regular closure what we have
instead are interfaces so let's take a
look at that for a moment here so along
the top there are some of the clgs
data types it's the I added list and
then down the left are see ljs protocols
and the protocols act have the same
semantics as they do in regular closure
and then each of those X's indicates a
implementation of that data type to that
particular protocol so you can see that
Asajj I associate of things are provided
for vector and map but not for seven
lists right collections counted all
these are all all these types are
collections and are counted and can be
emptied then you can see I indexed is
only for vector and I map is only for
map and so on okay so this is actually
somewhat similar to what you would see
if you were to build a similar chart
looking at regular closures interfaces
you could have types along the top and
interfaces down the side one of the
differences is that here there is no
inherit
at all there's this is a flat list in
jail jail but there's not a difference
and that is what some people might call
the expression problem if you take a
well actually it's a very interesting um
somebody earlier I believe it was mr.
Sierra was talking about how what
interfaces you have to implement if you
are creating your own collection type in
regular closure right well here I'm
looking I've got that label goog map
there to indicate AG closure map type
okay
the G closure library provides its own
map type not sure why you'd want to use
it maybe for interrupting enclosure
script in C ljs but if you're handed one
of those in in regular closure you have
similar problems where you might have a
map coming in from again actually Google
has a has a collection library for a
Java right and there's some other ones
Apache has some so if you have a class
that you didn't write and you have
interfaces in regular closure that you'd
like it to implement you're stuck
there's no way to do without writing a
wrapper or some other kind of constructs
but because we're using protocols
because in clgs protocols are already
what's being used for the internal types
we can take some class that we didn't
write good map and extend it to clgs his
own protocols and make it work so let's
take a look at how that will actually
how we can do that
okay so what we were looking at before
here was a regular closure repla it
really is getting let me
not cutoff quite so much
what we were looking at before
was a regular closure rebel right so
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna set
that aside here for a moment
and instead look at a CL Jas rebel right
so before we were poking at the language
from the outside now we are inside a
rebel inside of clgs so what we type
here is actually going to be closure
script code okay so first I'm going to
bring in the Google structs library okay
and then create a instance of one of
their maps so because it's a map we can
call a get function on all right no no
you can't because yet is a clgs function
that expects a particular a particular
protocol to be implemented and if you
look at the error that's actually thrown
you can see that it's talking about
right there
sorry about the wrapping I didn't
realize my text was it's too small you
can see right here it's trying to call
the I look up protocols - look up method
and it says I can't find it
that's what get does get is defined in
terms of this protocol and it doesn't
know how to do it so if we want it to do
that we've got to tell it how and this
is the entire implementation for that
we're gonna use extend type here refer
to the name of the class we want to
extend or the type rather and the
protocol we want to extend it to and
then here's the implementation right
we're just gonna call a method of the
actual google map and the key that we
want it to look up if we run that now we
can do that same get on em and it will
look it up now if you notice I did not
create a wrapper
I didn't recreate the original goog map
object that object was live and still
sitting there and I changed the
definition of
are the extension of that existing
protocol to that existing class and
instance and it just works you can also
see that keyword lookups work because
clgs uses the same protocol for that as
well because I used name in the
implementation right here this is a
design decision right where I decided
that for this particular extension of
googoo
I look up that I was gonna translate all
the keys into strings so if it was a
keyword I'm gonna treat it as a string
and look it up in the method right ok
and then I'm there's some other ones I
had some other X's in that chart so
here's some implementation make those
real making goog Maps
I see cable associative and printable if
we combine all those together
now we can actually have a useful
printout of a goob Map instance and I
did it associative by pouring the
existing good map into a regular closure
clgs map and so that works as well but
you can see that the type has now been
switched underneath to a regular CL
Jasmin type okay there was something
else I wanted to say about that oh right
so the when we're looking at protocols
whether in regular closure of clgs it's
important to pay attention to who owns
the types and the protocols that you're
working with in this case I'm taking as
I said a type I don't own and a protocol
I don't control and hooking them up the
problem with that is that an entire
running system there's only one of these
cells for each combination of goog map
and say I look up so for example I had
that name call in there basically saying
it's impossible to look up an actual key
word or symbol in a Google map because I
think there's probably only gonna be
strings there if I were to put that code
that extend type call into a library and
somebody else were to do the same thing
and make a slight especially if they
were to make a slightly different
decision about how to implement that
we'd be in conflict so if you own the
data type or you own the protocol if you
you've invented the protocol and you're
extending to a bunch of types that are
out there or if you create a new
collection type and you're extending it
to existing protocols you're safe but
anytime that you aren't in control of
either one you have to follow a kind of
golden rule right and make sure that you
are willing to either back off if
somebody else does it or or fight for
your right to be to be the correct
implementation right so you have to be
aware of that and there's a real
composability issue that we
have to be aware of I think a good rule
of thumb there is to try is to avoid
putting that kind of thing in any kind
of low-level library such that it might
show up without people intending it
that's something if you really need to
combine two things it should be that you
don't know it should be a you know a
high application level thing where
people aren't going to be reusing that
code in ways that you weren't thinking
about okay
okay so we used extend type there extend
type is not a language primitive in clgs
it is a macro so we need macros in order
to get protocols the way we do and in
order to talk about macros I need to
review a little bit about the repple and
you PI can't see that in the back
there's nothing I can do about it
we'll zoom in anyway though so right we
know about this right the read eval
print loop this is familiar I want to
look a little bit closer at eval to see
what's going on there
Anthony touched on several of these
points but in the regular both CL JSON
closure follow the same pattern for what
goes on any value can split it up into
these three steps the first being
analyze and macro expand which happened
in a sort of interleaved way the result
of that is a tree with a lot more
information about the code that was
passed in originally if you are familiar
with what an ast is you would find this
tree to be very rather familiar as well
emit consumes that tree and produces
whatever the target is so in clgs that's
javascript in regular closure it's byte
code either CLR or JVM bytecode once
that's been emitted then we've got to
actually run it somehow alright cuz this
is eval we can't just have produced the
code so in eval itself in in clgs it's a
little bit pluggable right we can either
load it into a rhino instance and run it
inside the same JVM or we can send it
over the wire to a browser there's
different things we can do with that so
I want to take a look at some of these
steps individually and see exactly what
C ljs does in order to do that I'm gonna
switch back to a regular closure rebel
okay so first let's look at reading here
I've got a string version of that very
same code that we saw earlier that's
extending I look up to Google's map G
closures map
and then I'm gonna read that and put the
result in the form so that's just a
messy way to quote it right so now we
can look at the form and see that it's
exactly what we'd expect so what's the
difference between this in the string
what what is the type of value that's in
form right there it's a list very good
so it was a string now it's been read
into being a list now macro expand is
something that a lot of us are familiar
with I have to mention the env here that
clgs uses this is the compile time
environment that is being used that
contains information like what
namespaces are available what bars have
been defined in them what the current
namespace is we'll we'll see it in a
moment here I've got a little a little
one mocked up for this example so in
clgs when we use that then that
describes the environment in which the
form is going to be a macro expanded and
we can see the result of that except I
forgot to so let me do that quick look
there it is env there's the current
namespace and the context and the locals
there we go so that's what the extend
type macro is actually doing it's going
in and poking at the goog map prototype
and using namespace attributes here to
actually put the implementation right
inside the object okay so I said that
Mac or expand analysis sort of happened
intertwined a bit and so once we macro
expanded we can see what is going on
already inside to analyze but this is
going to do the full analysis and we're
gonna get to see the entire the entire
ast which which sometimes can be a
little bit verbose I don't know if you
could see
how much it goes on a bit there and a
bit more so for the rest of this we're
gonna use a slightly simpler form let's
use a get a get is another macro that is
available in clgs and again we can look
at it after it's been read you can macro
expand it so now this is another little
interesting feature of clgs that there's
this j/s star special form and this is
specifically to allow parts of clothes
clgs itself to drop down to JavaScript
where necessary so what ends up going on
here is this is basically just a sort of
a string interpolation so that each of
these parameters after they've been
compiled to JavaScript can be inserted
into those two spots so you can see it's
doing those square brackets there our
JavaScript array lookup right because
we're doing a gap so let's look at the
analysis for that
so this is a little bit smaller hmm you
can see the environment is being
repeated here as it turns out it's very
useful when you're emitting the
JavaScript to have access to the full
environment so that's repeated in every
node the most important part is the OP
each node of the tree has a an op field
that tells you exactly what this
particular node is for this is the J s
for the j s star special form and then
down here we have the arguments to it
see it's done some work to split up the
string interpolation input and then we
have arguments the first argument was
the the VAR u in the example it was some
- array and you can see this has now
been recognized as a bar it is then
fully namespace qualified it's got the
underscore munging going on there so
this is a JavaScript name for the bar
we've referred to and here we can see
the constant 5 the ast for that
so now that we have all that information
about the code we have everything we
need to call the omit function from the
compiler so you notice that the
environment was passed in to analyze but
we don't need it anymore to pass in to
admit because it's been copied
everywhere that we need it so
so we can emit and see the actual code
produced by that example okay now a very
important thing to know here's that no
JavaScript code has been run yet so that
means all of the macro expansion all the
analysis everything that we've looked at
just now is all running in the JVM
mostly written in closure and regular
closure and so that is the key point
about how macros in clgs our closure
code not clgs code because we haven't we
haven't even sent anything to a
JavaScript environment yet right so that
is how analysis and macro expansion work
but there's another step even below that
that is the compiler itself the compiler
is what actually does the macro
expansion and does the analysis so let's
take a look at that now what I intend to
do here okay now let's do this first
let's look at this there is a feature in
common lisp called symbol macro let
anybody familiar with that at all
phew okay it's different from macros
were familiar with in closure in two
ways that are both hinted by in the name
one is symbol and the other is let right
so symbol macro let the symbol part
means that in order to refer to it we
don't need to have a list that looks
like a function call normally macros you
do that and you pass it some parameters
for a symbol macro all you need to do is
refer to the symbol so in this little
example here this syntax by the way is
not at all what Common Lisp uses but
this is what's easy to implement in clgs
so this here is all that is needed a
simple symbol naming a symbol is all
that's needed to trigger a symbol macro
expansion the other part is let write
symbol macro let
is your hint that this is a lexical
macro so it's just within certain
lexical scope it's not a namespace level
okay so I'd like this to work the idea
be here being that this could be some
expensive work right here in the delay
right that that might take a lot of time
or we might want to make sure we don't
do if we don't have to and then we could
have code down here that itself might be
either delayed or run in a lazy sequence
or in some other way put off and rather
than having to dereference oh that just
by referring to the word speed we
actually get the code be ref speed delay
so this part here is the name of the
symbol we want to bind this part here is
a sort of automatically quoted
expression that will be inserted down
below when it comes time to run it okay
so I'm now going to open up the clgs
compiler and I don't want anybody to
panic oh well we'll try here okay so I
want to change two places I want to
change let so that it understands this
symbol macro left metadata that I have
here on the speed symbol and I want to
change how symbols are understood and
analyzed right so here is the function
that analyzes let and I'm not going to
try to explain every line here but I do
hope that you can get a sense of what's
going on and that you will find it
unscary enough that if you feel like
poking around them there you'll be able
to do that so this loop right here is
going through all of the pairs of
bindings in the let expression itself
this is compile time right so we're
going through the pairs of symbols or
rather the symbol and initialization
that we put inside the square brackets
of the left so you can see here it's
constructor there's the name of the
symbol we want to define
and here's the innit expression okay you
can see it checking some things alright
so this block here is the code the
original clgs code that you would find
in the repository today you can see it
analyzes the initial expression to
figure out how it's actually going to do
that right because that gets run at
runtime so has to analyze it and then it
loops on these three parameters the
first is building up a stack of binding
environments the next one stuffs the
binding environment into the this this
larger environment object that we're
building up one we passed in to continue
to get build up as we compile and then
we go on to the next pair of bindings so
those are the three things we've got
there so what I've added is these three
lines right here so what I'm doing is
I'm checking to see if the metadata for
the name has simple macro light on it
which for this one here I'm sorry for
this line it does not write that's a
regular let this one it does have the
metadata so in that case we will switch
to this branch and we leave the stack of
the binding environment alone we still
go on to the next bindings so the only
thing different is this one right here
and so what we're doing is we're putting
into the local environment this little
map it has symbol macro at true so that
we can find that later and then it just
copies right in the original init form
unanalyzed right so that's our automatic
quoting we're just dropping that form
straight in that's everything we need to
know in order to jump down to analyze
symbol analyze symbol normally is going
to first look to see if it's in the
locals right this is the same binding
environment we just modified so if it's
if it's not in there then it skips down
and does bar resolution looks around a
namespaces to try to find what global
bar that might be in the original code
clj is just went to this then if it
wasn't a
name space bar or a bar that commute
sorry if it could find it in the locals
right this is if we if we did find a
local binding lb local binding we did
find a local binding then we were just
going to produce one of these so I added
these two lines right here mm-hmm
these two lines right here so it checks
to see if that symbol Mac roulette field
that we put into the binding environment
if it's true then rather than making a
bar
we at this point recursively analyzed
that form that we set aside so it's just
as if it were textually right here we're
gonna analyze it right at this point so
between those two that is all you need
in a clgs repple to be able to do symbol
macula so okay so if this works what
what value should this produce right
we've got a delay of five here down here
are saying 10 plus speed speed itself is
going to be expanded in 2d reppin that
delay so it should be 15 right look that
works
so by adding what was that five or six
lines to the clgs compiler we were able
to add a feature the language that clgs
hasn't had before now okay so that's
everything that we talked about we
started up at the runtime and
compile-time representations of data
types we looked at the protocols to
implement those and why it's nice that
clgs uses protocols for its own data
types rather than using interfaces like
regular closure we look at how macros
are fundamental part of making protocols
work and how the compiler does some of
its analysis and compilation and I don't
know what I'm supposed to be done but
that's all I've got so are there any
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
