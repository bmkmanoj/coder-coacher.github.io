we are from faraway land of Minnesota
I'm Gillian demage Kesava I teach at
University of Minnesota Morris teach
computer science
I'm Ryan McArthur I'm a junior Success
student at the University of Minnesota
Morris I'm Tomas Hagen I'm also a junior
CSI student and we'll be sharing with
you some super fun that we had with
first class shapes and quilt this summer
that was Thomas's and Ryan's summer
project so what we'll be talking about
today is who we are and why we would
like to work on this topic how it fits
with other things that we're doing and
then we'll go about we'll talk about
functional MVC and quill and how first
class objects fit into that first class
shapes and then talk talk about some
ideas and examples that helped us
develop this project and go into details
of implementation and then we'll talk
about a very long list of future work
that we have okay so this is what our
campus looks like usually in November it
doesn't look like this or it wasn't
looking like this one we left and we're
not complaining it's a small campus of
University of Minnesota it's a liberal
arts campus undegraded only and it's not
located anywhere close to Minneapolis or
st. Paul it's about three hours drive
depends on who is driving and we've been
working on various things related to
making closure more beginner friendly
and by beginners we mean absolute
beginners so people with no programming
experience whatsoever so if you things
need to happen for this we want
make sure that beginners can understand
closure without knowing any programming
but in particular without knowing Java
and that obviously affects how error
messages would work so we've been
looking into that a little bit and I
talked about this at closure West we
also would like to have a few fun and
exciting libraries for beginners that
would allow them to explore functional
programming recursion abstraction
concepts that we would like them to
learn and have fun at the same time one
of their items on our to-do list slash
wish list is integrating with a
beginner-friendly IDE cursive may be
saying we don't know but right now that
is also something that's that we're
working on the this particular talk fits
into this in the sense that we'll be
talking about the second part
so some material that beginners can work
on that will help them learn concepts
and that was a summer project that
Thomas and Ryan were working on for
about six or eight weeks depends on how
you count this project was inspired by a
very similar library in the racquet
programming language so racket is a lisp
it's a descendant from scheme and we use
racket in our introductory classes now
so for students who don't have any
programming background and one of the
really nice features of racket is its
universe package that implements
functional MVC suit has the separation
between Model View and control and it
has functional implementation of MVC so
there is a world state and it contains
all of the things that are changing in
the program and there
you provide functions to modify that
state either on a clock tick or when a
certain event occurs and then you also
have functions that take that world
state and make an image out of it so
there is a complete separation in this
program and in students Minds from the
model which is the contents of what's
happening representation of what's
happening and the view which is the
image of what's happening visual
representation and racket also has first
class shapes so you can define a circle
a blue circle of radius 5 and you can
use it in your program as an object and
you can store it in a variable returning
from a function put it in a list so you
can do anything with it that you can do
with a number and you can have various
shapes you can also have user imported
images there so JPEGs and other formats
and you can use this to create games or
art or various interactive programs and
there are there is a variety of
functions that can be used to combine
these shapes into more complex shapes
and then again treat them as one same so
you can combine them create a picture of
a car and work with it and your program
however you want and when you need to
put it on the canvas on the visual
representation you can do that but you
don't have to so it's a single net zone
and this is a little bit more about how
this is done in racket so there is a big
bang function that starts the world and
this is all a big macro where various
things are defined so in this example we
have a bunch of dots and this is a
clickable area and if you click in the
position that has a dot already that dot
would disappear if there is no dot there
it will appear so very simple exam
for one of the first ones that we do was
this sort of thing in the racket class
so the world state here is a list of
positions of the dots the Centers of the
dots starts off empty there is a
function that's called on a draw event
so when we need to draw that takes that
world state and creates the image that
you see nothing is happening on tick
because nothing on the clock seat
because the world does not change you on
the clock tick and then on a mouse click
we add or remove a dot so let me show
you a little bit more about how this
works in racket so the top thing there
is a dot which is a first-class shape
it's just a dot not attached to any
particular position and then when we
need to convert the list of positions to
an image that's displayed dot that's
going from the model to the view then if
this list is empty that's a in the empty
scene so a blank square otherwise we
place an image of a dot at the position
X and Y in that list of positions in the
first element of the list of positions
and then make a recursive call on the
rest so very convenient very nice
example of recursion and then there is a
similar function that deals with adding
or removing dots takes a list of
positions coordinates of a click and
returns a new list of positions and I'm
not showing the code but I'm sure you
can all write something like this ok so
when we were looking at implementing
first-class shapes we needed the Model
View controller and luckily quill
existed nice graphical library along
with fun functional mode called fun mode
made by Nikita blog was off which was
already implemented the Model View
controller for us so we had
there the state is basically a hash map
that you can alter using multiple
function or you can individually change
everything using functions or you can
associate and change and fun mode plus
first-class shapes we made a joke and
started calling it super fun mode so
that's that's what uh yeah so ours is
just implementing first-class shapes
into the functional mode of coil and so
the elements of the state are modified
through functions this is just an
example that we were using to learn
closure this summer I'd actually never
looked at it until this summer and this
is an example from the summer that we
won't go in-depth into it all so here's
the update state where you change
individual things on clock ticks
basically and then there's functions
like update speed and update rocks that
would change each one as the clock ticks
happen so shapes as first-class subjects
we are looking to sort of implement this
in the racket style that yalena was
talking about earlier in that shapes are
treated like objects and can be modified
their functions shapes as objects would
hold their specifications for drawing
them on the canvas and this sort of
makes it easy to redraw and reuse shapes
once you've already sort of initialized
the shape and sort of having this shape
object seems easier for beginning people
and beginning students to understand at
least conceptually to have this thing
that you can sort of it's almost like a
shaped object so like we say functional
coil sort of uses the paintbrush
approach where when you create an object
it's sort of the by pixel location in
that you can't visualize an object off
of its canvas it is where you draw it on
the canvas more like you know a paint
brush versus our first class shapes
which is more the collage approach so in
this picture here you see we've got the
sort of pieces by themselves initialized
and then you can
modify those and think about them more
abstractly before applying them to the
canvas so so how quilt deals with simple
shapes is the shape lives entirely in
the draw function there isn't actually
an object so if it doesn't so in this
example we draw a background set the
fill color to green in this case and
then we use the quill function to draw a
rectangle at position 300 300 with the
width of 100 and the height of 200 so
you can't actually you know make that
same rectangle unless you keep the fill
the same color and you know change the
XY coordinates so our function instead
you define it once in the setup and you
can reuse it whenever you need it so in
this case we create a rectangle of width
height 100 200 and we set it to green
and that green is actually just colors
that we predetermined so beginners don't
have to worry about RGB values they can
use green or blue and they don't have to
worry about it and then we draw we call
our DS function or which stands for draw
shape at position 300 300 instead and
you can you know draw it at whatever
position you want repeatedly so sort of
taking this idea of simple shapes one
step further we have something called
complex shapes which are essentially
just collections of simple shapes in the
abstract form so when you create a
complex shape it's your simple shapes
offset from a center position and each
simple shape holds its individual offset
from that position and in our first
class shapes we've implemented functions
that you we found in racket like the
example earlier above beside that sort
of thing so in this example here we have
our green circle and our green rectangle
and you can create a complex shape
called object and then beside them and
then you can draw the complex shape at
your position and it will draw both the
decent
shapes as one complex shape on that
position so here's some examples of
above and beside in this code block you
can see we're creating green sky erects
with above and you pass in the arguments
sort of like the image would suggest so
when you're above the names of the
conflict the symbol shapes above each
other in the order that you would like
them above and you can also call it
reduce on above and apply that over a
vector pretty easily and it would
produce the exact same results where you
to just call above on the same thing and
now for a successful live demo so here
is something we were just a pretty
simple thing we were working with
earlier in this summer so this is two
complex shapes overlaid sort of stacked
on top of each other in the draw off
state moving in a sinusoidal pattern
across each other and this entire
demonstration is actually just created
out of two simple shapes on top of each
other
a box and a line and then those are made
into a row with beside and then those
rows are above Donn top of each other so
this is created with above beside into
simple shapes and you get this entire
sort of cool rotating pattern thing that
you just stare at for a long time and
get back to your presentation yep and
then when you again quill has like easy
Mouse implementation things so that you
can switch orientations so switching
from the box is moving horizontal to
moving vertically when we jump to the
code you can see just how easy that is
because you are moving the entire
complex shapes and you don't have to
worry about pinpoint locations like you
would in normal functional kwill
so in here we're defining our line
length our box length we create our
simple shape diagonal line here with the
create line function and then we have
our sort of invisible block underneath
it which is just the outline of the
block it's on top of and then we create
our first complex shape called block
line using above of our two simple
shapes this demonstration does sort of
scale to fit screens so we're checking
total width and total height and here's
our first row creation we're creating a
complex shape row using reduce beside
and repeating with our simple complex
shape until we fill our screen to create
a row and then we follow that same
pattern until we filled our width and
height of our screen here using a reduce
above here we're just checking the mouse
to see if you've clicked if we are if we
want it to move horizontally or
vertically the update state function
which is just changing the angles so
that we have that nice sinusoidal
pattern and then our two sort of helper
functions for our draw which have some
nice let blocks but essentially boiled
down to just drawing those two complex
shapes very easily really and finally in
the draw function we create our
background we filled the line color and
then we just see if we would like to
draw it horizontally or vertically and
that's really all there is to it
so if we are going to combine multiple
complex shapes together it creates a new
complex shape so in this case we have a
complex screen which is made up of a
circle and a rectangle and a complex
blue which is also made up of a circle
and a rectangle and we combined them
together to create the complex shape
that consists of a circle rectangle a
circle and a rectangle overlay is
another function we made which also
creates complex shapes in this case we
we decided to make overlay where the
first argument is at the front of the
image and the last argument is at the
back or top and bottom and in this case
we're just overlaying different sized
rectangles on top of each other we also
have an aligned version of each function
above and beside take in one argument
along with the the either complex shape
or multiple simple shapes and those are
left center and right and if it you were
to above a line Center it's the same
thing as above and basically it offsets
it in this case to the right so you have
like a tower leaning to the right and
overlay aline takes two arguments before
the thing which are top center bottom or
left center right and that will in this
case we did a bottom right and overlay
them on the bottom right of the entire
complex shape we can also also rotate
and scale so in this case we are
rotating a red square of some size 45
degrees and you can also scale and it's
actually an X scale and a Y scale so
we're scaling the x axis and why is that
access by 2 in this case so we're
doubling the size of the of the shape
and then you can apply it you know you
can first wrote or scale it and then
rotate it at the same time
so quills functional mode was has it
does deal with images but it does it in
sort of a convoluted way that took us
quite a while to figure out so we
thought it would be really nice to make
it easy for the beginning and intro
people to understand how to make an
image and we thought what's really easy
well the shapes that we've been making
already so we decided to do images just
like our first class shapes so that you
can essentially define a really cool
picture and then just create that
picture with the file path and you can
apply all the same functions that you
can to you simple shapes
to these images and you can incorporate
them into complex shapes and they're
dealt with just the same way with sort
of bounding box of the image so in this
case we're creating our cool picture on
the left there and then we're creating a
black box 100 by 50 and then we're above
the image scaled up to double size and
on top of that black box and it works so
with all of that in mind I've just we
did a sort of simple code comparison
here with quills normal functional mode
on the left side and our code to draw on
the right side and both of them are
drawing that shape in the middle there
sort of the circles on top of each other
so if you look at Cole's functional mode
you've got your background you've got a
fill
and an ellipse and a fill and an ellipse
and a fill and an ellipse and a fill and
an ellipse and a fill and an ellipse and
when you're looking at this it's like
yes it does make sense that you're
filling these colors every single time
you would like to create a new ellipse
of a different color and a different
size and you have to do those
calculations but just conceptually
looking at it you don't get the idea of
this shape you get a block of numbers
that you have to figure out what the RGB
values are for and what the positional
differences is so if you were handed
this block of code would you know if the
circles are aligning on top of each
other or on the bottom of each other
versus when you look at our block of
code you've got your green ring your red
ring yellow ring blue ring and you can
see that they're overlaid
top-center orientation with green on top
red yellow blue and in this case we're
actually reusing the yellow ring scaled
up to double size because we can because
it's abstract before it's drawn on top
of the canvas so with that in mind
what's actually under the hood in each
individual shape is what you see here so
this is how you would create a rectangle
you throw in the width height and then
the colors and we define what needs to
be known the width and height or the
width and height and then complex width
and complex height would be if that is
part of a complex shape what the complex
within complex height are in this case
it's just an individual shape so it's
complex width and height are what it
currently is DX and dy are the X&amp;amp;Y
offsets from the origin of the complex
shape so in this case they're 0 because
we're not in the complex shape angle is
whatever if you apply rotate to it angle
changes and then the internal DS
function actually is what draws the
shape so that gets passed in in
Expedition Y position if it's a picture
in this case it's not so it just gets
handed null we never use it then the
width and the height and then current
stroke is the outline of the box or the
color of a line if you're gonna draw it
and angle is how much it's rotated we
first have to check to make sure we have
a color and if not we set it to no fill
but if we do we'll actually takes in
anywhere from 1 to 4 variables to
determine the color so we have to
account for each case so if you're
coming straight from quail you can use
your colors from there we actually draw
the rectangle at 0 0 and then if there's
a rotation we apply the rotate because
the way rotate works and quill is it's
based entirely off the top left corner
of the canvas or 0/0 so after we've
rotated the shape we then translate it
down to the X&amp;amp;Y positions so rotations
happen and they don't get slid off the
screen when you rotate and then we set
it back down to no fill to make sure we
don't mess up any other shapes complex
shapes are just a vector of simple
shapes so what we just saw
in effect all those hashmaps in a vector
each shape knows its position from the
center as I talked with DX and dy and
this is different from rackets
implementation because when they create
a new complex shape it's actually just
an entirely new image so you you can't
pull it apart or pick out anything and
what this allows us to do is alter
individual shapes within a complex shape
so we'll look at another demo so in this
case we have a complex shape consisting
of 16 x 16 out of smaller squares and
you can easily change the size of those
squares and so this is still a complex
shape and when we explode it you can you
can alter each individual shape which
racket would not be able to do so
looking at the code for that um we
create the shape here by above and besid
things it's called big bang mouse click
to determine whether it's exploding or
not
along with the to update states for
whether it is exploding and then drawing
it whether it is also exploding and the
actual change for explosion is we're
just mapping and associate over each
individual shape within the complex
shape and we are changing its offset
from the center and that's all it takes
according to the rate and the old DX and
new Y values which is why in example the
center actually moves slower because
it's going off of its old DX and dy
values
so that drop shape structure so whenever
you want to take your first class shape
object and translate that to pixels on
the screen you can called es and the
function for that is here so it takes in
your shape object and the X&amp;amp;Y positions
that you would like your shape object to
be on the canvas and then within there
we have to check whether or not you're
passing it a complex shape or a simple
shape dictated mainly by whether or not
you're handing it a vector and in the
first case if you are just handing it a
simple shape it goes into that shape and
pulls out the drawing function from
within that shape and then hands it the
x position and y position you want it on
the canvas whether or not it's a picture
the width of the shape from within the
shape object the height of the shape the
current strokes and the angle for
rotations and if it is a complex shape
that you're handing it's essentially the
same process mapped over every simple
shape within it with the DX and dy
translations for the offsets from the
entire complex shape
so in the future we'd like to be able to
get the color of an individual shape
currently you can't because the color
and the the drawing if our coil
currently happens within the draw state
entirely so you can't actually get like
the state of the color cuz you just set
the fill you draw the shape and as soon
as you change the fill that information
is gone we'd like to add more
functionality to our super fun mode like
we said add the ability to the color of
a simple shape rotating complex objects
we currently can't do ran out of time
mainly but it was also harder than we
thought it'd be because of the rotation
on the origin so we're looking to get
that working we want a pixel detail
level this overlay so you can specify
exactly how much of an overlay you want
instead of just the nine positions we
currently have like top right or you
know top left we want to make text be an
object instead of how shapes are and
quill text is also the same way it lives
entirely inside the draw function so you
can't reuse text C so we want to create
a text object so we can you know reuse
it we want to have more seamless
integration with quill phone mode one of
the main things is for pictures if you
want to create a picture you have to do
it within one of the sketch functions
you can't kind of define it outside of
any of that and if you do it blows up
and gives you bad error messages so if
you want to create a picture you have to
do it within either setup or the update
state and we would like to figure out a
way to get around that we'd also like to
add some of the examples we worked on
this summer to our git repo which I
don't think would be too bad for to
inspire people to work on things or see
what we've done and then we'd also like
to integrate a music library into it so
you can have images and music possibly
overtone we've looked at so if you guys
want it you can absolutely get
everything that we've done so far we've
got a code our page so you can pull it
down from there the links there we also
have to get hub page with all of our
materials as well as other things under
the closure intro of course sort of the
entire working into
building this into the introductory
course and other things in that line
related in similar similar work
completely independent from us but also
similar is a Tom Hall did a talk at Euro
closure
he used GM lab which was similar with
the above and beside and stuff which was
kind of interesting because his was also
for educational purposes with first
class shapes which apparently it's a
common idea so we thought that was cool
and prior work old um M students
actually came up with the ideas for what
we currently worked on so Max Magnuson
impulsively and yeah we also like to
thank HHMI the hard Hughes Medical
Institute because they sort of they
funded the entire science department
really at Morris so as CSI we got a part
of that grant and that paid for me to do
this research over the summer as well as
Elsa and grant that paid for Ryan to do
the research over the summer I'll select
a thing closure cons and the sponsors
and organizers because otherwise we
wouldn't be here up on this stage
questions this is the we made the
parenthesis with that code there
question mark I this parentheses on the
brain
you
okay so first of all the objective of
the first course is not necessarily to
teach people in individual programming
language it's to give them the key
concepts that they would be able to
build upon later and the second part of
that question so why was the difference
between closure and racket is that
correct yeah how it would be different I
think one main difference is that
closure has a lot of opportunities for
students to work on their own
immediately transitioning from the class
there are plenty of libraries one of the
things that I've been running into with
the racket class is that students want
to do things that maybe even exist in
racket but don't exist in the subset
that we're covering and they're
difficult to get even documentation on
so closure is much more open in this
sense it's much easier to to bring
things in so I think that's a
distinguishing part and another related
element of it is all of the open source
projects the students can contribute to
many more examples online that actually
scale so I think it just is to me it's
introducing students to much more open
community for which we're really
grateful to everybody here and in
particular and one thing that kind of
intrigued me to want to do closure
instead of racket is that rack it's not
really used in the professional world
much where closure is so knowing that
you you're learning a language that's
actually used to get a job outside of
college is reassuring instead of racket
which isn't used a lot
well to follow up on that however we're
gone we don't follow that road too far
because there are schools that are
forced to use languages that people
perceive as professional and you know
starting with C++ or Java is definitely
not a good plan there is a lot of
discussion of what people should start
with but these two languages that have
been pushed are not it okay and I'll
repeat the question sorry I didn't - it
was the first question so the question
is between teaching Python first the
racket first how do students deal with
subsequent classes how does how well
does it prepare them and actually we'll
ask Ryan and Thomas because well we have
balls introductory classes so Ryan
actually went through the Python class
Thomas went through the racket class so
they can tell you but I from my
standpoint I think one interesting thing
that I observed a couple of things
recursion definitely is much much
simpler as a concept no matter what
language if you have functional
background and algorithms in particular
anything that's recursive even if it's
pseudocode is easier to understand if
you have good grasp of recursion which
is what you get if you do racket and
another interesting element of that is
callbacks in JavaScript which we do now
in
our software design class so we use
JavaScript again that comes actually
from some TAS that feedback that
students who have gone through racket
class understand called callbacks much
easier you pass a function than you call
it what's the big deal so that's my take
on that and we can hear from so I went
to the Python class and I actually
didn't get introduced to a functional
language until this summer when I
started learning closure so when I
started it I was actually finding myself
trying to use the for for loop which is
not a for loop as I discovered so that
was that was a that was hard for me to
get to grasp and I mean I had used
recursion but I leaned towards the for
loops mainly so it was it was definitely
a switch where he he came from the
functional satiric it so I think it was
a little easier for him to learn closure
than for me so we were looking at
closure over the summer so it been maybe
two years since I had looked at
functional languages but just coming
back to it was like oh that's like this
and that's like this and that's like
this and I understand this this is all
recursion and we even we fell into that
for loop trap there but we got out of
that pretty quickly I had a period
coming out of starting with racket and
going into Java where I was like well
okay we have four loops here but why
don't we just use recursion like why
don't we just use recursion with
everything which in some cases you do
but not in Java so
so I think students transition there
there are certain approaches that we use
in our java class was the understanding
that the significant number of students
came with only functional background so
when I was trying to adjust to that I
started doing a lot of small methods
static methods as sort of an equivalent
of a function and that worked fine and
then slowly transitioning to more
object-oriented model so that's one of
the adjustments that we made to
accommodate students coming out of
racket class but other than that we
really don't see whole ton of difference
it's really about concepts some things
you have to kind of explain twice to
both sets of students in data structures
past data structures they're good
which slide was it this one
yeah well one thing that we didn't find
it doesn't exist in racket and it
doesn't seem to exist in quill is an
easy way to do a mirror image of
anything that's different from rotating
180 degrees and I don't know if there is
a primitive for that okay yeah certainly
would be cool to introduce because I
don't think it exists in racket I looked
one of one group of students was okay
yeah that sounds really cool yeah thank
you
not yet
that was a summer project and would be
nice to do usability study would be nice
to do usability study on some of the
error messages things that we'll have
done that's not related to that we get
in there we're a small school and people
get really busy summer research is a
great opportunity during the semester
things move much slower
I wish we had you know real lab all of
that but yeah but it's definitely on the
list
it's definitely something that we would
like to get user feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
