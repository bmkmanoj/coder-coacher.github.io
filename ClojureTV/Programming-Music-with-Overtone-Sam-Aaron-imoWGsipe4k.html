music tight systems there is the ominous
music system which has been around for a
while
there's music notation system totally
honored to ski
lots of other people have done all kinds
of up with Lisp and music and in
fact the original creators of Emacs and
a nice list we're all pianists so this
probably makes sense once you've learned
some of the Emacs keyboard commands how
that came to them so now finally closure
gets to participate in the game and we
have Sam Aaron here to talk about us
here to talk about overtone and music
synthesis
yes true if I constantly move I listed
myself I must say I'm going to
completely gear in this I guess what I'm
about to show you is sort of a tribute
to practice reading home if you don't
know about some open mind and change the
title you'll notice this is a play on
another book which I read while ago
rules notes on their synthesis of four
by crystal examiner and eleven they
don't read this book and read this book
okay more people need to create this
book 22 brilliant 60s besides on the
talked about design and brand new array
and he combines notation and language
and process and he had diagrams like
this and besides that is an architect
you don't diagram like this and I had a
primary vector Michael Jordan Ford is
not symmetrical music but what I'm
saying is that if you look at different
contexts and you can bring interesting
things out of this context with time to
other places and so because of crystal
crystal exciters main work really that
had an influence of the software
community where as the time comes for a
building patterns concern all that
notion of design patterns came to us as
a meaning view of example where we're
taking ideas from architecture bringing
the software world and so what we do in
terms of other fields is amusement
interesting place where actually spend
time researching computing ideas can we
actually find new approaches to
competing by looking at new contexts
like music so really that's that's what
I'm trying to say here and so although
we do a lot of things with business
software and web
other things other context can be really
interesting for really technical
sophisticated research and the next
point I wanna make is that also about
Castro
so this is Kasparov in his second
rematch very lost against deep blue nine
six and this was a really interesting
point in time so here we have famous
chess player will grow master finally
green by somebody else who will actually
us alone have a queue based is the idea
guide actually choosing what making the
moves in the chessboard oh and the thing
is what you do when will the grow master
chess and you're beating my computer
what's the next step team up with
computers incredibly good advanced chess
where basically you be like a garden
rights cheating you have a laptop over
whatever things you want to whatever in
chess programs whatever databases of
previous moves you wanted at the
disposal and you would use those that
help you play chess and so this is what
the events in advance chess and he said
it was brilliant that people claimed as
cheating it was already in the spirit of
chess but him it freed his mind so he
could not worry about whether there was
a strong move or tactical thing weight
within wicket tactical blunder he could
focus on the psychology of the game and
the tactics and just think about the
other person in the gameplay and all the
stuff he liked about chess he to focus
on and I was really interesting about it
as they had a competition online
competition free style and Olga make a
move like they wanted so humans
computers combinations crawl into this
competition he'd been practicing with
his Grandmaster chess friends for a long
time now you can't win this on the
Grandmaster or expert mastering our
computers and what was interesting is
that human plus computer would all would
be integrated computer so he was
actually a big deal in this approach but
two random guys from America would be
terrible big big haslam don't ever have
these guys I'm
chess players and it was a real shock
customer and he sorta came up this
premise that through a week you know
week chess player plus machine the
synthetic process was superior to a
stronger Peter alone and more remarkably
superior to strong human so in strong
chess first machine was the fairy
princess so if we can use process and
interest rates we can beam people you
know it can be people in practice car
lives only that's a really interesting
position how do we apply this to other
context outside of chess
does this apply to music this is quite a
little mates I believe so and so the
point to Monday's two things is it's
very interesting to explore other
domains as rich place which you look at
things and also if we use compute as
well and we actually instead have a
formalized process and we have cool ways
of doing that I think that we could
actually try out and take place take us
out some interesting places with
everything before and who needs to pick
apart what we need for this machine in
this combination I'll talk about a bit I
have immersed in briefly to to have
music so this was one of the first
machines that this was made on imagine
that has nothing they do you think this
is similar
quite a music thing what the hell this
Maxell expensive involve our community
pretty interesting things episode these
reason I bring this up is because the
state of the art music making hasn't
really changed much so what can I do to
help change it so I started a project
will in process try and combine
improvisation process we're combining
the music under actually that the parent
is using simples extremely soon as that
song I'm sorry but it was Sania came
over - of some parameter and it was a
combination of multiple people work in
the project so I got humours University
Anglia Ruskin University acquisition
that people's actual science musician in
these Animax of research university and
so one of the one of the questions are
in car house what's the end goal like
how we get the baa baa black sheep into
something much more interesting and
impressive
also the we Lane goal is to be on Jimi
Hendrix Clement so we'll be on stage
there I should playing music enjoying it
and appends the king here is that people
in the audience can perceive as
virtuosity so they can see that he's a
badass guitarist and it's that plcs was
badass is really important otherwise God
knew what he was doing yeah and so
combine that to myself and Jethro's
playing in Ruby and rails confidence
perhaps totally we could begin our
emails
this is the state of the art of you
music making it swimming so need to
prove that it's going to budget person
able to you - you guys started over 200
children's and and the next thing is
what I do things are given rights so
we're going to change your minds
on-the-fly glossary making use we don't
have to pre-render everything you just
press play maybe tweet some tile things
we want to actually you know change a
light or what we're doing and I won't be
doing music with stuck you know we're
just we have no real ability to do that
so all the good computer music has been
pre-render than female and another issue
is communication so we want to be able
to make bands and people playing music
together communicating working together
so giving up red chili peppers you can
clearly see they're all working opportu
they're in synchronization communication
looking each other feeling or putting
the music through their body language
here we go to Princeton University
laptop there between their own pods like
complete silence maybe they're chatting
through IRC is not Vina so how can take
this further and one of the things I
think really needs the Photoshop defines
all these things together is the notion
of an interface so the traditional
interface is you've got some which is
very open and exposed and clear and
there's something that anyone can play
with us or a six-year-old it's from a
guitar and hear some sounds and we can
all twinkle war on how to play and then
when we see someone who's really badass
there we can see the velocity compare
that to what we might see as the latest
innovation but this is able to life how
the hell are you going to look at that
velocity is just so damn complex you've
got no idea if the person is good or bad
because interfaces there's no way to
review plus how you project that you put
it on a screen on this what's your claim
I mean come on a laptop players actually
try and project the screen of what
they're doing if you've got that on the
screen still you're not communicating
what to do so this is the real serious
issue and compare that to you're saying
you know take on it another way of
looking into the notation and this is a
way of actual communication music with
world so here we have some basic Western
common notation describing an area
capture song called label and what's
really interesting about this is that
when I've shared this particular slide
to musicians they go oh that's a
terrible score that's that could have
been so much nicer or a really naughty
way of doing mate and the reason why I
could do that is they could readings
they could see into the casino today so
they could see how it could be improved
had insight into that because the
notation was clear what we have
attributed music we've got sandwich
really I can't tell if the guy bit of
fluff on his guitar there I can't see if
you play the wrong note or who's out of
tuna at a time there's no real way to
understand what's going on there I can
try and do so many 50 and do some
feature extractions and they were that's
not really what we want we want to be in
the symbol space not in the same space
and when we have notation we can do a
lot of good things
that's not an intention right
we have notation feel a lot of good
things so we can have our energy play
books how do you get started making
music so I can get the Hendrix book and
learn how to play some Hendrix now might
not be as good as it but every other
actually makes them sound similar and
I'll be excited about that
compared to our friends they can enjoy
it and similar like when you have
friends coming to how to cook them some
food they don't expect you to be a
michelin-starred chef they want you to
make some nice food and talk about it's
the social thing so why isn't the case
the music why can't be getting around
and not be expected to be a top form and
also a notation you do amazing things
that you can visualize a lot of complex
data so here we have a large score
making with this a musician can look at
repeating patterns they can see time
because see where the sciences are it
can thicken confer a lot of information
just by quickly classrooms for so even
things that I learnt have to do this
kind of stuff okay so that's good so
that's really where we need to do so
let's bring yourself back a bit in time
and look at this Paula chapter we talk
about people who actually passed away
recently this is max Matthews you guys
really a ripe old age of 84 and he was
one the grandfather's of computer music
and yes fantastic chat and endings
number 63 or 964 here this paper as
publish to the science journal called
the digital computer as a musical
instruments produce a computer can be
programmed played instrumental music -
any composer also compose an ancient
what a fantastic idea and this may be
described everything that that's really
the state of the haunted community so it
talks about Haven - extremely numbers
and turn them into sounds that's the
starting point so here we have our
numbers we pass them to additional a lot
of birds
speaker so essentially he numbers
between minus 1 and 1
which describe either speed ur co needs
to be a critical point of time as only
we send enough of those for you tonight
the speaker that really really enacted
generator science and so the key here
really is choosing which numbers to send
to the speaker that's that's what you do
so if you can generate the right numbers
you can make any kind of sense that's
that's the principle so and what's
interesting here is we talked about
somewhere between ten thousand dollars
per seconds and we really don't know
numbers the only thing that's changed as
a faculty to this far faster rate and
getting for a better quality set of
medicals so once we know that all we
need to do is the supreme device your
music and the movie thoughts or to focus
on things our notation how do we
actually describe more two to three
types so you hear about any of that so
we talked about a basically a series of
function calls which describe modulation
parameters so here we have a bunch of
instruments - in this case we play to
them through time we have like a
duration and the loudness and the
frequency and some other things it's
always do is actually television tease
one another render the sound pretty
simple and everything is what would we
next need so we have a way to see any
kind of sound have annotation describing
how the cycle change the time we don't
yet have a thing to actually create our
instruments and so he created this
notation which you basically have knows
which are generators of signals they
were called huge engine generators and
you could have envelope generators sine
wave generators all sort of different
things you sort of plug them together so
the output apart is input of another and
by inside you
and exams and in his system had ten
eugenics it's pretty cool
I even generate a lot of different
things with us which you compare against
Gordon system very I have no return we
have about 1450 was not and so once you
put all those things need to skip now
forty years at a time and and here's a
sort of state of arts or visual systems
this is Maximus P and notice it's
absolutely the same it's no difference
really we've got a slider with us away
actually visualizing output real-time
because our computers are better but
we're really not the same thing we've
got unit generators which are feeding
into earlier generators which generates
signals or signals or signals and that
way we could predict you know these
things together an interesting way
Sanders but there's one slight issue
with this in that although it's great
for demos and simple things of this is
looks nice to work with imagine i'm of
this and change my sounds you want to
mention the interest need lot of these
things so very quickly a dozen like this
here ago multiple samples play the same
time clearly has been completed there's
no means abstraction has no means of
generating samples of samples or so
young Hutchison catches this intricate
touches so there's no my other function
is you can't pass patch history patches
you just really got a very basic
attraction and really to limit it to the
kind of complexity to manage
instrumentation which is a pain and so
what do we do with the scientists we
want to actually deal with these kinds
of things we put in a box so it's not
super variables is that exact same thing
involved except for role that you're
dealing with some visual notation on a
computer we actually have a nicely
defined API to actually send updates
tracking how to modify this internal
data structures so you need imagine that
Patterson
and so this is where we are today this
is what our turn is based on
supercollider and we was initially
conceived it was this box which had
maximus beast annotation science paper
sounds and it had a language was also
baked into the same thing and James
becoming the road supervisor he versa
three separating the maps so they
actually told her to define protocol so
the language was different process
essentially potentially to service self
and the really did ask was we are
allowing the opportunity to explore
different languages and so he created
super quiet language just because the
language that were available that didn't
have the kind of abstractions he want to
spend music but he observed that things
and change and lots of languages now
kind
contain any kind of things important
maybe that because the needs maintain an
own separate weird hybrid of small words
I based like a really light thing
himself so go to town and people I made
an opportunity for you to touch you try
the languages so why not so that's where
tennis over Tony is a closure pretend to
supervise over so essentially
replacement with supercar language and
we have a scientific frozen so we're
interested in live interaction and
explorations going to use the record to
actually explore and what with sounds we
want to be able to think about different
kinds of structures to work with
Rico generations we want to generate a
citizen totem from high-level
abstractions we want to co2 as a toolkit
so we don't have to use all of it to
pull apart so the total namespaces work
out for events and real world
connectivity so we want to be able to
use they connect with extra external
devices very easily so we want to be
able to talk to serial ports we want to
be able to talk to network protocols the
only way I've talked to databases what
it returns websites where they want is
that you connect to the to make your
music who wants to the jtro
and so those are things talked about is
obviously disguised on tables talks so
the cool thing about this slide isn't
the map you've got the whole computation
to find a water slide pretty cool is the
fact that I proposed of these seven
parts and so this is this kind of idea
is that
- makes you think what might be
interesting based abstractions were
using and so this is the kind of way I'm
thinking about is how we break what are
the equivalents these figures go there
and what would they be so I want to work
hydration very quickly I've got five
minutes
I've got halfway through my slides okay
so think of this so I've written a came
to university laptop Orchestra two
periods I listen it this is a situation
want to be in so who else is an actual
person a so if you wanna join us a bunch
of happens to pacer pads just notation
of when PI meets hi suckers and
basically want to be able to manipulate
this patterns both of us concurrently
cognitively and so I wish my goodness
again the story community diversity try
to describe why closer to could fit
about OCU awareness and it says that's
human a musical a shared data structure
you want to have good concurrence very
structuring God this molecule and and
it's not so bad there here you just have
a cue in the world
during office so you can serialize
things but where you want additional
protection modify multiple things that
works and coordinate things work the
place which is exactly what you want to
do a musical context any language that
supports this kind of thing and so
against Everton okay so you'd hear her
de voto brilliance who have got stickers
on your laptop you're all my friends if
you don't have to discover five eight
something you want good thing I have a
job you know Basquiat so we made a bunch
of line with the trade ASCII art as an
ellipsis is a term I agree there's
Maggie to schedule things in the future
or a serial port library and we also
have it at the heart of the return is an
open sound control server so comfortable
and controls like it's kind of like a
new MIDI but it communicates over TCP or
UDP and it's really super flexible so
here's our ask your sandwich or the link
and come on gluten free book is good and
so I should also go very quickly through
some of the kind of abstractions of to
attend supports just to show you that
although it's a musical system might
sound a bit not it's actually pretty
damn technical I need a lot of
sophisticated ideas in there to actually
make it happen so here we have a system
we have different ways of describing
events to variants synchronizing an
event through time so we're playing a
lambda when the event occurs we call the
state I have two different types of all
event which happens with red cord on
sync event comes in the same thread
between the event you are using else
increment we've got a dependency
management system so we'll when multiple
dependencies developing met than meant
also matter in this case numbers going
to be called word service connected
order to be creative we were actually
more satisfying on the dependency which
may trigger off which is super useful
when you actually try to earn stars up
another external things we like Linux
cruising up many of different starter
motors you even really more like this
I've also got a very basic simple
dynamic type system which allows you to
control which messages sent out the
supercollider to make sure we represent
rogue messages so this sort of God's
domain between no return and supervisor
so we can say for example the command
this cost message can only contain an X
and multiple anything's if it doesn't
matter great exception this is super
useful for finding errors we also have
cool music abstractions so here's a
bunch of scales nicely modeled and as we
have course the Scotch is small which
shows a lot of course it's good and we
also have a compiler inside there as
well so here we have a small house
instruments but although this looks work
like Larry Cohen the idea it should
movement we're afraid it's not really
it's it's our own language and so the
semantics of things inside there are
different so plus and most private
sample do different things they might be
multiplying singles to get to both the
numbers and so we actually do literally
compiles down to binary format Senate
violence language or super sir there's a
lot of a lot of fun business behind
there and yeah that's still greatly
affect so although : Bobby Oracle
information it's what I'm going to show
you later on I'm totally happy with up
and hacking any maxes most of you do is
it's a really nice thing it's not always
the best thing so
cars are beautiful this is this is why
the low-key stiffs camping frame one
slide nice
I mean it's good no one mentioned one
looks different out yet time how to
fetch them and they need more people
like that like this as usually is not
better while at least in brilliance oh
it needs your advice putting like a
really minor white Ruby for the book is
amazing we need to make more people
writing logical cartoons
okay we went through this or is that you
might want to work with musicians you
look at that thing what the hell is that
it could be it could be the matrix C
Landers rocks no Gray's ESS so we want
to have the thing that they think I
didn't say how we deal with the fact
that code looks like this to other
people right which brings us to a modern
museum not New York
so here we have I think it's actually
just finished its exhibition it off a
while and inside there is this device we
have one here so this is modernize how
cause that and the cool thing about this
is it's a device which doesn't it rinse
if you make any audio itself Scott no
sound production capabilities whatsoever
it's just pure iron device and why do
you want such a device what's
interesting about that I'll consider
like the guitar
and here F you could cause a guitar and
a guitarist has to learn all of these
chords
one played songs which require those
calls and those chords are really from
people the design of the device the
guitar which ourselves the function of
the practice squad actual producer
sounds so the the waves designer
constructed is all about the actual
recreationally sound and so when the
ends are kind of arbitrary mappings or
fingers are actually the cause and
that's not necessarily what you want
it's what you need you want to make a
sound with a physical device but what
we're in additional language and so the
device like this will allow us to
actually make our own kinds of chord
patterns of gotten chords which may be
squares or triangles or not everyone's
and transposing about moving around the
grid and we can imagine different kinds
of interfaces for different kinds of
songs or even during a given thoughts
interface my modified change so here
we're ready to divorcing the thing which
makes us out from the thing which has
uses alternative comedians and also
other things this is touch asked which
is for iPhone or Android and and the
cool thing about this is you look at
this interface think what hell does that
mean and that's the perfect question
throughout because you can talk the
musician or before words say what do you
like it that's really interesting thing
rather than saying this with insurance
having after players is a hidden
interface how you I want you like it to
meet and oh you don't need to have it
just like this you can change it because
they well or something like a scratch
thing I do to DJ mixing that's perfect
for sport or I want something much more
sophisticated and design sales figures
have had like multiple tables and so
this is really cool so in that these
three interfaces
good to be working with the same
software they work with different
software but they have present different
kind of opportunities different kind of
performance I think doing very well on
time it's good so at this stage I'm
going to stop for demo but before that
have any quick question
computing people people interested yes
what's the name of that Oh am i sorry
about this this is going on and it's
really complicated great so much nicest
letter for you so complicated so I spent
some time explaining it is a box with
buttons which 'likes I change this to
place
mushroom
as if it works so I'm going to actually
using the line from the latest
development and right of our Tech's
that's not a good idea miss page a lot
of people and the way the story is just
you put it as a dependency using a
library super simple and we connect
describing all you scribes and you say
use and this will do all sorts of
naughty things that shouldn't do who
actually change state far observers and
also the crazy stuff project do what we
do
I think that's nice as they please makes
the beautiful music that's very cool and
so here we have a music environment how
what was that
so I can place really nap sounds very
easy refreshing standard assignment
nothing else to do a fish
where they get the gold advantage that
you're going to learn documentation so
desires few chains from the invoke
simply connect wise alliance and
supplementation so I should say Oh doc
which do in terms of documentation you
could use doc you want to but because
some of the functions are overridden so
like plus for example we will actually
win us the case for prenup perversions
and expecting why when the articles and
also close and including records on the
links
who
here we have a side table look across
lasers got frequencies that fade to
inputs we had full values of these
things these also put the keyword
arguments are actually changing
slightest amount a few things
Algirdas sorry way to the valley
historian 3-1 on acceptable so on each
of the units for an individual them have
documentation like this
thank you for mining some of green
sailor boring for your musical pleasure
now we also have an example system which
is poor little answer examples so the
idea being that for each new jet you can
have examples to show how it works so
for example examples for deep breath
there's one negative and the warm look
at this and possibly it's a random
floating-point number wall for
frequencies of rate determined by global
parameters describing exact what happens
you might not report microstate expected
here since lines of explore that this
user does you have the source for this
huge a the cool thing is it's preserving
my stress so actually the macros crisis
stores their sources text to the prefer
to watch this news the reason for it is
so this is actually is the exact photo
code retouching excludes examples so we
have to keep their pride using the demo
thing as an example so now you see the
demo goes for two cents but for
educators
like we were master at the point of this
three doesn't show you what you get
doses you actually see them on the
terminal to tack putting the current
values we actually introspect example
it's not about making your musings about
learning and the idea is that when
people learn by a particular youjin
hopefully we'll have some more examples
so we can all learn together and so
that's that the introspection story so
let's go to make sense so till the thx
thing is cinema cinema so we're going to
reading a fish
accordian rabbits is that a is that
meant that many lines of code with a
tire size so you actually look at that
understanding being item writings so I
was really the supercar language
originally I was able to translate it
under standards this is the key thing so
we can have sounds as complicated
interesting like that we have notation
for the people who actually perceive
understand and communicate with each
other and so the idea is when people
make a new kind of sounds we can all
learn through it by reading just like we
read sources so this kind of open sight
openness or scent let's go somewhere
else be books so always our most basic
plagiarize
because the mono
okay
you
you
how about I'll show you
urgh so say they won't here heard of
exhorting I was going to play right
structure your ring of things you can do
here Asha transcribed pair excited not
head to the one basically read the score
translations and snippets put it where
it is and then so variable phrases and
so they are here we still all together
be cats the right times
left hands and you things up repeating
things and using a nice quote structure
structure to is so little and everything
methods were given key scale so here for
here at Lane eight platform ager and
we're using just the whole thing these
two pieces of state the whole thing just
leads to a companion which represents
where you wanna let happen
ah splendid for the trade ecology is
that we all play music on the train on
the way to London we have a window and
the thing about this is loads not
amazing sophisticated I actually played
with my shows
and the cool new weapon is is a very
silently somewhat complicated so what
differentiates a really good Peter's not
so good one isn't whether they fluff for
notes and odds is that that timing
manuals and so here with national focus
precisely at time be cool
how many do from time however I got left
that's the other one so that these
Morgan copy this notes copy the decor
system called prompt change or the
scheme here is an example X temperature
inversion of that this is some skincare
we say here
second Platoon externalize the number
names pudding is very attractive Arthur
King and so if you also changed
you
you never have to do all the composition
yourself that committee producer with
that here's another example where so
announcer extremely I was able to read
and translate and so it wasn't as simple
as a law which was supercar language
derivative especially pretty similar
match this is the scheme personal code
revisions just has a lot of differences
but still is able to read the code
translating just which is mind blowing
hello
using color match
you actually can generate synthesized
music on the fly interesting sentence
this was an example it was copied from
Chappell Dan stole and so yet I don't
read his current site translated to
against example tuners and simonpullen
kata visit received a 50 grind special
synthesizer which actually synthesized
the toaster and the drugs nothing's
actually samples no pre-recorded things
as the cool thing is between things like
that being the monster so we know that
this one theater so we have an entry way
which doesn't all the cool stuff we have
the different function to difficult
things are compressed the effects
function to toggle them forget to choose
with global and pitch as the thing which
is just dispatches us recently and it's
not a mobile page with new things I say
they are trial no to play in this case
it are going to be more than extra G one
line at a time here I've actually put
any type of scale in there that there
was in that scale thing is also being a
major scale right a scale or whatever
you want so you agree on the five chains
okay so long as there is mr. show yes
this is well show you now might be money
a world is amazing I want to definitely
do this you know of course you do and I
but I just want to go on to tease you
and show you think it's actually see
greens do so do the women so one of the
obstructions I've been thinking about
being working on trying to identify this
is in call the CJ so it's a big unit
generated composed Jones
super fun and so you can break something
like that down into the kick drums the
CJ
snare drum to CGM the world war the
seizure and then to the dubstep said
it's just eventually easily super logic
code here which as a price
see chances put them together and
putting on weight too quickly about this
but the synthesizers really is a
directed graph review journals and so I
see Jen it's just a certain part of my
craft so you can pull in these sub parts
a little together and how so you can
take on these seizures like for example
let's go back to our friendly terminal
rated pleased to know how close is he
gonna ask me a computation or works with
me and so I can take something read
holes happening I just go for sorting
I'm confusing subtle interesting
actually can play such a thing with
ex-russian School of Music expansion so
when you actually pass the vector to a
function that she creates three of the
functions for the same time in Expedia
for you as for things he would just say
right that's an accrual les Payten to
judge that by specifying those as the
whole thing huh she soon I don't have
safety system so if you do the wrong
thing will destroy your ears another
time the headphones are thrown in
denomination is a serious one and I feel
actually quite sick so I don't want to
let you do that I also don't to destroy
these speakers or your speakers so
liability to overturn a safety system so
what you're doing that I'm using son
doesn't have any good as a safety
systems clicking this happening I think
you're safe so what I want to do here is
I should multiply that sounds a fraction
really say when one one one one when we
are the dubstep sound may go bot when
one line homes on the ground one one one
one one one
I like you think about what perhaps are
a few that are couldn't smoke and then
we will look and once you've got Bobo
that's great what else triggers and we
just plug them in but it's beautiful and
so as we're this is mid narrator but a
huge amount of technical effort into
this so it's pretty stable it's well
documented all means is more people to
actually happen it making cool things
making the critics of mobile then we've
got a great time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
