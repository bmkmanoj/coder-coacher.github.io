and building a language now if you read
the abstract you may have been under the
impression as I was when I wrote it that
I was going to sort of walk you through
the process of designing and actually
building the language and that was the
original talk that I wrote but I started
talking to people about it and I kept
getting a couple of really common
questions like why would you ever make a
language there are so many languages
already just just use one of those right
and then there was another set of people
who kind of were in the know a little
bit and they knew that I had actually
implemented a language at work and they
they asked me a different kind of
question which is how did you convince
them to let you write a language at work
and so I kind of hoped to answer all of
these questions as part of this talk we
are going to go through a little bit of
design and actual implementation but I
want to leave the possibilities really
open for you to experiment with your own
stuff so oh yes
so I've renamed the talk by the way to
how to tell when you've accidentally
written a language
and what to do about it
and so I hope to to also give you the
secrets to this so here's the agenda
first we're going to kind of deconstruct
what we think of as a computer language
and what it means to implement one I'm
gonna do a little bit of an aside about
data-driven architecture and then we're
going to talk through the design process
and the actual implementation process so
I hope by the end that you are motivated
and know how to start going about trying
to do your own language so first what is
a language if you go to any bookstore or
library and pick up a copy of one of the
popular programming languages books say
like the dragon book or the tiger book
or you go to any kind of like internet
tutorial you'll find kind of the
following outline for how to write a
programming language right you're going
to start by being told how to use lexan
yak and maybe bison or one of the kind
of things based on it or either that or
they're gonna spend five chapters on an
abstract parsing theory and tell you how
to roll your own Lollar parser and all
sorts of stuff that you don't actually
need to know then they're going to tell
you about more stuff that you don't need
to know like single static assignment
and control flow graphs
maybe continuation passing style and
they might you know have a very strong
opinion on the difference between the
two and then they're gonna tell you how
to omit machine code and machine code
that pushes registers and jumps and is
works on your processor right these are
how these tutorials and languages
language books present it and I think
that this is really outdated it's really
restrictive and it's kind of uncreated
and it's not wrong like if you did all
this stuff you would have implemented a
language and there are several languages
that do this see does this right
but it's it's really restrictive right
so I want to kind of expand our notion
of what it is to implement a language so
in order to do that let's look at some
modern languages I'm gonna start with
Ruby because Ruby is relatively
straightforward they take a string they
make it into a tree and then they
interpret it with some C code right and
this is MRI there are a bunch of other
implementations of Ruby right so this is
very straightforward the pipeline is
very small there's a lot of complexity
in here and this is in a lot of ways an
oversimplification but it's pretty
contained right Haskell has a much
larger pipeline right you start with a
string you get a couple of different
kinds of trees you do type checking and
then they have this intermediate
language called C - - that they use
which is sort of an off-the-shelf
language which is a subset of C with
some nice features stripped out which
which you laughs but that's actually
what is appropriate for you know a
machine writing code and then it outputs
native byte code and then there's an
interprets it on your hardware right v8
is a popular implementation of
JavaScript used in node and in chrome
and they actually have three different
backends so they take your string as an
input and they well so first of all they
can just evaluate that tree that they
get from the string they just interpret
it straight and then they can also run
it in tracing mode which generates this
trace and when you have this nice graph
of traces with a bunch of complex stuff
in it and from the trace it can actually
generate machine code so usually in your
browser all three of these are happening
at the same time depending on whether
the code is considered hot datalog is
one of my recent favorites it's what you
will use if you're using day
Tomic it's interesting because input is
not actually a string unlike a lot of
the other languages that we've looked at
its input is a data structure you can
express it in freshmen or you can just
use closure data structures right so
your your code is a data structure and
clojurescript I'm only putting in here
because it uses a language intended for
humans as an intermediate step right it
outputs JavaScript so in general the
only thing we can really say about
languages even these very large
general-purpose languages is that they
take something from a human they do some
processing on it on some kind of tree
and then they interpret it right and
this is what a language is a language is
a program that allows very complex human
input to be understood by a computer
that's it okay so given that here's a
couple definitions so this is a computer
language and I actually like calling
them computer languages some people call
them programming languages it's not
necessarily the case that you usually
will be programming with your language
so I generally call it a computer
language to emphasize that it's being
interpreted by a computer right so
that's that's a computer language human
controlled input of unbounded complexity
and intermediate representation which is
called an IR as a bit of jargon but all
it is is just one of the steps in the
middle of your pipeline usually you can
actually dump it to view it as a human
so you can get kind of an insight into
what's happening a parser turns text
into data structures and code is just
any input to a computer language right
this is all pretty simple so given that
let's talk about data-driven
architecture so data-driven architecture
is this new fad where you are supposed
to design your systems around
and data right you sort of push it to
configuration in a way so you take this
data that's maybe written by a human and
your application takes that data and
uses that data to specify behaviors
right so it gets kind of interpreted in
a way right and that data can be
potentially very complex depending on
the application that you're using so
let's look at some of the disciplines
that you would need to implement a
data-driven system right some questions
you might want to ask yourself if the
data gets persisted
what's the migration strategy if you
change the format how do you get from
one to the other or you locked into a
format all right
who provides the data how's it composed
how is it stored is it in a git
repository is it in a database is it in
the cloud I don't know is the data for
humans to write or is it generated by
machines this is a very important
question that we need to ask ourselves
and I see a lot of people forget this
and write for example configuration data
structures that aren't there are way too
large and unwieldy for actual humans to
interact with what behaviors or
resources do you want users to be able
to specify with your data and what kind
of behaviors and resources do you want
to exclude
and this isn't necessarily taking away
power it's more giving guarantees in a
way and I'll talk more about that um so
when I hear people talk about this as a
language designer it's really familiar
because the disciplines that you need
when you're designing a language for
people to use are exactly the same right
and I don't think it should be very
revolutionary here to tell you that data
is code these data is code right every
single one of these is something that
you have to think about when you're
understanding how to build a computer
language now if you're building sort of
a general-purpose language
what we consider to be programmers a lot
of these questions are answered already
right we have source control we have of
course it's intended for a human right
although someone else might decide to
generate it for us and we do have to
think about what kind of things we want
users to be able to do and what kind of
things we want them not to be able to do
uh you may have heard of green sponge
tenth rule if you haven't this is how it
goes any sufficiently complicated C or
Fortran program contains an ad hoc
informally specified bug-ridden slow
implementation of half of Common Lisp
and there's also Morris's corollary
which says including Common Lisp and I'm
not sure if that means Common Lisp
programs or the Common Lisp project
itself either way and it's you know very
tongue-in-cheek but Greenspun said this
for a reason right we keep writing these
systems that actually accidentally
contain languages and I actually think
that this this quote gives way too much
credit to C Fortran and Common Lisp so
my slight edit is that if your user
input is sufficiently complex then your
program is likely to contain a computer
language input which is probably not
very well thought out so let's look at
some examples of this right one very
common source of exa dental languages is
XML and JSON and it's XML and JSON are
very convenient in because they can
describe arbitrary trees and when they
can describe arbitrary trees suddenly
your user input starts to get very large
and a the sort of canonical example of
this is ant and who here has built a
project with ant it's got to be some job
of people here yeah so ant was intended
as a configuration syntax and then they
added conditionals and then they added
let binding and at a certain point it
became a full language that now we have
to reckon with an entire
language whose syntax is XML ColdFusion
is different because it was intended as
a language but they decided that parsing
was too hard so they wrote everything in
XML right query parameters for complex
HTTP interfaces you're not supposed to
be able to nest query parameters but
I've seen some people try watch out here
and that consider your entire HTTP
interface as a whole and think about how
it might how the user input might be
expanding uncontrollably and how you
might factor some of that out into a
language right this almost happened to
neo4j actually until they backed off and
wrote their cipher query language which
is quite nice PHP is one of my personal
favorite examples of this PHP was
intended to be a set of kind of ad-hoc
scripts to make your personal homepage
and sort of unfortunately at the time it
was in a niche that was a bit bigger
than its boots and so being the only
dynamic language that was open-source
that you could deploy that easily
so it kind of got things globbed on to
it until it was like an actual language
to be reckoned with
and they've dealt with some of their
problems but they still have to deal
with this history I love I love harping
on vim now you may notice that I'm using
them and the software that is driving
the presentation is written in demo this
was a language tacked on to a language
that was already tacked on to another
language which was really meant to be a
user interface that was that you
communicate back and forth then to do
text editing on a line because it was
too expensive to render the whole file
to the screen who here has ever read the
man page to find
okay great uh hidden within the flags of
find is a very simple logic language
it's not it we won't like do goals and
that kind of stuff for you but it's got
and and or and not and you can group
things it's it's quite sophisticated and
it's expressed in terms of command line
flags which is which is pretty great
okay so if you have this kind of system
and you understand that you're going to
have very complex user input you
probably want to think about using some
programming language concepts in your
implementation right in your design
especially so how are you supposed to do
that
right if these projects had sat down and
been able to understand what they were
doing and how they're going to end up
what might they have done differently so
let's design a language now languages
are very diverse they have all sorts of
different kinds of implementations vary
from very very large to very very small
but I think generally they break out
into about four different categories
some of them don't have parts of these
and some of them have parts of these
that are very large but generally you
have the front end which is the part
that connects to the human right this is
the part that you interact with you have
the back end which is the part that
allows the computer to do stuff you have
translation which is the process of
getting the user format to the computer
format and then you have runtime which
is sort of supporting code to allow the
computer to do the computer format part
and I'll get into more of how these kind
of inner relate but again some of these
can be very large and some of them can
be very small really depends on what
you're doing right so the goals for your
design
are to get a the computer to understand
the human right you want code that is
written to be able to be interpreted
right this is the very basic like let's
implement it right
you also want to make sure the human
interacting with your system understands
the way in which the computer
understands their code and this is this
is so that I can go and read something
else that someone else has written and
understand what the computer is doing
with it otherwise we end up with write
only languages right also I want to
understand if I have a new idea in my
head of what I want to do I want to
understand how to get the computer to
understand that right if that's within
the domain of what your program is
supposed to do cool so these are all
rather independent and all very
important design considerations so
questions you should ask yourself when
you are designing a front-end for a
language how will they how will your
users write store update and run code
this is pretty straightforward if your
language is in text and you're intending
people to write things in a text editor
and put them in a source control system
it's a lot less straightforward if it's
embedded in a system or your or your
input is data structures or query
parameters sometimes users don't persist
a code like for command line languages
that'll write it and press ENTER and
it'll run and it's gone right what kind
of errors can happen and how will they
be reported errors are not an
exceptional case in language land they
are the bread and butter of how your
language is going to interact with the
world I see so many people writing
languages and thinking of the error
cases as kind of like well I guess they
messed up so I don't know error cases in
languages are first-class you need to
make them happen and they need to be
nice
Clojure excuse me how much power do your
users need and how much reliability do
they need this is a trade-off that you
may find yourself having to make a lot
do you want to give users the power to
confuse other users this is a this is a
hard question because sometimes the
users need that power sometimes for your
system like C as a language for example
people need the power to do a pointer
arithmetic right in that domain it
results in a lack of reliability because
I as a user of a C library don't know
what that library is going to do battle
I have no guarantees about it other than
what's in their documentation and this
isn't necessarily a question of possible
and impossible it's more it's way more a
question of easy and difficult
what do you users expect to be easy and
what are they okay with being difficult
what do you want to be easy for them and
what do you want to be difficult for
them it's okay to make something
difficult if it's something that really
they shouldn't be doing right the core
of all of this is you need to understand
your users right this is this is what I
keep repeating and it's something that
people don't really think about as much
they think of languages is a very kind
of low-level technical project and it
actually is much more about UX and
understanding your users experiences
things to try in this phase I would
suggest writing a highlighting mode for
your editor if you're using text and
mock-up code this allows you to really
quickly figure out what you kind of want
to do and generate ideas once you've
generated ideas you want to kind of pick
a complex task that your users have and
implement it in mock up you want to show
it to people especially your target
users these are all basic design
principles right of how you design for
users you need to reconsider everything
you are going to do
discover that you are wrong about a lot
of things that your users want and as in
languages that I designed I've had to
kill so many features that I really
loved in order to actually make it work
for people so be prepared to kill
features that you love it's okay and in
general in the design process you want
the feedback loop to be really small you
want to be able to try something get
feedback on it and iterate on it and the
larger that is the harder it's going to
be to whittle that down to something
that's really nice and is going to meet
your users needs so for the back end in
planning for a back-end I suggest that
at first you start with something easy
and that you limit the languages access
to primitive features so that you can
swap out backends later unless the
backend is a very very important part of
what you're doing it's pretty
advantageous to do this the language
that I wrote for work has had five
backends now
it had three ways of interpreting one
where it generated JavaScript and one
now regenerate through B which is fun
you generally want to aim to get the
really big picture performance stuff
right generally kind of you know Big O
notation kind of performance stuff
things that block and things that don't
like the the sort of big picture stuff
don't worry too much about like how fast
your bit operations are at the beginning
because you can fix a lot of that stuff
later so at this point I want to stop
talk about the abstraction gap so here's
your language there's a human at the
left and interpretation happening over
there on the right and the distance
between the the format that the humans
are reasoning about the code in and the
environment which is interpreted I
called the abstraction gap now the
abstraction gap the bigger your
abstraction gap is the
more work you're gonna have to do just
in general but there's a couple of
pressures that keep applying to this gap
one is that the higher level the users
stuff is the better the UX is right the
more control you can have over their
error messages the higher level concepts
that they can reason about and then the
lower your interpretation context is the
better your performance is going to be
in general writing an interpreter in a
high-level language is going to be a lot
slower than compiling it to run natively
on your hardware right so these are
these pressures kind of pulling this gap
apart and there's a third pressure that
says the more the bigger your
abstraction gap does give is the more
translation you have to do and in
general the more runtime support you're
gonna have to have runtime support could
include garbage collection it could
include for example there was a data
system which i think of as a language
that was presented at closure conch last
year where you just make a data
structure and a web service pops up and
all of the code that actually runs an
HTTP service is runtime support rates
and you have to have a very complex set
of runtime support to make that happen
so depending on what you're doing and
where you're your domain is you may
wanted to make a very different
trade-offs in these cases so these are
the these are the three things that
you'll have to trade off between is high
level features fast interpretation and
slim runtime support cool so understand
where you are in that in those
trade-offs all right
so when you get down to implementing a
language and I'm assuming that your
enclosure now you can implement in all
sorts of different platforms but I want
to talk specifically about some closure
techniques that you might want to use
for the front end you need to decide
what the input format is the goal in all
of your input formats is to get it into
this variant format and if you saw my
talk at closure conch
this will be familiar otherwise just
think of it as an arbitrarily nested
vector thing with key words at the
beginning tell you telling you what kind
of thing it is and those key words are
specific to your application so you get
to decide what they are and match
against them later so one possibility is
that your input is text this is very
common if your input is text use insta
parse it's very unlikely that you're
doing anything that it can't handle I
don't want to spend too much time on
this because like I said all of the
books spend five chapters on it and
don't really get to anything else so
just using so parse we're done this is
the easy part
since we're in a lisp
another option for input is quoted forms
and you see a lot of languages like this
Herbert there's well hiccup isn't quite
quoted but it's in a sense of language
and a lot of macros end up being
basically small languages right
you can just do quoted forms manually
you can just get the forms and D
structure them and do whatever you want
if you want a kind of a nicer interface
there's the syntax rules library that
they have documentation go read it and
it's quite nice so to get your user
input interpreted there's a couple of
options one is just to walk the tree and
do stuff and you're what you're going to
use here is close your core match and
that's capable of D structuring all of
these vectors within vectors and making
stuff happen you might also consider
outputting closure closure is really
good at this I have written a language
that outputs closure and it's a
surprisingly good interface for this at
the time that I wrote a closure core
match had a bug with loop that made the
made the whole JVM go into an infinite
loop when I tried to load file but when
it tried to macro expand but it's a lot
better now and you should use it okay
now for translation and this is the hard
part
and like I think a lot of the time
because of the way that languages are
presented people think of parsing as the
hard part
because you're taking a flat thing and
making it into a nested thing but
honestly it's 2015 parsing is the easy
part if you get to design this in fax
parsing is very straightforward the hard
part is translation from your input
format to your output format the goal is
are to validate the code if applicable
and I suggest you go on youtube if you
didn't see it already Nathan Sorenson
stalk on domain specific type systems
this is a very deep topic about how to
validate code and sort of decide if it
does what it's supposed to do and then
get your code from the syntax to the
target this there's no library that you
can plug in here
this is whatever it takes programming
right you just need to make it happen
and basically the main strategy you're
going to use is you're going to D
structure this stuff with core match and
create new trees right a couple of tips
here do not shy away from using mutable
data structures if they're sort of
confined to one step of the process
they're really useful and if it makes
you feel any better
Haskell's compiler uses mutable
structures everywhere so it's okay
if you find something getting to be a
bit too complicated you can introduce a
new intermediate representation this is
a thing a strategy that I've used a
number of times and it really doesn't it
often does a good job of separating one
part of the process from another right
you can stretch up the pipeline if you
need to another thing you might do
instead of creating a new tree format
you might just do it rative steps on a
single tree these are all things that
are used a lot and that i've used to
successfully invest at this point when
you start doing translation you will
pick the back end you'll write your
parser and then you will start trying to
get from one thing to the other and you
will realize that things in your design
are impossible it's okay this will
happen to you maybe three or four times
depending on what you're doing and it's
okay to just loop back to design here
and say well I need to change these
things and show it to your users and go
through that process again so things to
take away one is don't be afraid to
write languages they're as easy or as
hard as you make them the hard part is
that your user input is complicated and
you need to do the work to interpret it
and that's a that's essential complexity
not incidental learn to understand when
a language is an appropriate solution if
your user input is arbitrarily complex
then you probably have a language on
your hands treat your data like your
code like your data understand where it
comes from where it goes how it's stored
but mostly and this is the big takeaway
I want you to get here is to understand
your users this is the number one thing
that we need to do as programmers that
we are currently failing at in a lot of
our language implementations so take the
time talk to people who are going to be
using it and really put yourself in the
shoes of people who are going to be
using your system
so that's what I've got questions
yes so the question was about
understanding the problem domain in
addition to understanding users
understanding the problem domain in
which your language is supposed to
operate and I consider that part of it
right like your users are wanting to
operate in a particular problem domain
and you need to understand that domain
you need to understand the language that
they're going to use to talk about the
problem domain you need to understand
the limitations of that and really kind
of know what you're doing anything else
and in the back somewhere on the balcony
excuse me
so a lot of the stuff that I've done is
not open source unfortunately especially
the one that I've written for work I've
done a number of designs which you'll
find on my blog which is there
my latest project is called tulip and
it's a general-purpose language I'm not
done implementing it I'm sort of in the
middle of I'm in the middle of having
started the implementation process and
looping back to design having found some
of the things that I wanted to do or
impossible but that's kind of where it
is yes
we had we have a large science team and
they they're not necessarily gonna pick
up Python to do their work and they
needed to be able to define certain
rating rules and how certain things got
rated and at the time we already had a
system that was a tree of nodes that
would roll up values and if he squinted
and turned your head it was it was a
language yeah there was a question over
here
oh you were pointing okay all right well
