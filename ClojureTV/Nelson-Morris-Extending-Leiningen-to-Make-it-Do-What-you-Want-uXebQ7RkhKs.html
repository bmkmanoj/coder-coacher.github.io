I'm here to talk to you about extending
line again it's kind of become the
standard build tool here in the closure
world and if you if you were at the cons
or if you saw some of the videos there
was a talk by a guy named Tim ewald who
did a hand program or and woodworking
with hand tools and towards the end of
it he makes an analogy he doesn't quite
make it all the way so i'll do it for
him that says that line is like a power
tool it's this very complex and possibly
sharp thing with some edges you can you
cut yourself and it does a bunch of
stuff for you and i'll say this is
pretty much true but it's a bit more
like a whole bunch of power tools put
together into an assembly line because
you do have the dependency management
piece that goes out on the internet and
if you tell it you want something like
apache commons then it pulls down all
the miscellaneous things that come with
that it does project up does profile
merging and this allows you to have like
a dev profile and a test profile and
this came up and recently in IRC where
someone had a has some resources they
wanted just for their tests but these
are multi gigabyte resources and then
women they actually put a jar together
and try to publish it it was a multi
gigabyte jar which was not what they
were looking for so and then lining it
does a bunch of other things such as
okay project isolation task resolution
whenever you run it from the command
line it goes and figures out what the
actual test but you want to run is it
does projects isolation so that what's
in the line again virtual machine tries
not to affect with actually in your
project and so you don't get when you're
in your project you don't get line again
dependencies somehow coming in and
messing things up it also does a lately
a new project generation so templating
for creating new projects out very
quickly now from this we've tried to
create a data interface
ace towards the towards line again and
this is the project map pretty much
every closure project has one now since
it lots of them used line again you can
set your dependencies and you can set a
bunch of other miscellaneous things in
it and so I'm here to talk to you about
what you can do beyond just what's right
there in the project map the things that
we have that are other ways to extend
the line again in pieces and I'm going
to start with or let's see so for this
I'm going to talk about how to define
new tasks how to actually change
lanagin's behavior that you want to run
time and how you do the the template
generation so you can define your own
after you've defined all these these
changes to lining that you want to make
whenever you go start a new project you
have these templates that already have
everything built up for you to start
with we'll talk about new tasks and to
talk about new tasks we have to talk
briefly about a little bit of the
internals of line again about line I
mentioned it briefly when I talked about
the isolation mechanism but when line
again starts up it's going to start a
line again virtual machine represented
here by the much more complex picture
this is the part where it goes out and
does the profile emerging the dependency
resolution the task resolution and all
that good stuff and then whenever your
fri it's finally ready what it will do
is it will spin up a another Java
Virtual Machine passing just the
classpath entities just the jars that
you need for your class paths and
setting that up every much smaller and
so you have to think about where do I
want my tasks to run at if I'm going to
create a new task is it a project level
task do I want it to run at the project
level is it something that actually
wants to change how lining in itself
works then I have to do something at the
line again level and
in general the the law you'll hear lots
of stuff about line again plugins and if
you're going to do a project level task
you don't need to worry about things at
about plugins about the the deeper ways
you can change it but if you want to
operate outside your project and effect
line again itself then you do have to
create palani can plug in so how do you
create the project tasks and this is we
have we've got Phil who is the creator
and maintainer of lon ian has a general
theory that a lot of tasks that people
think hey I need to have a plugin can
just be these project level tasks and
these are much more simpler to create
you can use it doing something called
aliases I'm going to talk to show an
example here this is the database
migration code roughly summarized
database migration code foreclosures in
it we define a namespace in our project
khlo charged EDT be migrated and then we
define a main function which then calls
out to our migration stuff and actually
we pass the the name the VARs rep you
know representing the functions that it
then needs to run and now to actually
call this from a command line structure
what we want to do is we want to put
this alias into the project map we tell
it that the aliases or our map from the
the key is going to be the task name and
the values going to be what it basically
expands out to so here we have when i
run my great what i'm actually wants you
to do instead is go do this line run
command dash M means and use the main
from this next name from the namespace
so run with the main from closures DVD
migrate and this allows me just to say
line migrate the task resolution happens
finds outs and it's an alias and then
can run at the project level doing the
project stuff that I want it to do these
are particularly useful for
like I've mentioned project level stuff
so if you have if you're doing DB or if
you have a database and you don't want
to create a GUI for say deleting some of
your data or moving itself you might
have have more of a command-line
interface you can just run a task for
runnin alias for this if you have a
messaging queue and you need to insert
some messages on the initialization or
startup you can do it here this also
particular useful for cron tasks if
you've got chron and you decide to use
line as part of your deployment platform
it can just call it to these particular
aliases and it's much simpler than
trying to create anything else we also
use something similar for our enclosures
for our stats for the downloads deaths
every 24 hours it'll go through the logs
and say what has been downloaded and
push this out into a file that thing
it's loaded by the clothes dryers web
system and picks it up and this is all
done through a very similar alias
mechanism an advantage of aliases being
that their project level stuff and they
stay at the project is that this main
function i have here can actually if if
you don't want to use line as part of
your deployment as part of your
deployment runtime in your production
run time you can just deploy a jar and
then when you get ready to run like a
cron task you can just do java put the
jar on the classpath and tell it to run
this particular main function from from
stuff using the normal closure
evaluation still evaluation so it
provides both a way to do it from a jar
deployment and then you can use aliases
to make it much nicer from a line again
deployment
now if you want to actually affect the
line against structure the line again
what it does then you two for your task
then we got to talk a little about about
what line again does for its task
resolution and so this is a summarized
version of the main that you call into
whenever you start up when you run line
it eventually ends up here does this
concept called profile merging where it
tries to figure out which profile you're
in and loads all the relevance i'll talk
about them later but hooks and
middleware pieces and then it calls into
this function called resolve and apply
that eventually ends up at a function
called apply task which does the alias
handling mechanism i talked about a min
ago and then it will call resolve task
to figure out what the actual if it's
not a lace it'll end up doing resolve
task to figure out to load up the main
space and get it get it going and it
calls into the function for your task
using the project and then the command
line arguments eventually the the
resolve task function ends up here where
it looks up the actual task bar and it
does this by line again dot template our
task name dot slash test name so when
you create a plug-in it's going to be
lining in dot plugin name and that you
define a new task you define the plug-in
name for that task or using the same the
task with the same function with the
same name here's a very very simple one
ZZ Z and it creates a task called Z Z Z
which basically completely ignores the
project and calls into some other
function somewhere
and now at the at the line again level
there's a lot of times that you want to
maybe manipulate lining it just a little
bit and then actually continue running a
task at the project level and the way
that you do this is with a function
called eval and project this comes from
line again core eval / eval and project
the first function the first argument is
going to be the project that you were
wanting to run the second one is going
to be the code that you want to run once
that JVM has started and it's ready
ready to go and the third argument is
actually some code that you want to run
a step before you run the art of the
code from the second argument this
involves working around something called
that phil has named the Gilardi scenario
it basically has to do with the way that
closure reads the arguments if you tried
to do a require in as part of the the
second argument it looks at it and says
I don't know what Z Z Z is even though
you're about to require it i don't know
i'm going to blow up so there's this
this pre initialization step that can
happen
and so for a lot of things that want to
to call back into the project they want
to call back into a specific point a
good example of this is line ring in
your project map you'll define a handler
which is going to be the web the web
piece that actually it goes and starts
up you define this in the project map
under the ring key and then what ring
actually does for the the code that it
wants to evaluate as part of eval and
project is it calls into this the the
result of this function here which is
this server bring server lining in serve
function and it's going to pass in the
configuration map that you put under the
ring key so it's going to take the
symbol represented by the hello world
core handler it's going to take that
it'll pass it off into the project vm
and that is then read in the project vm
and is able to be used as the starting
function sort of like a almost a
callback type mechanism but that
direction there are others other ways
that you can do this i believe the early
versions of like the line and mutant
plugin they had a namespace that if it
was if you had an immutable Iser it
could say ok we know that this exists
that we're going to go run the
initialization stuff from there
if you have a if you have a plug-in that
wants to run and doesn't care about
whether it has a project or not then you
have to put a little bit of metadata at
the front here for this no project
needed this lets us know that it's okay
for it to run without a project this is
if some examples are line the ones that
are built in or like line repple line
help line knew all those ones or things
that run outside of the project they
don't care about having a project I've
also seen plugins I've saw one when I
scan in the the list of a line ping
which almost certainly doesn't need to
have a project in order to go out and
paint a web server as part of as part of
plugins when you're doing stuff you
might hit a point where you need to
abort you might say oh I don't actually
have the the right configuration or
maybe you called out to a web server and
the web server didn't respond and
Lanigan provides a couple of functions
for this exit takes an exit code and a
message and abort just takes a message
but you want to use these over trying to
shut down the JVM yourself because there
are what are called higher level tasks
like line do which allow you to say do
this then do this then do this all
within the same wine again virtual
machine so if you yourself how to create
a plug-in that's they going to shut down
the virtual machine well then all the
rest of the people in that chain have
now have no ability to actually run so
we provide these methods here and they
get if you're the only task it will do
the proper exit thing if you're not then
we do a little bit of magic to let it
keep going all right so I showed about
creating tasks and how to call back into
the project test but we didn't really
change much about line against behavior
yet in order to do that the easiest way
is if you can just change the project
map I want to call out a pretension to a
couple of keys here Oh actually here an
example of doing this
in the way that was generally
recommended through lining it through
the line again team now is to check is
in the Z Z Z so that's our task the
first thing we do is we check and say do
we did the user define a Z Z Z profile
if so then we want to use what's there
otherwise we want to use this default
one that's that we defined earlier in
our in our name space we then want to
call merge profiles on a project and
that particular profile this gives line
a chance to do all the stuff that it
needs to do for its for its changing and
profiles and then we'll call pass that
off Annie Valon project and so what this
does here is assuming there is no the
user doesn't have the ZZ Z profile it
adds this new dependency into the tree
into the dependency tree that we want
and when we call eval and project that
that dependency ends up on the classpath
you see this a lot in fact this is
probably one of the most common things
about to do a for a plug-in is you have
a line ring does it in order to bring in
the ring dependencies line C ljs build
use it to bring in the closure script
dependencies pretty much anything where
you're going to call into another
project with a plug-in let me phrase
this anywhere anytime that you're going
to call at the project level on a
dependency that may not be already
required you should have a profile that
adds that dependency into it so you
don't blow up at runtime all right so
there's a couple key other keys i want
to mention in particular one of them is
called prep tasks there I haven't seen
this one used as much as it could be
when you have prepped asks these are
tasks that need to be run before we get
to to the evaluation point the part
where the project's ready to go it's
going to be a list of all of it all the
tasks and this kind of creates this this
life cycle type mechanism if you're more
familiar with maven it's not quite that
direct it's not quite that far but more
headed that direction and this uses the
general same task resolution mechanism I
talked about before so if you have
another plug-in like the
as a plug-in called mine shell we could
if that was included here we would call
out shell and they would call make
there's a line protobuf plug-in which
provides a protobuf command and that we
call compile you know the next step
would be to call compile would then
compile the proto buffers hit Java do
the Java compilation that it needs to
and then do the if you want to do the
closure compilation and then what's all
that's done it's finally ready to run
the rest of the stuff the next key I
want to talk about is a key called
injections and injections will run as
one of the first things of starting up
the project virtual machine we get a lot
of question or there's there's an not a
lot but it's a comment question of how
can I figure out what version my code is
at runtime and we've got this separation
between the line and virtual machine and
the project virtual machine and the
lining and virtual machine has the
project map but by the time you pass
things all the way down to the the
project virtual machine the project map
doesn't pass along with it by normally
and so here's the way you can put this
in a task where you say change the
injections key and it's part of this the
first thing I want to do is look at the
project turn it into a string and spit
it out into a resource and then on the
project side when you're able to then
read that resource we're trying to turn
it back into a real map and say oh I
haven't I now have a version that tells
me what version of the code I'm running
okay so those are the two those are two
of the bigger keys that aren't used as
often that represent a lot of that
represent some abilities to change line
again but if you find yourself not able
to do what you want through the project
map the big hammer and way to change
line against behavior are called hooks
in your plug-in namespace if you have a
function called hooks it'll get run as
part of the profile merging if you have
a function called activate then it's up
to the user to say yes I hooks are true
go and actually run this code as an
example of the first one I created I
plugin called line pedantic at one point
that hooked into the dependency
resolution and will look and say do I
have am i pulling down an older version
of a dependency then something once and
if I am then I probably want to go
figure this out first before before I
actually try and get into my code and
figure out that I have some problem at
runtime so just abort the whole thing
and by just including the plug-in since
this is all it did by including the
plug-in it was sort of implicit that
this is the behavior that you wanted so
I defined it in the hooks function an
example of the activate using the
activate function is closure see ljs
build see ljs build has some hooks that
you can add or has hopes that when you
run line compile it will also do the sea
ljs compiler when you run line test it
will actually run some closure script
tests if you run line clean it will
actually do do the the sea ljs clean now
the way that hooks are generally used is
are defined is that you use a library
called Robert Hooke and this is already
included in the project are in the
dependency list or already concluded as
part of the line virtual machine so when
you require it comes in this bottom line
here I could've done a little different
but the bottom line it calls hook which
is the Robert Hooke namespace and it
says add a hook and in this case it's
saying hook onto the line again compile
task and replace it with the
compile hook that I have defined above
the compile hook or when you use robert
hooke it takes the first argument that
gets passed to your your new function
that you defined is the old task the old
function that would have ran and then
you get all the arguments that would
have went to it so in the case of
something like see ljs build and it
hooks into the compile task it still
wants the closure compiler to run so the
very first thing it does it says okay
we'll go run the fur you know apply task
arts go run the first the the original
test that was there and then now we're
going to run our closure script compiler
and you can hook into you don't just
have to hook task level things in line
again for example in the pedantic
plug-in i mentioned before i actually
hooked into the dependency of their
solution portion of it if you go through
unfortunately hooks do require knowing a
little bit about lining in itself you've
got to kind of figure out what is the
right function i want to replace and if
you go look at the code line again has a
convention that if it's marked with
internal metadata so if it has colon
internal in front of it then it's a pub
then it's a private function that can
change if it doesn't have that it's
considered part of the public API and
you are welcome to go redefine it or use
hooks on it as you want to we'll try and
keep it as stable as we can now we don't
use the normal private and public
mechanism because when you're using VARs
as we doing here in the ad hook VARs can
go and jump into private private
functions anyways they completely ignore
the private metadata and so if you refer
to them this way you still get the
function back out so it's not like
there's a compiler error anywhere in
here that would that would that we're
avoiding all right
so what I've talked about tasks about
defining a new task I've talked about
how to change the project map and how to
you extend line again with hooks there's
another concept called middleware and
it's similar to ring middleware and
that's given a similar name but this is
something that's going to run all the
time for any task so changing the
project mobile level our project
changing project tests that changing the
project map just at the task level means
it only affects for when you run that
specific task but if you're going to do
it at them at the middleware level it'll
affect every task and so an example of
doing that would be the saving of the
project map that I showed earlier with
the injections key so here I do the same
check and see if the user already to
find this particular profile if not then
use this D for this default one I've
defined and then merge it in and then
I'm going to return it so middleware
sorry middleware you define a function
in your pull in your plug-in namespace
called middleware and it takes a project
map and it needs to return the project
map and it can then manipulate the
project map as it wants to so yeah in
this one I change the the resource that
I include the injections key if I can
and this is useful for like I said
running for any tasks so before when I
was doing at just the task level maybe I
just do it at compile but really for
something like this you might want it to
run any timeline rebel runs or any time
line run runs or any time line compile
line yeah you want to do it for a whole
bunch of tasks maybe the tests in
particular also as an example
okay I don't see middleware used quite
that often most most plugins do more
task level manipulation but it is here
for whenever you if you need something
to generally just change part of that
behavior all right and so now the last
thing that I particularly want to talk
about for lining in our its template
mechanism once you finally have to find
all these plugins or the middleware and
stuff that you want whenever you go to
create a new project you might actually
not want to have to rewrite your project
file to include all that stuff all the
time so we have a template mechanism to
define a template its line again new
template name as your namespace you
define a function also by template name
it takes the name of the project and
then programs here is going to be the
command line arguments they come along
so you when you run line new foo project
name or by a project name or directory
and then you can pass a whole bunch of
other command line arguments to it by
convention a lining in template or the
actual template files that you're going
to copy over go into the source
directory just a level deeper than
what's your name space was so you follow
the same name spacing thing namespace to
directory plan
I mean to change the slide oh well so
here is a an example of a template what
you would in general what you would do
is you bring in a new space called
lonegan new templates this is going to
have a whole bunch of helper functions
already defined for you and then in this
case I since the name flight then since
the template name is template here we
define a function named Tim plate in
this case it doesn't care about the
command line arguments so it just takes
the project name this renderer function
you pass to it the directory that it's
going to look for the template files the
ones that get that get changed and then
it's going to return to you a function
which I've named render by you by
convention to severe winter and it's
actually going to be what you use later
to generate the new strings for your
files that you'll use and then you also
generally create a date a data type
object which is a map just Maps a name
over to the values that you want it to
be as you pass that into your template
now inside the let here you usually use
this arrow files function and you pass
it the data which lets it go and
understand which which the directory
structure is that it actually wants to
go and write out everything to and then
you can pass it a set a list of well a
VAR args list of vectors the first
element is going to be the the file name
that comes out and the second element is
going to be the string that it's going
to render in this case we use the render
function that we ought to earlier we
tell it render this is the particular
template and then here's the data that
contains all the substitutions that we
want to make into it if you look down
there at the bottom there is one that
has this sanitized this double brackets
sanitized as part of the file name a
lining the part of the line again uses
or this template megam uses
mustache as its templating things so if
you've seen mustache this is how they do
it or if you haven't seen mustache this
is how they do it and all that does is
it replaces sanitized with the value
that came out of data when it look it
look takes the data map it looks and
says here's the sanitized key are give
me the value of the sanitized ski and it
replaces it in there on this previous
line here we see that it is sanitized of
name and name is the project name and
sanitize in this case does a lot of
stuff to help handle changes from that
line that that closure needs in order to
go from dashes to underscores or
underscores two dashes for the project
for namespaces to the file system I
think it also handles a couple of other
things but that's the big one is is the
underscores and the dashes here's an
example of the of a template file a
templated file a project file which just
says hey we can pull out name from the
data whenever you actually go to render
me and there are lots of other helpful
functions in this template's namespace
in particular someone's to draw
attention to are here but multi-segment
is a big one if you write your own
templates because a lot of people like
to deeply namespace there too there
there close your code and some people
don't so if you have you know orb
closures ecchi you know project then
this multi this multi-segment and the
sanitized namespace and all that help
translate from this deeply dotted thing
into the right files and into getting
just the particular project name from
that and so on and all of this is
defined in lonegan new templates it's
not that big of a file I don't it's not
too bad it's very it's pretty well has a
bunch of docstrings and other things
into it so if you go right templates i
definitely recommend looking and seeing
what are these functions do and can do
you need to be using them
when you're there all right so in
summary when you're ready with if you're
trying to extend line again for new
tasks what you want to do is either
aliases if you can there's an easier way
to do it and probably better if you can
get away with just doing that one
otherwise you need to do a plug-in and
we talked about plug-in resolution and
what it can do if you want to change the
behavior of wine again at a task or a
middleware level modifying the project
map is going to be the easiest way if
you can find there if we have a key
exposed that you can just change to do
what you need to otherwise you can use
the hooks mechanism which is a really
big hammer and you kind of have to
understand a little bit more of the
internal code level if you find yourself
using hooks on a lot of things that are
not task level then please come let us
know it might be a representation of
some place that we need to expose a key
in the project map for okay and then we
talked about templates and how they're
used to generate new projects if you
have questions where the IRC channel is
pretty well staffed at different times
and we usually am Phil is very very good
about answering questions whenever he's
around or you can go to lanagin org
which contains information on how to
join and send stuff to the line again
mailing list or you can send it to the
closure mailing list because we all
follow that anyways and there's some
information on me in general it seems
that I am the lining in person here for
foreclosure west this year so if you
