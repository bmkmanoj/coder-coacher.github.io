very happy to be here today in Barcelona
I'm here to talk about testing but
before I start allow me to introduce
myself briefly my name is Yann stem king
I'm originally from Warsaw a city in
Poland a beautiful place I recommend a
visit it's lovely this time of the year
I I've been using closure since 2010 and
I work at stylist in Munich mostly on
the back hand side of systems let's talk
about testing the testing culture is
quite strong in the closure community
when you generate your new project
typically we've line again you get one
test for free as part of the project
skeleton and to make matters worse the
test fails you have to fix it this is
good but why do we test things
automatically we have the repple right
we could just take all of our test
expressions and put them directly into
the repple and validate whether
everything works as expected or it
doesn't we don't do this because just
like sequences in our favorite language
we are lazy and it's a good thing it's a
very good thing we take things which are
easy and can be alternated and lets
computers do it for us and keeping this
automation and laziness in mind let's
dig into the world of properties the
core concept of property based testing
let's start with a very simple example
division let's assume we have an
arithmetic library we want to test and
we start with the division operator we
could write the following closure
closure tests test case which checks
whether the division of integers works
as expected with their division of a
double and an integer works as expected
and finally whether arithmetic exception
is thrown when it should be thrown my
question is is this enough its fist
enough to be sure that our library is
properly implemented if not how many
more tests
we need to do we need ten more a hundred
more a thousand more it's difficult to
judge instead let's see how we can
refactor this test a bit let's notice
that if we forget about the arithmetic
exception case we can use the our macro
and take the extract the test expression
to one line and then just keep
specifying more and more input values
until we are sure that our
implementation is right now let's do
some mathematics a over B equals a over
B let's multiply both sides of this
equation by D and simplify the right
side if we express this equation and
plain English we end up with something
which looks as follows this property
should hold for division general
property keyword let's take this
property and put it into our test what
we have here is something a bit
different notice that this time our test
cases do not have to have a result
specified we just specify input values
and we don't care about the output value
we just care that this property holds
for every single input value wouldn't it
make sense sense to have those things
generated for us for free so that for
arbitrary s and arbitrary B's property
holds it turns out that this is exactly
what the quick check is all about
originally introduced in a paper from
1999 and quick check for Haskell was to
look quickly ported to other languages
and it's available among other things
for closure let's see how we could use
test check in order to improve our tests
of the arithmetic library let's require
tests check the close report of the one
of the close reports of the quick check
method
and require a couple of nine spaces we
will need the core test check namespace
and the name is responsible for
generators and properties using what we
just what we've just required we can now
define so-called property prop is a
customer customary name - to name those
symbols so for all a's big ends and for
all B's being ends we claim that the
following property holds notice that if
you squint it's nothing but plain
mathematics now using the test case
quick check function we can generate
1000 random values piped into our
property and and verify is that
everything works as expected if we
evaluate this expression we will get the
following map back well this doesn't
look that good let's take a look
our is mattock exception divided by 0
well indeed we never said that we cannot
be 0 so we need to fix our property
somehow we need to make B's exclude well
we need to exclude 0 from possible
values of B in order to do this we will
use such that Combinator which believes
just like filter function if you like
given a predicate it generates a new
generator of values which match the
predicate using gel sample we can take a
look at various values generated by
various generators here we can see that
generator of integers generates ends
just as before and our new derived
generator excludes all the zeros just as
we wanted now we can plug in our newly
defined generator and take a look at a
result value of the new property we
execute our test again and this time
after 1000 executions test check did not
find any input values which would
contradict what
we claimed in the property but as you
remember in our original tests we use
the doubles as well let's extend our
test so that it covers doubles as well
less the version of test check I so
didn't have a built-in generator of
doubles so let's write one on our own
ethnic is something like math but for
generators here we are mapping the
double function over generator of
integers and as the sample function will
show us we get integers mapped into
doubles once again we have to exclude
zero so we use our old friend such as to
exclude all the zeros and this time we
have a new generator with doubles
excluding zeros we plug both generate
generators into our test case we run
1000 tests and the result is false
what's happening there well if you take
a look at the fail key you will see
value 23 and 21 this is a and B for
which the test fails well this is
puzzling let's take a look at what's
happening inside well indeed if we plug
those values directly into the test it's
false so what's the actual value well it
turns out that what we run into is the
fact that on our computers we used on a
daily basis operations and
floating-point numbers are not exact and
our claim about equality of those
divisions and multiplications was not
right and this is something generative
testing excels at it comes up with all
the crazy possible combinations of input
values and subjects your properties to
to a hail of tests and then it gives you
a ready input value to consider for
debugging a wonderful tool now I'd like
to show you something different let's
talk about reverse if we want to test
the reverse function
once again we have to think about some
properties holds something general well
for certain sequences like lists or
vectors reversing a reverse collection
is the same collection it would be
excellent if we could just test it this
way but there are reasons for which this
does not work instead we can write it
this way that's for arbitrary collection
reverse of reverse our collection is
equal to the original collection this
time I'm going to write a proper closure
test namespace to test this behavior
let's write let's create the project
core test namespace and let's assume the
following partially correct
implementation of reverse we will need
the DEF spec macro which corresponds to
a closure test def test macro using it
we will write what follows property of
reverse composed for all collections
being lists of integers I claim that
collection is equal to reverse of
reverse of collection let's run it we
can run it using standard core standards
closure test tools the map says that the
property doesn't hold and the failing
case under the fail key is 0 a list
consisting of just 0 well it makes sense
notice also the CD key
this is the random seed which is used to
will see the random generator which
subsequently generates values for our
test cases on new execution and you see
it will be generated and it will be and
our test will be subjected to a
different sequence of test cases let's
try this now this time test check
sounded different test case different
failing scenario it's a list to one and
now let's take a look at this part of
the part of the map which I've been
ignoring so far let's take a look at the
Shrunk sub map
shrunk contains the result of so-called
shrinking procedure shrinking is in
minimizing the failing test value how it
works is that after after quick check
and specifically test check after
finding a value for which the test does
not hold it uses certain properties of
generators to find to make those values
smaller and smaller and minimize them
and find the minimal value for which the
test fails and then it gives you this
minimal fail in case now I can't find
words to describe how awesome this is
instead of let's let's assume you've got
a domain where you represent your you
represent your domain using some nested
Maps potential you recursively nested
Maps test check will not throw at you
five megabytes of a data structure
saying debug that instead it will do its
best to minimize it to a minimal map
making your test fail again automation
this is exactly what the human would do
right we would try to figure out what is
actually the minimal scenario for which
our logic doesn't correspond to the
specification it's done automatically
for us it's outstanding
it seems that so far test checked is an
excellent tool as long as your domain is
expressible using lists and integers
arguably most domains can be expressed
this way but let's take a look at
something more applied let's take a look
at Stanford's at Cypress we are
maintaining multiple of several services
in closure
one of them is our main website this
system has quite a complicated routing
logic this logic has been a source of
many bugs regressions internal conflicts
and other problems we wanted to rewrite
it and we wanted to get it done right at
this time we also wanted to have
comprehensive test suit which will make
it made sure that this time no bug is
left behind property based testing was a
natural candidate for this problem we
decided to hide the entire
implementation of our new routing and
routes while routing and router
generation behind a simple API exposing
just two functions path to descriptor
where descriptor is a data structure
representing a given page on our website
and an corresponding function for
generating strings how would we attack
this problem how would we generate will
be tested
well reverse once again this shows a
very similar property to the reverse
case assuming that we have the same
context composing those two functions
yields a and identity function in the
domain of pass or descriptors so let's
test it what we wrote looked as follows
for all descriptors generated by our
custom generator of valid e descriptors
and for all contexts following equality
which I just described should always
hold the number of bugs the number of
regressions this single test has
uncovered in our implementation is
unbelievable and it's also a wonderful
tool for test-driven development if
you're into writing tests seeing them
read implementing something saying them
green you'll love this what you do is
you write a generator you write a
property and it just will keep giving
you more and more failing scenarios
until you will get your implementation
rights according to your claims and when
you're done you just extend your
generators to a broader the name of your
problem to broader subsets of your
domain or write more properties it works
like a charm it works for us like a
charm
let's take a look at some other use
cases in his dock John Hughes one of
course herself quickcheck
discusses a lot of interesting topics
among them a problem they found in I
believe well some car manufacturer where
the internal bus in which a message in
in which messages are being sent around
between various subsystems of the car
they found quite a life threatening bug
thanks to generative testing a very
interesting talk I really recommend
checking this out a word of warning if
you watch this talk you won't feel safe
in your car anymore another use case
Kyle Pillsbury and his work on
distributed databases Jepson if you're
not familiar with Kyle's work and what
he does is he subjects distributed
databases to automatically generated
sequence of operations executed
concurrently and then introduces
glitches in the network connecting those
databases and then figures out whether
and checks whether the database holds
promises it should guarantee in such
scenarios a really interesting talk and
really interesting and very real-world
very applied application of generative
testing a word of warning if you watch
this talk you won't feel safe using your
database ever again fine we see how
certain people use generative testing
for some really complex and interesting
problems but how do they do this well in
order to understand how do they do is we
have to dig into the world of things
which are other taboo and the closure
let's talk about state in order to taste
stateful systems generative testing
works on a bit different basis
originally introduced in the top from
2000 from in a paper from 2006 stateful
generative testing was was used to test
large telco systems at Ericsson Ericsson
was I believe the first customer of the
startup founded by creators of quick
check very interesting paper in which
they go in detail into how they have
their tool works and how it is how it
can be applied to really complex the
name instead I will just instead of
discussing it India I will present a
simple example the general idea behind
testing stateful systems with generative
testing works as follows you generate a
sequence of actions which you apply to
the system under test
thus mutating its State at the same time
you keep track of all the all the
changes in your internal model of the
system and after each application you
verify that the state of this system is
just as the model just as the model
suggests it should be let's take a look
at a concrete example once again
something simple in our case our
mutating state will be simply a variable
pointing to a closure vector and what we
want to determine is whether applying
cange
and operations will whether conjoined
adds to the end and pop removes from
doing from the beginning in order to
test the system we will maintain our our
vector and a variable pointing to it and
at the same time we will keep track of
elements in the vector in a separate
collection and after each application of
either conjoin or pop we will check
elements in the vector are identical to
elements in our module of the vector
let's generate a couple let's require a
couple of things faces let's use that
spec which we've seen before and
generators and a new library which I'm
introducing on this slide called States
which does all the hard work for us
related to generating sequence of
operations let's define a following test
case property of vector operations is
defined using the states around commands
function commands next step and
postconditions
that's a lot of arguments I will discuss
them in detail also there is the map
which stores the initial version of this
of the initial state of the system which
is an empty vector commands is a
generator of actions of operations which
will be applied for system
it looks quite complex it takes as an
argument as its argument it takes the
state of the system under test instead
of going into detail of its
implementation let's take a look at this
sample of values it would return as you
can see given a state in which a vector
is symbol a and a list of elements we
keep track of this 1 2 3 it generates a
following sequence of simple closure s
expressions which would be applied to
the vector next function to discuss is
next step as its argument it takes the
state of the system under test
a variable to which the last reason to
the result of last operation was
assigned and the last operation which
was executed we will dispatch on the
operation which which has been just
executed if it's conjoint we will add an
element which was added to the list to
our internal model and in case of pop we
will do the reverse
drop one element in both cases we will
keep track of the variable to which we
will keep track of the variable pointing
to our vector under test
finally post condition is the place
where our assertion is it takes as its
arguments the state of the system the
command which is executed and value
returned by this command in this case we
care only about the pop case if the
operation was pop we expect that the
returned value is identical to our
internal model of the system if it's not
pop we assume everything is alright
let's run our test and see what's
happening it fails post condition
unsatisfied this the system was in the
following states elements - 2 7 - 1 and
vector being variable - in the fail
vector you see a sequence of operations
which led to the post condition being
unsatisfied if the collection of
operations was longer
thanks to shrinking it would be
minimized to a smaller hopefully minimal
sequence of operations which reproduces
the incorrect behavior what's wrong well
it turns out that I made a mistake in
those condition in fact I made a mistake
elsewhere I keep track of elements of
the vector in a list and icon joint
elements to the front of the list
instead of in adding them to the end
what fixes the problem is reversing
elements in the Equality check with such
a small change I can rerun my tests and
this time after 100 of random executions
of various sequences of commands against
my state everything is alright
if you'd like to check out some more
complex scenario of this method of
testing I recommend taking a look at the
project which was mentioned already
today namely little matrix series this
time however I'm not interested in the
implementation of the library but its
tests in the test namespace Macau uses
generative testing to generate sequences
of operations which he executed against
his implementation of the map and
another standard library implementation
and finally he compares whether both
maps are identical this way maybe not
guaranteeing but increasing the
likeliness that his implementation is
correct as well on top of this strategy
of testing stateful systems and
generating operations to execute against
your system and the model of the system
you can build even more complex things
in which I've mentioned once already
today John Hughes introduces goes into
detail of generating concurrent
sequences of operations and applying
them to the state in multiple threads at
the same time and afterwards checking
whether the system under test still
holds its promises in case of any
potential race conditions it's happening
within the system between those
concurrent threads what you get in turn
is nothing but automated detection of
race conditions John Hughes company
offers commercial support for a product
and commercial support for testing of
such systems testing such
parallel models but in his talk which
I'm which I encourage you to take a look
at he discusses very interesting
applications he starts with very simple
cases some ticketing machines and then
goes to applications such as details
some really low-level
threats who libraries running inside of
specials write a triac database and
tells stories of how they use such
systems to find some really intricate
bugs deep insights of their dreadful
implementation a fascinating video
another interesting talk which I can
recommend is it comes from comes from
last year's Europe closure in Krakov
Philippe Potter introduces a new era of
testing and presents a an interesting
combination of of tools he combines
tools for regenerative testing like test
check with projects which Kyle Kingsbury
developed for his Jebsen
experiments and combine combines them to
achieve similar tools like like ones
offered by John Hughes company namely
automatic detectors of race conditions
in your closure applications I really
recommend very interesting talk very
interesting solution to a difficult
problem if you'd like to learn more
there is a lot of reading material no
need to take pictures slides will be in
the Internet's momentarily first two
links are to closure libraries which
implement this idea of stateful testing
using generative testing
to following links our airline
implementations also very interesting
very illustrative attend finally in the
blog post section we have an experience
report covering this this story which
I've already mentioned about using quick
check to find race conditions in thread
pool implementations then yellow wrap
blog there you'll find a very
interesting list of tips tricks links to
interesting materials links to
interesting libraries all dedicated to
being more effective at using your eyes
using generative testing for from
checking your code and then if you have
long commutes and are into podcasts I
recommend downloading the quick check
IDs out of mostly airline podcast which
is an interview with John Hughes where
he tells interesting stories about how
his work on a quick check has has begun
including the fact that the initial
version of the quick check paper got
rejected and after being finally
published after 10 years got a price for
the most influential paper of the past
decade very interesting podcast and a
couple of interesting stories and one
hour well spent I hope that in this
short talk I was able to convince you
that generative testing is a viable
alternative or a viable complement to
traditional testing methods instead of
specifying unit tests one by one
you just defined a more general broader
properties and use tooling which
automatically will verify your proper
is by subjecting it to a hail of test
cases if something is wrong you will get
back a minimal example showing you where
your system doesn't match your
specification on top of those simple
foundations you can build even more
powerful tools you can build things
which says stateful systems real-world
systems and finally making them
concurrent you can ultimate you can use
the same tool to automatically detect
race conditions and really complex
software projects just like Kyle
Kingsbury is doing and his Jepson work
what lies beyond that this is a question
I've got to you this is all I've got
