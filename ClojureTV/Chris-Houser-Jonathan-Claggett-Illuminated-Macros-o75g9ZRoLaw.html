about and sorry I'm having more trouble
with these slides here than expected so
I'll read off the screen so first I'll
just talk a little bit about what a
macro is or some ways to think about it
will define what we mean by illuminated
macros I talked a little bit about how
racket illuminates macros and then
Jonathan will talk how about how we can
do illuminated macro things and closure
so macro is a compiler hook right when
the closure compiler is going through
its normal process when it sees
reference to a macro it'll call out and
let you do arbitrary code right so
whatever you want to do you could have a
hook into the compiler through a macro
but actually the code you do there
whatever that arbitrary work is returns
more code right so a macro is a compiler
it takes code from one language and
produces it another now colloquially we
we talk about both the input and the
output forms being closure but they're
not really the same language so here's
an example of that this is a macro that
you might write if closure didn't have
its own left right this is kind of the
the scheme definition of using a
anonymous function and then calling it
to simulate let so the input to this
macro is a language that does have a let
to form right it understands what that
two means and the output of the macro is
code in a language that doesn't have led
at all but only has an arms functions so
this is a compiler from one language to
a slightly more basic language so a
macro is a compiler but a macro is also
a function and in closure very even
implemented functions just a regular
function that's tagged so the compiler
knows how to call it slightly
differently and like all functions
macros are best when they're
referentially transparent like when
they're pure functions you can of course
as you can in the closure function do
any crazy thing you want but most of the
time it's best if they're pure functions
that they just take their input and
we're
their output and don't do have any side
effects besides that many functions so
this is that that same macro I just
showed many functions do three kinds of
things one of the kinds of things is
collect input we often use destructuring
for that and then sometimes need to do
some more work besides there's often a
part that computes you can see here the
computation part is sort of well that's
not right at all
okay yeah well so you can see the
destructuring that's where we're
collecting input the the take nth forms
there are computation so here it's sort
of intermingled the computation than the
output but then that quoted that syntax
quote form is the is the output right
and so those are the three kinds of
things that a lot of functions do not
always separated some functions leave
those a certain and one of the one or
more of those out they don't need to for
example do any computation and in fact
we see that in macros you know which are
functions we might use slightly
different terminology we might say
actually emit and maybe even parse up at
the front because it's a compiler
writing its analyzing its input it might
be doing a little bit of parsing so I
mentioned these three kinds of things
because we'll come back to that as we go
along
specifically I think that often when
we're writing macros we either don't
need to or don't think we need to do any
computation once we've understood the
input we can just go straight to the
output I'm sure that people who have
looked at the core async go macro are
aware that sometimes you do need to do
some computation in your macro so
alright but what do I mean by an
illuminated macro so Jonathan and I have
been sort of pondering some of these
things and specifically the sorts of
things we'd like to see in a macro and
here are some of the things we came up
with this isn't you know it's not a
perfect list or anything but at some of
the things that we think would be nice
that we only see various degrees of
success in in macros that currently
exists so syntax documentation by that
we mean that
when you look at a macro it'd be great
to be able to understand how to use it
just look at the documentation and
understand what forms and what order
what they mean so good documentation in
whatever form whether it's textual maybe
a BNF notation would be nice to
understand what what input of a macro
needs or maybe a railroad diagram oh no
I had a turbo Pascal book that I loved
because it had railroad diagrams for all
the syntax
there's also syntax error messages so
for a given input that's incorrect it
would be great if we saw a report that
gave you the nature of the problem where
the problem occurred and maybe even an
example of what would have been valid
input a description of what would have
been valid input instead visualization
of parsing for a particular input so
this is something that I don't think
we've actually seen anywhere but it
would be interesting if when you gave a
form a specific form to a macro if it
could tell you how it interpreted you
know what parts were understood as what
so think about you know destructuring or
the optional parameters to the def and
macro if you could give it an input and
it could tell you how it understood each
of those parts to be and then
visualization for the output now we have
macro expand right and that's that's
something but it'd be pretty neat if for
example you could tell from the output
of macro expand which parts of the macro
form came from the macro itself and
which parts came from your input it
might help clarify what's going on there
and of course the important thing is
that it should be easy to do all these
things you know we can do all these to
some extent or other now but it's all
handwritten and re-implemented by each
macro writer so it'd be nice if there
were tools to help us do this better but
it's certainly not easy now so here's
I'm gonna pick on closure for a moment
you're not really meant to be able to
see all that that is closure zone defin
macro definition it's only an expert of
excerpt of it it's the part that is
analyzing the input understanding the
different optional parameters to the
defin macro it doesn't have anything to
do with destructuring this is in a form
of the DEF and macro that's earlier in
core that that doesn't do destructuring
yet and there's a couple other things
there's a custom error message that's
written up there at the top you can't
really see it but is checking for a
particular kind of problem and asserting
a English error that's meant to be you
know easy to understand so what happens
if you don't do that kind of manual
check well here's a quote from a paper
that I'll refer to a couple times in
this talk papers called fortifying
macros and this quote is saying that
when a macro doesn't check its input
sufficiently it allows that the macro
eventually trips over constraint checks
at a low level in the language tower low
level checking in turn yields incoherent
error messages and this was kind of a
theme of the paper and the things they
were sort of harping on and we'll come
to see how they addressed that problem
but here's an example of what they're
talking about so here's that same latin
actor I don't trust the screen now I
have to keep looking so you can see a
couple examples of errors here so the
the the middle of the screen there you
can see what happens when I give it an
extra binding form without a value right
it says wrong number of Arc's 1 I don't
know if that means passed to something
I've never heard of right as a user of
the macro without understanding how the
macro is implemented I have no chance of
understanding what that error message
means and in the bottom case there if
you can see it it's even a little
scarier because here I gave it some
crazy input and it didn't give me any
error at all it just gave me crazy
output right
so all right so that matter it was easy
to write oh I wanted to say so sort of a
summary of what closure gives us sort of
out of the box what we have now is good
in a few ways specifically we have this
syntax quote DSL really it's a DSL that
gives us a little bit of hygiene right
but even more importantly it has an
escape right it's got an escape Tildy
that lets you get back out into the
regular language now this is something
to be wary of in general if a DSL does
not have an escape it may be that you
are trapped right so
um all right so let's look at a
different approach for writing Macker
all right this is an example of what's
called macro by example this is this
sniff it was taken from the fortifying
macros paper and it is implemented in in
racket it's a flavor of the scheme
language so I'm going to check in my
time I'm going to very quickly go
through this to say that
so the define scent is just a little bit
on you find the defined syntax is sort
of the generic way in racket to define a
new macro so then the syntax rules is
the specific DSL that they're
demonstrating here for for writing
macros and the key thing to note here is
the third line is a pattern that shows
what the actual syntax you're trying to
match is right so it's this let form and
then the last line is the output from
the macro alright so you've got those
those ellipses there which are sort of
magical and you can see that it's doing
some kind of rearranging of the terms
and somehow it understands the ellipses
in different places and there's very
specific rules for how that works and
but the result is that it's a little bit
self-documenting right you can read that
pattern and that looks pretty close to
what you would have to type as a user
trying to use the macro so it's a little
bit self documenting in that way so it's
one step closer to illuminated macros
but you are trapped because there's no
way in here to put between the pattern
and the output there's no way to do
arbitrary computation in fact there's no
way to do computation at all somebody
noticed this and well so I just wanted
mention that that the that you're
trapped here
so now it maybe you might accuse me of
hypocrisy for wanting to write macros
without being trapped by a DSL when by
writing macro I'm probably creating a
DSL right so if I recommend avoiding
hypocrisy either by not trapping your
user at all or at least providing an
escape out so that they can provide
regular closure code with a full power
of the language okay
so here is another form of macro by
example called syntax case
it added a very little bit more one more
feature which I wanted to point out
because it's another of our three parts
of function this guard expression here
in the middle is more or less arbitrary
code you can see there it's got special
syntax for referring to these magical
ellipses variables but this guard does
not participate in the output at all
except to the extent that it causes a
failure
so the one improvement we've made you
the the the pattern is the same right so
the documentation part is the same but
the the guard expression all it really
does is it helps constrain you know
contain the errors to the macro itself
so you don't have things bubbling up
from the lower level of the stack like
we talked about so it's a slight
improvement well so the authors of the
paper the fortifying macros paper I saw
all the weaknesses in this and address
them all head-on and so here is an
example of their solution so you can see
the format there is very similar and now
it says syntax Parsons though the other
ones we looked at and so they addressed
the problems head-on by by adding things
to their DSL one of the things they
added is more syntax patterns so we
didn't really look it in detail but
syntax case had really three kinds of
head literal lists with there were just
regular parentheses unconstrained VARs
so there's those bars that were getting
matched and used again later and
sequences represent by the ellipses
syntax poor parse has a few more pattern
constructs well a lot more really so
they really you know handle that problem
they also added some other things to
their DSL they added types to constrain
what pattern variables can match and
then they added syntax a defined syntax
class form so that you can create your
own pattern types they added site
conditions which are like guards but are
more localized and trigger sort of
backtracking through the parsing rather
than failing the entire case and then
they added the ability to write custom
error messages for your side conditions
when they fail here's an example of let
that uses a few of those features not
all of them so
you can see that the the one real nice
thing that we had from macro by example
which was that the pattern looked like
the code it was matching has sort of
been lost and we've got sort of some of
the pattern down here and some of it up
there and then there's a lot of other
you know stuff going on so it has sort
of taken a step backward in the
documentation front but where this
really shines is in error messages
because with all these names and
descriptions of the patterns and and the
way that it's a real parser that's going
through and parsing the code that you
give it it's able to find multiple
possible errors that it can describe
fairly clearly and then choose from
among them the one that they think is
most likely to be useful to the
programmer so the error messages are
really where it really shines but along
the way they've got a DSL that still has
you largely trapped and is indeed you
know somewhat complex and is walk
backwards in the documentation so
jonathan has some other thoughts on ways
we can solve this Thank You ciao sir
okay so this is Ruby and this is racket
but let's talk about closure we have
macros just like racket has macros those
those macros they have syntax and of
course we would like good documentation
for that syntax so before I talk about
the tool that I'm going to present I
wanted to show real quickly what we are
dealing with today and kind of the kind
of the state of the documentation and
error messages with closure macros today
I'm gonna focus on let throughout this
part just as a way of being consistent
with the paper that we were reading
referring to previously okay so I
highlighted the syntax parts of the of
the let doc string they're all in green
so you can see that it's first of all I
want to mention that it's handwritten
second of all it's not complete we have
let which is gonna have you know zero
more bindings inside of square brackets
and then the binding form is missing
from this syntax documentation in fact
unfortunate that's unfortunate because
it's kind of the most interesting part
it's you can of course go to the URL
that I've also highlighted in green but
that's hardly that's basically punting
and saying I'm not gonna give you all
the documentation which is unfortunate
because the code is written in closure
and it knows somewhere in this closure
base what that syntax is okay so let's
look at error messages I have a basic
common newbie error message up here
you're going to accidentally try to bind
to a keyword instead of a symbol the
exception error are the you know they're
it's actually not that bad you are
trying to use a keyword and it's an
unsupported binding form but there is an
issue here if you look at the error
message it's coming from nowhere in the
code that you typed it's coming from
someplace else
specifically line 4029 of core so you've
kind of lost if you're new to closure
this doesn't help you tell you it tells
you what went wrong but doesn't tell you
where it went wrong and for that matter
it doesn't actually tell you what you
could have done right another example of
destructuring another error message that
you might see in in with let
this is more subtle there I've
accidentally typed a C after the colon
as not a problem it compiles it runs it
returns just fine until I actually try
to use C and then it's not there so this
is an example of even though we have the
macro doing the parsing verse it's just
missed apart for this could pattern so
it's not quite a complete checker well
let's look at the code for this grammar
here maybe we can fix it or maybe not
well this is a handwritten parser so it
does it's actually a really nice you
know it does this job and it actually
has a lot of error messages in there and
it tries to get through all of the
contents of of what you expect to find
unfortunately it is handwritten it is
complicated and just you know adding
that one part in here to make sure that
you can't have symbols following the
colon as might be a bit tricky there
might be side of you're not side-effects
but you might have consequences that
ripple throughout this block of code ok
so let's talk about the project that I'm
working on that was spawned by the for
find macros paper and just try to give
it at first of all I have no idea how to
name things so if you have any ideas
just I'm I'm open to suggestions after
the talk the goal of this project is to
help define illuminated macros which
essentially boils down to good syntax
documentation and good syntax error
messages there are other things that we
talked about which we're going to try to
get to in the future but for now that's
what it's solving right now okay right
in the middle of the right at the base
of this project is a new function called
parsed forms the way parse forms works
is it takes two arguments a as yet
undefined syntax that I will describe
but just not right now and some kind of
input some kind of set of input so in
this case it's something that looks a
lot like let and the return value of
parse forms is whatever that lets syntax
returns I'll get into that in a little
bit but if it doesn't if it can't parse
it
it's just gonna try to print out some
kind of error message remember that : a
that we saw let's look at another
example of that this time with what
parse forms returns for an error message
just as a caveat I'm not entirely
thrilled with this output but at least
captures the three things I want to
capture so more work is needed to make
it prettier but it essentially captures
the essence of it first of all this is
showing us where exactly where there was
a problem in the in the form it's
showing us exactly what happened there
was a bad value and showing us why it
was a bad value showing by showing us
positively what we were expecting to see
so there that's the three things of a
good error message you can actually
probably if you were a new person
looking at this code you have a shot at
fixing it without resorting to a webpage
so okay so that's parse forms I wanted
to try to step it back a little bit or
make it a little bit more convenient to
use parse form since after all it's two
functions so of course we have to wrap
it and convenient macro in this case the
macros name is def syntax it defines
essentially a macro on what's different
between def macro and def syntax well
they both take for example in this case
let as the name def syntax it only takes
one argument following it and that's the
syntax of the macro again I will get
into that syntax in a little bit so it's
essentially expanding to def macro let
ampersand forms and then it just calls
parse forms that's the essence of it now
there's a reason you want to use def
syntax rather than just saying def macro
or you know and calling yourself and the
reason is because it exposes the syntax
that so-called let syntax up there it
exposes it for other tools to describe
it so there's another tool called the
syn doc which prints the syntax for any
macro that has been defined using def
syntax so let's look at that again def
syntax let let syntax and here I'm
printing out the actual grammar of that
syntax this is generated code
and color-coded because it is because
it's generated I can color-code it and
this is the complete grammar of let it
shows binding vex it shows how to D
structure maps and goes through all of
the detail this is considerably more
complete in fact it is complete
for what let does and the syntax that
let requires I think just as an aside
this is the only source of documentation
right now that has this complete picture
of what let does so this slide will be
available after the talk ok all right
but that's showing the output well you
guys want to see is the input or rather
how do we actually go about making these
magic grammars that show up and in such
pretty colors so what is it well at its
core is a library called sequence
expressions or seek X this is
essentially reg X except that it's a
it's essentially reg X for all of
closure values not just characters so if
you want to think of reg X as something
that does pattern matching and pattern
capturing on a single string of
characters this can do the same
effective thing but this time across a
string of closure forms or rather
closure values of any kind be it
integers sets data structures of any
kind which is nice I'm going to start by
showing an example I'm going to build it
up over time and this is the actual
grammar for the let for the let form
that we saw earlier so down below again
we have deficit and tax let's so this is
a macro and I'm gonna it has has some
various features that describe the
grammar so cat that just stands for
concatenate and it means that we're
gonna connect all the sub forms
underneath it the Veck form is the first
form and rep star is the second form rap
star is merely the repetition pattern it
means zero or more vekl it means this is
a literal subsection here and it's going
to be a vector well what's inside the
vector another pattern in this case rap
star so there's going to be 0 more
binding pairs just to just four
the forum is a default and it matches
any one thing binding for binding pair
is not defined we have to define that so
let's define that here we have a def
it's just a var and it's bound to a rule
called binding pair there's nothing
special about the rule it's just
labeling it so that when we print it out
on the screen it looks good and it's
defined simply as a concatenation of a
binding form with a form I had for
convenience I've made another macro
called def rule that simply combines def
binding pair with rule binding pair in
this case it's def will binding form and
it is defined as the alternation between
either a symbol or binding vac or
binding map so the last one I'm going to
look at is binding the feck and it looks
like this as you can see it's a Veck
form so it's some kind of literal vector
inside it is the concatenation of 0 more
binding forms followed by an optional
simple AB and ampersand followed by
symbol followed by an optional key word
as followed by symbol okay so what's
tricky about this particular one is
binding form is actually defined after
this one so it's a recursive grammar in
order to get at grammar elements that
have been defined after you I had to
declare it upfront up at the top as you
can see it and then because it hasn't
been defined yet I had to wrap it and
protect it with a delay this is an
example of using existing closure
constructs to just protect us and able
now we were able to describe grammars
that are recursive in nature okay so
that's that shows the definition almost
the complete definition of what is in
the pattern of a grammar but there's two
aspects of sequence expressions just
like regular expressions there's pattern
matching and pattern capturing or input
capturing so I'm going to show you some
of the input capturing features in
essence there's only two parts to it
there's a cap function and a recap
function cap is for capturing actual raw
data that comes in in both of these
examples you can see that cap binding
form and cap form are capturing is
more forms underneath them so what's
recap that is something that allows you
to get access to all the things that you
have already captured thus far in the
pattern so as you can see underneath
recap is that whole sub pattern the
input to recap or rather what it what
recap gives you is a function that can
access the captured elements thus far
and the output of that captured function
becomes a model that is available for
further use later on in the pattern so
in this particular example I'm capturing
the binding form D structuring it
because there's only one item in the
binding form same thing for the for the
value I'm D structuring that and getting
the first item out of that and then I'm
just returning it as an object this is
probably going to be one of the harder
elements of this to explain but I don't
have a lot of time to talk about this
but this is I think the important point
here is that you can you its arbitrarily
powerful you can describe caps anywhere
you like in your code in your pattern
you can define recaps anywhere you like
above those and apply any closure
function to those and the output of that
closure function becomes available for
future recaps up the stack okay
so that's the idea or that's the example
of using it let's talk about the ideas
in sequence expressions and why some of
these ideas are nice the first one of
course you're not familiar with the
sequence is the importance of data at
the end of the day the syntax is data
and that allows thus induction to
traverse that grammar tree and generate
rules and print those out in a pretty
way likewise automatic error messages
come out of this because the grammar is
available we can parse it and the
results of that parse become an abstract
syntax tree that we can track and we can
find out where things went wrong and
find out by looking at the original
grammar where things could have gone
right and it's not the end of it because
we're starting with data we don't have
to end with a specific closed set of
tools we're open to future improvements
as we go forward
so another aspect I think Chancellor
mentioned this was a the idea of
trapping DSL Zoar the idea of escaping
from the DSL well I made a conscious
decision here I think you saw the Veck
forms and kind of the cumbersome use of
vector or why didn't I just use vector
in that position well because I didn't
want to have any escaping I wanted you
to be eight free to use this as just a
library not a DSL that you can go into
and then you have to run away from when
you're when you want to do real work so
the idea is it's just functions there's
actually no macros in the sequence
library itself the sequence expression
library and it's defined underneath as a
protocol there's all good programming
closure libraries do so you can extend
it to everything just as a practical
example all of closures literal forms
vectors numbers string sets etc have
been extended across this protocol in
fact they match exactly one occurrence
of themselves and that's the that's the
definition of a literal so if you want
to stick a number in a sequence
expression it is it's there and you can
just use one and that is a valid
expression and it represents one
occurrence of the number one and that's
on purpose there's no escaping needed
there's no special form that gets you
out of this DSL if you if you haven't
typed a special for a special function
name then you're not in the DSL so you
can define it however you like or you
can use it or not use it as as you see
fit this last point I want to make it's
probably the most like I was alluding to
earlier the hardest point to talk about
there's two elements to sequence
expressions the matching portion and the
the building portion and it mixes both
of them very consciously together so
this is a very controversial complexion
of two types of functionality you have
your patterns they're arbitrarily
powerful and complex you have functions
built into that those are functions
therefore arbitrarily powerful and
complex so that's bad right it makes it
well there are downsides I'm going to
start with the first one which is simply
makes the pattern harder to read in the
source code
because the source code has been
polluted if you will with captures and
recaptures and more recaptures so that's
your trade-off for using this code - you
know it's using this library and you end
up with patterns that are kind of hard
to read in the source code so unlike a
macro by example you can see that we've
not even tried that to go for that goal
now that is mitigated somewhat because
we can use syntax doc or sin doc to
print the macro the syntax out on
another Channel
so you were actually while you can't
read in the source code you can
certainly read it elsewhere and you can
display it in other ways another
advantage though of having this mixing
of pattern matching with pattern
capturing is there composable blocks of
code so one syntax expression defines
both things and you can reuse that chunk
in other syntax expressions I'm going to
show a quick example of that
so here's defin as defined using the
syntax expression library it has the
bottom part is a set of optional
docstrings attribute maps and an
alternation between a single signature
body or a literal list form one or more
literal list forms that have signature
bodies in them it's not the terminals
are just a shorthand way of telling the
the the grammar to say that's great
don't print anymore underneath this this
is an endpoint as far as that we get the
idea when you see the attribute map we
know it's a map okay
signature body is borrowing the the
binding vector let as its first part so
whatever that work is being done there
both in terms of matching and in terms
of capturing is being lifted and put
into here so it's a very easy and
composable way to take your code and and
define arbitrarily complex grammars and
then define and reuse those bits and
pieces as needed throughout your your
your stack of macros and just for
completeness this is the full syntax for
defin again
I don't think this is available anywhere
else so this slide will also be
available after the talk okay so that's
the end of the talk and we have
described illuminated macros as having
basically four things that we like to
see is we would like to see good
documentation we'd love to see some good
error messages and we would like to see
additional advanced tools that help both
the developer of the macro and the user
of the macro to see how the input is
being compared to the actual syntax and
how the input is being compared to the
actual output and that's that's the URL
by the way that's it
you should have time for a question or
two anyone have any questions yes the
output code is there is the mod that
this is the code no that's the code no
he's talking about the output the so the
the model so after you captured it it's
this one here oh I'm sorry right so
that's that's the capture so if you were
to use this exclusively for a macro it
would be it would be in those capturing
functions that like that little
anonymous function there is where you
would be building up the output form and
then it would come out just like that
because it's as you said it's a it's an
arbitrary complex output capture as well
and so that's what your output form
where you're a platform would be built
up that answer your question okay good
question so the question is where's the
output for that since X I have not put
in this example the capturing code the
reason is it would I couldn't fit all
that on one slot so the idea would be
there's two ways you can think of using
this or if this helps to think about it
one is simply to capture everything and
then just to send that to closures
built-in let that would be basically
treating all of that grammar as simply a
validator but the more advanced usage
would be to capture at various key
points all of the information for
example at binding returning maps and
then finally generating your output from
that results at the at the bottom level
there would be a final lowest level
recap that would produce something that
would say let star etc etc etc okay well
nice question
we do not the question is do we have a
way to trace from the input to the
output we want that but we do not have
that the closest we have is the same
macro expand that we have for other
closure macros which only shows you the
final output right because we have the
grammar as a tree and because we have
the results of parsing it as a tree
there's no reason we can't do that
except I'm okay
okay yeah the scheme folks have have
done a lot more work on more complex
macro languages than we have in closure
here so well that's all our time so
