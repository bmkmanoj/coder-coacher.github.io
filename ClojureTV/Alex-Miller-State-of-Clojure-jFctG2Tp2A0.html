this so then he said no you should do
this okay I'll do this but I wanted to
go through a little bit of the things
that were going on in the last year plus
of closure because I think it's really
really exciting and rich talked about
all that and that there's just amazing
stuff going on and it's all of you doing
things more so than me but I wanted to
highlight some of those things and and
get some of that stuff out there so I
want to cast your mind way back to long
long ago to like January of 2013 so and
in January 2013
none of these libraries existed so it
was only like a year a little little
over a year ago but I'm gonna guess that
most of you are probably using one of
these libraries and this is not a
complete list by any means like there's
no way I could possibly list all the
libraries that come out in the last year
but there's just like all the prismatic
libraries and core async and the tests
check simple check stuff and just tons
of other things that are out there that
did not exist a year ago so I mean I
think it's it's clear that we are like
rapidly evolving some really useful
tools and that people are using to make
real stuff and in the tooling space I
think equally they're just the world is
totally different now than it was a year
ago as far as closure tooling the
intelligent cursive plug-in has come out
and it's fantastic if you haven't tried
it yet that's a great if you're looking
for an IDE type solution for closure
it's great
the counter-clockwise continues to
advance and they have a standalone
version now so it's a lot easier to get
started with in Rafael kam cider
them fireplace has really come in to
become the new vim Vanguard for closure
work the night code IDE came out for it
an enclosure it's a great place if
you're just getting started I think it's
a fantastic beginner environment light
table was open sourced and has just a
huge active community of people building
great plug-ins and doing all sorts of
really interesting stuff avi is a the I
sort of
similar editor written enclosure they
come out recently the gorilla repple I
haven't even had a chance to play with
yet but is doing all sorts of
interesting things
closure refactor and a but there's a
bunch of other even libraries and tools
that have come out and none of those
things existed a year ago I mean that's
just in the last year about a year ago
closure 1/5 came out and that had
reducers in it and the new threading
macros and some of the Eden Reader and
Eden changes and lots and lots of other
stuff closure 1/6 came out a few hours
ago and so that's been release please
switch to it yes and I'm not gonna go
through all the things that are in that
but the you know the highlights of that
are that there's a new Java API for
clawing into closure D structuring of
names based keys and maps of some new
some functions that have not nil tests
in them we've done a huge overhaul of
how hashing works with the goal to
prevent some cases that could come up in
in in the past especially with
collections of things and so I think
those are there's some specific cases
you can fall into that are really bad so
that we've addressed those significantly
I think and then there's tons of bug
fixes and little improvements and things
and I don't have anywhere near of time
to go through all those but go look at
the changelog and look through all those
and I also want to include Korey sync in
this because it really started as
something that you know originally was
going to being part of closure 1:6 and
rich managed to design in such a way
that it did not require did not need to
be actually in closure itself which
meant that we could put it out there and
people could immediately start using it
with old closure releases or existing
closure releases and so I think that was
absolutely the right thing to do and and
rather than trying to include it in
closure itself and so I'm happy that
that got out there as a big piece of
work and I want to thank you I know
there are a lot of people in this room
who contributed patches these are all
people that have patches that ended up
in one six so thank you to everyone too
one who has been submitting tickets and
patches and all that sort of thing and I
want to call out special attention to
Andy Fingerhut who's right here and I
kind of live in JIRA and watch every
change that goes into it or new ticket
everything is I'm watching all that
stuff and and continually trying to
tweak all that and make it better and
that's my job Andy also was doing that
and and so just as a community member
and he really puts a ton of time into it
and he he catches a different set of
things than I catch and so I I really
thoroughly appreciate his help and
everything he's done so I want to make
sure that got called out there's also
been a ton of new books that have come
out these are all books that have come
out in the last just in the last year
and I like that a lot of them are really
focused on specific domains and not
necessarily on like teaching syntax or
something like that we're getting more
focused books now about different things
we also have some old classics that are
have new revisions coming out in the
near future and then there's some new
books that are not out yet but are on
the way so there's just a ton of books
out there I might be working on one
myself and if you're a newbie sort of
looking to get into closure there are
fantastic resources now that did not
exist a year ago and I'm gonna mention
some of them here and I'm not mentioning
some that already exists so I was just
trying to focus on the ones that are new
in the last year or so but Daniel
Higginbotham has been working on closure
for the brave and true which is
available online but also no starch I
think is going to publish that as a book
if you would like to consume it in that
form
Kyle Kingsbury I'm not sure if he's in
the room but he's been at the conference
has been working on his closure from the
ground up series which i think is a
great series for getting started
Karen Mayer has the hitchhiker's guide
to closure which is a little more
tongue-in-cheek but she's been working
on that and I don't have anything about
her work with robots and things like
that later on in the talk
excuse me she's been doing all this work
with programming robots with closure and
going and talking about it at places
like oz comm and other conferences and
that's just a huge boon for us in terms
of as a community in terms of getting
spreading that knowledge in new domains
and things like that the closure cons
were moved online into the closure
script koans which it's just a really
easy way to point somebody at this and
to get a feel for some of those things
exorcism is a great site for programming
exercises getting feedback on them and
that that's has clothing support in it
as well as other languages Stewart
Holloway Neal Ford put together a video
series last year for O'Reilly which is
like six hours of material so that's a
that's another great resource
Eric Norman who's here did a successful
Kickstarter last year for to produce a
series of intro to closure videos as
part of Lisp cast and he has a new
series on web development that just came
out
speaking of crowdfunded things Ambrose
Venera sergeant did a IndieGoGo campaign
last year for type closure he was trying
to raise $20,000 so he could continue
working on this he actually raised
$35,000 and then I'll enabled him to do
some stretch goals one of which was
supporting Nikola mow meadow and some of
the closure and closure ideas that he's
been working on in tools analyzer and
some of the things that Tim Baldrige
talked about yesterday we had a bunch of
students in the Google summer code last
year
I want to thank Daniel Solano Gomez
who's been over here and he's been
working on it for a couple years now
really helping facilitate all that work
and is continuing to do that this year
and so he deserves a great round of
thanks for that it's a great way to get
students involved and and to have some
new kinds of work a new research type
level work done in the closure community
and so that's great
the lisbon summer projects happened last
year and I don't think they've released
the results yet but
at the point where they had at the point
where they had announced the art they
provided some data after the first set
of projects came in and I think 35
percent of the projects were in closure
so clearly a lot of people were using
that I don't know if anybody
participated in the closure cup
competition last year but that was a
really fun thing that it was like a
48-hour competition to put together
closer apps and I really hope that they
do it again this year I there are just
some really neat things that people put
together and a relatively short amount
of time and so it's fun to go look at
those set of projects that got created
pretty rapidly we have a great and
growing community there are almost 9,000
people on the closure mailing list there
are about 50 user groups on the unlisted
on the wiki page we have for this and
about over 60 that are out on Meetup and
I think a lot of those overlap but the
number of members and the the meetup
groups that are out there is more than
8,000 so clearly there are tens of
thousands of closure developers out
there working on things that are visible
and I assume or that are not quite as
visible but I'm really if you don't have
a user group near you please consider
starting one if you have questions
please contact me and we'll help you
with that and it's a great way to meet
people and and learn and if you want to
teach other people starting a closure
bridge in your area would be a great way
to do that
Brigid Hillier and all the other people
who've been working on closure bridge
are doing a phenomenal job it's sort of
bringing closure to more people and to
new people and I seeing the first
workshops in Durham and San Francisco
sell out and just a day or two or
whatever has been just awesome and so I
really looking forward to seeing those
everywhere and repeated and all those
new people coming in and I hope that a
year from now when we come back that
there's a closure West has a ton of
people who've been to closure bridge and
are here
talking about it and that sort of thing
so other people are starting to notice
thought works does this technology radar
every quarter where they talk about new
emerging technologies and whether you
should adopt them or assess them and
that sort of thing and there they've had
closure solidly in the adopt spot for
for a while now and so it's nice to see
that up there people see tos and people
who are looking at technology look at
this sort of thing so it's important to
get that out there red monk has a
language survey which compares github
projects and Stack Overflow questions
and and you can see there's some
correlation there trying to get an idea
for language popularity closure was the
biggest mover in the last survey that
they put out it had gone up five spots
and was now in the top twenty and
highlighted where it was there there's
kind of a grouping up there of older
fairly established languages and then
there's sort of a second-tier there and
I think that that's where you see
languages like Clojure and Scala and
Erlang and go and and I think it's we
continue to be really obviously in that
sort of that tier and so people are
having if people are obviously using it
because it's out there and you see that
reflected in these numbers there's been
a number of important acquisitions that
have happened in the last year so Runa
was acquired by staples Innovation Lab
and obviously a lot of those people are
here and so and they've continued to
hire and do all sorts of great stuff and
it's important to see these kinds of
things happen in the industry because
you know closure is a high leverage tool
and so it's really awesome to see that
leverage plank paying off for people and
being a good example out there climate
corporation I know there's a lot of
people here from the from climate got
acquired by Monsanto last year that's
another really noticeable one and I
wanted to mention that relevance and
metadata partners merged last year to
become cognate act and that's where I
work and
meditative partners is the company that
had supported our that Richard created
for atomic and one of the big benefits
of this merger is that we had enough
enough people involved that we could
offer enterprise support for closure and
de Tomic and other things that are
coming out of contact and so a lot of
enterprises that's an important checkbox
out there of being able to buy support
so we're I'm really glad that exists out
there and we can help out with it a
little bit there been a number of boy
actually layered that over the top there
there been a number of success stories
out there that I wanted to talk about to
puppet DB I'm not sure how many people
are aware of this but they are probably
the most deployed close your app in the
world they have 40,000 installs and
continue to rewrite more and more of
their of their platforming closure I'm
gonna have to drop out of here one
second I just dropped that in late and I
dropped it over the rest of the slide
here so Beanstalk has been having
success pulling closure in room key has
been growing with closure and talking
about that publicly which is great the
mail online is the Daily Mail's online
website and they've switched over to
closure and have been pretty visible and
talking about it prismatic obviously
people have probably heard about
prismatic this week if you hadn't heard
about it already but they're doing a
fantastic job building a company a
platform on top of closure so those are
all just a sampling I know there are a
lot of other people in this room who
have done other awesome things and I
can't possibly be comprehensive in all
of them so if I didn't include yours in
there I apologize for that but there's
too many people doing too many awesome
things for me to track it all which is
great and where are we going next I
don't know where we're going next I
can't wait to see a year from now where
we are and what people have built what
tools people have built and what's come
out with closure and
closure bridges going and where the
community is going and I'm totally
excited to see where that's going
so keep making awesome stuff it's a
summary of all that and that's all I
have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
