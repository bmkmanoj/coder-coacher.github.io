practice I am careful medida in here at
simple swinging ball dress that is my
twitter handle I'm Anna I'm the software
developer at walmart labs you can find
me on twitter using that twitter handle
and on any other social media platform
using my first and last my last name
so what is a closure bridge it's a
community effort to encourage what more
women who are near to software
development or need to closure to learn
closure and we provide weekend workshops
worldwide workshops are free to attend
with venue food and everything else
provided by the sponsors and workshops
are organized by the local communities
but the curriculum the ultimate
organizing materials are developed in
collaboration by everyone who's involved
in closure bridge all around the world
so closure which was started in late
2013 and the first workshop spring 2014
in Durham in San Francisco and they're
based on the rails bridge model of
programming workshops so if you're at
all familiar with rails you might have
heard of them there friday evening in
sofas where everyone gets together a
meat seafood and installs their dev
environment and then they come back the
Saturday after and they spend the entire
day learning closure there's also no
bridge foundry which is sort of like a
nonprofit organization that serves as
like an umbrella for stuff like closure
bridge and railsbridge and I think like
angular bridge and go bridge and other
stuff like that where if people are
really interested in a certain
programming language and they want to
bring more diversity to the community
they can start their own bridge and
provide resources like advisors and help
finding sponsors sort of regardless of
what you work in so what exactly does
closure bridge do well just like this
cat we make magic happen not really we
work on curriculum ways we are slowly
developing various versions of learning
materials trying to target different
levels of programming skills we teach
volunteers teachers and tas how to
organized workshops in an inclusive
supportive environment
and we organized workshops all around
the world and every closure which
chapter shares their experience with
everyone else in the community so we're
constantly working on improving and
developing curriculum making everything
better so accordant we started our
workshops by volume custom curriculum
like Anna mentioned we do Creek young
involvement as a community so if you go
to github com / closure bridge /
curriculum you can see all the stuff
that we use your workshops and you can
contribute to it yourself and there are
a lot of ways to volunteer time with
closure bridge a lot of them involve
doing face to face things that is not
you're seeing it for some reason you can
go along and you can also like right and
file issues and we're super chads to
have that also and one of the frequent
questions that people ask me at
conferences is sort of why bother riding
around curriculum especially because
over the past few years a lot of books
and other things we've been developed to
teach people like beginner level closure
from trash and that is true that there
are a lot of books that people can learn
from but a big part of closure bridges
that we develop things as a community
and aside from just sort of like
teaching a workshop we like teach people
in the community how to teach show and
inclusive workshops so the existing
resources out there aren't quite as
inclusive as we'd like to try for and I
felt like an exercise of this was I went
I looked at like 38 different closure
books on Amazon which was as many I
could find that where it's all published
and I looked at every Edition and check
to see like who the authors were and I
were the first few pages I looked at
their BIOS and check to see what
pronouns that used for themselves and
out of 38 there was one who didn't call
themselves EE which was not super
encouraging given that we teach
workshops for women so I thought they're
also ways to contribute to books other
than writing them yourself so I thought
I'd go through the acknowledgments pages
and see how many times an author of a
book thought to ask a woman what they
thought of the thing that they were
writing and out of like 232 times it was
someone who went by he none of those
times it was someone who went by she
which is also not super encouraging so I
think there's more than enough
justification for like writing our own
curriculum for teaching workshops for
people who aren't men then we should be
considering input from people who aren't
men as we're writing our lesson plans
and yeah there are few different parts
of closure bridge curriculum there's the
teacher's guide which explains to people
who are teaching a workshop how it
actually uses the curriculum there's a
set-up guide which gives instructions
for attendees how to set up their
closure dev environment there is the
core curriculum which is like the basics
of closure and then there's a capstone
application so we have a few different
ones that at the end of the workshop
students can sit down and figure out how
to use the things they just learned in
practice and I can decide right now the
curriculum is beginner level but we're
trying to like develop intermediate and
slightly more advanced ones as well so
people can come back and keep learning
every time and dip like I mentioned
there are a few different capstone apps
one of them is total swap which is sort
of like using a library that's closer
turtle to draw like line based graphics
using a term like in logo one of them as
snowflakes which is like animated
snowflakes fall evening zinc will
another one is twinkle twinkle little
star so you can learn how to like make
music using overtone and then there's a
global growth application which is like
the basics of web bulb 10 closure and
caesar cipher which is a shorter
exercise that's like building a caesar
cipher and practicing like stringing
character manipulation enclosure so the
coach bridge curriculum includes a lot
of things but who actually writes the
curriculum it's these people and
possibly more these are as many people
as i could find by just sort of like
going through all of the repositories
that are closer related
and like in the closure bridge
organization that we use in our
workshops and these are people who sort
of like contributed directly to those so
thank you to those people since some of
them are like actually physically here
right now and this example of someone
who's contributed to the curriculum
which is long oh who is sitting there
and he's now waving a hero closure
turtle which is library that we used for
the turtles wat capstone I mentioned
earlier he said that he initially helped
teach san Francisco's closure bridge
workshop in 2014 because you got
interested in teaching closure because
he was teaching Tamil already and he
originally heard about closure bridge
when he was teaching his own closure
workshop at this big event in Oakland
every year called Oakland workshop
weekend where people sort of like teach
free sometimes like tech related
workshops and people my community come
in and get to learn new things so he
heard about one of the hosts there that
a closure bridge was happening and he
really wanted to help out so said my
main intention in getting involved was
to pitch in to the effort I want to do
my part to help closure bridge a
beginners closure workshop that has
great cause your community supports to
be able to get off the ground and be
successful in the early stages and of
course he totally agrees with the
overall goal of increasing diversity on
the electric mini so then closure was
2015 happened and he gave a really good
presentation on programming closure and
camel which they're like links to that
presentation in the side deck and he
also sought a talk from Yoko prada who
is when together like board members of
closure bridge and she helps with the
curriculum and accrued sponsors and like
helps with website and does basically
everything and she talked about how
teaching functions is the hardest part
of closure pitch workshops a lot of time
so long ago decided to help out he said
he was thinking of writing version of
logo written enclosure and then he and I
ran into each other on the stuff I went
evening and you realize that it could
probably be using closure bridge
workshops so he pried toys he
prioritized as a side project and then
she was cool for rendering because
Bridget Hillier was also somewhere here
at the conference she started closure
bridge she was really enthusiastic about
it because we're already using it in
some of our workshops and yeah now the
library Hughes gets used enclosure
bridge workshops this is a tweet from
Sarah vessels who attended closure
bridge Kentucky last September and she
is making pretty flowers using closure
journal and that was her final project
so yeah if you're interested in writing
lesson plans on his nose and so who
watches the waters or if you're not a
Star Trek fan who's making sure that
everything goes well here's a sample to
do list or for someone who's organizing
closure bit workshop it doesn't look
very inviting does it and if even if you
organized workshops before you probably
could use some help fortunately there's
lots of help first of all there's a
closure bridge workshop a Google Group
and where people post their questions
there I the poster advice their post
about the their experience the reports
from workshops that were completed and
there's also mentorships on social
assistance and th raining here the
mentors you can find them on Twitter or
on the mailing list mentors are
basically members of the closure
breadboard and who organized workshops
themselves they can guide you for the
whole process of garbhán organizing
workshop and even if you organized an
event before we strongly encourage you
to keep us in the loop anyway because we
want to make sure that everything goes
smoothly that organizing workshops it's
not a painful experience so that you
organize them again
and hopefully again and again until your
whole town or city is programming
enclosure there's also an organizing
guide it's open source it's available on
github it's pretty much a collection of
notes on how to tackle all the staff
that needs to be done if someone has
some experience in organizing events
then the Minimum Viable workshop
describes what exactly is needed for a
workshop to qualify as Scotia bit
workshop so for example there's a
teacher training there's the install
files that's usually on Friday and
there's a actual workshop that's on
Saturday then there's workshop planning
timeline which explains what specific
tasks need to be done how many weeks or
days in advance the organizing guide
gives you also a sample budget and
templates for all the email
communications that you might need what
is super useful and there's also a small
section about class level grouping and
information and how to tackle that
subject many staff I don't think many of
you like to handle money and well I'm
actually glad because otherwise I'd
probably I would probably be at a
banking conference at closing conference
and i'm pretty sure that just the
thought of finding sponsors arranging
payments since pretty scary to some you
might exchange some transactions so that
the bank account and then I don't know
get into trouble whether the tax man and
you want to avoid that the easiest
solution to that is to have sponsors pay
for things directly and that's all fine
and well if you have some contact if
there's someone who you can reach out if
you live in an area that's rich in tech
companies then you probably know someone
you have contacts but not everyone is so
lucky and fortunately we can help with
that we can introduce you to some
companies we can give you advice about
on fundraising here's a list of all
previous sponsors these amazing
companies very often helped us organize
more than one event they provided venues
sometimes their employees were also the
volunteers big thank you to everyone on
this list because if it wasn't for you
nothing we are doing would have happened
otherwise so after you found your mentor
after you found your sponsors it's time
to set up a teacher training teacher and
ta training this event is intended for
people who has never been a TI or a
teacher before or for folks who ta it
before but not taught and like to teach
in the future for anyone who feels a
little bit shaky about the prospect of
doing it again the winning again about
teaching basically that aim is to go
over some general teaching concepts and
the core closure with values and
comparing
how this affects how this influences the
instructional style that you should use
when you're teaching the workshop the
material we use is the same material
used by rights bridge the link is on
that slide as well th training is also a
great opportunity to go through any
problems that people are anticipating
and worries that your volunteers might
have it's also a great chance to get
just get to know each other better and
make sure that everyone's on the same
page here's one of the examples of how
volunteers prepared themselves for the
actual event no last though organized
closure bridge in Austin the local
austin closure meetup dedicated one of
their monthly hack days to work through
the curricle and they played around with
the light table as well this gave them a
chance to make sure that everything will
worked and they ironed out everything
that didn't basically it's it's
important to dedicate some time to
familiarize yourself with with the
material that you're going to work on
and if you spend some time and fixing
some things that you finds that are
broken everyone else in the community
will benefit from that
so yeah once you organized or Chuck
inevitably have to actually teach it aha
we've had 33 workshops so far over the
past about two years which was 24 cities
across eight countries with about like
22 attendees a workshop which is about
720 enclosure bridge attendees so far
but across all those workshops we've
gotten a lot of the same few questions
from organizers in particular who should
teach the workshop how much experience
your teachers have and where do TAS come
from even as far as who should teach the
workshop we say ideally it should be a
woman because it's sort of woman
oriented workshop but possibly not if
there aren't that many leading closure
devs around I tried to find a jiff that
was a jiff of a cat leading things and
this was the closest I could get I think
it is entertaining nonetheless one of
the goals of closure bridges to create
spaces that are led by people who are
under represented in tech so if they're
women excited to volunteer we sort of
seed whichever positions they would
enjoy doing to them which often means
like teaching aunty annuals and then if
not sometimes they'd rather tame or
organize other than like lead the class
so in those cases we are really just
have other volunteers as far as how much
experience teachers should have teachers
come from a lot of different backgrounds
some of them are really experienced
teachers some of them are programmers we
don't really teach or do anything like
public facing at all most of the time
and we also people who are relatively
new to closure but enjoy talking to
people and to be honest like as long as
you're familiar with the concepts that
are actually in the curriculum and you
go through the exercises a few times
it's generally fine and you're like good
to teach so this is an example of one of
our tea is Elena is an associate
professor of community of computer
science at the University of Minnesota
in Morris I think several for students
are here at this conference this year
Ct a foreclosure bridge workshops in
Minnesota in Boston and she also gave a
talk at last year's closure west on
adapting closure for an entry-level
computer science classroom which that is
the talk and there's a link in the
corner in the science a rest assured not
all closure bridge TAS and teachers are
professors of computer science but what
I was talking with her she said really
good things about teaching and had
really insightful responses so I wanted
to share them with you in particular
some of the closure which teachers and
tas previously t84 courses in grad
school or they worked in like a
classroom vaguely at some point and
they're really jazz get back into the
classroom for day but there are some
differences between teaching for like K
12 / University and then teaching
foreclosure bridge and as Leonard puts
it there's no goal of teaching specific
concepts and no assessment the goal is
to give students a feel for programming
a better understanding of what
approaches and skills this activity
requires and hopefully to make them feel
that they have or can acquire those
skills also hopefully to let the
students have fun with programming and
experience joy of accomplishing a task
the exact details of what those tasks
are matter less and students often
surprised me by trying challenges that I
didn't even think of so in other words
the goals of closure bridge workshop
isn't necessarily to set benchmarks and
make sure people meet them closure
bridge workshops shouldn't be a big rush
if you don't get finished that's fine
and in fact people shouldn't even
necessarily feel like they finished
anything because the goal of a closure
bridge workshop is to teach new
community community members the basics
teach them how to get started and make
them feel welcome to come back and learn
more later and as part of Tang and
organizing for closure rich Elenna also
spent some time recruiting other
volunteers to help teach the workshop
one of the frequent barriers new
organizers face is figuring out how to
find TSU aren't men existing closure
user groups are usually very friendly as
is everyone at the conference but they
also tend to be predominantly male so
one of the key points of closure bridge
is to create a learning environment for
women so you should try first to like go
out into the community and find
NTA Elenna said her strategy for this
was to reach out to folks that she met
at closure Weston quarter cons if you
happen to have college students or staff
in your user group or there's a college
nearby you can reach out to them and
upper level students are often really
jazzed to help teach people programming
and all women's college issues that are
especially really helpful because all
the computer science students there are
women and we do also try to get previous
students to come back NTA after they
have come as an attendee which is the
more sustainable path viewing this and
finally Elena's most valuable take away
from teaching the workshop was seeing
people discover that they can do things
that seem so foreign to them it turned
out that most of the attendees at her
workshops learned functional programming
concepts like higher-order functions and
recursion pretty naturally and even
though she was skeptical at first about
how feasible it would be to teach a
one-day like actually beginner little
workshop enclosure she found that it
worked really well so now it's the
committee job to keep developing
materials and contributing their time so
what happens after you want after the
workshop while you're organizing and
later writing the workshop you're
working against time constraints against
the rush to get everything done in time
so once it's over you just want to sit
back relax forget about everything you
think you're done but you're not well at
least you shouldn't be we strive to make
every closure bridge workshop better
than the last one so running a
retrospective of your volunteers is a
really great idea and it's getting more
and more popular among the organizers it
gives everyone a chance to go through
everything that happened we also ask our
students for feedback on the workshop so
after the event we
an anonymous exit survey asking them how
we did then summaries are usually
published on the closure bridge workshop
mailing list we tend to reuse the same
questions we have we store them in the
organizing guide on github here are some
quotes from the survey so closure bridge
is all about inclusive supportive
environment and flexible curriculums the
environment where you're not being given
some what you go and left alone to try
and figure it out yourself so it looks
like we're doing a good job in this area
but of course there's always room for
improvement I'm going to give you a
moment to read that
we always ask the students about the
things that they think we should change
lots of stuff comes up during the
workshop but also through the survey
there are many pain points around
tooling around writing better
curriculums that target different levels
of programming skills so this is where
we need help and since all materials are
open source it's really easy for any of
you to lend us a hand and if you've
noticed the last two quotes they talk
about lack of follow up activities so
students go to this really cool event
they learn about closure and then they
may or may not know what to do next like
what do i do what do i search for more
materials where do I find like-minded
people are they any events that I can
attend how do I signed up for them so
organizers very often create attendee
mailing list to help them with the
communication that they send out when
they're organizing the event so it's
good to just Bray use that mailing list
and send out occasional email about the
local closure metab about a conference
about opportunity grants maybe even
compile a list of some useful resources
that they could use your students could
use to just carry on learning culture I
sometimes hear people say they meaning
women should make the effort to learn
that language on their own to try and
find resources on their own if they're
really serious about programming that
they should maybe not prove themselves
but like that we shouldn't have to reach
out to someone who's really serious
about the thing that they want to do and
I don't agree with that I don't think we
should be expecting anyone
to reach out to us we shouldn't make our
community into this special Club where
people don't feel welcome they don't
feel invited a few years ago if I went
to a tech meetup are usually was the
only women woman in that event and if I
were lucky maybe I was doubling the
women presence in that room but if you
look around us today at closure West
there are over 60 women so I think
reaching out to minorities really pays
off here's a very cool thing that the
organizers of closure bridge in Berlin
do they have this weekly learners group
that is about 10 people and every event
starts in a very relaxed atmosphere with
a potluck and a chat and then they form
groups and hacking stuff sometimes these
are one of hacks times longer running
projects they have a tumbler with some
art pieces that they created using
closure but on top of that they change
their regular closure meetups to make
them more beginner friendly so they're
now more accessible to closure bridge
alumni and the result is that the turn
up to those events is just more diverse
and one was one last thing let's not
forget why we're doing this why we want
more women and more other minories
minorities in tech we want to make our
workplaces more diverse and we can't do
that if we don't hire so if you happen
to be hiring an entry-level closures or
someone who's programming in other
languages but its closure
curious-looking among closure bridge
alumni is a really good idea there are
also other women integra groups like
lambda ladies or if you don't want who
who you should contact but you'd like to
post your job advertisement somewhere
you can always contact someone from the
closure bridge and we'll help you out
that's all thank you if you have any
questions it's time to ask
I don't think there are any events
taking place right now I think the last
event was in Seattle last week this I
don't think there are any events
happening and in like in the nearest
future yeah we also so if you go on like
the github so if you go to Lake closure
or github com / closure bridge there's a
repository there where we file issues I
think it's like / workshops and people
who are in like the process of
organizing something will open an issue
there so you can go through and see the
cities where people are currently
working on it we don't post them on the
website until they create an event right
page for it
ok we will be around there's wait
there's one L this offensive school
yes so I learned closure through closure
bridge and I got hired by someone I met
at closure West or closure punch like a
year and a half ago or something also
there's at least one person I know from
the San Francisco workshop who started
out actually like she went through boot
camp light like I did then went to
closure bridge I was interested in
functional programming and now she ended
up interning at several places i think
her first rope was actually doing scala
development though and now i'm not sure
what she works in now yes she is at slam
data doing scala so sometimes end up
with closure herbs sometimes other
functional languages and things I don't
think we've actually sat down and like
counted to see how many are working
professional enclosure guy yes
the question was are there any returned
deserters and how frequently do these
happen it depends on the city because
it's always done by local organizers
sometimes people will organize one and
then sort of like hope the best some
people are like in Berlin where they
organize one's very regularly it just
like depends on the city and in
Minnesota they had had like two so far
and then they're organizing a third one
right now I think in Austin we had one
and now they're in the process of
organizing a second one to this year
it is so it's not coming for students to
come back as students the next time
they've been some cases where students
come in the first time and then come
into TI like subsequent ones yes we
don't have like an intermediate or
advanced level curriculum right now so
for the most part it's like if you come
to close your bridge you are a beginner
at the thing that we are teaching you
and then subsequent workshops often will
use the same curriculum so it makes more
sense to have them to get a versus come
in as a student yes
in your curriculum that are specifically
more inclusive or welcoming a better
I talked about Hershiser okay um so the
curriculum for closure bridge was
written specifically to teach like
women's workshops it's not necessarily
that we have stuff in there that's
better for women I think we pay
attention to like the verbiage we use a
lot more I don't think there's anything
like inherently about the stuff that we
use in workshops it's like gendered it's
mostly just like if you read the stuff
that we use in workshops or at UCS use
our stuff and workshop it does like look
different but most of the time it's like
the lack of a gender isn't it I think we
spend a lot more time like removing
assumptions and stuff from it because we
assume people know nothing when they're
coming to this workshop so we try harder
to make that true I think and because we
use it like explicitly in workshops
every time someone teaches a workshop
and something doesn't go well we end up
changing it almost directly after so
yes
I have something at the primary the
pressure was what is the most surprising
thing that you found while developing
closure pitch workshops I think for me
like I so I went to a boot camp but
ultimately I was mostly self-taught and
I was working like profession as a
functional programmer before I started
getting involved with co Turkish and I
think what was surprising to me was like
what a big difference like the fact that
people were explicitly trying to welcome
people mate I think when I was first
learning how to do functional
programming it wasn't through something
like this and i would go to meet ups and
I didn't feel like I was supposed to be
there and no one actually said anything
otherwise and it makes a big difference
to just sort of like explicitly tell
people that they belong there and I
think how big of a difference that makes
is what is so surprising that it's not
just like amazing it's like it helps
everyone for the most part to do that do
you have something well it's a little
bit different but I I got a few
responses few emails from other closure
which organises about the things they
were surprised about and they all agreed
that surprising was the fact that
closure is a really good language to
learn programming to start learning from
programming from if you're coming from
another language especially if its
object oriented programming language a
public thing that closure is probably
not a good idea to start learning
programming it's just the opposite so
that was something that I found really
surprising
any other questions
okay then oh wait how there's one more
every time yes so we've been using light
table until I think very recently
meaning like on the order of a couple
weeks recently a flight table before had
like the insta rapel belton so it was
super easy for workshops or like not
super easy was relatively easy to like
get people started because there wasn't
as much for them to hold in their head
in terms of like starting a dub
environment like once they had it set up
it was fairly easy to keep going I'm not
sure if people are still using my table
some are some are still using it sorry
no so it's not default included anymore
so it's a thing that you apparently have
to like install separately you and sad
face but yeah
yes I think now people are starting to
use like night code is the thing that
people use yes
any other questions
yes
that is not much in terms of syntax that
you have to learn so you're just
learning the concepts you're not
learning everything that surrounded
it's just a little more direct than
explaining right
also to repeat the thing that just
happened soon as what makes like closure
a good thing for beginners and David
chambers who also volunteers for closure
bridge his only closure bridge board he
was not just like irrelevantly jumping
and just then Memphis that is who that
was he was saying that's sort of easier
to introduce people to how to manipulate
data because you don't have to sort of
like wrap it in objects and classes and
things and you can just sort of like
manipulate things more directly the
person in the back
other
do you like or subscribe
so to repeat the question I someone in
the audience was asking whether we think
it's like the list syntax that makes it
useful to teach to beginners and if so
if we have an opinion on like racket
versus closure so for me personally the
big reason why I would rather teach
closure to beginners in this context
it's like in a university setting I
think it's really good to teach racket
because you're getting people started in
a language most the time you're teaching
like cs101 or something like that and
there's this like base assumption that
they're going to take that class and
then they're going to keep on going
through like a minor or like a major or
something so by the time that they
finish their degree they were in some
other language I think with racket those
are trying to teach people who aren't in
that kind of a setting where you're sort
of like trying to introduce them to
something it is like there's more
support for doing things in industry and
stuff with closure so if someone who's
new to programming laurens closure they
can at least like go to meet up where
people who work professionally as
programmers are and they have some like
base thing that they can use to like
associate with people's work and what
they do professionally if that makes
sense what's your sad okay any other
questions yes
programming
the world
or
so to repeat yeah so to repeat what the
person the audience was saying they
mentioned that would be useful also to
have as part of the workshop like
introduce people to the different like
positions and functions that people have
I guess an industry when you're teaching
them how to program because it gives
them some idea of like what careers and
stuff that they could percy later down
line which i agree with and think is
very useful thing to do any other
questions
okay then we are going to have an
unsession tonight where you can come and
we will sort of like organize people
into groups depending on what kind of
stuff they're interested in volunteering
on and where they live and you can come
to that if you're interested you're more
than welcome yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
