I'm going to do
Emacs is power Emacs is magic
Emacs is fun and Emacs is forever
okay let's get this party started oh
that is embarrassing since I
unintentionally left the slide blank ah
that's way better so welcome everybody
it is it is really exciting for me to be
here last time around
when I was in the United States I was
feeling like shit I did not know where I
was I couldn't say my name and you know
my name is kind of hard to pronounce but
still I definitely wasn't myself this
time around I arrived one week in
advance so we would see a real
presentation from me and this
presentation is a little bit more
special than usual for me because here
in attendance I have one of my closest
friends who is like family to me he
lives here in the States
and has never seen me life so Johnny
enjoying this is for you as some of you
probably know this is my name most of
you most of you cannot read it I know I
met maybe 10 people from Eastern Europe
here who can read it and pronounce it
so this is good but for the rest of you
I'm back now you know why cider is so
buggy and you also know that I am
dashingly handsome at weddings I hear
from Sofia Bulgarian and now you know
why I sound so awesome you know people
ask me where should I go and study
English to sound like you recipe yeah 30
years in Bulgaria we will do this to
everybody by the way don't do not don't
think for a second that Sophia looks
like this this is a heavily photoshopped
image now Sophia actually looks like
this it's a it's a pretty ugly place but
the fun place and if you ever want to do
something quiet come and visit me I'll
make it worth you
I work at top-down but you probably
don't care about this you maybe care
about my open-source work which I have
been told is quite extensive in the
realms of Ruby closure Emacs some people
tell me that they know me justice be
bought off and some people know me just
as the cider guy I refer to myself as
the head brew master at Sanders brewery
because I'm refined gentleman and I like
refined titles and without any further
ado let me introduce you to an exciting
adventure in the most advanced brewery
in the world so what is cider for me
this is the beverage that I rely upon to
escape from the horrors and pains of my
life but for you it might be the closure
interactive development environment the
trucks you know and of course this is
built on top of him axe there is a lot
of controversy surrounding building
something that rocks on top of something
like he mugs
some people say is it true that Emacs is
the one true editor that is going to
bring balance to the source I think I
have consulted an expert now people also
ask me you know that cider really rock
after oh it's some idea of course it's
of course it rocks I'm an honest person
if I say it rocks it rocks and Eddie
Vedder after his retirement he has been
getting more and more into closure
guess what he uses I know that here in
the audience we have a few curious VM
users you know and I know that deep down
they believe and not so deep down they
honestly believe that the only thing
that emerged is good for is inducing
error sigh but for them space marks
so you know iMix
created a better wind nvm and this
speaks volumes if you ask me
so enough chitchat let's get down to
business I'd like to begin with an
update from our sales department we've
got some really interesting metrics to
show that the past year was really
successful it was the most successful
year since the creation of the project
we started commanding 42% of the market
share and one year later we are
commanding 46% of the market share of
closure programming environments and
this happen despite continues the
coaster performance by Mahon various
conferences around the world but our
sales researchers are positive that if I
perform properly today the future the
future is going to be quite bright and
if I don't you know we're still going to
make some headway and why are we so
confident in the brew area because we've
got the best customer satisfaction in
the industry you know iPhone has 97
percent customer satisfaction
we've got 110 percent and don't ask me
how we came up with this number because
it isn't clear to me and I'm always
wondering if this is just an off by one
error and the actual satisfaction is
like still I have some real customer
testimonials let's hear what Mitch
Hickey has to say you know using cider
is exciting you never know if cider
jacking will work or not well Alex cure
slider changed my life I used to go to
horror movies to get an adrenaline rush
rush
sorry about my typos now is simply a
great cider using cider on a daily basis
improved my piano playing skills tenfold
6/8 K Emax keybindings requires some
serious hand and finger coordination
Bridgette a mixer fancy name Zack human
ciders learning curve is amazing I'm
still amazed it never ends and the final
and favorite by Anna you know have the
things in emacs and cider seem magic to
me every time I use them I feel like a
wizard it strong so now I'd like to tell
you a little bit about what we are
preparing for you in the near and Tatsuo
future
but the Englishmen are fond of saying
that you don't know where you're going
until you know where you've been
so let us quickly see where we were
through the years at the closure comes
two years ago we unveiled cider 0.8 it
was the first stable and usable cider
release at Euro closure the previous
year we unveiled cider 0.9 it featured
the single biggest breakthrough in emacs
technology the interactive closure
debugger after we posted to production
we thought we were dragon slayers we
were mighty and if you haven't seen the
debugger let me show it for you you know
the first time I saw this I literally
started crying it was so deep and
profound moment it if you're feeling
like crying go ahead
in the very same release we introduced
boot support and we plan to introduce
sneaker support and sleeper support in
success
- releases at close your ex just a few
months ago at London we unveiled cider
0.10 the biggest thing to happen to
cider
since cider 0.9 it featured a ton of
exciting things like inline evaluation
results now people were telling me that
this was impossible to do in emacs
but it seems it is possible we've added
the ability to Jack and straight into
closure script we've added dynamic font
locking which means that cider Mouse now
gets the font locking information
straight from the running process
instead of it being hard-coded in
closure mode so before you enable cider
the front locking of your code would
look like this and after this it would
look like this notice that all the
functions and macros and whatever were
font locked properly so you are never
going to make a mistake with the name of
something because you're going to see
it's not properly font locked this is
pretty powerful dynamic indentation my
my favorite recent addition to cider
people were complaining that it was hard
to define custom indentation schemes so
we made it possible to add an indent a a
bit of indentation metadata to every
form a macro a function whatever cider
will inspect and honor this generate
dynamically the indentation rows and
adjust your code properly so now you can
indent your code however you want you
don't have to be confined by this idea
does it like this this does it like this
and I really hope that other tools are
going to start honoring our indentation
specification which is super generic
there is absolutely nothing too much
specific in it because I believe that
this would be quite beneficial for the
entire community at large and because
people have colorful things we made a
colorful wrap our
you know you're not excited okay
most recently somewhere around closer
remote and closer D which is the German
closure conference we released cider
0.11 it was our other small release the
biggest change there was that we dropped
support for closure 1.5 and 1.6 because
we want to focus on achieving feature
parity between closure script and
closure closure script is 1.7 only so
this would simplify our lives a bit and
we drop support for Java 6 because
nobody deserves to be dealing with this
shit people wanted the ability to run
older loaded and tow the project tests
and we gave it to them and we also stole
a pretty cool feature from lights table
we call it enlightened mode so you have
this bit of code you enable this mode
you evaluate something and you're going
to say all the locals and all the
intermediate return values in line in
your source so I think that this is
quite handy and will make you reach out
less often for the debugger play with it
you'll be enlightened and probably the
most requested feature ever you know
people really hated that they have to
update the their boot profile or lining
and profile with every sign the release
they don't have to do it anymore
starting with 0.11 you can remove
everything you get cider related in your
setup and Jachin will work magically so
in the words of Bharat very very nice
great success
all of this however is in the past and I
bet that you are all using cider 0.11
because you love getting some adrenaline
rush right so let me share with you what
are we brewing right now in the brewery
surprise surprise we are brewing cider
0.12
it features it features a bunch of
interesting and uninteresting features
for instance we have improved handling
of internal middleware errors and by
this I mean the following in the
previous releases if there was some
unexpected middleware error you would
get a stack trace in your repo buffer
you would lose the focus of wherever you
are
it was quite annoying now people are
going to see a special customized stack
trace buffer and they're also going to
get the ability to suppress such errors
for the duration of the session so even
if we make some fuck up and sorry I
forgot I was in the United States even
if we make some mistake so you can
suppress this and continue with your
work without being interrupted by the
middleware errors so this is quite quite
handy I believe now let me zoom this for
you you know here you have a magic
button you can press to suppress the
error in question people were saying
that the debugger is not powerful enough
so we are we fighted conditional
breakpoints in the debugger which I
believe are pretty cool and we've added
the ability to step in into function XY
will be bugging there now you can
applause because this was way more
complex
it always bothered me that we weren't
displaying the same test results as
lining and us we were displaying just
the number of tests that were run and
lining in would split the information
into assertions and tests and now we do
this as well so nice I noticed that many
of you were using Zen burn and solarized
popular coward teams for Emacs and we
didn't really support them properly
but now we do so if you update your
favorite team cider is going to look WAY
prettier
we love programming in a test-driven
fashion and now we have cider Auto test
mode basically every time you reload a
namespace this is going to run your
tests and you are never going to
introduce breakages ever again or at
least you can believe so another nice
addition pretty tiny but still we
started showing the namespaces of the
stuff that that were resolved by our dog
so if you hear several symbols with the
same name it gets easier to figure out
what exactly our doc is referring to and
one huge usability improvement for
people using the mouse
I'm told that many people are you know
if you click on something insider you
are going to get this the documentation
of the symbol at point in a pop-up no
excitement oh okay we are deleting this
feature because nobody wants it
we've also noticed that there was a ton
of quarter in our cider menu and in the
interest of making it easier for people
to find their way around we broke down
the menu into three menus one is the
primary menu from which you can connect
disconnect whatever report box quite
quite handy we'd get I've got a
dedicated menu for all the evaluation
command set as you can see we've got
plenty of evaluation commands and we've
got a dedicated menu for all the other
commands and we've got even more of
those so that the menu is a very handy
way to quickly refresh your knowledge of
something or uncover new Sider
functionality
so check it out and in a similar vein we
wanted to make it easy to find out what
key bindings are available so we
introduced one extra package called
cider hydras I know what you're thinking
about this kind of hydras but no Hydra
is a way to create hierarchic navigation
menus for Emacs it basically looks
something like this
you press one key you get one menu you
press another key you get another nested
menu here's one example with cider if
you're in the documentation Hydra you're
going to see this so it makes it kind of
easy to remember what is available for
you I have noticed that very few people
know that God commands like cider
apropos and cider a proper documentation
even exists
and those are really powerful commands
so there are other interesting things in
this release but we do not have time for
them so check out the change lock it is
quite extensive but there is one more
thing about this release yeah
how original right we've got a real
manual and because this is so important
so Spyder used to have a 20 pages long
read me that nobody read because you
know who eats stuff like this now we
have reasonably beautiful nicely
organized web what manual hosted at read
the docs it is a work in progress that
there is a lot of work to be done and I
would like to use this opportunity to
ask every every one of you to go through
the manual submit ideas to improve it
reward my bet English you know we can
definitely create something really
beautiful together and you know
everybody is going to be happier in the
end of the day so cool stuff and now the
question that is on everybody's mind you
know when when are you going to be able
to play with this I have a news for your
cider 0.12 is available for pre-order
now and it is going to be a free upgrade
we expect to ship the final release in
spring 2016 huh
how vague is this right so it might
happen later today or it might happen on
the 20th of June who knows and now the
favorite part of the presentation for me
my wild speculations about the future of
cider the journey ahead yeah so when I
when I was starting the project together
with Tim with Phil our focus definitely
wasn't usability and we never thought
that ordinary humans would be using
cider we wanted to create something for
him acts from Emacs users for Emacs
users and this meant that the experience
for newcomers to Emacs was rather
horrible so this is going to be a big
focus for us going forward you have
noticed that the past few releases
always had something for newcomers for
instance winter we extended a lot the
Welcome banner we've added the cider
drink a sip command that gives you
helpful tips on Snyder's usage we
introduced the manual we are adding some
Mouse navigation here and there so we
really want to make cider welcoming for
everybody because we believe that now
even if you're not a true Emacs user
now you can be converted
so the other thing that we are going to
focus a lot is the user interface and
user experience in general we have been
both in chrome new features onto cider
without much consideration about their
consistency with the rest of the
existing feature the visuals the
intuitive 'ti if you wish and the end
result is familiar to of you it is kind
of confusing so in the next two releases
we are going to streamline the UI we are
going to unify it expect some dramatic
and not so dramatic changes but when we
are done this is going to be the
pinnacle of Emax innovation trust me
about this
so my optimistic ETA for this is around
three months but given the proximity of
the summer it is more realistic to pick
this at six months another thing
game-related
built-in refactoring right now one
barrier to entry for newcomers is that
if you want to get powerful refactoring
tools for you max you have to install a
separate package this is GOG refactor
and because this is a separate package
often cider and CLG a refactor are a
little bit out of sync because they are
developed independently going forward we
are going to start gradually moving some
of the refactoring functionality from
CLG refactor into cider itself this is
going to improve the installation
process significantly and obviously is
going to eliminate all the compatibility
issues I give this the optimistic ETA of
three to six months realistically six to
twelve another big old feature parity
between closure script and closure this
is a pretty hard not to cry
and I and the rest of the team are
certainly going to need all the help we
can get me and our toward the primary
contributors to cider half between zero
and none knowledge of closure script and
this is the reason why so many of the
features do not work with closure script
because we have absolutely no idea what
to do there and unfortunately we are
also quite busy and do not have the time
to obtain the idea so if somebody is
occlusive script ninja and is feeling
adventurous come join us in darkness or
in Maxim Ness however you want to call
it we are really really excited to
unboard some closure script programmers
to the core team and we are going to
teach you everything you need to know
about an repo and about Emacs Lisp so do
not be afraid
DTA if you wait on me and tartar is one
post years maybe three but if you step
forward we can expedite the process
significantly another big item on our
agenda is support for the new closure
one point one point eight socket repo if
we supported this the closure script
issues would be handled automatically
the problem is that rebasing the project
from main repo to the socket repo is
going to be a tremendous amount of work
and as I said we are short on time if
one of you is not so short on time fine
homework assignment so I really hope
that we are going to get down to this
and we are never going to drop support
for any point of foreseeable future so
if we add this it is going to be a
supplement to what we have right now it
is not going to be a replacement for an
repo and I believe that in the shorter
term we can make the biggest gains from
improving and repo itself
it seems to me that it was a mistake to
include the project under the closure
cantrip initiative because this has led
to stagnation in his development
especially now the chest is super busy
so I'm going to petition for the project
to be released from closure country so
we can steward it and extend it in a
more traditional more more approachable
manner detail on this is he'll call me
maybe because it's not up to me I'll
have to discuss it with cognate echt
with just I'm not sure that even even if
it is possible but small improvements to
the Unruh popcorn and bigger
improvements to piggyback are going to
solve pretty much all of our existing
issues so I believe that this is the
shortest path to greatness and yeah
screencasts people have been asking me
for an introduction to cider screencast
for three years now every time at every
conference I say that I'm about to
record one right now I estimate that I'm
going to record a few screencasts in the
next six months maybe six years who
knows but it is definitely on my agenda
you know it just life I have grand plans
for the project and the other a
maintainer very passionate Bunch great
people for me in particular it is
getting harder and harder I have a
pretty demanding job which has nothing
to do with closure and nothing to do
with programming I am involved in maybe
30 or 40 open-source projects and I feel
that open source is a second full-time
job for me which hasn't advanced the
quality of my life that much but it is
pretty preserving my sanity if you have
to do so many meetings as I have to do
you know you're going to do whatever it
takes to escape from this I like to
refer to the model of ciders development
as conference driven development
and most of the year I and the rest of
the team do pretty much nothing and
around conferences yeah we get a little
bit ashamed we want people to be talking
at the conference about the great new
features insider and the epic box that
we introduced so so we try our best and
you know we have been trying our best
for closure West as well I took this
screenshot a few days ago so I believe
that we reached some all-time
contribution peak sorry about this
foreclosure West and this this wouldn't
be possible without the amazing
contributors that we have 139 people
have contributed to cider as of today
and I believe that this is amazing
because we are talking about an emic
slist project
I'd like to single out a few individuals
in particular that they have been a huge
support pretty much since day one
remember the name or term Allah Barbara
because this is the person behind pretty
much everything exciting that we have
shipped in the previous one here he he
is the stuff of legends Michael is the
person to whom we owe any closure script
support at all Lars is the master of
refactoring and Jeff that did so much in
the early days of the Middle where
support so respect and recently in the
past couple of months we got some new
amazing contributors who worked really
hard on making cider 0.12 realities so
I'm very optimistic about the future
originally cider was more or less a
one-man show but but now I'm quite
certain that even if something is to
happen to me you know that the future of
the project is quite quite secure still
we are at a very very interesting point
in the development of the project the
closure community has matured a lot
people are making a living from writing
closure applications and they're making
their living using tools like cider that
weren't developed in the in the best
possible way you know we have cut every
corner possible do you know why there
are so many regressions
in the development bills it is pretty
simple we do not have any unit tests on
the amok site we are working on this but
you know I I know what I'm supposed to
do I do not have the time for it
everybody's so busy and nobody wants to
invest into link nobody wants to invest
in tooling for a saint's platform
like Eclipse and NetBeans IntelliJ
for instance : made everything in
cursive by himself companies simply
simply don't care and this is very
disappointing for me because if you
employ a team of 20 people and you give
them subpart tools you are reducing
their productivity so much if you pay a
couple of people to work on improving
the tools you want that the net results
for you are going to be so so positive
so if your company has money to burn and
some reasonable management you know you
can pink me enter tour we wouldn't mind
working concider for one year and making
it you know even more powerful than
cursive because this is possible
possible it is totally possible it is
just a matter of time time that we do
not have until then we are going to rely
on on your contributions on your efforts
and tune our spare time it was it was an
honor for me to be here this is
everything I here for you
sorry about this it seems that this is
not everything I have for you and this
is original so let's see what is this
one more one more thing
Seattle 0.12 codename Theatre will be
released today and I actually wrote this
slide before releasing cider Seattle so
you can go update it is out there in the
real world for you to enjoy
irresponsibly and now by some miracle I
have five minutes to take some questions
that this is really funny because when I
was rehearsing the presentation it took
me 45 minutes so I guess you intimidated
me and I skipped some of the fun parts I
don't know so so basically the idea is
to be to be able to work on the same
project for closer and closer script and
quickly quickly jump between the differ
the two connections that are powering
the development this is this is
basically the vision we haven't been
promoting that much this feature because
we haven't polished our support for CLG
C files that much but this works I
believe that once more people migrated
to closure 1.7 sibling buffers are going
to be way more important but that the
basic idea is one codebase a closer
connection and a closer script
connection and an easy way to jump
between them any other questions
so so the question was do any of the
contributors the core team I guess
insider are using space max no we are
all hardcore and we have custom can fix
other questions so the question was do
we have any small tasks that are
suitable for new contributors as a
matter of fact we have plenty such tasks
we take them with the low-hanging fruit
tack on github so everything with such a
tag is relatively easy to do doesn't
require in-depth knowledge of ciders
internals so just peruse the issue
tracker there are so many open tickets
there plenty plenty of opportunities to
contribute yeah so the question was
where can you find members of the core
team we in the new manual we have a
support section which details all the
places where we hang hang around so my
favorite place is slack the closure and
slack I'm always there my handle there
is Buju dar not be bought off so some
people don't know it's me but it's me
and we are always in gator as well and
some of us are on IRC we are also
monitoring Stack Overflow but just refer
to the support section of the manual the
manual is so insanely great it is going
to answer every questions that every
question that this talk didn't answer I
do not see other hands you know don't be
shy I travelled from Eastern Europe to
get here okay so I guess this is so
enjoy the new release once again it was
an honor for me to be here and enjoying
the rest of the conference
