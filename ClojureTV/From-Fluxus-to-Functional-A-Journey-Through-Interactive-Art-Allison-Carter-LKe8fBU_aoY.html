to be giving a talk in title of fluxes
to functional journey through
interactive art and so kind of today
what we're gonna look at if we're gonna
look at a few interactive art pieces
some done in list enclosure and sort of
look at how they relate to kind of the
art movement and where they came from
until we're doing a journey through
interactive art though I kind of think
this talk should be titled what do you
know is an overtone have in common and
hopefully this makes sense them a little
bit we'll see but I'm first off let's
kind of look at what is art um this
isn't a great question but it's kind of
something that we sort of have to look
at whenever we're talking about any sort
of new idea of what can be art or what
art used to be because really art is
always changing you know art didn't have
to originally make sense art used to
have for your religious art kind of a
change from you know how we looked at
things and at times art had to be
European and art now could be American
and art used to have to sort of show a
scene or a picture and then art could
show an emotion and art didn't even have
to be something that was created it
could be something that already existed
one of my favorite quotes about art is
from Marshall McLuhan who is a media
theorist and cultural theorist of the
60s comments basically art is anything
you can get away with and I've always
loved this folks I think it's entirely
true um so let's take a look at this is
this art
um this is something that wasn't a
museum was actually in the Museum of
British Columbia in Vancouver and it
looks like art it looks like something
that could be alright that someone
painted as does this I mean it's
definitely abstract it's definitely
abstract expressionism maybe it has an
intent behind it we think but what if
this wasn't painted by someone what if
this was painted by Aaron Aaron is
actually a piece of software and Aaron
a painter Aaron has been in continuous
development since the 70s
and is currently a list project that
creates paintings and abstract paintings
still life portraits based on sort of
commands and um things that the Creator
Harold Cohen puts in Aaron has had
several iterations currently Aaron is
this right here which is a physical
machine that actually paints paint onto
canvas and creates these works but Aaron
has also been a window screen saver in
the 90s because of course he was but um
this kind of brings up a question and
art itself is creative but is Aaron
creative air doesn't have a creative
process I would say Aaron is not
creative but Aaron is instead
interactive takes in commands and
creates these pieces of art and here is
a quote from Harold Cohen the creator of
Aaron basically says if what Aaron is
making is not art what is it exactly and
in what ways other than its origin does
it differ from the real thing if it is
not thinking what exactly is it doing
this brings up some really good points
about what art can be and it kind of
brings us to ask these questions again
not great but what is art I like to
think of art being as the merit of the
piece is intrinsically tied to the way
in which it was created and this kind of
brings us back to Marshall McLuhan he
said something in a book understanding
media the extensions of man itself
that the medium is the message he would
later write another book that was
entitled to the meeting with the message
and sort of go more in depth with these
ideas but and this is where a lot of
foundations of Media Studies and looking
at interactive art and today's media
kind of come from so Marshall McLuhan
talked about this idea of the light bulb
as a piece of or as an important piece
of art not because it's something that's
created but it's because it's something
that allows creation this is something
that he can determine a medium without
content there is no content to the light
bulb light bulb exists as a lie
Bob but as he put it what it does is it
creates an environment by its mere
presence and the light enables art to be
created it enables us to do many things
I mean when the lightbulb was created we
were able to work at night it allowed
all of these other things to happen and
so this a medium of the lightbulb is
extremely important to our society
another thing he talked about was the
printing press and the printing press
sort of allowed us to take knowledge
away from the keepers and holders of it
because if we think about it before the
printing press was created works of
literature and works of knowledge were
all sort of held by churches and schools
and sort of those that wanted to keep
this information away from everyone
but the printing press allowed this to
be printed everywhere and in some ways
this is more important than any
individual piece or any individual book
that was printed on the printing press
the same way a blank canvas is just as
important as a piece of art that is
going onto it and all of these different
mediums allow us to look at things in
different ways I mean we looked at music
in a certain way and then we had the
advent of electronic music and
synthesizers and all of these things so
as these new mediums come into play we
sort of see people using them in
different ways and creating art in
different ways so let's take a moment
and watch something this is a
performance piece by a group called
rebel electric and they are a closer
live performance group that uses
overtone and shader tone and tone and
shader toys and things like that to
create these sort of intermedia pieces
so watch this for a little bit and sort
of see how it evolves and how it changes
so kind of what we're watching here is
not one individual thing it's a bunch of
different things happening it's a video
Mart I mean there is a video component
we're watching we're watching the video
sort of be created and expand there's an
auditory component we're watching music
and we're listening to the music being
created but this is also something
that's being performed this particular
video is entitled stars and it was a
live performance in front of an audience
so this is being live coded and the act
of coding and it isn't itself of
performance here but in the same vein
this is also interactive art this is an
art that is being interacted with and
it's changing as the code is being
written
I mean I think this is pretty cool and I
I'm into it I'm into the music that's
happening I'm into the visuals and it's
something that's new and it's something
that we're kind of playing with we're
playing with this medium and we're
playing with closure as a medium but
this is part of a much larger art
movement and kind of a long tradition
and I think to sort of see why this is
something that's important and sort of
where it's coming from we kind of have
to take a step back and we kind of have
to look at things that were happening
before so yeah Marcel Duchamp was an
artist in the 20s and he had this great
quote that is art is not about itself
but the attention we bring to it and
this was sort of the foundation of this
art movement that was called Dada and
Dada was this art movement from the 20s
it was a bunch of people who were kind
of a little a little upset at where art
was going we had these museums we had
these pieces they were like well we make
stuff we don't make stuff like that but
our stuff is important and they sort of
it was this revolutionary movement and
they had this idea that you know they
could have these things called
ready-mades ready-mades were basically
what we saw earlier with the fountain
the urinal into this object in the world
that if you put intent behind it it now
becomes art and that piece of art is
basically in museums all over the world
but it's all recreative this art is not
so much the individual piece it's kind
of a set of instructions it's like if
you want to make the fountain what you
do is you get a urinal you take it apart
you sign your name or you sign marcel
duchamp's name since he came up with the
piece and you put it on a podium and now
you have a piece of art and all of these
pieces that you're making are still
important but it's this idea of
recreation and this idea of anything can
be art without intent one of my favorite
data pieces is Marcel Duchamp's door in
his apartment which he made into door 11
ruler II from 1927 and it's playing with
this day of a door can either be open or
closed and this door can never be opened
or closed it's always both that's kind
of the heart of data is this little bit
of fun
and kind of just you know sort of saying
yeah we'll do whatever we want um but
what was going on at the same time was
this idea of film and film was sort of
taking off and it was the 1920s we kind
of had Hollywood we had silent film we
had all these people looking at stories
and images and things like that and the
data folks decided that they weren't
going to use a film camera in a
traditional way they weren't going to
use it to capture a story they were
going to do something a little bit
different so this is an avant-garde
piece called the return to reason I'm
gonna watch a little bit of it we don't
want to love it
so what we just watched was a little out
there and it's avant-garde cinema but
what they're doing is they're trying
something new and they're using a camera
in a different way they're throwing
nails in front of it they're just
looking at how light moves and they're
kind of using this new medium and sort
of playing with it as a toy but it's
also looking at this is something that's
recreated I mean the film we just
watched is as important as a film we
could watch anywhere else we can watch
the same one everywhere and it's all
returned to reason it's all this idea
and Walter Ben Amin was a author
philosopher cultural critic one of the
founders of sort of media studies
aesthetic Theory things like that he
wrote a book called the work of art in
the age of mechanical reproduction
basically he said in this quote even the
most perfect reproduction of a work of
art is lacking one element the existence
in place where it happens to be so where
the piece of art was created is what
makes it important where this video was
created and how it was created and who
created it and the intent behind it is
what's important so we can have this
recreation all through this and so that
was sort of Dada
and that kind of brings us to the next
idea which is this movement called
fluxes and fluxes was this movement in
the 60s and 70s and this art movement
that was another revolutionary art
movement that was sort of challenging
what it means to be art and what it
means to make art it was sort of a
response to a predominantly rich in
white and male-dominated industry of the
art world and saying that the creation
of art was more important than the final
piece I mean they were really serious
they even had a manifesto so obviously
they knew what they were doing but let's
take a look this is a recreation of a
fluxes piece which we can only watch a
brief moment of but no sorry slide ahead
but anyway before we get to that let's
disco over Fluxus has mainly four
tenants when you're looking at it I like
to look at it as flex this is an
attitude fluxes is less about what
you're doing and more about the attitude
you have approaching it fluxes is also
inter media and I'm sure most of you
heard the term multimedia intermedia is
similar
I would say sort of the difference is
multimedia can be a bunch of different
things together could have music and a
movie and a presentation like this is a
multimedia presentation but if I didn't
show videos it would still be a
presentation sort of what we looked at
with repla electric earlier I would say
as an intermediate piece because if you
take one of those pieces out you no
longer have what's important about it
you don't have the mix of video audio
and performance um without one of those
individual pieces it ceases to be as
important and that's sort of where
intermedia comes from also say Fluxus is
simple it sort of looks at a simple idea
and you know sort of it expands upon it
and most importantly it has fun looking
at sort of this kind of art movement
it's easy to look at a lot of these
things and say like oh that's silly
that's pretentious I don't really get it
but really I mean I like this look it it
was a lot of people having fun which is
basically what we're all doing now
anyway this is a piece that's called
painting to hammer and nail basically
what you do is it's a canvas and you
have hammers and nails and you nail a
nail into the canvas and that's it it's
interactive this is by an artist I'm
sure most of you actually know who is
Yoko Ono who you probably don't know as
so much as an artist but more as John
Lennon's wife but she was really
important in contemporary art but fluxes
also sort of looked at using things in
different ways much like hammering a
piano shot instead of playing it and
this is mainly just something simple
something fun something new and doing
something a little weird
but flex this is weird it's out there
and yeah that's that's what's going on
this is an art movement that happened
and I think it's something that is still
happening today and that we're looking
at and we're sort of playing with the
idea of media here and looking at things
in different ways um this is an
interactive piece by Nam June Paik who
is one of my favorite artists this is
called participation TV and I think
pieces like this are sort of the start
we're seeing people interacting with
media and we're seeing these
intermediate aspects sort of come into a
different way
this was an installation in a gallery
that allowed people to basically use
sound and video to kind of create
whatever they wanted to make and give
that interactive element but at the same
time all of this was happening there was
also sort of the advent of electronic
music and we kind of had Bob Moog making
the Moog synthesizers and things like
that and we had a Wendy Carlos I kind of
like to think of Bob Moog Bob Moog is
the engineer and Wendy Carlos is the
artist who sort of used all of these
tools and instruments in different ways
and she created switched-on Bach which
was a very famous album which kind of
was the advent of electronic music and
sort of this happening and looking at
electronic music and video allowed
artists to create other things like this
is a video piece using electronic music
videos magnets analog video processing
and things to kind of manipulate the
images in different ways and create
something that is intermedia and
something that's cool and we can kind of
see a lot of the same analogies to kind
of stuff that's happening now and stuff
that we're doing today and this is by
Nam June Paik it's in 1984 it's called
Paul Starr video
and he did a lot of work like this just
kind of playing with magnets on TVs and
rustling moves differently and
interacting with the art he was creating
but this kind of brings us back to the
idea that Walter Ben Amin also brought
up in his book art in the age of
mechanical reproduction basically at
that time it was sort of the advent of
film in the advent of photography and it
was kind of a response to painting and
it was basically saying painting by its
nature cannot provide an object of
simultaneous collector reception as film
is able to do today and compare that to
the idea that a public that would love
slapstick comedy and things like that
would look at surrealism in kind of not
the same way and look at it as a little
bit out there
and have sort of a backwards attitude
towards it what movements like Dada and
fluxes challenged was the idea of art
being owned by the elite much the same
way that film was doing in that time and
that art could be made by anyone and art
could be enjoyed by anyone and really is
this a bunch of people playing with toys
and making cool stuff and really art is
for everyone art can be enjoyed by
everyone and art can be loved by
everyone here's a piece that was in 2011
it's kind of taking a lot of the same
ideas of fluxes and looking at it in a
modern context
we have an interactive piece we have
intermedia we have sound we have this in
a gallery and it's painting it's
painting with interaction is pending
with found anyone can go up there and
say things until right now is taking
sort of the ideas
and painting what it hears but in art
art isn't going anywhere and it's not
new it's just using the tools of Spade
to create things in the same band that
people were doing decades ago or even at
the beginning of the century
which kind of brings us back to what we
watched earlier with repla lie trick in
the same kind of way that dotto is
playing with cameras and Fluxus was
looking at intermedia in different ways
and Nam June Paik was playing with
magnets and video processing we have
people now playing with code we need
people playing with closure and we have
great libraries out there that allow us
all to do these things as I said earlier
Fluxus was a movement and I've sort of
had this idea that Fluxus may not have
happened yet and it can still happen at
any time and you know there's any time
can be the Fluxus movement and I'm just
really into the fact that there is a
library out they are called fluxes that
is used for making live coding 3d art
performances and installations and
things like that which you can go out
and start working on right now whenever
you want all of these things are
revolutionary art and there were things
that challenged the art world and really
I would say that computer art and
interactive art is a revolutionary art
because right now we're doing the same
thing we're saying we can make art the
way we want to make it and we can make
art with the tools we like and the tools
we use and we can use these tools in
different ways I always like to look at
data and say look at Twitter right now
Twitter is the new data I mean if you
look at people ship posting that's
exactly what's going on but we're we're
actually in the nature anyone can make
art we have the tools you can go out
there and you can be a video artist you
can be a musician you can do all of
these things and the art world isn't
owned by a certain group of people it's
owned by everyone so you can go use
overtone you can use quill you can use
shitter tone you can use whatever you
like and you can start making new things
so really this and this aren't that
different after all
but um yeah it looks like I have a bit
of time and I may have gone through
sides a little quickly but um that was
flex it deflected the Fluxus
difunctional
my name is Alison Carter I'm on the
Internet and if anyone has any questions
I can take some otherwise I can hang out
and y'all can come talk to me about art
in overtone and whatever you'd like but
uh thanks
yeah totally yeah definitely um I guess
like I like to look at repetition or one
of my favorite ways to look at it is I'm
not sure if a lot of people are familiar
with like minimalist music like Steve
Reich or Philip Glass or things like
that or even a lot of droning electronic
music if you listen to it you keep
hearing the same thing over and over
again and while you're hearing it you
hear it change and you hear different
things happening with it and that
repetition is itself creating something
new even though it is the same thing
over and over again and it is really
cool and I am I am definitely into that
yeah
oh that was Nam June Paik he was a
Fluxus artist from Seoul Korea who moved
to New York and he was active for many
decades awesome yep
yeah um I don't know
that's a I'm not sure that is that is a
good way that's a good sort of thing to
think about I don't know if I have
anything particularly to say on that but
um yeah totally I mean shouldn't we all
just be paid to make art I I don't know
like yeah sure um I would say just
listen to as much as possible and find
stuff that you like and kind of just
embrace the fact that nothing is new and
that anything you want to do has
probably already been done so just go
with it and make whatever you want that
all right great thanks I'm gonna hang
out here and I'll fire a be outside if
anyone wants to talk to me come up and
thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
