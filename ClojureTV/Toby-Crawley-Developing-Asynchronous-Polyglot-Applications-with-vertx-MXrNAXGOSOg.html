think of this venue it's a nice place I
think it's great they built this whole
thing as a memorial to one person I bet
George Washington was blown away the
first time he saw um the tide you guys
about vertex today we're going to start
with what vertex is it's a lightweight
high-performance application platform
for the JVM and I can also say human
something that walks on two legs and
poops so just like the dock strings that
you mentioned they are accurate but not
very useful for understanding the
essence and the true nature of the thing
they're describing so I want to take a
different approach to talking about
vertex and I want to we're going to go
look through some code that uses it and
see how it actually does what it does
and we're also going to talk about some
of the motivations the problems it
solves so let's start with problems
though these are the problems that
vertex aims to solve one is that the JVM
networking packages are byzantine and if
you don't if you don't think they're
Byzantine you can at least maybe agree
that they're inconsistent so it works on
solving that problem when you're
building a networking application you go
down the road if you want to be
efficient you get on the road doing
things get currently and if you're using
languages of mutable state then you run
into concurrency issues everything can
be asynchronous so often when you're
building a fishing network application
you go even further you not just
concurrently you're doing things
asynchronously and but there are times
when you have to be able to think
synchronously and then tying together d
couple components can be painful
especially how to do it yourself and
especially if your components are
distributed across multiple jvms so how
does the vertex attack these things the
first problem is it uses it uses Neddie
Neddie itself is a wonderful abstraction
over the networking packages that the
jbean provides and Nettie is very
powerful but has a lot of thought and
knowledge you can turn so vertex
abstract some of that away and
simplifies some of
I complexity for you vertex also
guarantees that everything it does is
threat confined so if you're using a
language which is we're mutable state we
have mutable state it's it's less error
prone to develop applications that way
vertex is primary asynchronous framework
but it has synchronous facilities so
that when at times when you have to do
things synchronously you can and then
for tying components together it
provides a built-in distributed event
bus that can actually span multiple jvms
to tell these things together for you
it's also polyglot so it sports a lot of
different languages the core
distribution of vertex basically
supports Java and ships a bunch of Java
API s and then for each of these
languages listed there's a module that
then wraps that API and something that's
hopefully idiomatic for that language
community and the ones marked with a
star just means they're not yet to a
stable 10 status and so they're not
referenced as part of that core
distribution there's a configuration
file in there that says okay you're
deploying Ruby I know what Ruby is and
we could grab the module for that
install it and run it enclosures that on
there that's why that's what brought me
here today so I want to touch I think a
lot of us are familiar the advantages of
a sink but I want to talk to touch on
that just briefly while we often end up
in this a sink place to try and trying
to be able to perform a network app and
the real reason is is instead of waiting
for resources to become available you
basically you get in a situation where
you don't want your threads standing
around right and waiting for a
particular resource so instead of
instead of waiting on that resource to
become available they go off and do
other work they register interest in
some way and that resource go off and do
other work get notified or able to
resume work on that resource when it
comes available the the model that
vertex uses internally for asynchronous
basinger stuff is reactor loop which is
if you're if you're familiar with node
node uses a reactor loop as well one big
difference is that instead of one
reactor looper
yes you get one reactor looper core and
then when you d deploy an application to
vertex an instance of that application
is referred to as a vertical in in
vertex parlance and that vertical gets
tied to one of those event loops for the
lifetime of the application so that's
that's that's one way you get thread
confinement so that vertical is only
going to be ever accessed by one thread
at a time let's talk for a minute about
the event bus so really i'm setting the
stage here so we can actually get into
that example i happened and understand
what it's doing a little bit better when
we see it so the event bus it lets you
pass simple strengths of primitives
bytes byte arrays and you can also pass
structured data around in vertex uses
json is the underlying make a format for
that because it's common among all the
languages of supports they all have
support for it and so a lot of the
language modules do for you is they kind
of hide that JSON from you so if you're
using the closure language module you
publish closure data to it it's
converted to JSON underneath if you read
data off the eventbus it comes back to
you as close your data but you still
have to be aware that's happening
because JSON is obviously a lower
fidelity format them with enclosure it
supports publish-subscribe semantics so
you can publish a message and then every
person that's listening to it or ever
you everything that's listening to get a
copy of it it sports point-to-point so
you can publish a message and only one
of those receivers will get it and then
it supports request response so you can
send a message one receiver will get it
can reply to your message you can reply
to the reply ad infinitum basically have
a private conversation between two
components and it's cluster also it uses
hazel cast for discovery so these so the
multiple je viens can discover each
other and then it makes a direct
connection between the mon builds a
topology and that hazel cast pieces
cluster as sorry it's pluggable so if
you want to use some other technology
you can and and one of the neatest
features I think is that you can also
Bridge that event bus down to a browser
client when you do that the browser
client just becomes another component in
your application and so it's almost
appear to any other node the messages
are transient so that means there's no
durability so if if you're in a cluster
in a network the network goes down or a
note goes down you potentially lose
messages and so if durability is
important to you then you may not want
to use that event bus for those types of
messages but really the the event bus is
designed to be a simple RPC mechanism
and I think that's why it's transient so
let's let's talk about our sample app
it's a stream processing app
unfortunately not gonna be processing a
stream of cheese that would be pretty
awesome but we're going to we're going
to process a stream of words so we're
going to have we're gonna have a stream
of words we can have a browser-based you
I where you can register regular
expression filters against that stream
and basically split it into substrings
so I'm going to switch to some code so
that the application itself it's
polyglot so we've got four languages in
there we've got closure closure script
JavaScript and Ruby we're going and and
this is this is basically a lonegan
project i'm using to manage this but i'm
using a plug-in called lined vertex
which kind of bridges the the closure
world to the lining up into the vertex
world for us so that where i'm going to
actually run this thing all right so
what that's going to do is it's going to
start the vertex container then it's
going to deploy our application to it so
before I load this I want to say that I
work really really hard on the UI for
this and so prepare to be blown away
there we go so if you're looking if a
vice if anybody's looking for you i
engineered to see me after all right so
so it's pretty basic we can toggle the
wrong stream with CR string of data we
can add a say anything that contains the
letter A we can add that filter let's
see anything
it starts with a capital letter dinner
doesn't work okay so we can add filters
we can delete filters delete these sub
streams and then we've got a count of
how many how many times that that stream
is matched excuse me the filter and it's
pretty basic right but but it gives us
the opportunity to talk about some some
interesting features so let's see you
want to go here and so as here's a
diagram kind of showing where we're
going to look at we've got all these
different components and they're all
going to communicate with each other
over the eventbus so they're all
decoupled we're going to star wars are
going to take a look at this data source
piece first and that is written in Ruby
because this is a polyglot application
so my source of words is basically the
words dictionary off a local machine
obviously in a real application it might
be slightly more interesting like cheese
the the first vertex feature we are
using here why can't I tight there we go
is a timer so vertex supports timers you
can do one shot timers periodic timers
and what we're doing here is we're
creating a periodic timer so every 100
milliseconds it's going to take the
block we're passing to it convert that
to a runnable and just throw it onto the
reactor loop and so it'll bubble up and
get executed in the body of this thing
we're actually publishing to the event
bus so the event bus it's fairly simple
and it's also a little ceremony so if
you're used to using it if you've used a
JMS system before and in order to
interact to the publisher receive you
have to have a destination object and
that is you have to actually ask the
message broker to create you a
destination which you can in some
systems be a heavyweight operation
relatively with vertex instead of
destinations you have addresses and an
address is just a string just something
that names it and so in this case our
address is coming from some
configuration and we'll see how that
gets here in a bit but so when you when
you try to publish to an address that
does not exist now it does if you try to
receive from one that doesn't exist it
comes into existence so we're just
publishing every ten times a second
we're publishing
a random word from our data set so so
that's how we get our data source now
let's go look at the filter and how
let's see how the filter interacts with
that data source and the rest of the
system so finally some closure code so
here we're using uh the eventbus
namespace which comes from the closure
language module kind of wraps the Java
Java pneus of the eventbus the
interesting pieces start here we're
actually we're calling this on message
function which Beck lets us register a
function to be called anytime a message
comes in it's a call back so registering
on this command address so since since
things are decoupled the filter has no
idea where its commands come from it
just knows that come in on the command
address and I not do things with them so
the commands that are coming in here are
add filter and delete filter which is
what correspond directly to the add
filter and delete buttons in the UI and
so add filter we itself just registered
another message handler against the
stream address which is the address that
the the Ruby data source is publishing
to and all it does is just call this
match filter function which applies that
regular expression and then publishes to
yet another address the result address
which the browser were listening to to
display the sub streams when a match
occurs so that's the filter piece this
guy let's jump all the way over and see
what that that client looks like i'll
make it a lot of noise aren't see if
that is better client so this is closure
script so I mention that you could you
can bridge the event bus down to browser
clients and basically make them just
another component on the event bus to
support that vertex ships a JavaScript
client that who's at the API of that you
know very similar to the JavaScript
server-side API you use for interacting
with the event bus so the closure
language module ships a close your
script wrapper around that thinks you
have that same parity between
client-server that's what we're using
here
night so that's that's that's what we're
bringing in there the rest of that we're
also using a look using doing a lot of
in focus down transformations in here
we're not going to look at those what we
really care about is the these guys so
so again this looks very similar to what
we saw before we're registering call
backs against the dresses so the result
address is the address that the filter
namespace is publishing to STATS
addresses where our counts come from and
we'll see where those are generated
momentarily on the other interesting
piece here is send command yeah but this
isn't it so this is what actually sends
those commands to the command address
the add and delete filter and again the
client has no idea who's consuming these
messages who generating the messages
it's displaying it just knows about the
eventbus so we've seen let's see the
data source the filter the client let's
look at this web piece that kind of ties
the two together we're going to step
away from closure and go to JavaScript
first thing we do here is we actually
create have to create an HTTP server so
even though we're running inside a
vertex container that container provides
minimal services the primary service you
get there is deployment of things and
the event bus so we have to actually
create our own server as if we are
embedded in a way so we create that
server provided a function that's going
to get passed every request that comes
in and that this pretty straightforward
is just serving up static assets off the
disk our HTML or CSS or JavaScript the
neat piece here is starts here we're
taking that HTTP server and we're
wrapping it inside a sock jas server
sock jas is a protocol for doing
bi-directional browser communication
that will attempt WebSockets and then
fall back to other other technologies
until it finds something that works for
the browser network combo that the
client presents and this is what we're
actually using to bridge that the event
bus so that doesn't happen by default
you have to explicitly say I want to
share my event bus with my clients and
that happens through this bridge call so
the first thing we pass it
some configuration which here includes
basically the context path where it can
be found and then we've got the RET the
other two pieces of security so that
first array we're passing in there is
controls what the client can send to the
server so we're basically saying the
client can only send messages on the
command address and then the the second
array is what what addresses the client
can register handlers on to listen to
receive data on and you can get more
complicated than this you can actually
filter on the shape of the message the
passes through pass through these thing
but I'm mentioning this because i think
the security he's here is critical if
you're going to use this thing in
production you wanna be very careful
that you've got this configured properly
because otherwise if you have a bunch of
addresses you're using internally inside
your application it's possible to expose
those two clients which may not be the
best thing and then we listen on a port
so now we have the web piece so we've
seen data source the filter the client
the web piece that ties them together
let's take a look at where our count
comes from so that's over here in a
namespace called stats so here we're
using a little more functionality vertex
we're actually bringing in vertex core
and we're going to use that here to
deploy a module so we're storing our our
stats in Redis we need a way to talk to
read us so we're going to bring in of
the reddest module for vertex and what's
going to happen is we're going to call
deployed module with this vertex
specific module specifier it's going to
say well I don't have reticence thought
I'm going to go grab it from or mod
Redis I'm going to go grab it from maven
unpack it and install it and then when
it deploys that that module is actually
going to create a vertical and deploy
that vertical that vertical is then
going to listen on a node event bus
address and so I mentioned before that
the languages were implemented as
modules but modules don't have to be
language implementations they give you
anything any kind of functionality that
you want to use in vertex the fact the
recommended way to go to production is
to take your verticals wrap them up in a
module and deploy the module
yeah so so we've got that so we've got
the the reddest module listening on a
known address now we have to interact
with it and this is where things get a
little ugly this is what we
affectionately refer to as callback hail
right and it's the common complaint
about callback based one common
complaint about callback based
asynchronous programming and I'm not
going to go through this because I don't
want to but the the real the real
problem with callback hell Robbie end up
with a bunch of mystic callbacks and you
get a situation where it's difficult to
discern the intent of the code difficult
to to follow the flow of control but for
simple cases like this we can deal what
we would normally do is good closure
developers and take and break this up
into two small well named functions and
then it comes you know slightly easier
to reason about oops good about there so
this code does the exact same thing is
the office gated code above to play
module then we can talk about a little
more easily so we've got a register a
handler against the result address
that's the same address that the filter
namespace is publishing to and then
we're passing each one of those this
update match count function update match
count is what actually interacts with
rattus for us so it sends this this
increment command to read us which is a
atomic getting increment if you're not
familiar with lettuce and since we're
doing this asynchronously we want to
know the result but since we're
asynchronous we have to register a reply
handler which will get called when for
the win redis response so that's this
handle reddest response clever name
can't there we go so we check the status
of that message and then if it's if it's
successful we're going to publish to the
stats address which is what our browser
listens on to get those counts otherwise
we throw an exception so I think I think
you know breaking up like this makes it
easier to talk about it works for simple
cases like this but there's this new
thing or if you guys have heard of it
and the closure
nika racing right we at which takes a
totally different approach to to
asynchronous programming it's a
different asynchronous model and so I
thought wouldn't be great if we could
combine these two some house combine
some of those concepts with vertex so
that let me to write this thing so here
we're bringing in a different we're
bringing in this event bus
implementation that is not called back
based it operates on channels instead
this code does the same thing as we've
seen twice now we deploy the module but
then instead of registering a call back
against the result address we actually
just request a message channel that
message channel would just get a message
every time something appears there on
that on that address let me drop into a
go loop here which is basically just a
loop inside of a go block or a go inside
of a loop no other way and and and so
and then we just grab we just take
messages from those results and pass
them along through a thread that looks
very familiar that's easier to
understand and if and if we sudden so if
this became a more complicated operation
instead of morton st callbacks we would
just end up with more things in our
thread an update match count is also
operating with channels it's doing a
sinned with a reply Chan to to interact
with Redis that's pretty cool there's
bad news though none of this exists so I
said let me say it this way I I have
enough implemented to make this work but
I'm not convinced yet it's a great idea
to try to marry these two models so I
have not I don't know how performing it
will be and what what what the broader
implications are so haven't taken this
idea and spread it across a full event
bus or a full vertex API implementation
but it's something I'm you know thinking
about we'll see if it if we actually get
you remember that so that's so what we
just saw was basically the counter piece
and the reddest piece we saw both of
those there there's two more pieces two
more things I want to show you
before we leave the code yeah so that's
ones initialization so when I deploy
this application to vertex has to be
initialized somehow and and there's
verte there's configuration the project
clj which tells the vertex plugin to
tell vertex to run this function it just
going to initialize our filter namespace
space and this will initialize the stats
namespace and then this is where we
deploy our Ruby and JavaScript code so
we're actually calling this making this
deploy vertical call which will load
that Ruby code and then pass it along to
the Ruby interpreter and then we've got
a ruby vertical we're passing along the
config there that config is basically
just this it's a map that just gives us
well-known Keys mapping them to address
names and then and then we're doing the
same for the web the vertical so you
know I said that when you deploy a
vertical it gets tied to one reactor
loop for the lifetime of the application
so what if you have eight cores you have
eight reactor loops if you deploy one
vertical you're taking advantage of how
many cores one right so you're ignoring
seven cores so you can actually we have
that instances keyword argument there at
the end where you can actually say a lot
about multiple instances of this thing
and they will they will be put on
different reactor loops so it gives you
a little more efficiency there and then
we start a rap oh it's an inner upper
endpoint and so you can attach to that
and do interactive development the way
you've grown accustomed to so we're not
gonna look at the rebel now because
we've kind of all seen that before so
that that's the code let's go back here
and we'll beat this horse a little more
we've got so this is the diagram again
but it's kind of fleshed out with you
know what some of the languages we're
seeing here and a little more of the
technology I think the takeaways from
this are there's a couple of things one
is that that we've got these pieces
written different languages but we don't
care what language they're written in
we're all running in the same jvm here
now and we're all of it they're all
talking over the eventbus they don't
care that one piece is closure one piece
is Ruby fact we have no idea where the
Redis plugins written in
suspect Java but I haven't looked at it
another another piece here is that we're
running a one JVM now we could take the
same application and build a vertex
cluster deploy it across the cluster and
it would work exactly the same with zero
changes to the application code I think
that's kind of kind of cool and then and
then we've got our bridge so we were
actually bringing in those browser
clients as peers in that cluster I think
that's a really powerful idea that
everything is just a component so we
talked we we've looked at some of these
features we've seen an HTTP server we
saw we've talked the event bus to death
we've seen timers and there's but
there's a few other things that supports
like TCP UDP WebSocket async servers
clients for all those things as well as
an asynchronous DNS client and then has
a secret is file system support so you
can do asynchronous reads writes creates
and we've been using vertex here in as a
container but you can actually embed
that inside another another JVM process
and so there's a blog post on the mutant
website where we take an embedded vertex
and use it to bridge the JMS based
messaging system in a mutant across the
event bus down to the browser so if
you're interested in embedding that
might be worth looking at so so let's
talk about trade-offs some of the good
things I got touched on all these high
static complexity etc but what do we
lose to get those what we're hiding in
any complexity and that was that was
enough you know the first point in my
last slide but but I think there's
there's value in having some of the
complexity but there are times where you
need to get down to those knobs you need
to be able to write your own channel
handlers to do things and with vertex
you currently all that all the neti is
hidden from you currently there there
can be some some language ecosystem
friction so so if you say you're using
Ruby and you want to use Ruby gems
since vertex kind of has its own idea
about how dependencies are handled
because it has to support all these
languages it doesn't pick the dependency
mechanism for any one of them so there
can be some friction to tie the the
languages normal dependency mechanism to
vertex and for a closure the lines
vertex plug-in helps with that it
basically will take when you start up a
vertex it will take the dependency list
in your project clj and convert that to
a format that vertex expects we've
talked about callback hell and ways
around that and one thing I meant to
mention on that slide when I was talking
about that is that another way to deal
with this just using something like RX
java i think that's what a lot of people
in vertex community especially people
doing java we use our ace java for this
type of thing and I think our X job is
neat but I'm more excited at least for
closure about the possibilities use
possibilities of using core async there
but i think that needs more thought more
more experimentation to see if that's
actually going to work and then a common
complaint with reactor based systems
that don't block the reactor loop bad
things happen when you brought block
reactor loops but and unfortunately I
think that idea is a leaky abstraction
that's something that we should have to
worry about what we do and so some of
you certainly have to be aware of when
using vertex and there are times to when
when you actually you can't do thing
asynchronously so say you're talking to
a database that has no asynchronous
support it's only synchronous so vertex
has it has a solution for that as well
they're called worker verticals so you
can take a vertical and instead of that
and you can say hey I'm deploying not a
regular vertical but a worker and when
that gets deployed instead of being
attached to an event or a reactor loop
it gets tied to a thread pool so it can
it can then block and it communicates
through the arrest of your system like
everything else just over the event bus
but vertex still guarantees that that
vertical is all going to be called by
one thread at a time so you still have
that thread confinement and thread
safety if that's if you're using a
language where that's concern
and you can if you're if you're certain
that that that that verticals threadsafe
you can actually mark it as such and
then it will get a little more
efficiency and use mobile threads at the
same time against it so we'll talk about
some other projects in the vertex
ecosystem that may be of interest one is
the the ring vertex adapter and to quote
rich it's what it sounds like lets you
bring it kind of helps ease that
ecosystem friction a little bit you can
bring ring apps over and run them on top
of vertex I haven't actually used it but
my understanding is that it works mostly
Nodin is a it's basically if no Jas
compatibility layer so the vertex API is
quite different than nodes but this is a
project that aims to let you bring no
j/s app and run it directly on top of
vertex and I don't know what its status
is currently but it's promising I think
and then yoke so since since this is all
since this is kind of a new platform on
different than most others yoke is yo
games to be a kind of a web application
framework for that supports multiple
languages now there's no closure
bindings yet free out but there's java
groovy and some other language I don't
care about but but yeah I think that's
interesting it wouldn't be difficult to
write close your bindings for that and
so some resources you know vertex
website the closure language module so
since the closure language module is not
yet 10 and vortex core doesn't reference
it you have to if you install vertex you
have to modify a configuration file to
tell it about closure it's pretty easy
and then the line vertex plugins there
and the code for this talk will be there
eventually probably today I don't want I
want to close on this thought this is a
stated goal of the vertex project and
it's kind of go throwing a bone test in
the closure community
because this is a big deal for us too
but I think vertex does a good job of
this it's simple while still being
powerful and I think you know that's a
it's a thin line to walk try to try to
do that I think they do a pretty good
job and I think that it's going to get
better going forward I think they'll
continue to do this because it's a
fairly young project now and that is all
I have so if you have any questions I
have some time thank
any questions yeah
high availability yeah so he's asking
about failure modes on the event bus and
high availability so right so it's so I
net the event bus has you you can there
are now facilities in the latest version
where you can actually set timeouts like
you can say well I've sent a message
because you see cuz since its it says
you have no idea whether there's
something on the other one actually
listening to your messages right so you
can now say that you can set a time out
and say lock I care if this message is
never received so you can set a time at
least handle that case for more critical
messages and you mentioned high
availability so that so if you're
running in a cluster you can't actually
do it actually supports high
availability we can deploy a vertical to
multiple vertex instances but it'll and
you can mark it as as a singleton
basically so will come upon one and then
if that no dyes that automatically
appear on another another node yes sir
if the two nodes cannot talk to each
other oh you mean they can't they they
like they lose the connection to each
other or they can never talk to each
other in the case of so yeah if they
were part of a high-availability setup
it's pretty simple so what would happen
is if they lost connection then they
would both be running the same thing it
was start up on the the other guy I
think I haven't played with a high bill
it back iha stuff yet it's fairly new so
I'm not sure exactly anything else I'm
missing anyone okay great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
