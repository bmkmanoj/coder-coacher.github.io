and I'm gonna be talking to you today
about composing music with closure spec
so I hope the energy levels are going to
rise there's the last talk of a day so
let just get started so what's on the
agenda so we're going to have some fun
with closure spec I hope you're ready
for the second back-to-back spec talk
the only difference is I'm doing it the
wrong way they're going to generate some
tears and finally I'm gonna reflect on
generative music alright so what's not
on the agenda how to use closures back
in production I know some of you are
already doing this even though it's
alpha I'm probably not going to show you
too many best practices that there's
going to be code examples but I think
this is more of a musical talk and
there's already great resources outs
were in great talks so Who am I this is
a computer's rendition of me I think is
a pretty poor rendition but I do like
the chalice effect on the neck I figured
I think that's an interesting a little
bit so I've been composing and
performing electronic music since about
2007 under the moniker ni I've also done
some procedural 3d stuff it used to be
called the demo scene but now not a lot
of people recognize that term anymore
but I also and the software tests are
tested by trade so I get paid to break
stuff and one of the ways in which we
break stuff is Jarrod of testing and
finding ways in which we can use the
software in perhaps a different way than
it was originally intended used to see
word I just saw where the boundaries are
so in general I'm more interested in the
chaos side of software development and
I'm also serve on a Vision Quest of
sorts when it regards to generative art
okay so you might be wondering you know
how a dispersive spec applied to
generating music so let me state a
hypothesis if the primary paradigm of
computing music is their music is data
then we should be able to use whatever
tools are out at our disposal to
describe data generate data and
manipulate data to produce music we're
going to see if this actually turns out
to be true so I will be using of course
closure spec I'm also going to be using
crystals library lights ish that's going
deep I'm using the German pronunciation
here and you're probably gonna be
familiar with with this if you've seen
any of crisp folds talk talks and I know
there's a lot of Chris food fanboys here
so I'm sure one of them if finally I'm
going to be using overtone for the
actual audio and playback now I did
manage to only get overtone to work with
the Alpha eight of closure one I know
but I think this should be quite enough
to demonstrate what spec is what's
happening in spec right now so this
should be pretty standards for closure
music nothing too crazy and as you can
probably imagine I did not build a
universal music making machine with spec
instead of course I want to focus on one
particular kind of musical flavor of
music so I resisted the temptation to do
something completely crazy and do
something Evan God so because it's not
Paris and it's definitely not 1924
instead I decided to pick a genre which
i think is quite simple in the way that
we can describe it and also has a
defined Canon there and it's also close
to my heart so this music is jungle so
if you don't know jungle I think a good
way to explain it is there's a flavor of
drum and bass with a certain twist let's
give you some more context about what
we're going to be creating today
so when speaking about computer music we
really speak of two kinds of data one is
the audio whether it's a wav file or
just any buffer of numbers that are
ultimately converted from digital to
analog and result in air vibration now
the other is this symbolic
representation of music what are it's
sheet music MIDI files or guitar tabs
this is the data which serves as the
blueprint for musical performance and to
an extent we can translate between these
two domains we want to synthesize audio
from the symbolic representation but it
also may want to produce symbolic
musical data by analyzing or
fingerprinting audio to go the other way
around now to create jungle we're going
to rely on both kinds of data jungle is
very heavily sample based so I think it
makes an interesting choice
full composition but to give you a bit
of a background about history and how
jungle was born so the birth of jungle
is related very much to the appearance
of deez machines like drum and bass and
hip-hop is very much linked to the
emergence of hardware samplers hardware
digital samplers so their availability
lower cost and ease of use compared to
tape manipulation really meant a
democratization of access to musical
production tools and so suddenly in the
90s or late 80s you had a lot of people
something vinyl records anything they
could really get their hands on and
people who were not trained musicians
started producing music that they liked
and that people liked and wanted to
dance to and if you ever were having
work with something like this what it
allows is you can pick record musical
data and store it in a bank somewhere
then you can manipulate it by looping
slicing doing pitch shifting time
stretching reversing those kinds of
operations and musician will often have
several of these
when performing or working in the studio
alright so what is the bare minimum that
I think constitutes a classical jungle
track this hasn't been any audio here
yet but we're going to get to that soon
I know you're waiting for it so at the
very bare minimum we're going to have
sampled drums some bass lines and vocal
samples and this is just some
constraints that I that I added for the
purpose of this presentation
there's many flavors of jungle music and
you can add whatever you like in terms
of the sonic landscape that you're
actually plundering and scent and
slicing so let's start with the drums
because this is really the call of the
jungle sound so the drums are usually
taken from breakbeats
so obviously there's a definition a
break beat is a sample of a syncopated
drum beat usually represented to form
repeated to form a rhythm used as a
basis for dance music hip-hop etc and
the break beat is literally a break in
the middle of a song when the pitched
instruments stop playing and the drummer
plays solo these most often come from
funk soul or gospel records 60 70s in
syncopated really means that the accent
is placed on the weak parts of the beat
rather than the strong ones alright so
I'm going to play you the most iconic
break beat of them all
so even if you're not into jungle you've
probably heard it a hundred times from
in everything from mwa straight out of
Compton to TV commercials for cars or
the original Futurama theme song and
it's called the almond break and it even
has its own shard or name that's how big
of a deal it is notice that the pattern
on the top is a transcription of this
DRAM pattern separated to the crash
symbol the ride snare and bass drum so
let's listen to it to it again and maybe
if you have good eyesight you're gonna
able to follow along so this is a solo
from a track called the Amon brother
from 1969 track by a band called the
Winston's and it happens to be one of
the most sampled songs in the history of
music this literally tens of thousands
of different renditions of this sequence
we only lasted a couple of seconds the
reason why this particular sample is
used I think is because it's revered for
its tumblr and its rhythm which are
quite unique one of the contemporary
musicians wanted to replicate this sound
some time ago and they bought thousands
of dollars worth of vintage equipments
recording studio equipment wants to
replicate the sound you know and and
they couldn't
there's something in the particular way
in which the the drum solo was recorded
in which it was recorded onto tape in
which the the tape grain added some
compression to it it's just very unique
and also the rhythm if you listen to the
sort of ride is
very stable and yet the rest of the
rhythm is is somewhat unstable right
it's syncopated it accentuates the weak
parts of the beat okay so we know that
we want to use sampled break beads as
the basis of our composition so how do
we represent them symbolically
and I think the easiest way is to ask
the musicians themselves and maybe it's
a bit of a cheat because I consider
myself part of that musical scene but
I've also collaborated with other
musicians and found a very curious
property now this is somewhat localized
information but I think you're gonna
find this amusing so if you looked at
the wine bottle label that I showed you
before it had the drum percussion
instruments separated out right you had
the the kick snare ride and crash on
different lines but this is not really
what you're working with this is not the
material how the material really looks
like because the sample is really just a
single layer with all of those
instruments layered out now you could
use digital signal processing to
separate out just the kick or just a
symbol or just a snare but conceptually
I think it's useful to look at the break
bead as a single layer as the Debray
pity the break beat is the instrument so
one to create a notation which felt
natural for me to use and as wouldn't
notations should be right it should be
intuitive they should allow for easy
communication so what I'm thinking about
a jungle beat in my head I'm going doing
something like I just touched it
something like a you know a pattern like
this where the actual sounds are very
close to the actual sounds of the drums
since my first language is polish I
think it's fair to say that we can call
the Polish jungle notation there is no
resemblance to that of Vuckovich birds
you know you get the get the choke so at
the very simplest we could think of as a
set of single syllable onomatopoeic
sounds which correspond to the dominant
percussion sound happening at a specific
time but this information isn't really
enough to get us going as in most
Chandra's of electronic music but not
limited to electronic music the
repetition is key so what we really need
to do is to define some rules as to you
know what these signs what these sounds
are and how we can repeat them so here's
the contrived example of how we can
define simple rules for how many times a
specific sound can be repeated in a row
we just build a collection that we can
use out of that there's an additional
sort of semantic element while we can
name the the the syllables the outcomes
by the specific drum elements like the
cake or ride semi snare combination ok
so there's an interesting property about
break beads that is there are composable
so if you take different renditions of
the armour and break and other break
beads in general we can sort of mix and
match parts of them rearrange them place
them in in some order and use
interchangeably to create our
composition so to do this we really need
to do as is the case with all sample
music is that we need to prepare and
what we need to prepare is a sample Bank
where
has some characteristics so these are
the characteristic I picked for this
particular composition so the drum loops
are equal in length they're in the same
tempo and the volume is normalized so if
we want to just have some
interchangeable elements then it's good
that they are prepared and normalized
ahead of the ahead of time so very
simple stuff I load him up as a bunch of
audio buffers I have a simple function
which only does one thing it plays back
a specific slice given a start time and
end time the buffer and then I just
gonna pick some free renditions of amun
break to begin with it will start
working with here's what they sound like
so these are all variations on the
original almond break that I played you
yet they have different patterns they
didn't have the same drum pattern and
they also had a specific Tom Brut serum
right different Equalization perhaps
some filtering and this is why what
gives the combination of these some
interesting properties so you know we
can play a single sound from one of the
breaks it's just going to sound like
this
what we really need to define is some
mappings from the from the sort of
polish jungle notation sounds to
specific parts of the of our break these
and so what I'm using here is really
somewhat of a familiar notation that it
from western music which is to use
rational numbers just to slice things up
and this is exactly what we're doing
all those break beads can be divided
into eight parts of equal length and see
these are actually played by good
drummers the tempo is going to match up
quite well all right so now we can
generate a sequence from the spec we saw
earlier we just flattened two
repetitions there were created pick four
bars of eight sounds and rhythm eyes
just takes a collection of ammon sounds
or breakbeat sounds which have relative
duration and arranges them in time using
absolute values okay so finally ready to
hear something composed here I'm
repeating the entire sequence two times
here and I'm going to playing it at a
brisk tempo of a hundred seventy two
beats per minute so that's kind of
musical and what I got to this point I
was kind of happy I knew that you know
if you take this and compare it to like
a very early 90s jungle track it's
actually pretty similar to an extent so
now I'm you know I already got to some
point in musical history and you have to
remember that you know when speaking
about early 90s in Jungle musicians
sample music you have to understand that
it's the the way that you samplers were
very simple and all of those very
elaborate techniques for slicing
manipulating break beads those evolved
over the course of the 90s and somewhat
accumulating in late 90s early 2000s
with IDM artists like Venetian Snares or
square for sure ethics twin who really
took the manipulation of break beads and
specifically the Armand break to a new
level in chronic playing at very high
speeds to the point where the
the original sound is almost
unintelligible some of that informations
is lost one of those techniques which
are very interesting is that if you take
especially the snare drum you can
musicians have been treating it as a
pitched instrument so playing it as if
it were pitched instruments and you
could manipulate it on the scale and
change things all right so as I
mentioned earlier we can mix and match
different break beat sounds in this case
I'm doing this at run time so you know
when you're speaking about some chance
techniques in music this is this is
chance techniques 101 right we have a
collection of equivalence techniques in
this case sounds that we want to play or
we just pick one at random and see what
happens
are you guys hearing this right maybe we
put the volume up a bit all right so the
next section is effect and this is
something that I haven't really
implemented yet but I do have a good
idea of how this model can look like so
if you ever saw musical software called
trackers so a tracker is a classical
piece of computer computer software
where we have a sequence of of events in
time where we can have something happen
and this can be playback of a sample or
triggering of a specific instruments and
for each of those notes we can define a
bank of effects that can happen at this
time so we can say that at time 0 we
have just regular playback but the next
time we hit we add some effects whatever
it's pitch shifting you know to play the
snare as a pitched instrument it's
adding adding filters or reverb or other
effects or maybe reversing the audio and
with that we can expand it with even
while the variations there's reality
variations we can do to replicate the
kind of edits that humans human
musicians were doing in the studio
ok so I've set up the scene for slicing
breakbeats
let's briefly talk about the base
pattern and it's pretty simple I mean
they didn't want to complicate the bass
too much so the sequences are rather
rudimentary the base in jungle plays our
route a simple roll simple in the sense
of the de melody it plays but very
important because of its sound it has
and in most especially the early jungle
this is just a simple sine oscillator
that generates a thumping bass sound
something like this so you get the idea
right it doesn't sound like much to by
itself but when you overlay the ebrake
bead over it it starts to add up
now base is obviously a pitched
instruments meaning that the height of
the sound varies to create a melody and
speed when speaking about melodies in
the West we think of them as a sequences
of notes where a notes is a single tone
of definite pitch made by a musical
instrument or the human voice now we
could just you know represent pitch in
the usual fashion in computer music we
use we tend to use MIDI which is just
uses integers in a certain range here
were operating on two octaves and the
duration is represented again by the
familiar rational numbers rational
numbers used in sheet music playing
pitch as random integers it's sort of
like having having a monkey sit at a
piano they may get a ride eventually but
we might actually get annoyed with our
primate companions first so instead we
can compose leipzig scale functions to
transform our random integers into
random integers which happen to fit on a
scale of our choosing so let's listen to
two suggest such an example
I don't know how well you could hear
that it wasn't great but at least I
didn't hate it so we can move on all
right so let's add the final spice to
our mix the vocal samples and
specifically in jungle music we're going
to be using a raga samples and this is
not raga the the South Indian classical
music technique but this is a style of
dance music originating from Jamaica and
derived from reggae which adido
improvisers over a sample or electronic
backing track so we can listen to to an
example of what this sounds like
so I'm not an expert in Jamaican English
but I think it the gentleman said rhythm
is full of culture and I don't know why
specifically these raga B raga samples
were picked as a sort of canonical bass
that jungle musicians picked from it
might just be the devil of Jamaican
ethnicity and they're really into the
Jamaican scene but really what we're
working from here is not anything fancy
at all so again just loading up a set of
these samples specifying some timing
between them all right so let's hear
these all free together
so this particular combination would
probably be described as ragged jungle
right makes sense all right so we know
how to build a short sequence that is
somewhat satisfactory so what is
stopping us from building up an entire
song from this so we'll just specify
some sort of arrangement that we're
going to follow and using the rather
familiar at least in German base pattern
of intro verse breaks down the reprise
and outro and this can broadly really
mean two things either there's a verse
meaning that we play all of our
instruments and this is real interesting
bit
order some sort of place where the beat
maybe doesn't play and that's the intro
breakdown in outro and we know we
specify the keys that should be present
in the particular part of the song and
we can re-evaluate some funny artist
names or song titles and album names
really if you think start thinking about
it
why stop at generating single songs if
we can generate whole discographies just
to show you the sort of telescoping
nature of musical composition coming
from single notes and if you think about
granular synthesis which would
which would slice up a sample into
thousands of elements even below that
all the way through to entire
collections of artists you know this
an interesting zooming effect that you
get and this is very useful because if
I'm a performing musician and I wanted
to form a to free
they've even four hour long set I now
have a compositional tool and to which I
can delegate some of the work and they
maybe because of that I can focus on
other things right some other aspects of
performance because I've delegated some
of the stuff to a program alright so you
know we can create cool albums you know
give them names call discographies know
we can differentiate between different
kinds of releases right we can say okay
this is a dub played so it was like it's
a representation of a vinyl record which
has two sides right an A and B side so
you know it's it's sort of going further
and further I feel like I could you know
take over the world you know you kind of
see where this is going
in the fairies so is there any practical
reason why you want to do this who would
even want to listen to all of that
generated music is there enough air time
in the world to listen to all of that
stuff and the examples you've here today
are you know okay at the best this is
not really virtuoso playing I think it's
a start
so this some interesting properties and
I found when we use specs that play to
our advantage and one of them is that we
can share specs between the generating
back-end and perhaps some sort of
front-end application and so you know
who's going to listen to all those songs
well the users are going to listen to
these songs tell us which are good
take these songs we know word that were
generated from we could improve on that
maybe even we can steal an idea from
Karen Myers Arsenal and have genetic
algorithms have specs fighting each
other to see which one produces the best
tunes and humans could provide feedback
to the generating process you know
what's stopping us we can do this we can
generate some documentation with live
example data have people edit these
specs in line and you see what they
sound like we can do this
we have the technology yeah we can just
you know right and because specs are
data we can we can treat them as data
and just take things out of them and
create representations sure we can do
that all right so I'd like to talk now
about what I think worked in this little
thought experiment of mine well maybe
it's not even the fourth experiments is
we have something tangible in the music
I think the end result is kind of decent
I mean in a 1993 kind of way and I'm
happy I'm happy because I now have a jam
buddy I can have a program that's going
to create a lazy sequence of Allman
breaks and play it for me and I can just
jam to it you know it's I don't need
musical friends now I can just jam with
myself it's very scalable and convenient
I also have a sort of single data
specification that I can share between
back-end and front-end for the purpose
of any applications I'm on or it might
want to build on top of it I think the
biggest gain is because of a musical
perfectionist which is I think just
shorthand for someone who is very bad at
finishing stuff
you know I can produce a lot of stuff
and maybe I'm gonna take 1% of those
generated beats and and play them on the
live sets I'm gonna throw everything
else away and move on with my life what
didn't work well I don't know that
you've noticed but since this closure
spec generators are sort of unaware of
context meaning that all of those
elements that we've stitched together
that were generated independently of
each other so that the generation had no
awareness that you know a common pattern
is pujita right but it just may be
randomly founded this particular this
particular element and there's really
little we can do to build sane
generators that are also context aware
of what came before in the sequence in
addition to that I tried to create
generate parameters for overtone sense
just to see you know where we could be
going with this but I'm not going to
play any of those examples because one
we might pop the speakers until we
probably wouldn't like it yeah I didn't
like it and I think the reason for it is
that again the generations are
independent in the sense that if we
adjust the resonance of a filter which
has consequences for the overall volume
but also we generally generate some sort
of volume level you know if those twos
come up as very high then this is gonna
be something that we're going to need to
normalize and would they really really
go on to go into that too much so I'm
not gonna show you any of it all right
so remember this slide and I'm gonna
start a rant now so beware so I don't
think this is right I don't think that
we can think of computer music as just
data and there's a very specific reason
and that's because this ignores a very
important element that is human
cognition there is a lot of things which
get lost if we just look at the data and
try to combine them together I mean
there's a reason why I decided not to
generate rap music because if I offend
someone am I liable yeah and in this
sense there's a whole area of human
perception acoustics mood context of
which most of generative generative
music is not aware and from that I'd
like to move to this sort of interesting
model for thinking about relationships
between humans and technology and and
that is that there is a certain tension
between the design what was intended and
was the appropriation or how do people
actually used it right spec may not have
been thought of as a platform for
generative music but I used it that way
right luckily there was nothing
preventing me from doing that which
perhaps means there was a good design
but you know as William Gibson wrote the
street finds its own use for things so
even if you take a piece of software I
was intended for creating improving the
quality if your software I can just come
at it from a musical or artistical
perspective and say I'm just gonna use
it to create something totally different
and this is fine right and when when I
talk to people about generative music I
fall to find so - two different
reactions one is that oh it's all
generated there is no human aspect to it
it's all very droids inhumane and on the
other hand you have people who say okay
this is not autonomous at all it's a
contrived example it's pretty
much all human creation and I don't
think either of these are necessarily
true
rather this the agency is hybridized
between the human the musician in the
various pieces of technology and what I
mean by that is that if we look at live
performance and I'm talking about
something specific or laptop music in
this example it's two artists one is
generating music and the other one is
generating visuals and I don't know if
you can read that but there's a full
categories of interaction here Civ human
human human perception human machine and
machine to machine and what this really
shows is that there's a lot of layers in
this performance it's hard to tell
where's the agent right so there's a
musician there's a DJ playing and you
know they there's another artist who's
producing visuals and maybe they've
talked together maybe they said or when
I play track a you know play that cool
video of the beach but maybe they
haven't maybe it's all okay
I'm the as a visual artist I'm listening
to the music thinking what it evokes and
then I'm asking my computer to do
something right and if the computer is
often seen as a black box and a lot of
technologies a sort of black box what
the black box as in you cannot see
what's inside until it breaks and
there's a lot of levels there are hidden
or black box in in technical systems you
know we have to go through some sort of
graphical user interface or you know the
repple there's some software that maybe
we wrote maybe someone else wrote maybe
it's you know UNIX code from the 70s
there's OS drivers there's all these
layers you go through and you know you
may be thinking that oh I click this but
there is some agency of countless
thousands of people who have worked on
the software on the hardware
using that you're not immediately aware
of and maybe you don't need to because
that is a huge sort of cognitive
cognitive loads to go through and when
it breaks obviously you know you get hit
with a stack trace in the face and
you're thinking okay now I know that
this box has opened and I can sort of
peer into it and maybe I don't
understand it and I think it's important
to see ways in which arts can sort of
open up these black boxes and questions
some of the presumptions we may have
about technological systems and one of
my favorite examples is a project called
Coal Fired computers 300 million black
sorry five hundred million computers
three hundred eighteen thousand black
lungs and it's an art installation
created by Harwood Yoko Koji and den
Mars where you have some on the
right-hand side a computer which is
powered by a coal powered boiler which
pumps all the exhaust gasses into this
sort of artificial lung that move the
call sort of accreting
inside of it and what is demonstrate is
that although we may have the perception
that you know the technological goods we
have the laptops smartphones they seem
to be clean but we forget that the
energy which was used to produce and to
manufacture them and often the what we
powered them with perhaps you know came
from burning coal and there's some coal
miners in China who who died prematurely
because you know the coal does got into
the lungs so I think the role of the
artist here is in sort of deconstructing
various black boxes they are not obvious
on day to day basis so what we can do
with this next right I mean we have the
sort of generative system we have some
ideas about what can go what can come
next and I think one interesting aspect
I think is what I would call
self-healing live performances and just
to give you an example let's say that
you want to play in C major and then you
have a spec that you know
this specifies the valid values but you
know your finger slips and you're about
to play a discordant two-tone well we
can see that you know oh you're about to
do something invalid I'm just going to
replace the sound with some valid valid
note that you've defined just so you
don't have to worry about it right I
like that
Stuart Holloway you said yesterday that
the spec is preventing him from doing
stupid things why not apply that same
use achill performance there's a quote
attributed to Syd Barrett the late
frontman of Pink Floyd who said that
it's not important to know which notes
to play just important to know which not
to play alright so where we can go well
as we can go so the second thing I
wanted to explore is sort of expose the
live stream of generated music where
people can listen to it maybe listen
different flavours of it a big fan of
this radio station called jungle train
it's a human run radio station for I can
tell unless they're really really hiding
everything you shouldn't you should give
it a listen
most of the time it sounds much better
than what I played some times is that I
think my stuff is actually better but
that's just because there's tens of
thousands of jungle songs and you know
it's just fatigue alright and the final
thing I want to explore is the cognitive
aspect I'm gonna be wrapping up here but
I'm just gonna mention what I mean by
this so trying to think about how as
software developers and musicians we can
incorporate more knowledge of human
cognition and how hearing works and our
perception of music into our daily
practices some couple of resources that
I think are really good if you want to
get into this this topic there was
supposed to be a github link here but
I've been gradually just messing this
code up more and more before the
presentation so I guess you can just
follow me on Twitter and
I should have this code up running in
case you want to play with it and I
would invite you to to maybe take your
favorite kind of music and try to make a
model maybe you can generate something
interesting that's it alright so there's
one final thing I just wanted to play
you out of a little tune one second I
know this is showing right
dum dum tum tum okay here we are
let's place and choose this is pretty
verbose but that's just soda you can
tell what's going on sequentially
that's all I got thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
