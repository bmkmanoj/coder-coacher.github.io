is Maria this is my first time attending
a closure conference I'm really excited
to be here I'm also really nervous
assumed Mike can tell and so far I'm
having a really good time I think
everyone was really enjoying it so big
shout out to Alex and Lynn and all the
people behind the scenes for organizing
this awesome conference
I'm originally from beautiful Berlin in
Germany where I studied em I did my
undergraduate degree there and then I
think about three years ago I decided to
move to Auckland New Zealand with my
husband to just gain some engineers
international experience and proof my
English you can probably still hear my
German accent say yeah but I'm really
lucky to live here this is MP high in
New Zealand it's a beautiful place you
should come and visit and so yeah I'm
I'm also from New Zealand same as Colin
but I think Colin Colin beats me in that
regard I think he has had jet travel
even further I think he's from the South
Island sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah we have
a small Terrace and a back yard so I
work in Auckland New Zealand as a
closure developer and at a company
called live ups and we do call in
contact software that is supposed to run
in a browser but I'm also a master's
student at Georgia Tech studying towards
my online degree or my master's degree
so it's they have this really cool
program where you can get an a masters
degree online so I don't need to go to
the US which is very good if you live in
New Zealand so being a student I get the
chance to participate at this year's
Google Summer of Code and I think it was
about a year ago or 10 months ago so not
too long that I started to learn closure
and closure script so I still count
myself as a beginner but yeah I think
the first experience I had with closure
script was really good it was through
ohm and then I worked on a company in
Toronto
in frame work and it was just I was just
really amazing how quickly I could move
how easy it was for me to add new
functionality to my application and also
the community community was just really
helpful and friendly and welcoming and I
just wanted to be part of that great
community and set it aside decided to
apply for this year's google Summer of
Code and luckily got accepted and
working on adding JavaScript module
support to the compiler and having David
Nolan as my mentor who is an awesome
mentor by the way anybody probably know
that so yeah I spent three months with a
compiler and learned a few things about
the compiler and that's what we'll be
talking about in this talk so we're
having a look at how we get from closure
script to JavaScript so how how does the
compiler do it and and the intention of
the talk is just to show you that I'm
going to compile the person not at all
this is the first compiler that I worked
on and and I just want to show you it's
not might not be as scary as it seems
it's just something else that you can
learn and you can get used to it
so since I learned a lot better with
examples I will be using a simple
closure script example that will be
passing through our different phrases of
the compiler and there will be some code
so please stick with me so this is the
example we're going to be using it's
getting the background color property
from the body and setting it to a
specific CSS color and it will evaluate
this in a second
but before I start does anyone here have
a favorite just as color anyone ah cool
yeah I think I heard tomato or something
it's actually a CSS color which is
surprising there's also Dutchess blue
funny that they have their own CSS color
so now when we evaluate this file the
slides are tomato which is pretty cool
so what just happened there is that I'm
using bootstrap clojurescript to
evaluate if the closure Scorpio so I'm
gripping and the closure script that is
in code Moreau that's the editor I'm
using here passing into the compiler
which gives me JavaScript and then it's
evaluated and so there's no server
involved or anything like this
everything is just in the browser which
is really cool and what I'll be using
this throughout my slides uh-oh I should
probably change it back to why not sure
if people want to look at Tomatoes
lights cool so and let's see instead of
evaluating it lets see you mm-hmm
let's have a look at the JavaScript that
comes out of the compiler so what does
it that's straightforward right that's
probably what you would have written
it's just a nested property access and
then setting it to this specific color
so the compiler can be divided into
three main phases reading analysis and
emission if you're not familiar with
those phases I wasn't to be honest and
and don't worry I will go through each
of them with our example I will have I
will start with reading so the reader
takes a closure script as text and
outputs just data structures so color
closure data structures that we're also
familiar with and that we also love and
so the thing is that our code is still
saved as text files on the disk right
and we need to have a way to convert it
into something that the compiler can
deal with that we can inspect that we
can annotate those types of things so
it's what the reader does and the code
for the reader that we're using in
closure script is actually not located
inside the closure script report itself
but in instead we're using closure to
tool start reader which is a contra
project and the reader has pretty much
the same semantics as the reader that
you already know from
and is represented by the function read
which takes an input stream
the other cool thing is that over the
summer I think over the summer not too
long ago it was ported from closures or
the inertia readers enclosure it was
ported from closure to a closure script
which is very useful which is required
and for us to have bootstrap closure
script so let's look at our example so
here we're using actually the ported
reader which is enclosure script and
it's represented by the namespace clj as
the tool start reader and we're calling
the function instead of read we're
calling a function read string because
we don't want to pass an input stream we
want to pass our example as a string oh
so when we and when we evaluate this we
can see that we get a list back
containing three elements symbol another
list and a string since you might say oh
I'm not really sure you could might be
something else let let's actually look
at the type so here we can and get the
type and it's just it's just a list and
in this case it's a closure script list
so this is pretty cool since we now and
can use the tools that we're already
very familiar with right we can map over
over it and do lots of things so for
example here yeah we can map over the
result that the reader returns and get
the type of each element in that list so
and then we can see that yeah we have a
symbol another list and just a string
cool so coming back to our overview and
we can change our overview a little bit
and we now know that the reader takes
text and an input stream and returns
data data structures and which are
passed to the analysis face so that's a
move on to the analysis phase so the
analyzer takes the data structures
returned by the reader and
and gives us an ast also called abstract
syntax tree I will see in a bit how that
looks like another cool thing that's
happening during the internet and
analysis phase is Mac for extension and
we'll also have a look at that one
so you might be thinking well heard on
Lisp that's already a tree right you can
already see that as a tree though
actually we actually need to annotate
that tree a little bit we need more
information about our program to be able
to emit JavaScript so the structure will
still be the same kind of some things
will change and but we'll still have for
example set bang as a root node but
instead have a map as a as a note there
with more information so here's an
example note in the ast for true and
which is very simple and you can see
that a node is a map which contains at
least three keys up form and ends up
just specifies which type the node has
in this case it's a constant forum holds
the initial form that was passed to the
analysis phase and NFS short for
environment and holds the map which just
has more information about the
environment such as the name space or
lines or columns and those kinds of
things so let's look at the let's go
back to our example and look at the ast
for example so here I'm creating a
simple user environment and setting it
the namespace to it the default
namespace clj is the user I am passing
the example as a string to the reader as
we've seen before the reader returns the
data structures and then I'm passing the
data structure to the analyzer which is
represented in the namespace clj is the
analyzer and takes in an environment and
our our form right so when I evaluate
this it's quite a lot
and we'll see in a bit why that's the
case and I'll show you a better overview
so because it's a bit difficult to and
tell what's going on here but then since
this is just a data structure it's just
a map we can to get an overview we can
for example look at the keys to see what
our root note has what kind of kiss our
root note has so we can see okay it has
an app form we already knows know those
ones those are old news and then we have
target well and children so children is
a key value pair that every note has who
has child elements and is a vector that
includes those child elements as notes
and this is can be really useful if you
want to traverse the ast without
actually knowing more information about
the note and then we have target and Val
which are note specific keys so for
example and if not would have the
specific keys test then and else in our
case here we have target and bell and
target and valve would just be other ast
nodes and target is the target which
will be the background color property
and Val is our string CSS color constant
cool so this is the root note it's a map
and has as of type set bang and this
tells us already quite a lot this tells
that's us that it's not set back is
actually not a function otherwise the
node type would be invoke and then if we
look at the forum we can see the forum
is still the same form that we passed in
so this tells us that set bang is also
not a macro otherwise the forum would
have changed so then we have N and the
children key containing those child
nodes that target and fell that we've
seen before so if we look at the target
key note
we can see the target is of type dot
which tells us it's a JavaScript Interop
so you have dot for example if you
access a property or if you invoke a
function our case we're accessing a
property and we can see that because we
have an extra key called field which
points to the field that we're accessing
and then this node also has another
target because we could see what if you
look at it if you look at the farm it
has been expended so this tells us that
dot dot is actually macro so this one
this dot node will have another target
which will have another target until we
finally arrive at the end which is just
our final target is just a document on
the other hand side on the other side
and wielki just holds a simple constant
node and for our color cool so how how
does how does it work in the code how is
this AST constructed so this is just a
simple overview and we started the very
top there's this analyze function and
this one basically it just checks which
type our form has so here's the court
for that one this actually that one is
actually include enclosure script repo
and in the file analyzer dot clj see a
funny note on the side when i started to
look at those fire thing and may April
or May and it still had clj evening and
then eventually it changed to a CL JC
because and David started to work on the
bootstrap compiler and started to work
on the bootstrap compiler and so it
changed quite a lot of things and so
this one needed to have CL JC because we
now have closure script specific stuff
in there so that the same file actually
the same code can be used for the
bootstrap and compiler so it's just a
way to see or just from
yeah things are moving really quickly so
here analyze forum takes a forum and as
I said before checks the type so if we
have a symbol or if we have a sequence a
map a vector said a keyword and instance
or an empty list and then it does
specific things or if none of these is
true we'll have a constant which will be
the case for our own value right because
what why it was just a string and then
we can omit the ast for that constant
right away and you can also see that
here we do some type inference where we
checked us is a string and then we can
give this a steno to check but for our
root note and the second condition will
be true since we're having a list so
okay we don't have a map we don't have a
vector we have a list so we can move on
to analyze sequence and another secret
and I analyze sequence actually does the
macro expansion so we get a form and
then we expand one level and then we
check its the expanded form still the
same one as the initial form if yes we
can move on because we know we don't
have a we don't have a macro if if not
we have to start over again with the
expanded form so we'll just start from a
stop and call and analyze recursively so
then we move on to analyze sequence with
checks if our first element which in our
case will be set bang it's a special
form or not here you can see here are
the special forms and in a set and you
can see that set bang is part of this
set and and if it's not a special form
it will be a function and we'll move on
to a parse invoke but in our case set
bang is a special form yeah so it's the
path we're taking set bang is not micro
so we can move on to special to the
specific special forum and then move on
to parse and parse it's just a multi
method which and dispatches on the type
of the note so in our case set bang
and here you can see at the very end
we're finally omitting the EST for said
bay and but we also need to evaluate or
get the ast s for the target and the
value that's also done recursively so
we're calling analyze again for the
target and the value right so coming
back to our overview we've now seen the
analyze it takes a data structure it
does micro expansion and then returns an
abstract syntax tree which is also just
a simple data structure that we can
traverse and have a look at and change
things so it's which is really cool so
now let's move on to our final phase
emission so the mission phase takes the
a ste generated by the analyzer and
finally returns to JavaScript and the
way it returns the JavaScript is by
basically just printing whatever out is
bound to so out for example could be
bound to a file which is cool but it
could also be bound to a string so just
right back into the code again we see
that similar to the analyzer we have a
function where all the action basically
happens or where we which is our entry
point where we always go back to when we
want to emit the next node so emits
takes our a speed that we got from the
analyzer and and also checks the type
again if we have a map which will have
initially what we could have other
things and if none of those things
true will go to the very m to the
default case which would basically just
as you can see print whatever we have so
for our constant node it would print
white so we move on since we still have
the map the second condition will be
true so we were calling MIT and Amit is
just a wrapper around amidst our which
this is another and
multi-method which dispatches on the
note type in our case again set bang and
here you can see that we're already
getting a hint of the final JavaScript
we already have the target on the left
then the equal string and then the value
on the right which is pretty cool and
it's calling amidst the function that
we've seen before recursively again
because we need to figure out what kind
of strings we want to generate for the
target and the value so the target as
we've seen before is a dot node and here
for our dot node we said okay it's a
property X is not a function invocation
so if we will have a field value and so
it will go into the den instead of the
else branch and we can see that we're
omitting the properties from right to
left so we started the most nested one
and at the which will be the background
color and then work our way up or down
depending on how you want to see it to
the final target which will be the
JavaScript document so for our CSS color
we said we have a constant node and this
basically just calls another function
with just a matthew matt' multi-method
again and checks what kind of constant
we have and here we're getting here
we're getting the initial form of that
constant which if you remember was just
a string and then emitting it which will
go into the default switch case and just
print it string
cool so let's put it all together here
again we have our example as a string
and we then pass it to the reader that
we've seen before passed the data
structure to that analyzer analyzer
gives us a is T and then we call into
the emission phase the mission phase is
represented by the name space sealed
gist and dot compiler and we will call
emit string which will bind out to a
string
oh and if we evaluate that we get our
final JavaScript that we've seen before
initially which is pretty cool right so
now that you've of course I have to have
a cat picture in there so now that we've
seen how the compiler works I'm pretty
sure you want a contributor right
luckily closure and closure script and
the other contra projects use JIRA or
Jireh material and to to manage test and
for bug reports and those kind of things
and it's public so you can just go have
a look at the tasks and see what people
working on get if can you can get a
feeling of the process of how people
interact which which is with each other
which is pretty cool but also um and
which helped me initially quite a lot
and was that they're both closer and
closer script and probably other contrib
projects have a label called newbie
label and you can actually just go and
to Gira's search for your project and
select just test it open and just search
for the new beliebe and that will give
you all the tasks that have this label
and I think currently enclosure script
it's about six tests so this was really
helpful for me and because that's how I
found my first test and so country
vertical script so that the how does the
contribution process work so you need to
assign the CA first should probably take
about five or ten minutes and then
created your account but also asked on
the mailing list for permissions because
if you want to edit your tasks and
things like that you need to have the
proper permissions and I'm just asked on
a mailing list orange-like and people
are very happy to give you those
permissions and then
you can look at the test either you have
something that you want to work on
yourself or you pick one of the newbie
tests and just ask around if someone
else is already working on that or not
don't and just communicate and tell
people that you would like to work on
this task now that so that they know
then you go you call in the closure
script project make some changes and
then once you're happy with them you
squash all of your commits and do a
single patch and attach that one to your
juror test and then you could for
example ask people to try out your patch
depending on if it's a bigger one or not
and then if everything looks good I will
be merged and you'd be happy right and
one thing to keep in mind is that you're
done as a sailor you need to write code
to contribute this was true for me in
the first case so my first I already
mentioned my first task was a newbie
task and what I did was and I added a
bunch of drug strings to all the
closures core protocol just were quite a
lot um but it was a good it was a good
starting point for me I could go through
the code and get a feeling for the
process and no it just felt really good
to just give back and I'm country brute
and yeah learning about the process
basically there are lots of other things
other ways you can contribute and for
example you can write about things that
you're trying out blog about it they're
never enough resources or information
and online and I think Mike Fox he also
has a YouTube channel and where he
creates little screencasts or videos
about the things that he's trying out
with coder script and react native so
you for example could do that if you
build a cool application with
clojurescript make that one public and
tell people about it so that people can
look at your code and this also helped
me initially quite a lot to look at
other people's code to figure out how
they're using closure script test other
people's patches
there's a clgs - deaf channels like
where people ask if you want to test
their purchase and those types of things
or you can test a pre-release which is
also really appreciate it
and you can report backs and if you do
that probably it's important to keep in
mind what and stood Holloway set
yesterday try to provide a minimum
repository and make sure the arrows are
not in your tool laying that will just
save your and maintain us a lot of time
if you provide something that people can
take and reproduce your problem with and
then of course go out into the world and
the questions there are lots of channels
we have the mailing list we have the IRC
Channel and we have this like China
where always people around ask questions
and it's really appreciated if you
answer those questions so references
that help me quite a lot were of course
the closer Script code base it's very
readable you can go have a look at that
one then there's a cool talk from
Michael focus from Clojure West 2012
where he talks about the clojurescript
anatomy and he gives more motivation for
clojurescript but also goes through the
compilation pipeline symulast
and what we did today and there's
another cool talk from Timothy Baldrige
from Culture West and last year and he
talks about data all the A's teeth and
what he talks about is that there's
another contra project called closure
tools analyzer and that actually does
the things or similar things that the
analyzer doesn't and enclosure script
and he he talks about that and it's just
a good way to know or learn more about
the ast and then there's this cool
project created by David called hello -
CEO JSC is C for the compiler and and
which is just a collection of code and
walking you through all the all the
steps and you can actually go in try it
out and have a look at the ste
manipulated and it's just really really
a cool project to get your
hands dirty cool um yeah I think yeah
that's it I probably rushed through
quite a lot so we have time for our
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
