approach to full stack full stack
testing at ladder so a little about
myself I was an engineer at mail box and
Dropbox for a couple years worked up and
down the stack did some back-end things
and worked on systems of scale which was
fun I also got to later on work on the
front end doing some full stack
engineering and yeah basically have some
scars from doing single page development
and react in a mutable language and sort
of during that time discovered closer
script and sort of fell in love with the
sort of built-in approach to
immutability and pure functions and when
we started ladder kind of took that took
that knowledge with me yeah so now now
at ladder we're building a new type of
life insurance company sort of a lot of
these companies have been around for a
long time and so we're building a new
company that's all digital and sort of
powered by software from the ground up
so it's like one of the big things we're
working on is usually using data to
underwrite people in real time so
traditionally the process can take up to
four to six weeks and we want to be able
to get people in get them policies sort
of in five minutes the other piece is
sort of we're building a you know
interactive client component and so we
want to help people we want to empower
users give them tools to visualize and
manipulate complex financial data and
really understand how their insurance
needs change over time so that's sort of
like the the general types of problems
that we're working on
and we're really early stage we're ten
people right now for engineers we're
iterating a lot on the user experience
so our stage is one where we want to
iterate really quickly we want to have a
lot of flexibility and yeah but we're
also big proponents of testing and we
have a core belief that sort of like the
right type of testing can accelerate
this type of development whereas sort of
testing at the wrong layers or over
testing could slow us down so we're
trying to find sort of a sweet spot that
works for us so here's our crisp problem
statement we're looking for a test
solution that is decoupled so something
that is not tied to our current
implementation ideally something that
sort of pics sort of an API boundary and
respects that and what this will let us
do is give us flexibility to you know
protect potentially like refactor
implementations without breaking our
tests and better than that sort of our
tests giving us sort of really good
feedback on whether or not you know our
factoring worked so sort of nailing this
will like give us a ton of flexibility
yeah we want similar to decoupled we
want these tests to be end-to-end so we
want sort of the scope of what these
tests are testing to be as broad as
possible lightweight we want these tests
to run fast we don't want we want to
avoid sort of lots of dependencies set
up overhead interprocess communication
so something that is quick quick to run
and CI and also just quick to run
development and then finally we want
them to be simple so simple interface
for developers to to write and debug
tests so these are our criteria first
let's kind of dive into common
approaches to testing so these are sort
of testing
approaches that I've used at other
places and these are all sort of like
these are important approaches to
testing but just sort of general the
general category so if this is sort of
your your general client-server
application your client could be sort of
like a single page app a mobile client
and you know your networking layers sort
of translating things that you're
hearing over the network into sort of
intense whatever that means in your
application and you know calling into
some library functions so unit tests is
you know you're just sort of taking
taking various functions that you want
to understand better and you're
providing sort of input/output pairs and
sort of like you're just asserting
internal functions are working correctly
so these are super light weight fast but
they're totally coupled to your
implementation and that you know these
are sort of scattered through all the
different layers of your software and
you know they're obviously not end to
end and that was never their intention
so so it's a unit tests then you gotta
look at API tests you could also call
these network tests the idea is like you
would spin up your server and you would
sort of hit your your network API these
are simple and that there's sort of like
one consistent interface which you know
if you have sort of your defining like a
rest HTTP server so your inputs you're
just asserting things about inputs and
outputs from HTTP requests but from the
perspective of a client and sort of in
our case we want to be really testing
client and server together and in sort
of sufficiently complex mobile and
single page apps it's really sort of the
orchestration of the two that's
important so from the perspective of the
client sort of the network API is sort
of implementation details so this is not
sort of a Zen den as we want to be sort
of the last category is UI automation
test and so a lot of you are probably
familiar with selenium
and this is great and it's sort of very
decoupled from your implementation so I
mean you could think about like you
could switch from having a Python back
end and like an angularjs front end and
then you could swap to you know using
closure and ohm and as long as sort of
you have the same buttons with the same
class names or you know you could
probably get in theory you could have
your selenium tests sort of work against
that so that's really nice property is
that they're sort of agnostic to your
implementation and their end to end
their testing everything but so they
don't score as well as being lightweight
and simple sort of these tests sort of
have complicated interfaces they're also
like not cross platform so you know web
android/ios all have sort of different
UI automation frameworks and these are
just you know these are slow because
you're fundamentally you know automating
what a browser would do so this is sort
of not sort of the sweet spot of what
we're looking for in a lot of you know a
lot of cases you'll have sort of all
three of these so yeah let's look at
what happens when you would try to
refactor so let's say you sort of wanted
to sort of like rework things you know
you're going to break some unit tests
also sort of you change you know how
your clients calling your server you're
going to have broken in API layer tests
also you know the spec changes every
time you change the spec you're going to
break tests because you're your test
back is typically you know asserting
some sort of behavior change so but what
we're trying to look for is a solution
that like mitigates all that all the
different you know potentially expensive
slit-like work that you're going to have
to put in fixing all your selenium tests
so let's keep looking so um next um next
is a uniform yet extensible approach to
building networked
interactive applications it's written
enclosure script it's a wrapper for
react the thing that's great about react
is it gives you functional rendering for
web iOS Android and um next was inspired
by real a graph ql Falkor and atomic
also a side note on that is Tony Kaye is
doing a unsession tonight on untangled
which is a framework on top of bone next
so check that check that I think it
might be next door tonight also another
great way to learn about um next is
David Nolan has some really great talks
basically some good intro talks and some
more in-depth ones so so we're using ohm
next this is what an ohm next stack
looks like and so the first thing that
and this is sort of our um stat home
next stack in that home next is not
prescriptive about sort of what your
server looks like but this is sort of
how ours is structured and yeah the
first thing that kind of should jump out
at you is that the client parser is sort
of split out from sort of you I and
networking so sort of you're splitting
out sort of your pure data layer
business logic from you I and networking
and we're going to see that sort of that
architectural decision and home next
there's really going to let's do some
cool stuff with testing so walking
through the responsibilities of the
different components in a gnome next
step so you have your UI this is just a
bunch of sort of dumb react components
that define a query take data and render
data and so the top you know they just
take reacts really good at rendering
trees and so they define a query the
other thing they do is that's sort of
like the read render side you also want
your user interface to be interactive
and sort of propagate information back
up so react is great of having a
functional way to bind to event
listeners if you've ever sort of
manage a life cycle manually you'll
probably ended up with you know sort of
memory leaks and sort of you know lost
callback functions react handles that in
a really great way and so so when you
get interaction from the the client you
want to send mutations to the to the
client parser and another cool decision
that I made is a use as a command model
so instead of the UI directly invoking
sort of some function on the client
parser it just hands over sort of some
reified data which is you know an intent
rather than an implementation and that
sort of layer of indirection let's do
some some cool stuff with testing so
client parser as I said is the pure
business logic layer its services reads
from the client and also you know if we
can't satisfy some of these reads it'll
send it to the server and also applies
optimistic mutation so if user interacts
with your site sort of you want to show
them a result of that sort of
interaction immediately and that's
really the whole point of you know react
like rich rich interactive client
applications and if that's not a
requirement for you then you really
shouldn't be using home next or any sort
of single page app framework because
there's a huge cost in sort of getting
getting sort of like a reactive
experience without having to go to the
server client networking layer this is
just you know it takes basically a query
from the parser and just sends it to the
server and this is sort of where
asynchrony can live in your in your
frame or this this layer and the other
cool thing about em next is that there
is sort of no visible asynchrony within
your your business logic where your UI
and for people that have done lots of
like JavaScript front-end development
it's easy to get sort of in callback
hell and sort of would like racing you
know concurrent xhr requests and um next
sells really good batching so it'll sort
of just aggregate all the need from your
whole client and hand it to this
networking layer and so every time you
go over the wire you're sort of getting
everything you need and so we just have
like sort of a one at a time that
working paradigm where we just say you
know we're not going to have concurrent
Network requests we're just going to
play them one at a time which is you
know a trade-off we lose some
theoretical performance but it's a lot a
lot simpler cool and then the networking
layer is basically translating sort of
bytes you're getting over the network
into basically a query that you sent to
the server parser and then the server
parser is sort of your your logical API
and this is the thing that's right into
the database sending emails conducting
all your server side business logic and
also servicing reads so that's sort of
overview of the stack so our approach
our claim is that testing client parser
to server parser you can see this is all
in the JVM is going to be a good testing
approach that gives us nice lightweight
simple the coupled testing that is n den
dish so cool so let's do quick whirlwind
tour of home next through an example
let's say we're going to build a social
networking app so we're gonna have
friends and we're just going to display
all the users and then each user we're
going to display their friends the only
thing you can do in this is you can add
a friend there's no authentication or a
sense of like the current user and this
is basically just a server-side
extension of applying property based
testing to user interfaces so the people
in our network are Bob Mary and Laura
Bob Mary our friends that's it that's
really really simple so if we're gonna
you know first step let's just build to
react components you know we have people
is our top level component each you know
we're going to render all the like the
the person components underneath them
each person component has a name and
some friends and then each friend just
has a name so these are components to
say like gimmies data and I'll just
render to the DOM and then react kind of
takes care of like flesh
actually to the to the browser so yeah
where do we get the data so owns answer
to this question is just having
components declaratively say what what
data they require and so you can see
these these queries sort of our one to
one with props and so if we asked the
root component people like what data do
you need it's pulling the data that you
know all of its children need and sort
of recursively down the line so before
mounting all this we can just say hey
what's what's the data requirement of
the UI and we get this nice query and so
we can take this query and then pass it
to our client parser and our client
parser will sort of hydrate our query so
it'll give us data the exact data in the
same shape that we requested and so you
know hydrated query would look like this
so if you kind of you got to see that
they correspond in shape and this is
going to be the main interface that
we're going to test that is we're going
to sort of we're going to send send the
parser mutations those mutations are
going to sort of propagate through our
whole system come back and then we're
going to query the the state of the UI
will get the query the UI sort of when
it's in the optimistic state as well as
in the final state so the cool thing
about this hydrated query we should
we'll call this the the UI data tree and
the nice thing the nice kind of
guarantee that own gives us is that our
DOM is just a simple function of this UI
data tree so we can feel really
comfortable sort of if we know the shape
of you I data tree that a DOM is going
to look just like that it's going to
have at least the same data cool so
let's let's go sort of get back to our
claim so first let's look in as simple
so we want test to be really easy to
write into bug
I think we all know that if tests are
really a pain to write then they're
going to be a lot less tests written so
sort of liked this simpler and easier
they can be to write the better test
that our application is going to be so
this is this really matters so as I said
before you know we're going to we have
our UI query we populate that into a UI
data tree and then the UI says I want to
add a friend and this is who are going
to change or state of our system so
we'll go from sort of state a to state B
and then weary query our system again
with you I data tree or with a query and
that gives us a new UI data tree so we
can see in the one below you know Bob's
friends with Mary and so that's what our
tests are going to do our tests are
going to sort of supply some sequence of
these mutations in various parameters of
these mutations and then we're just
going to make assertions about what is
the actual shape of the UI data tree the
other thing this is you know we're full
stack testing here and so in the kind of
API we want to maintain is that we want
to sort of like be at like a user
perspective so we want to only look at
the UI data tree and we only want to
look at sort of other things that we
would see so a user would see you know
push notifications or emails so we mock
out our smtpclient and we can assert if
we you know person want friends person
to in person to friends person 3 we want
to make sure person like persons 2 and 3
both get emails so these tests should be
really easy to write to cool so
basically our mutation sequences you
know we're using the command pattern so
client intent is reify data it's just
simple closure data this is just a seek
with the first you know the first
element is a symbol the second is a map
and we also our UI data trees are simple
data and so we can navigate those and
make assertions about those that's sort
of like what why we all started like
programming enclosure because we just
love sort of being able to like look at
data and play with it and sort of like
make assertions about it and so this is
something that you
can these are the types of tests that we
can right now so simple check decoupled
so these not tied to the current
implementation as we just saw we're only
making assertions about our UI data tree
in sort of out of band things like what
emails we got or other API calls that
we'd knock out so everything else can
change we can't change the fact that
we're using um next though that's that's
sort of one of the because we are making
all of our assertions against the UI
data tree but you know we can change
sort of how we're representing state and
the client or we can sort of choose to
not persist something like Russ you know
reify some things on the client or we
can move things from the client to the
server we could change our database
schema we could change the way we're
serializing things or you know sort of
the way our endpoints work so we can
move lots of sort of API boundaries
around but as long as we're delivering
sort of the same UI data tree which is
the thing that the end user ultimately
seize we're going to have tests that are
robust to refactoring cool another
question is since we're only looking at
the UI data tree how do we know that our
servers actually persisting our changes
because you know like just doing local
development you can sort of like click
around through your app and if it's sort
of doing all the good optimistic things
it's showing you the right thing but
then when you refresh the page like know
the date is there and you're like okay
let's get something up so we want to be
able to write tests that do that and so
the naive approach of doing this would
be you would issue some client mutation
and then you just look in the database
you'd sort of assert that there's that
friendship in there so that's one way to
do it but the problem with that is now
you're sort of coupling your tests to
this you know to the database you're
using to the current representation of
that state in the database let's say you
sort of do a big migration and use
want to change how your hair snoring
change it you shouldn't break these
tests for that so so the decoupled
approach is you know the client will
mutate and then you simulate a page
refresh the way you do that is basically
the semantic guarantee of um is that you
can read at any time so sort of at the
end of our sort of state transition like
so the state transition is will go from
a start state will apply this add friend
mutation will go to an optimistic state
and then we'll get a response back from
the server and we'll go to the final
state and then after that we will sort
of just query the server with an empty
client state and that'll give us like
the same effect as if we refresh the
page so we can just compare that refresh
you idata tree to our final state you I
data tree and that's the same as you
know refreshing the page and so we can
not only test that it was written in our
database but that we can also fetch it
and turn it transform it into a client
query so that's that's sort of an
example how we get decoupling through
this approach and to end so we want to
test as much as possible so from this we
saw a slide earlier you know we're not
testing the networking layer the client
networking layer or the UI that's sort
of the bad news but the good news is in
these like these layers should be really
simple and are really not part of sort
of the chain like the business logic of
your application and so we're pretty
cognizant to keep sort of our networking
layer doesn't have sort of tons of you
know sort of like different cases
they're sort of just one case of just
like sending things to the server and
the other thing is the sort of the UI as
we saw earlier it's just a lot of react
components and it's just functionally
taking a UI data tree and rendering it
to the
and this and so sort of the so the
downside is their pieces that we're not
testing that's a drawback but the what
we're getting out of this is we're going
to test the core data flow and so will
be omitting some boundary nodes but what
the purpose of this type of testing is
to sort of give us confidence that you
know when we when we go to start after
we write some of these tests and we go
start QA we're not Q aying like whether
or not like the data has been sent to
the server and like is correctly on the
client like we're not Q aying like do we
have stale and trees or not all we're
queuing is like is this rendering right
is the CSS correct do I does that
animation look well so sort of for the
hard parts of our application which is
sort of moving data around we're going
to lock that down and we're going to be
able to reason about it really well and
then this approach is sort of going to
not test things like given some closure
map can we send you know with two from
subject can we send an email these are
other things that we can write unit
tests for cool so end-to-end does not
get a check but is uh also not an X so
lightweight so we want to test is our
approach yeah we want our approach to be
fast with little dependency set up and
overhead so let's think about like what
we're doing this is all running on the
JVM the cool thing about the client
parser is that it's just the data layer
it's just your data business logic it's
all it's like answering queries from the
UI and sort of giving it back you I data
trees and it's taking imp like novelty
and mutations and sort of changing state
none of that is sort of it should be
totally da mac gnostic so with the
reader conditional we can just run this
on the JVM so that's great so for
lightweight so we only you're only in
one process another cool thing sort of
an aside there is this logic your client
parser should be totally portable so you
should be able to drop
this in on any other client so you could
run this in react native on iOS you
would sort of have a totally different
UI layer but this is sort of the the
modularity guarantee of own necks where
we can just swap out you eyes and those
you eyes will have their own queries but
they'll instantly sort of have access to
all the mutations that we implemented on
our other client they'll be able to read
the same data but the shape of you I
data tree will change so cool so
everything's JVM 11 process there's no
rendering all we're doing is like
outputting a UI data tree which is just
a bunch of maps and vectors and keywords
there's no network i/o using an
in-memory database so everybody gets
their own test database so we can run
all these tests in parallel cool so
let's yeah so it's all so let's do a
little demo so this is our dry function
we're just going to call friend add a
thousand times and every time we call a
friend add what we're doing is hope you
guys see that okay anyways where we're
calling we're just going to call a
mutation in the repple and yeah so
basically you can see here runs in six
hundred milliseconds so what we did is
so did we added a friend and every time
you had a friend we mutate our client
state we reparse out an optimistic UI
data tree we send that mutation to the
server we write it to the database we
call send email on our email protocol
the server then we service any reads
that we have we send those reads back to
the client we merge those into the
client state and then we really queer e
the final state to get the final you I
data tree and then we do the sort of the
whole refresh refresh flow and that
happens sort of each time for every sort
of mutation and
friend ad so it's pretty cool that we
can do that in 600 milliseconds so you
wouldn't feel to do that with with
selenium or other sort of testing UI
automation testing approaches so
lightweight check cool and now that we
can sort of run these arbitrary
sequences of sort of user interaction we
can do property based testing so quick
overview of property based testing is
like sort of comparative example based
testing is an example based testing you
know you put on your adversarial hat
you're like how can I break this code
and like you try to give sort of tricky
input-output pairs and make sure that
your function is doing the right thing
so that's sort of like what most of us
think of when we think of testing as an
example based testing property based
testing is we just generate random input
and then we sort of run it through our
system and then we insert some
invariants hold so it's kind of tough to
write these invariants because they're
more general but yeah we can sort of
like this is similar to like fuzzing
where you just sort of like blast things
with input and see if they break so
that's the that's the same this is sort
of the general idea behind property
based testing so here's an example what
we have is let's say we wanted to test
that closures like closure course or is
idempotent what we do is we generate you
know vectors of random size with where
the entries are random integers and then
we would sort it and then we would sort
it twice and then we compare those
results and if those results are equal
you know then we can feel it's not a
proof but we can feel pretty confident
that this property of item potency of
sorting sort of holds true for this sort
sort implementation so in our social
social friends app these are some of the
invariant
that we want to hold so yeah in
particular we're going to look into we
don't want to send repeat emails so we
want to sort of gain confidence that our
system like if someone just is like
click click click friend friend friend
friend that's not going to like blow
your inbox up with you know a ton of
email notifications so we want to start
sort of one email notification /
friending and then the other thing we
want to do is we want to assert that our
client is synced given any sequence of
input and the way will assert synced is
sort of what we're talking about before
by comparing our refresh tree to our
final tree so you guys are not able to
see that very well changing fonts on the
fly here
you
are those that was unsuccessful hahaha
so let's go to our property based
testing so up at the top here we sort of
have sort of our generator so this is
going to generate a bunch of sequences
of friend adding and yeah and so like if
we run that in the repple we get you
know something that looks like like this
so sort of sequences of a friend friend
adding so like this one this will give
us like the empty set this will you know
have person to friend person one but
it's just give this sort of like a
random string of data and so from our
sorting example this is you know the the
input for our vector just like random
random entries and then we're going to
run these examples through our synced
code and this you know our property
synced all it's going to do is it's
going to you know we're going to assert
that sort of the final tree is equal to
the refresh tree so we'll run that
cool and so we get a failure and the
cool thing is it'll shrink our input
down to the middle bowl failing case and
which is you know turns into a nice
property based test or example based
test so we can just call drive on this
yeah and so that that gives us our UI
data tree and so synced we're comparing
that our final tree is equal to our
refresh tree and so if we look at these
two we can see sort of in the refresh
tree that Mary is sort of Bob's friends
with Mary but Mary's not friends with
Bob so it looks like we're not
persisting the reciprocal relationship
but we are in the client so we go ahead
and fix this little live fixing things
in production here
then we go back to our test cool and we
see that we fix the fixed the property
based test passes and then now our
example we have a reciprocal we have
persisted that reciprocal relationship
on the server so same sort of thing for
for email but yeah the cool thing is
that you know for all the different
friending inputs we now feel really
comfortable that if we hit refresh at
any point in time we will see the same
data cool so that was just a little
example of property based testing so
rich shaky quote not everything is
awesome so we look at sort of the
trade-offs so the cons as we saw you
know this approach isn't it fully
end-to-end another thing we ran into is
there some running the client parser on
the JVM there's some sort of jas JVM
discrepancies sort of there's there's
only like the number type in JavaScript
whereas there is sort of a lot of
different types of numbers in the JVM
and so one thing that we've among other
things we found is we've put a lot of
our shared code to get tested st. they
run the same tests and the JVM and in
JavaScript so that's sort of one way to
mitigate that that common but the pro is
we have a framework that we can run tons
of tests super quickly and it's really
lightweight and it gives us a ton of
confidence about our data it gives us
sort of we sort of think of the whole
scope of our application it gives us
like this core piece which is the data
the data moving between client and
server we can get really confident about
that and we can assert things about that
is when we have problems we just sort of
have to debug at the periphery sort of
where that that data is be turning into
emails or that data is getting turned
into actual pixels on the screen so in
conclusion yeah I would encourage you
guys to
sort of think about how you're going to
test your systems before you build them
i would also sort of encouraged to ya
have build a way so you can kind of
compare that you can sort of make
assertions about your data and
especially in the case that you're
building sort of like a client-server
interacting application that you would
be able to sort of test test the
interaction of these two pieces because
that's sort of where a lot of complexity
happens is when you're going over the
network and you have sort of two 22
notes trying to Grant's on state yeah
and the latter team asked me why was
going up to seattle and i said to
misrepresent all your hard work as my
own so this is really yeah team effort
and these guys put in a lot of hard work
to sort of build our full stack frame
testing framework cool all the codes up
on github I didn't talk too much sort of
like how a lot of this is built just
sort of more of why you know why this is
a good approach but you can kind of dig
into that and free feel free to sort of
make issues or comment on happy too
happy to answer any questions cool thank
you any questions cool right here
no so yeah we run there's no it's all in
the JVM so basically we have like our
client parser CL JC file and we'll sort
of just run that in the rubble and then
sort of that'll get compiled and like
combat like put into like our appt j/s
later but yeah there's no no browser at
all on these tests yeah so I've used so
this is a this is like the the Vinny
Mac's war here be careful with what I
say but I think and I'm not a reframe
expert but i would say it might be
comparable to the analogy that I think
I've heard is useful is if you've used
like redux versus relay like Redux is
simpler light more lightweight less
boilerplate doesn't is more agnostic to
sort of like what you're doing with the
server and like doesn't deal with any
sort of client-server synchronization
whereas relay is kind of more sort of is
all about sort of syncing things between
client and server but there's more
overhead and more boilerplate but what
you get is a lot sort of like it'll help
you sort of scale longer so I think yeah
I think that's a similar analogy between
reframe and Oh next yeah yeah I think
reframe is not as opinionated as how you
get data from the server whereas ohm
next says let's use like co-located
queries to do that cool
awesome thanks for coming out guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
