act on the diatomic team I'm also the
tech lead for pedestal before the
conference Alice Alex asked us to send
some answers to questions by way of an
introduction and one of them was
favorite function so I threw that out
there I tossed in what I thought was an
interesting fact that I've used to start
previous keynotes
which is does anyone here know what is
special about st. John's Wood tube stop
in London it is the only one whose name
does not include a letter from the word
mackerel so if you get nothing else out
of this talk that's a fantastic thing to
drop at dinner parties and you know what
have you alright so um so I have worked
with rich for the last couple years
which has been you know really super
enjoyable for me I've learned a ton of
stuff from him one of the things that
I've learned is that you get a lot of
mileage out of going back aways in time
and picking up a tool that most people
have forgotten about so I brought mine
right here okay hold it higher so
everyone could see this is a beautiful
circa 1910 Bucks Brothers cast steel
chisel the reason I brought it was I
needed an example for this talk which is
programming with hand tools so we often
say you know we should really use the
right tool for the right job and it's
absolutely true it's an interesting
expression though first I don't know as
I've ever heard anyone apply it to a
tool that they didn't like right so it's
worth really thinking about what tools
we do use I spent a lot of time thinking
about tools in two veins
software is one and the others
woodworking so I'm 44 years old and one
of the things I have learned about
myself in the last couple years is that
I can't not be building things so you
know I am at my happiest when I'm
writing software or building furniture I
am at my I can't say unhappiest it's not
really fair exactly one of the toughest
times for me is when my family goes away
on vacation which is fantastic for my
wife because she needs to get out of the
house to relax and after a little while
so
drive me bonkers because I can't just
why buy a pool or at the beach and read
books or what have you I got to make
stuff I work primarily by hand there's a
bunch of reasons for that in the you
know woodworking space big ones are it's
a lot less noisy it's a lot less dusty
woodworking dust is a bone carcinogen
and you have to have pretty
sophisticated equipment to keep it out
of your space and out of your lungs and
it avoids problems with physics a lot of
power tools involved rotating a blade
very quickly like 1020 thousand rpm and
then taking a piece of wood and pushing
it into that blade tangential to the
axis of rotation that means that there's
a front edge of that blade that's
pulling the wood in and pushing it down
and then the back edge of that blade is
pushing it up and back towards you at
potentially a super high rate of speed
so you can inadvertently push wood into
a spinning blade and have it come back
at you at 50 or 60 miles an hour so it
just doesn't seem like a good idea to me
now a lot of people hear me say I build
furniture primarily by hand and they
think man that must be a lot of work and
really complex and it's not there's
three things you need to understand and
I'm going to teach them all to you right
here right first you need to understand
the material right Wood is a thing that
has known structure known properties
that we can reason about the most
important one that really differentiates
from closure is that what is mutable
that turns out to be really really
important a tree is basically a mutable
stack of cones I never thought about
that's this way before until until I was
learning how to read grain and a piece
of in a piece of wood right when you
think about how a tree grows it gets
bigger but it doesn't get bigger at an
even rate all the way up it's not a
cylinder right it tapers at the top it's
a series of really long skinny cones and
so when you cut a board out of a pile of
cones it's a conic section right that's
why when you see boards that have those
grain patterns which we call cathedrals
right because they're not clean enough
to be called parabolas that's why those
show up there right a board is basically
a conic section of a tree in general
wood is stronger along its length than
along its width right and it expands
along its width and not along its length
that expands due to humidity right so
that whether it is more it expands the
drier it is the more it contracts so
here's a picture I'm not an awesome
photographer these were photos I shot in
my shop but this is an attempt to show
you the conic section so this is the
bottom of the board it's as if we slice
the tree and then laid it back like this
and I don't know if you could tell in
the photo there are some rings up here
the annular rings of growth right that's
the bottom of the cone and then we see
the cathedrals up on the board up there
right up here
that's the cones going up the tree right
and if you look right here at these very
light lines they're going that way okay
so that's the structure that you deal
with right that's the known structure
and everything that you do in hand-tool
woodworking is about taking a beveled
blade like this and this is really the
only tool all other tools are variations
of this as we'll see and attacking this
would in some way right so check this
out I just got this look how thin it is
no wires
it's awesome so using a blade with a
piece of wood is really easy right if
you go this way you slice something off
it if you go this way across it works
like a knife and slices the grain if you
go in this way from the edge it splits
the piece of wood if you go in this way
straight down it chops a hole out of it
and if you angle it this way and drag it
across it switches from slicing to
scraping that's it right it's all about
how you take this blade what angle you
hold it at which direction you're coming
from that's all you need to know right
every single hand woodworking tool works
like that here's the other thing you
need to know this is a beautiful door
and it's not mine I didn't have a door
convenient to photograph so I had to
borrow one you've all seen doors like
this everywhere through your whole life
they're shaped like this for a reason
they're shaped this way because the wood
is stronger in these dimensions and it
stays more rigid and inside each of
these pieces is a groove that allows
this panel to float it's not actually
fastened in and the reason it has to
float is because wood expands and
contracts and its width right so there's
a reason that every door that's actually
made of solid wood that you've ever seen
is built like this right so we talked
about what a tree's built like on the
inside right and how we take advantage
or you know work around the fact that we
get strength the long way right not the
narrow way across the width and then we
have to deal with big panels that are
going to expand and contract make sense
all right so that's all you need to know
about wood now you need to know about
tools and as I said there's really only
one there is a beveled blade and every
single woodworking tool every single
hand woodworking tool really just
amounts to this right it's a blade of
some sort we'll take a look at a couple
in a second there is a gateway skill to
working with this these fundamental
tools and that is sharpening right a
blade of an edge right these are edge
tools and
is made by getting two planes to
intersect at you know a true edge not a
single line right not something rounded
over sharpening is a really daunting
thing when you start when I was
researching getting more into hand tools
there's a gazillion things on the
internet about how you could sharpen in
different technologies and tools on the
important thing is to just try it it
turns out not to be that difficult this
is a really old chisel that I bought at
a vintage tool sale
it got reground to clean up the blade
that was there whoever had sharpened it
previously didn't have it straight it
probably took I don't know five ten
minutes to get it sharp enough to shave
the arm hair off my arm which is usually
where I stopped in terms of sharpening
something and it you know once it starts
to get dull it takes I don't know maybe
a minute to 90 seconds to touch it up
again and then every now and then you
have to go back and do the original
thing again so it you know it seems like
this really challenging task it's it
turns out not to be in practice alright
so let's look at a bunch of tools so um
these are all chisels right this is the
one I just have right there these are
just other chisels that work exactly the
same way this one's kind of special this
is known as a pig-sticker
that's for really whaling on the edge of
a board and driving hole really deep
into it so it's got to have this really
beefy blade in this set and this big
tang up here that stops the wood from
splitting this is my grandfather's
vintage stanley number for bench plane
bench planes you I'm sure seen pictures
of and really it's just a big chisel in
there this bit right here is the blade
it's a giant chisel you'd never be able
to hold it at a stable angle and push it
along so a plane is really just a chisel
holder right with handles that's it
these are joinery planes joinery planes
have different shaped blades like this
one or one right there and what they do
is have all kinds of arms and attachment
that hold the blade at right angles to
some other piece of the plane so they
allow you to put grooves into things or
you know cut things square to other
things so there's a handful of them to
do
various things this tool is called a
scraper right scrapers are really fine
way to work wood so it takes off just a
little it was the example of a few tip
to blade up like this and went this way
so that tool up there is just a holder
for a piece of metal angled like that
this is a card scraper which is just a
piece of metal that you hold with your
hands okay even a drill this is a crummy
photo I apologize but even a drill see
this little edge right here the shiny
bit that's a little beveled blade and
there's one on the other side right so
that drill has a lead screw you start to
crank it around with a little bit
embrace the lead screw goes in and those
two blades start to cut around in a
circle to slice through the wood okay
alright I love this picture you know
what it is yeah it's a seven-point rip
saw 26 inches long and if you were to
count up along the length of the blade
every one of these is a tooth there's
140 of them they're just tiny little
chisels it's all just chisels all all
the way down okay alright so we we
understand about the wood we understand
about the tool we know the structure of
the tree we know it's really all just
chisels now we need an environment okay
the environment in hand woodworking is
really important and it with a lot of
machine tool work I mean people don't
build these things quite the same way
you need a workbench and a workbench
when you work by hand is a
three-dimensional thing to hold pieces
of wood in place the fundamental
difference between woodworking by hand
and woodworking with a machine is when
you're using a machine you bring the
wood to the machine right and move the
wood across that machine when you're
working by hand you bring the tool to
where the wood is and move it across the
wood so you need to hold the wood still
okay my workbench is based on this
design roughly which is this etching is
from a book by Peter Nicholson it was
originally published in the mid 1700s
why go back that far for a design well
because if
you work with hand tools and you want to
find real expert opinions on how to do
it nothing beats the guys who didn't
have any alternative right those guys
knew what they were doing they supported
their families working six days a week
12 hours a day making stuff so you got
to look at what they did and like really
pay attention to it so this is a picture
of my workbench down to my shop looks
basically the same it's got this big
apron on the front with a whole bunch of
holes in it it's got these metal things
we'll see more of in a second and it's
got this crazy hooky thing over here on
the left that thing's called a crochet
crochet is just the French word for
hooky thing
this is just a cool action shot all
right so you need to be able to hold
pieces of wood in place to work on them
so here's a board getting it I mean it's
already flat but the peas are I got to
admit these are posed photographs right
so if you were flattening this board
you'd lay it down flat you'd run the
plane traversing across it there's
actually no vices on this bench there's
there's nothing but physics to hold
things in place so there's a stop up
here inserted in a couple holes that
hold it going that way you can't really
see it here but there's a groove in the
bench and there's a piece dropped and
behind it that stops it from sliding
that way so I prefer to work where
possible just having stuff braced
against other things the blade is going
to exert a lot of pressure on the wood
so it's not going to come back at you
right so you just need something else to
stop it from sliding and you're good so
we can work the faces of boards we can
work the edges of boards and this shows
what the hooky thing is for okay it's
sometimes also called a jam cleat and it
basically lets you slide a board in and
hold it in place these metal things are
called holdfasts these were the tools
that people use before there were vices
holdfast there are about nine inches
long they're made out of these are made
out of a kind of iron or steel wire
actually traditionally they'd be forged
and what the holdfast does is it slides
into a hole in the bench that's fairly
deep say two and a half inches and then
you hold it in place and you take a
wooden mallet and you smash the end of
it and it flexes enough that it shoves
the shaft into the hole and wedges it
there those will hold tight enough that
I can lift my bench with them well I
mean I can lift half my bench the bench
is heavy enough I'd need someone else to
lift the other half you release them by
smacking the back of them that jars the
thing in the hole and it pops out and
the reason that the front of the bench
is covered with holes is it's super
convenient for using holdfasts okay so
this is working an edge of a board to
get it at right angles and smooth and
straight if we turn a board on end and
push it into the cleat and smack a
holdfast in there then we can work the
end of it well there isn't a vise
actually built on to the bench there is
one that goes on the other end this is
known as a boxing vise named for Joseph
Moxon who wrote another woodworking book
back in the 1800s it's designed to hold
a pretty wide panel so that you can work
the end of it typically if you are
cutting dovetails with a saw along these
lines the vise is actually just clamped
onto the bench using holdfasts so the
system kind of builds on itself here's
one last example of working on a piece
in this case this is a back panel for a
for a bookcase that I've been working on
for ages and it's using the same two
holdfast that we're holding the vise and
they allow me to clamp it down right
along the edge and then take that plane
right there which has a fence on the
side that butts up against the slip run
the plane down and cut this rabbit into
the side right and that allows me to
overlap panels so this workbench is
pretty solid pretty stable and
substantial it was built with this set
of tools right I built as I say
primarily by hand so a bunch of saws a
bunch of planes some drills some chisels
and you're done to be fair in the in the
name of full disclosure there were
however two automated tools that I use I
said at the beginning I work primarily
with hand tools I use a bandsaw up there
right I use the bandsaw primarily for
rip cuts that's cuts along the length of
long pieces of wood I do those by hand
sometimes but it's pretty grueling so
you know that one's just uh and be
admitting that I'm 44 years old I also
use a drill press that's just me
admitting that I really hate it drilling
a hole that's not square right it's just
super irritating so so those are the two
power tools that I use right neither of
them has that physics property of
pushing wood into a blade at the wrong
angle right they they don't violate my
primary safety concerns they do at least
a bandsaw does generate a fair amount of
dust so it actually lives in my garage
so I actually only have a bandsaw I live
in New Hampshire so I would bandsaw
seven months of the year that only gets
used you know when the big doors open
all right so you might wonder you know
why do I put myself through this like
why would I want to work this way on the
first is that I have really come to
appreciate simple tools my friend Craig
would say that's because I am a simple
tool and he could be right right
I just find this is such an odd thing to
say at a tech conference especially with
something as as you know something like
closure that I think is really moving us
forward is the more I spend time with
computers the more I have to spend other
time with things that are distinctly not
computers and I love this quote have any
of you ever seen the wood right shop on
PBS yeah with Roy Underhill's the guy
who does that
he's a hand tool woodworker like just
all hand tools
he started the the carpentry and cabinet
making program at Colonial Williamsburg
he has this great quote the ancestral
simplicity that blade is a great thing
and it is really true there's something
super fundamental about it as a human
being I also really like working by hand
because I get a phenomenal amount of
precision and control with my tools far
more than I could get with the power
tools that I can afford and have space
for you can get super high quality power
tools that are extremely expensive and
super precise but if you don't have the
budget or space or inclination for that
you can do phenomenally well with hand
tools this is a shaving taken with a
smoothing plane which is the last step
in finishing wood it leaves a finish
that doesn't need sanding before
applying whatever it is you want to
apply to it I know if you can really
tell in this photo but this is thin
enough that you can see the pencil
through it it's on the order of a
thousandth of an inch with a sharp
enough blade that's a you know pretty
pretty reasonable tolerances you can
work at the thousandth two thousandth of
an inch kind of kind of place
so super difficult to do with a machine
here's another example this is more from
the control perspective so I'm working
on this bookcase for my wife and this is
a piece of molding that goes around the
top I actually brought a little chunk of
it here
and this molding was designed by me
saying what do you think we should put
on here for a piece of molding and her
drawing a little picture as we took the
picture away and cut it out and stuck it
on the end of a piece of wood and then
made the molding from there it's made
with these two wooden planes I know if
you could tell in the photo one of
them's concave one of them's convex
they're called hollow and round planes
the hollow one cuts the rounded bit the
rounded one cuts the hollowed bit right
and then these are two cabinet scrapers
just pieces of metal with graduated
sizes of concave and convex circles
which you can scrape down those surfaces
to get them super smooth now one of the
challenges making molding is when you're
done you have to cut it at an angle and
this you can see kind of in the back
there that's actually cut on a bevel
because you're going to put it on a
corner and you need to be able to make
that super precise both in terms of
length and just in terms of getting the
angle right 45 degrees so here's a tool
I built to do that one of the things
with simple tools is a lot of times when
you first see them you're like what is
that right coral objects like that and
and then when you see them in use you're
like oh okay I get it so you look at
this and go what it's some kind of box
and it's got some angle stuff and a
dowel and there's this weird wedgie
thing right first let me say wedges are
freaking awesome inclined plane for the
win so so this piece of molding is stuck
in this frame and the wedge acts as a
clamp driven under the dowel just with
finger pressure it'll hold it tight that
clamps the edge of the molding upside
down pushed up against the side of the
frame and lets you take a block plane
and smooth this down and that in turn
lets you get here
right so precision and control right I'm
not going to say you can't do this with
power tools I certainly can't do it with
the power tools that I have and have no
real interest to right absolutely
amazing how precise you can get you also
have the flexibility to make anything
like a lot of times you just say oh you
work by hand what happened you know what
can you not make there's nothing you
can't make everything prior to 1800 was
made entirely by hand look at the
ceiling in here that was made after 1800
it was not made with machines parts of
it might have been but not the whole
thing all right you can make anything by
hand here's a real concrete example this
is a power tool called a jointer and
what a jointer does is take a piece of
wood that's rough on the sides the faces
or the edges and it flattens about so
those two sections called the table are
at slightly different heights like 1/32
of an inch and under that guard right
that thing in the middle called a pork
chop actually because of the shape right
that thing swings out of the way when
you bring the wood over it and there's a
set of three or four blades in there
spinning crazy fast right and you take
the wood and you slide it over this and
as it moves from the low table to the
high table it skims off you know a
section of the board and the tips of
your fingers if you're not careful when
you're done getting one face flat you
flip it up against that fence on the
back and you get one edge flat okay so
this is pretty typical for a home shop
it's a six inch wide jointer probably
costs I don't know six hundred bucks and
the day after you bring it home you go
to the lumberyard and you find a
beautiful eight inch wide board I've
never met someone who owned a jointer
that wasn't smaller than the jointer
they wish they bought right and so you
know what some people do they cut the
board in half and joint the two halves
and then they glue it back together and
then they save their pennies for years
and say oh my god I'm gonna get a big
jointer right this is a 16 inch jointer
it costs thousands of dollars weighs a
colossal
amount takes up a ton of space it's like
an aircraft carrier right and you have
to have a ton of space on either side to
move wood across it right I mean you
need like 32 feet to do that and it's
still not big enough here's why the top
of my bench needs to be flat so I need a
24 inch jointer and it's got to be 16
feet long alternatively instead of you
know buying a ten thousand dollar
jointer and putting it in the garage in
my wife's spot I can buy a three hundred
dollar hand jointer and spend 15 minutes
and be done Devin this is the thing I
needed your help with how do you know
when you're done here step up for a
second grab the end of that you know
when you're done when you pull eight
feet of to three thousandth of an inch
thick shaving that you can see through
off your bench right you can do anything
with the hand tool does that mean that
the power tools are not useful to have
Thank You Devin no they might be right
but they have a limit there's always a
limit and it affects what you do all
right
I love hand tools because they connect
me to my work I've built a lot of stuff
over my 25 years writing software and my
five years doing woodworking and one of
the things that I am absolutely most
proud of is this it is not fancy it's
built out of pine it's my son's bed I
made it for him when he was seven years
old because he wanted a bed with a cave
and I gotta say there's there's fewer
things I'm prouder of as a father than
the fact that I made his bed with my own
two hands
all right last thing this isn't really a
reason why I use hand tools it's just an
observation it takes time and effort to
learn but not a ridiculous amount of
time and not a ridiculous amount of
effort all right well so that was super
interesting to me anyway
and you might be saying Tim you know
this is a closure conference right so
here comes the rocket analogy I work
with another material it's a beautiful
thing because it has known structure and
properties unlike the material I worked
with for 22 years of my career or so
where who knows what that pointer
actually refers to I have a material I
can reason about right persistent data
structures this is what they look like I
have a fundamental tool for operating on
persistent data structures we think
there's a lot of different tools there's
really just one it's the function
presented to the persistent data
structure from from different angles
right the same way that sharpening was a
gateway skilled for hand tools syntax
semantics like this take some effort to
pick up it's not that hard you know it's
hard finding a good picture to go with
the notion of a function
I found a picture that I think is
actually a photograph of the library of
seek functions here it is you use those
functions to carve up your data and you
have an environment right you have this
place that you work this beautiful clean
simple place that holds on to the stuff
that you're doing like my workbench it's
based on something old and here it is
and as with hand tool woodworking take
some time and effort to learn totally
worth it you might say Tim I see what
you did there you repeated the material
the tools in the environment attempt to
convince me that these are really
analogous in the same thing and I'm not
sure I believe it so I'm going to do the
thing you're not supposed to do and I'm
going to appeal to authority to convince
you and when you see who the authority
is you will be convinced
Roy Underhill again says it's much like
when obi-wan Kenobi gave Luke Skywalker
his lightsaber right woodworking is like
being a Jedi Knight with a lightsaber
and of course being a Jedi Knight with a
lightsaber is a lot like being a lisp
programmer right you can't argue with
obi-wan Kenobi
all right so I assert that those two
topics are now connected
everyone comes along next woodworkers
and programmers and says you know that's
great but I really want some automated
power tools to like get me more
productive that's really what I need and
you know I have to be very careful here
and I'll just say right now I am NOT
against the notion of automation right
not by any means I use a bandsaw I use a
drill press I use a bunch of other
things
I'm not against automation but it's
really important to understand that
automation when you automate something
it has an effect on how you perceive
that thing in the scholarship of
automation there's a thing called the
substitution myth the myth is that you
can take a manual process and substitute
an automated step and it it doesn't
change I think of it sort of as like the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle right
that the act of observing changes what's
observed or more vividly it's not until
you look at them through a magnifying
glass but you realize how often ants
burst into flame so
the problem is when you automate
something you change the nature of the
thing and you have to be aware of that
right so there so there's some there's
some great examples in some really
tragic examples so I've got a couple
down here the first ones navigation
studies show that when people use GPS
navigation they are far less aware of
where they have been on their way to a
destination they're gonna need the GPS
to get back I was talking to my friend
Russ and he had a great story about this
he used to work at a company there was a
young guy who said I'm gonna head out
and see a friend in Pennsylvania this
weekend and Russ grew up in Pennsylvania
so he said oh where where are you going
to go and the guy said I'm gonna go
wherever the GPS takes me so somewhere
we crossed into this like I don't
actually need to know where I am which
is an astonishing thing and you better
hope you have a good battery um the the
tragic one is flight right there have
been a lot of that there have been
various plane accidents in recent years
where the conclusion about what the
issue is is planes that have been on
autopilot coming out off of autopilot in
inclement weather and pilots reacting
wrong because they don't spend enough
time actually flying planes right they
spend time monitoring the autopilot that
is flying the plane
so the problem really the second bullet
is a key right knowing comes from doing
if you stop doing ultimately you stop
knowing right and that's where the
fundamental cost is in automation so
let's see where this affected things
we're going to start on the furniture
side we'll talk about software to in the
world of furniture right in the
mid-1800s machine tools starting to
really come into vogue and of course
there's a huge benefit to them you can
produce more stuff faster and more
economically it's beneficial to everyone
right it allowed for the creation of
furniture that more people could afford
as opposed to just you know the half of
one percent or whoever it did it's worth
noting chain
change the furniture that we actually
made every one of you in your house I
would bet has a door like this the
cabinet door and the it has this joint
up at the stop that's called a stub
tenon the door that I had on the first
slide way back when had a full mortise
and tenon meaning the rail on the top of
the door has a tenon which is a tongue
and it slides into the mortise which is
a hole in the upright piece rights
completely contained and goes almost all
the way to the end so that's a
tremendous amount of glue surface for
strength and you can't see anything but
two boards meeting at the top so
aesthetically it's preferable those
doors are extremely hard to find on
commercial furniture today because
they're more difficult to make instead
you find doors like this a stub tenon
that that little bit is all that's
holding that door together right it
doesn't go any deeper than that and it
shows on the top there's no aesthetic
reason to do this there's no structural
strength reason do this it's 100%
economical because you can make them
with a single pass on a rotary cutter
like this right the grooves in fact
here's a guy working on a machine that
makes a door in 1 minute and 37 seconds
he takes a piece of wood and pushes it
in between those two pieces and it
clamps down he presses a button and the
whole thing slides sideways and it comes
back and he takes that piece of wood out
and he puts another one in and does the
same thing over and over and over and
over again somewhat ironically perhaps
adding insult to injury for this
gentleman that machine is called the
unique 250
not entirely sure why all right so uh
machines change what we made but more
interestingly they changed how we make
them right prior to the arrival of
machines like with machine tools we tend
to do things in terms of measurement
right so here's an example this is a
table saw and you'll see right across
the bottom there's there's this moveable
fence that moves a distance from the
blade that's that spinning physics wheel
of death there and here's the ruler down
here for setting the fence right and so
what you would typically do is no I want
a piece that's five inches wide so I
move the fence over and I lock it down
and I slide pieces past there right so
you spend a bunch of time on machine
setup and then you run a bunch of pieces
and from a Productivity perspective
that's great you know you run a thousand
of them however many you need okay and
so most of the time when we work this
way we work in terms of measurements and
so this is a cut list which is all of
the pieces that you would need in this
case to build a particular shaker
blanket chest right we need front pieces
and side pieces and here are the
dimensions they should be and really
precise right this should be 9/16 of an
inch wide right and you take those
instructions over to your power tools
and you move all these levers with the
rulers and off you go this is not how we
used to do it this is a woodworker a
picture of a woodworker named Chris
Schwartz who's been really instrumental
in bringing back a lot of hand tool
techniques and he's using a tool called
a sector you can't get sectors anymore
you got to make them it's basically
these two pieces of wood hinged at the
bottom and periodically at equal
distance up each of them is a mark in a
number so they're just measured off in
some increments right in this particular
case what he's doing is taking this case
piece and he's trying to figure out how
many boards he needs to go across the
back and he wants to have six and he
wants them to be evenly sized so he
takes his sector and he spreads it out
so that the twelve at the end the mark
12 is put down in the back two corners
of the board then he comes down to the
mark two which is 1/6 of 12 and he sets
a pair of dividers to two
and if he takes those dividers and steps
off across that case it's going to come
out exactly at 6:00 he's just using
geometry instead of arithmetic right the
sector is a set of congruent triangles
right and there with predefined ratios
so he gets to exactly 1/6 of however
wide the cases he doesn't ever have to
know he'll use those dividers he'll mark
off the piece of wood he'll plane down
to the line they'll be the right size
neither he nor anyone else will ever
know how wide they actually are right we
used to work entirely in terms of
proportion this is a page taken from the
Chippendales director that would be the
original Chippendales director again
published in the 1700s and this was
essentially the catalog of furniture
that you might wish to acquire for your
estate if you were landed gentry because
let's face it the stuff was expensive
um the thing that's interesting about
this is this is basically the blueprint
and what do you not see on it any
dimensions any dimensions right there's
a little bit over here maybe a scale
that shows some relative stuff but
there's no dimensions on it and yet
someone could take this and make one of
these things and how could they do that
without their cut list the answer is
they based it on proportion and so you
could actually come in and say I want
one
you know this why'd I have this wall
come come see this wall and put a piece
of wood up here and Mark it and make me
one that why and they would scale
everything like SVG was the original
responsive design right that's what they
did and how did they know how to make
all the relative proportions there was a
whole scheme based on the classic orders
of architecture right this is the ionic
order it tells you over here it shows
you the proportion everything in terms
of the width of a column if you know the
width of the column you know everything
else even at the tippy-top which isn't
shown there it's shown here it's all
proportional to the width of the column
and this was general knowledge to the
people doing the work why was the class
order of architecture so important well
because the notion of beauty in Western
culture is really tied up in the notion
of proportion right rich actually
mentioned this last night with harmonica
talking about you know the full steps I
don't know a lot about music so I'm
gonna start using words wrong here right
but you said you know we're not going
any half steps because that's like crazy
noise we want nice sounding stuff and
you know harmonics I believe our whole
number ratios right in fact there's a
phrase of architecture is frozen music
and that's what it comes from there's a
less used phrase that describe Donald
swans music is defrosted architecture it
actually all comes from here right the
in you know ancient culture saw the
relative proportions of the human body
as the essence of beauty right the fact
that the human body by and large is is
proportional and so what we gained by
automation of making this furniture was
a tremendous amount of productivity and
economic benefit that made furniture
available for lots and lots of people
what we lost was working in a way that
correspondent with several thousand
years of construction practice driven by
the most basic notions of what's
beautiful now if you go to a museum that
has antique furniture most of it comes
from the period before when we switched
over to automated machines now maybe
that's just because it's old maybe it's
because they used up all the Honduran
mahogany bastards right
but maybe it's because it is actually
better that doesn't mean that doing the
automation is not good right it just
means that there was a price the good
news is that with the help of the
internet there's a lot of work being
done in the space and so for people who
are interested there's now more and more
material becoming available I like to
think of it as you know to paraphrase
Justin Timberlake we're bringing sectors
back
all right so that's enough about
furniture what about in software
development right here - the same thing
happens so I was working on a project
one day and one of the project managers
of my company came over and said it
really great this afternoon if he could
go help this guy not using names to
protect the guilty and uh
and I said yeah what's up and and she
said um he's been he's been trying to
build this test and he's been really
struggling with he's been working on it
for like most of the day and he says
it's untestable it's like untestable
okay that sounds challenging you know
I'll get a cup of coffee and I'll go see
him and sit down and talk and say all
right what is this thing that's
untestable like what's it do it's so
challenging it makes an HTTP request it
makes an HTTP request what's hard about
testing that I can't figure out the
right way to express it in cucumber it's
not that it's untestable it's that I
don't know how to write the test in the
test tool that I use so eight minutes
later we had another test that didn't
use that test tool but RAM is part of
the automated test process and tested it
it's a fascinating thing right I think
David said this before the tools that
you use shape how you look at the world
so for him a test was like it's got to
be in cucumber right that's not a
requirement of anything in the project
but that's how he looked at the world in
fact it's interesting along testing
lines how often you say to a fellow
developer hey does it work will the test
pass yeah it's not really the same thing
deployment is another great example I
said like I'm I'm 44 I've been doing
this 25 years now and I remember when
you didn't have a network to deploy with
and I remember when you had a network
but drizzling binaries across it would
be so damn slow right you carried it
over there but but you know stuff has
really changed here I was working on
another project with a guy and we had a
deployment system that assumed that you
know all you needed to carry to the
machine was the name of a git repo and
then you could get its contents and you
can find out its dependencies and get
all its dependencies right you know
where that doesn't work in a secure lab
where machines by default don't have
outbound access to the Internet and the
interesting thing was not that it was
that it really kicked him off it was
crazy to him it was going to take more
than a day for the people to wire up the
special pipe so our stuff could install
even like this is outrageous why was
there not just ubiquitous internet
connectivity
why would you want a secure machine not
connected to anything I think we have a
better sense of the answer to that
question now so this is again a real
perception change right like if someone
said you have to install your system on
you have to go install your software in
a box it's not plugged into anything
what would you do do your tools allow it
do they make it easy does everyone on
your team know how to do it right again
perception change as we automated
something development environments is
another huge one I spent many many years
I'm not ashamed to say working on a
little shame to say working in the
Microsoft environment and it's it's
interesting right visual studio the
Microsoft IDE for people who embrace it
is you know quite a productive
environment but it's an astonishing
thing one of the things that happen with
visual studio is that the the developer
base for Microsoft they really have
gotten to the point of feeling like this
is this is the only place stuff can come
from right if it's not in Visual Studio
it doesn't exist there is essentially no
open source world in the.net space to
speak of I mean there are projects
certainly right but there's not broad
adoption by developers because if it's
not a Visual Studio it doesn't exist
here's a crazy
it affects the Microsoft product teams
too if you make some cool new tech but
you can't figure out how to get in
Visual Studio it doesn't exist right you
won't get adoption I know it's hard to
imagine because working on the closure
side we don't know at all what it's like
to be married to a particular
environment where everything has to just
be key click away now Jennifer earlier I
guess yesterday did something very brave
she put was de LAN the screen right and
Wuzzles an amazing thing and she said it
wasn't meant for people to ripe why good
news for you it wasn't meant for people
to read either I love this cartoon where
did was still actually come from I'm
gonna jump back in the Wayback Machine
for a second but soap I'm gonna kind of
throw it all the dirty laundry here
right so the soap spec was written by
three companies Microsoft develop mentor
and userland
I worked a development or at that time
the motivation for doing soap originally
was that uh Microsoft had decom in their
RPC mechanism which was not internet
port friendly it was very promiscuous
with ports and so people instead were
using the web server is to drive content
through port 80 and that caused a lot of
friction inside Microsoft because the
guys who owned the web server the guys
threw in the middle where they write so
they the middleware guys were like well
we should do what they're doing we
should drive XML over port 80 and that's
really what was the you know initial
step towards soap and the thing that
happened along the way though was it was
really easy to say I've got some objects
in memory and I know how to write them
out right as soap messages but I got a
consume soap messages coming from
somewhere else and so I need to generate
some code that knows how to do that we
don't have a way to do that and so there
was all this talk in the community about
well what should we do should there be a
description language was taking a really
long time and so literally a couple
people took wisdom which was the
internal dispatch model for a particular
soap toolkit and said this is what we
should use right and they put it out in
the world
but you know the back of their mind and
this is the insidious thing about it
once as a product team you understand
that my engineers will only ever use the
IDE it frees you to do crazy complicated
things under the idea that the
development environment is always going
to protect you or protect them depending
how you look at it right
so I Got News for you perhaps.perhaps
bad news this is gonna be the first cons
where we'll still hits the screen twice
but you said you know and Jen
Jennifer's was little was so much nicer
so I generated this using the first
version of windows communication
foundation it was hard to fit on a slide
you might have trouble reading that this
describes a service with one endpoint
and do you know what the end point does
it echoes and look there it is this says
you're going to send an echo requesting
you're going to get an echo response out
and I know you're thinking well that's
cool I want to know what the echo
requests a response look like as
messages but that's actually to find on
other files okay here's the thing though
our industry went and did this to us as
engineers right and we let them because
we used a tool and had the thought that
it doesn't matter the tools going to
take care of us right and we spent I
don't know I've worked in the soap space
for most of ten years I think of it now
it was like a it's like a giant train
wreck and it's one of those long long
Wyoming coal trains is like four miles
long and there's a train wreck down here
and at the other end there's a factory
making train cars I don't know when this
thing is done alright so so just a
couple more quick examples the entire
stack this floored me I worked on a
project recently for a customer doing a
proof of concept and we delivered this
thing it took us like eight weeks it
wrote a reasonable amount of data to the
database like a at a pretty high rate of
speed and it analyzed the ball on the
fly and presented it and we demoed it
for him and the business loved it and
they had to sort of review the
architecture and what did they really
want to do and one of the pieces of
feedback that came back to us via back
channels was there were people in the in
the organization who didn't understand
how it could do this right because it
you know because we were using esoteric
things like like queues and and they
didn't understand how they could do it
buttons this is the astonishing part to
me instead of saying wow that's really
interesting tech how did you guys do
that like we had a couple sit downs with
people we offered more and ultimately
some of the feedback from people was
like we don't think it's real and it's
an amazing thing to me can you look at
your tools ago I so believe that this is
the way that if someone does something I
don't know how to do with these tools
then they're making it up
it's amazing the last example I have is
a really explicit example of changing
how you look at the world it's the
notion of software factories I don't
know how many of you know that term
it was blessedly short-lived the idea
was that some expert would configure a
tool like eclipse or Visual Studio to
make apps a certain way because it was
right and that your job would be to work
the object Stamper on the third ship
next week so that kind of went away but
it has sort of another form one thing
that you can't help but notice and I'm
sure all of you have had this question
when you when you talked about closure
work someone's like what's the killer
app you know going back know one you say
well what's the killer app of C++ and
the thing about killer apps is once you
start using a tool that builds killer
apps you start to think that every
problem right is that killer apps the
perfect solution killer apps are like
hey man this is the perfect way to build
this thing and now every problem I see
is that one right there are a lot of
examples of that I mean it's funny
because we say wait when all you have is
a hammer everything looks like a nail
and it's totally true now our chisel
alright so this begs the interesting
question
you know Automation I again I'm going to
repeat I am NOT against automation
automation provides productivity
benefits full stop no doubt but
automation also changes our perspective
of the problem the world we're working
in and how we attack what it is we're
trying to do so while there's a lot of
benefit if we're doing the same thing
over and over again I think it's
interesting to ask the question what
happens if you want to make something
unique how do you use automated tools to
make something unique you don't you go
back to simple hand tools so here are
two examples
artisans right and programmers love this
analogy in general right I want to think
of what I do as artisanal right I want
to create things that are useful but
also pleasing and if that means it takes
an extra couple years oh it's better
right we don't want these machines to
influence what we do we're willing to
use the machines for the rough stuff but
by and large we want to like really
craft this a great example of a guy who
had this opinion is James credit who's
is certainly in the running for
the most important American furniture
maker in the last 50 years
he was really upfront about the fact
that he was never going to compromise on
his art he built pieces like this the
thing was though he knew that what he
was doing was not about productivity and
not even about economic viability I love
that he wrote a book called the
impractical cabinet maker to be honest
right and he ended up starting a school
to actually support himself for at least
the significant portion of his career so
I think that um a lot of times we talk
about artisan ship and and people talk
about guilds and Prentiss ship and all
this stuff and it's a very romanticized
vision of what that means the romance
starts with it but I get to keep my
salary right so I actually think this is
the wrong example but I do think there's
a very particular artisan that we're
like these are the pattern makers if
you're going to get productivity with
machines you have to be able to build
the machines you got to start somewhere
so even with the rise of machines there
was a branch of woodworking called
pattern making what the pattern makers
did was create wooden models of the
parts that went in the machine and the
models were used to make the molds into
which molten metal was poured to cast so
these guys were super skilled super
high-value tons of leverage off what
they did because it enabled the machines
to happen right so you look at that it
looks actually like a bit of rusty iron
it's actually wood so is that one and
that one right these are handmade models
of gears that are going to drive the
machines that drive everything else now
you're looking at this going yeah Tim
that's great they make round gears no no
they make straight gears too you know
what else they make small engines yeah
this is actually pretty modern one
that's a wooden model for a pump wood is
still in many cases the best material
for delivering to a forge to make a mold
this will ultimately ultimately be
replaced by stuff that gets 3d printed
but today this is still state-of-the-art
this one's not done entirely by hand it
was done with a computer-controlled
router but all of the finishing and you
know smoothing everything out and the
rest of it is by hand right so this is
not you know going to continue forever
but this is the way that it has been
done for the last hundred years I think
that's who we are
right I think we are software pattern
makers we create the unique parts that
allow the software machines that power
our businesses or our organizations or
whatever else we do right and ultimately
this is what brings me back to closure
and closes the loop on this hand tool
metaphor right
I want tools that enable me to do unique
things that don't change my perspective
or don't you know change my perspective
without adding significant value and I
believe closure is a perfect toolset for
doing this so now this begs a question
there's another reason that we automate
stuff not just productivity we automate
for convenience to the closure
development environment or a closure
development environment existed the day
that closure shipped rich gave us the
repple and the compiler and we use stuff
from the Java ecosystem right we used
maven we use jar use what have you lots
of you started back then right there
were a lot of rough edges you know
there's a lot of extra things to do and
a lot of work has been done since then
to automate pieces of that and make it
far easier and that is a good thing
right because it helps drive adoption I
work at cognate echt certainly wanted
option of the closure stack right it's
made it easier for people to get started
but like all automation there's a cost
somewhere now I'm not going to claim
that I know what the cost is I have on
the next slide a proposal for what the
cost might be but I think this question
is really worth
thinking about so here's what I think it
might be if you go into a line again
project file and add a line right add a
new dependency line again we'll fetch
that the next time it's needed because
you're starting to wrap up or what have
you and it'll tell you right you can
always run a command line and have line
you can tell you exactly what it is you
depend on but you're going to see it
that first time when it comes down right
you're going to kick off a ripple that
stuff's mostly hidden now you don't see
a class path anymore
you might ultimately generate a jar
right and the mechanics of that are are
you know it's just taken care of for you
the files that are downloaded are no
longer to Lib directory in your project
they're off in your maven repo so
increasingly the things that we saw as
like hey these are all the things I use
to do what I do there's fewer and fewer
signs of them right in your face from
the environment you're working in again
you can get them right you can run line
depths tree you can generate a jar and
look inside it the question is do you
and if you don't the further question is
do you actually know what you ship and
the further question beyond that is
should you know what you ship I'm pretty
sure about the answer the last one again
I'm not saying this is you know
happening in the world I just think it's
worth looking at all of the things like
we've had great talks this week a lot of
people talking about hey I've got this
great thing it automates this it's
fantastic for this region or the other
and I don't mean to sound like a wet
blanket but there's always that other
question which is how does it change how
I look at the world right I've said a
couple times I spent a long time working
in the oo world and stacking all kinds
of stuff on top of an aspect-oriented
all kinds of class libraries and object
models and ioc the injection of
complexity and all that stuff and
and I will forever be grateful to rich
for giving us a tool set that is
merciless below mercilessly and
mercifully simple its merciless in its
pursuit of simplicity and in giving us
that its merciful toss so you see the
world through your tools simple tools
give you a broader perspective you can
automate things but the more you do it
the less clearly you see the world so be
mindful when you automate and know your
tools thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
