around so this is the more philosophical
talk as well to the titles I couldn't
decide some of them were semi cranky in
those employments and then war can be a
great a great feat or line because so
this is about step one this is this is
just an experience report it's not
advocacy there's a little methodology
here or science or anything else so I'd
like you to try think about when was the
last time that you thought about
something for an entire hour like nobody
bothered you and you had an idea and you
sat for an hour thought about how about
for a whole day does everybody remember
less than a second thought about
something for a whole day
however over a course of a month we had
something you're working on and
obviously not spending all the time
every day when you start staying into a
month or a year these are tremendously
valuable moments if you get to have them
at all
I consider myself extremely lucky to
have had the ability to think about
probably three different things for a
year or more one of them is closure
and there's nothing I prize more than
that kind of time the other thing I'd
ask is what was less than that you felt
confident trying to do something you had
never done before
and what do you think it takes to become
confident in turn something you've never
done before right obviously a software
developers a lot of times we're doing
the umpteenth application that takes
something out of a database and puts it
on the web
but the lucky you are luckier you are
the more likely you are to encounter
problems you've never done before and
how do you end up you know how do you
start doing that and not feel incredibly
at risk so sorry about sit by talking
about some software development you know
things we all know to be true right we
hate bugs and our programs of trying to
write quality programs and we know if we
let the programs reach the field it's
incredibly expensive to you know fix
inadequacies and the artists in the
program
right so we say okay we'll have a big
testing process and quality assurance
and even that we know is not so great
because the sort of has this removal you
know this distance from the development
effort which is not good so now we know
we know what to do in this area right we
fix bugs while we're coding by testing
and development and this is the best way
to avoid bugs in our applications right
no answer kids did you notice that I
learned how to make each bullet this
menu item no definitely absolutely
positively not the least expensive place
to fix bugs is when you're designing
your software which everybody does yes
right I will contend of all the things
I'm saying here watch it which are very
very extremely fuzzy that without a
doubt most of the big problems we have
with software our problems of
misconception we don't have a good idea
of what we're doing before we do it and
then go go go go and we do everything
you know we have practices and all kinds
of stuff and we feel really good about
ourselves after that point but if you
mess it up you know as Mark said in step
one it is not going to turn out they're
not problems of implementation there are
problems of implementation obviously and
testing and other things help with those
but problems of misconception are not
generally addressed by testing or type
systems or the things we use to correct
defects and implementation right there
aren't really type systems I can tell us
if we've got a good idea
or what we're doing
addresses that idea so I'm going to talk
a little bit about analysis and design I
know that so nineties and ugly and was
rightfully you know criticized and
really dropped because you know people
considered it to be about process and
drawing pictures and you know knowing
everything about everything and making
comprehensive plans and the waterfall
model and there was amazing amounts of
stuff that was terrible about this but
that doesn't mean that the the step
before go do it is not an important step
and I think we don't spend enough time
and energy or or make enough time or get
allocated time you know it may not be a
matter of our choice if we say we'd like
to spend some time thinking about it but
we have to ship something next week but
we are definitely suffering in quality
because we we don't spend the time here
and so I'd like to do is sort of just
whatever you think analysis in the
design is like you just forget for the
moment let's try to make a really simple
definition analysis and design is about
two things identifying some problem that
we're trying to solve and assessing our
proposed solution in terms of whether or
not it solves that problem that's really
what it's about
about anything else right we should be
solving problems but we should not be
building features there's nothing about
the feature what is feature
features just an attribute of something
is the shiny you know chrome knob on
something it's not the purpose of the
car there's no guarantee you if you put
together a feature list even if it comes
from the customer that is going to solve
their own problem or that solves any
problem or that the features when you
put them together don't introduce a
whole ton of other problems right so
programming and writing software is not
about completing this features in
particular features provided by users in
spite of their best efforts to satisfy
themselves or often really not good
ideas and you've got to dig underneath
it and figure out what problem they have
and what's the best solution to it and
then reconcile it with whatever they
asked for we also have a tendency
because we're we're all smart and we
love being smart and sort of figuring
out how to make things go that you know
figuring out how to make something go is
good no matter what it took to do it
right so if we can find a way to get
around a problem we're like whoo that's
great and it's not great right or
voiding problems which we're all capable
of doing very capable of doing isn't the
same as solving them so we should really
try to support on solving problems and
the thing I'm going to talk about today
is really that there there's a bunch of
technique and
skill to solving problems and the first
one is just to make an effort to
understand the problem you're working on
to recognize identify it put it
somewhere and talk about it so problem
solving is definitely a skill I think
you know you shouldn't take away from
this talk that you know there's a
certain kind of person who's like good
at problem solving and they get to do
this part of the job and then we can
practice these other things you can
practice this part
Polya wrote this amazing book called how
to solve it in 1945 or something which
is about how to practice how to practice
and what are the techniques
sobbing math problems in this case and
it's a terrific book full of great
insight and if you've never read it go
on to Amazon right after my talk and
order yourself I'm happy
one of the things that's not so great
about the book is that it is in the math
space right and in that space this is
really nice thing that happens when
you're done and you think you have an
answer if you have all the techniques of
mathematical proof to determine if you
actually have where as a software
developers you don't have that right
there's no way to prove that you have
solution to somebody's ecommerce site
problem right there's no mathematical
techniques and there's not going to be
any anytime soon that will let us do
that but it is a skill and it is
something you can practice this
something you can learn about and and
it's worth doing right because as human
beings we get good at what we practice
it doesn't matter what it is it's
amazing examples of people practicing
things that they seem to have no
potential hope to become good at and
they get good at it because they
practiced it if you practice problem
solving really practice a problem
solving you will get good at it if you
practice methodology X you will get good
at that and I'd like you to ask yourself
where do you think there's more leverage
I don't care what X is pick any X you
want would you rather be good at it or
the general skill of solving problems
so what do we need to do if we're going
to work on solving problems what what is
what is the activity like the first
thing is to actually say I am solving
this problem this problem is this bla
bla bla bla bla and therefore a bla I
have seen so much software made where no
one ever said that no one ever wrote
that down and then we have the whole
system and no one said what problem is
supposed to solve if we're not solving
problems I have no idea why we're in
this room we absolutely should be
working on solving problems which means
we should be we should be enumerated our
and then from the mental standpoint
which I'll talk about a little bit later
it is actually important to say them out
loud right as the person who's trying to
solve a problem say say have a
conversation with somebody in your group
and say we need to solve this the
problem the problem is you know rants or
talk and you have a little conversation
or write it down but just like you use
the you know the practice of repeating
somebody's name or introducing them as a
mnemonic to help you remember their name
it's the same thing this is the seed of
solving the problem is stating it so the
next the next part which is definitely
trigger and Polly's book is great and
it's got a lot of practical things
many of these are overlap what he said
is to understand the problem right so so
we said we have this problem I think we
need a no single database right there's
something missing
we have this problem we need a no single
day to ransom we haven't actually said
you know why what are the
characteristics of this problem to lead
us to this solution space and and this
is where all the interesting work is I
think in software development right and
so the first step is what do you know
about what you're trying to do there's
definitely gonna be a bunch of facts
there will be customer requirements
there will be other things they'll be
contact steal the system has run on this
kind of box has to run for this long it
can consume more more than this many
watts or has to support than 10 million
users whatever it is there are those
kinds of things and constraints all this
stuff or facts you know about what
you're supposed to do right there will
be things that right away you know you
don't know right I wonder where we're
going to get you know the inference of
data as an input to this thing what
we're going to do when our main data
source word is isn't available do we
have a secondary thing there'll be
things like that of course there will be
things that you don't know or you don't
know well that's fair but if there's
things you don't know
you should think about them now the
other thing to do is to say everybody
says doing X I have this great idea for
X if you know that you're the only
person in the world ever had this
problem self that's very very unlikely
so go find some other solutions to
similar problems you know are there any
others that you know about and what can
you find out about them because looking
at other solutions the same problem is
the number one way to get up to speed
really quickly and start working ahead
of you know the best known solutions in
this space and then because what you'll
have to do that will just be an
incremental step above what the last guy
did but if you're ignoring what the last
guy did you're starting from scratch so
you definitely want to look around in
the space all right now I'm not
advocating a methodology or anything but
if you're going to bother to do all this
work you should write it down somehow
some way I don't care about the other
thing you have to do is you have to be
discerning yep that you have to be
critical and we're at sort of in this
world because this Willis community
stuff and it's like I just hear awesome
it's like awesome happy I just heard
like 50 times a day not everything is
awesome all right and so it's hard to
talk about other people's stuff not
being awesome so just I mean mainly
focus on your own stuff in particular as
you're finding solutions I should try to
you know enumerate a solution to a
problem look for defects in your own
solution and of course you have a whole
talk about this because there will be
there will be technical errors there
will be errors in logic they'll also be
errors of taste and judgment and
abstraction and all those kinds of
things it all feeds into this and
entire talk in this this area but
whatever issues you can find in your own
solutions try to solve those two right
away upfront if you've added so the
other thing you see is we're gonna do
this oh he's using Ossie Davis oh that's
great it has these Co 10 attributes is
awesome it's really easy to get excited
about the good parts of what you do but
you should be looking for trade-offs the
chances of there being no trade-offs in
any solution are slim the other thing is
just this again this what what don't you
know that if if there's stuff you know
you don't know there are questions you
should be asking in order to find out
what you don't know you don't know
everything so there should be question
marks on the whatever it is you want to
use that you're going to write all this
stuff down there should be question
marks on that page if there are no
question marks you're missing the step
the other thing is to think about none
of us are born knowing how to write
software none of us are born knowing
about sequel or the characteristics of
the web or the protocols or anything
else
and if you're trying to solve the
problem especially in a space where you
haven't done it before you're going to
have a very limited ability to come up a
solution if you don't have a lot of
input you're going to need to get a lot
of different inputs so that you can let
your brain go around between them and
say oh yeah this idea and that idea are
connected to each other and therefore I
can do this other thing
if you only take a really narrow slice
of I see exactly what I'm doing right
now right the second to deliver next
week you're not going to have enough
inputs to make decisions so you want to
read about the kind of space that you're
in widely all right very specifically
with us other people try to do exactly
the same thing and then broadly there's
other characteristic problems and maybe
even if you want go try to find research
papers that are kind of in the same
space it's amazing the cool things you
can find by searching something like ACM
4 papers about the kind of it's like
we can get a certain kind of hash code
that does whatever you go into google
type hash code that does whatever enter
and if there's some scholarly and ACM
references grab those papers even if you
only understand like a tiny fraction of
the paper it's likely to contribute to
your ability to think about your problem
the other thing is even if you're not
going to tell the other guy when you're
looking at other solutions be extremely
critical I can't tell you how often
you're going to find the next best idea
by completely crucifying the last guy's
idea at least in your own head all right
take it apart right because when you
take it apart you're going to find a
couple of things maybe they didn't write
down when they were doing it so
everybody says designs about trade offs
everybody knows this right
but usually want to talk about
trade-offs in their software let's talk
about the parts of their software that
suck I had to make these trade-offs that
is not what a trade-off it is right you
have to look at at least two solutions
to your problem at least two and you
have to figure out what's good and bad
about those things right before you can
say I made a trade-off so I really
recommend that you do that and when you
do it you might want to write that down
somewhere okay so let's talk a little
bit more about practice a big part of
trying to do this work is maintaining
your focus we had a really nice talk
yesterday about flow and that that is a
kind of a focus related concept and when
you're trying to do design work you also
need I think some of the most extreme
focus you're going to ever need and so
there's some cool aspects to the havoc
one of the cool aspects to a hammock
that you can go on a hammock and you can
close your eyes and no one knows that
you're not sleeping but they won't
bother you because they think you might
be sleeping so it's it's very cool
computers are bad bad sources of
distraction they're so bad especially
for people like us something else
besides what I'm trying to think about
you desperately need to get away from
the computer if you're trying to focus
this it's almost impossible to focus
sitting at a computer the other thing
about focus is that you are going to be
making trade-offs when you try to focus
really intensely your gun to drop balls
you're going to miss calling people back
and responding to emails and doing your
slides for conferences and
the airport all the way there things
like that that's just the game the one
thing though is that you should
communicate to people that you care
about about this process and the fact
that when you're doing it you're going
to seem pretty far away and that's not a
comment about the person that you're you
know your care about it's just the
nature of doing this kind of work so it
is important to sort of do it a lot of
people will not get time to do this all
day every day or over the course of an
entire week or if you're going to get
some focus time you define what that is
you know everybody knows about timeout
time for little kids and what program
isn't this focused I'm like look kids I
need to go sit on the hammock and have
nobody bother them
so for me personally I think that that
the process involves two parts of your
mind and this is stuff that you're
seeing those books written about this
and whatever I haven't read them but but
they seem to correspond to my personal
experience which is that you sort of
have this waking line and background
line and you're waking mind is really
good at that criticizing part it's
extremely analytical and it's very very
good at tactics right right now we need
to make a decision you know the lion is
chasing after us jump left we are really
good at that that's what our waking mind
is about keeping us alive and making
short-term decisions and looking at the
immediate leap present information and
doing something about it however if you
think you're going to sit down and look
at a problem for the first time and
stare at your computer and do whatever
and have a conversation for 10 minutes
and make a really great decision I don't
think so
I know I can't do that definitely not
the problem with this kind of thing is
it tends to push uphill who I see this
movie that always okay here I have a
choice left and right okay go right
that's more up left to right it's right
they left that's more up more up it's
this part of your thinking is really
good at finding the local maximum but
it's not very good and getting off the
track it's on and finding the fact that
there's another hill over there that
really takes you higher
but this is a very very printable
activity that you have to engage in I
think if you want to use your entire
brain and become very good at
problem-solving and that is to think
about using your waking time to assign
tasks to your background line to
actually think hard about something and
create work for your background line
that really is the point of the hammock
and all this listing and all this we're
going to talk about you're going to do
when you're awake is actually to to give
the other half of you stuff to do the
other good thing about your waking mind
is when you when you do think you have a
great idea that you come up with in your
background line your waking line is good
at picking the other part saying you
know you thought you woke up with this
brilliant idea but now I'm seeing this
this characteristic of it seems not so
bright
so let's talk about the background line
I'm not going to directly equate it with
the sleeping mind but the sleeping line
is the number one instance of a
background mind you can find access to
your wrapper online during the day while
you're awake but it's tricky it's good
at making connections right the kind of
thing like if I leave my if I make a Hut
out of mud and it rains hard it will
disintegrate is not necessarily the kind
of thing that you can tactically figure
out you or your background mind is going
to know sort of aspects of all those
different components that make the
connections and synthesize them even
when you think you're really hot at
making decisions on the fly you're
almost always just regurgitating
something your background might has
already figured out so the background
light is good at synthesizing things
it's about it's good about strategy
right and so when mark talks about new
abstractions and things like that
abstractions are our software strategy
right because the idea there is you're
making some super global decision that's
going to need to be correcting a whole
bunch of contexts in which you can't
make tactical decisions yet right what
does it mean to make an abstraction
you're going to drop drive libraries
from you know what does it mean to put
something in a programming language well
I had no idea what you guys are going to
do about you know with it right it's a
it's a more strategic kind of thing you
don't build a programming layers and say
how will this programming language deal
with HTTP requests what you want to do
is give mark something that he can use
and when he's got a tactical decision
make about HTTP requests and that's a
strategic kind of thinking and your
background line is good at strategic
thinking if you want to do abstraction
you have to find time to do this thing
because that's the part of your brain it
comes from right it does abstraction it
draws analogies right I think this is
where you solve most non-trivial
problems okay you can make good
decisions in the moment otherwise but if
you really try to solve something hard
you've got to engage the other half of
your of your head so I'm not just saying
the scientific America say that when
we're sleeping we process the
information during the day because
that's pretty obvious but that sleep
reinforces memory which is good I mean
it is important to remember what you're
working on but more importantly it is a
great sorter out of things so we had
this whole I say I just advocated taking
a lot of input my taking a lot of it but
doing all this analysis of the
requirements in the space right doing
you know all the reading looking at you
know competitive solutions and tearing
them apart that's this is ton of stuff
when you're going to decide what about
that is important what is it when you're
asleep and that's what happens
evolution has solved this problem for us
and that's the solution it came up with
we can't ignore it we have to use it but
the most critical thing is this one
finding hidden relations and solving
problems we were working on so imagine
somebody says I have this problem this
that and you look at it for ten minutes
and say okay I'm going to go after the
movies and do something else then you go
to sleep you're going to solve that
problem your sleep no or you're off and
you didn't think about it did you no you
didn't think about it you didn't think
about it hard enough
while you were awake for it to become
important to your mind when you were
asleep and this goes back to that
feeding your background mind thing you
really do have to work hard just think
not typing it in just thinking about a
problem during the day so that it
becomes an agenda item for your
background line that's how it works
right it's when people were out there
and they're like oh my god how am I
going to find food and this is happening
there but I know I saw help over there
they seem to be by the water sometimes
or whatever that's when you wake up as a
caveman and say let's go hunt for the
animals by the water it's not a logical
deduction it seems like that when your
foreground - or
lysing it but there's no logic for that
necessarily it's really a process of
this very parallel kind of thinking so
this is very important so we have a
problem in general because we right
we're just being cast right so for those
more and more complex as time goes by
and and we know there's a seven plus or
minus two sort of working memory limit I
and as smart as any of us are we all
suffer from the same limit but the
problems that we're you know called upon
to solve are much bigger than that
normal so what do we do if we can't fit
the whole thing in our head at the same
time how can we work on a problem with
more than nine components right what I'm
going to recommend is that you write all
the bits down especially now you've
written a lot about the problem right
you know what the problem is you know a
lot of facts about it you know
constraints about where it runs you know
you don't know you've asked yourself
those questions you wrote them down I
wish I do blog you looked at competitive
things and said that works great over
here but that part of that competitive
thing sucks
I hate that I wish that wasn't there you
gave this huge agenda to your background
line and when you're trying to load it
up you need to survey and that's the
point of writing it all down before if
you've written all the stuff down
including some sketch of how you want to
problem you can go and just sort of jump
around and look at that and sort of like
you know how many balls can you juggle
well you can only gentle something I can
juggle at all
but if we look at the seven plus or
minus two thing to say we can juggle
seven to nine balls but if you can
imagine having an assistant who every
now and then can take one of those out
and put a different color in then you
could juggle balls of twenty different
colors at the same time as long as there
were only nine in the air and any one
point in time and that's what you're
doing you're going to sort of look
around at all these pieces and shift
arbitrary shapes of seven into your head
at different points in time
maybe you'll draw pictures don't use
that you'll melt it's not a methodology
so go over and over but then you must
again step away from the computer
there's another really important
important part of doing this which is to
go and sit somewhere and have no input
and close your eyes and not go to sleep
close your eyes because we have this
other thing right everybody knows what
it is it's really hard to describe but
does everybody have a concept of their
own their minds I write what you see
when you close your eyes and you start
thinking about something it's this weird
I mean is that actually technically
visual though some people are really
vibrantly visual I know for me it's I
don't know I can't describe it but it's
not
realistic but you need to do that that
that part is important for your brain
because at that point you're switching
out of sort of an input reception motor
if you're just looking at your lists
you're sort of in the mode of I'm
getting input but when you're sitting
and contemplating something and hashing
it over in your head you don't have any
other input which means you're
exercising the recall I had looked at
those 20 points let's say it was just 20
I looked at those 20 points over and
over and over again and I jumped around
with it put between them now I close my
eyes and I'm trying to recall them and
think about them a little bit more in my
head and you're going to find if you've
done the last step going over and over
you will actually be able to sit on a
hammock and pull all the different parts
of a fairly large problem in an
aggregate admittedly maybe one at a time
and think of a thing about them that way
that exercise is really really important
I don't know why it just is because it
forces this recall thing that definitely
makes those things agenda items for your
background line so we'll call that
mind's eye time now you're done
cake is in the oven you just have to
wait it's so good
and and and one of the things I would
say is at least wait overnight no matter
how ill you you and your buddies talked
about it and you like you just feel like
such a hotshot today I have got this
thing you know sleep on it at least one
night at least if it's an important
decision now how many people woke up
this morning with the answer to a hard
problem
is a science science at work no it's
really kind of an unfortunate thing if
you're not thinking about this do you
think what happened I worked hard all
day right who I've done working time to
relax unfortunately if you if you
believe in what I'm saying today you're
actually doing something kind of
important when you're sleeping so
occasionally you really have to give
your brain a chance to do that other
part of the job
if you always deny it I don't think
you're going to have the best results
unfortunately sometimes overnight is not
not enough some big problems especially
finding really good abstractions or
finding answers to things that satisfy a
bunch of simultaneous constraints take a
long time it just does and I'm I know
everybody has to ship and everything
else in that case a lot of what I'm
saying doesn't apply and like I said
before I consider it a huge opportunity
when I get an extended amount of time to
think about a problem because I know it
I'll come up with a better answer but
one of the ways you can deal with this
and not get stymied by well let me just
think about that for three months
because most managers are not incredibly
receptive to that sentence is to just
work on more than one thing right not
inside one day okay try to work on one
thing each day but if over the course of
time you have like three projects right
it's quite possible to load one up and
work on it for three days and find
you're not finding answers to any of
your question mark items or able to
enumerate new possibilities so you kind
of stuck a little bit just switch to
another project and do that for a few
days you have to advertise the loading
up time it can take between an hour and
an entire day to load up something so
once you've done that you try to get at
least the rest of the day or three days
or more on it
but don't get don't get hung up about
the stuck thing just switch don't stay
stuck switch or get morning but talk
about it more
you keep stimulating the pathway don't
don't say stuck on but yeah then
eventually cake comes out of the other
you wake up and you have a great idea
you think you know the answer to your
problem or you have a good idea for a
solution unfortunately sometimes you
have an answer to that not the problem
you were working on you're working on
three projects and you're loaded up the
project C and you woke up with the
answer to project a that has to be okay
right you just just switch and take
advantage of it at least capture it
right if you wake up with an answer to
some other thing that you can't work on
that day capture the results of this
background process they're really useful
finally you do have to take your great
ideas and figure out if they're actually
great by either analyzing the more which
is certainly important but sometimes you
have to write them and type them into
your computer actually we all have to do
this so you do eventually have the code
it's fun Stu has this great sense he's
seen some of my design
sheets and document of despair or
something it's like it seemed to be all
like hey we can't do this this doesn't
work like that question marks blah blah
this other thing it was just like a
whole it's all negative but it's all
challenges to the problem-solving
process it's not like it's not
despairing it's positive it's saying I
know what my challenges are and
therefore I can work out but you spit
this thing out now you have something so
you tried it you try to try to avoid a
lot of typing I know I do because if I
think I've got an answer and the answer
is small that's one of the most telling
attributes that is probably good
and what I would hope from doing this
whole process is that you gain
confidence in it after you've seen it
work for you
so that you say you know what I have
never done this before but I really have
thought about it and and this solution I
came up with overnight feels awesome and
whoo
let's go it is important to look at what
you did and to run it and see and find
out new things about the solution and
say I you know I had the supposition
it's not correct I thought it would have
this characteristic it doesn't et cetera
et cetera I am not advocating a
waterfall model you're going to try
stuff and go back that's fine but don't
lean on this right test-driven dentistry
I don't think I could come up with a
better thing right we can't really do
that the last thing is you are going to
be wrong I'm frequently wrong that's
part of the game you're going to think
of better ideas I think that's one of
the most exciting things I think no
matter of what I've ever thought of the
fact that I know I'm going to think of
something better as much as it will suck
a little bit because I
sometimes the best means that I'm still
going it's still working so you will
think of better ideas also the facts
change you can change because of two
reasons right one you missed some of
them early on so they're due to you
because you skip them what else do we
have changing requirements right this
just you know we all know this the facts
will change when the facts change do not
dig in do it over again and see if your
answer is still valid in the context of
the new requirements and new facts and
if it isn't change your mind and don't
apologize sometimes you'll just make
mistakes errors in logic or you know
miss you know you just you just get it
wrong that's fine if I could advocate
anything
do not be afraid especially do not be
afraid of being wrong so in summary this
is a ramp
there's no sir
I have two minutes for questions yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
