here to talk to you about cursive as
usual my favorite topic of conversation
so for those of you who aren't familiar
with cursive it's not EE for developing
enclosure code and I'm still working on
it it hasn't had a version one release
yet but it's getting very close to a
version one although admittedly I used
the slide at the college last year
almost this exact same slide so who
knows maybe next year I'll be back with
the same slide we'll see but I hope not
so the first public beta was about
eighteen months ago and there's been a
really great response since then there's
there's a lot of people using there's a
ton of people using cursive every day to
do the work and it's yes had a really
great response it's a plug-in to
IntelliJ at the moment so for those who
aren't familiar with IntelliJ it's a
Java IDE I think it's the best Java IDE
it's been around for years and the
jetbrains the company of the maker is
full of really smart people so
intelligible product they have it used
to be purely commercial and now they
have a split the IntelliJ community
edition there's open source it's all
apache license you can do what you want
with it and that has Java so all the
sort of base Java support that you need
maven and all the build tools get all
that stuff and then the Community
Edition sorry the Ultimate Edition
builds on top of there and it has a
bunch of closed source components for
j2ee and a lot of web dev stuff and wet
but cursive works fine with the free
edition you can just download the free
one and it'll work fine with that
so IntelliJ always always been jetbrains
flagship product but a couple of years
ago they split it out in two and they
made it basically into like an IDE
building platform and then the Java idea
was really just to sort of plug in into
that like any other plugin so it's still
a somewhat blessed special plugin but
it's that's more or less than what it
works and then JetBrains went on to
build a bunch of different ideas on top
of that so they have ideas for Ruby for
Python for PHP Objective C C++ they just
released the other day and so cursive I
will actually be able to release a
standalone IDE as well so it'd just be a
single thing you download for Windows
Mac and Linux and it'll be like a
lightweight standalone closure focused
IDE it is going to be commercial I will
be asking for your money
I'm just so dick it out of the way
upfront
and it'll be it'll cost more or less the
same as the smaller JetBrains ATVs so
I'm here specifically today to talk
about the debugger so IntelliJ it's
obviously been a Java ready forever so
they've been debugging Java code for for
a very long time so they have a
basically JVM debugger built in so you
can use it for Scala for any it for a
groovy any of the jvm languages it
supports and encourages specific
functionality it's based on the J PDA
which is the so the JVM actually
provides really really good debugging
facilities the J PDA is the Java
platform debugger architecture and the
specific component that has a whole
bunch of different components and the
specific one it uses is the JDI so
that's a series of java classes that you
can use to write debugging tools in Java
so one questions a lot of people ask is
why would I need it if I get if I have a
ripple write and and I do think it's
true that the ripple fulfills a lot of
the need that people previously use the
debugger for so if you're using
something like Java for example the
language is quite static and you compile
it up front and then you execute it and
the only way that you can really stop
your program and kind of look inside it
and see what's going on is with the
debugger and was really the only way you
could explore the execution of your
program so I do think it's true that
some of the use case that people
previously used to bug is for you can
now use a ripple for so particularly if
you you know you're working in the
ripple you're developing small functions
you can test them all independently and
then you can compose them together and
test the the larger blobs that
previously people might have used the
debugger for that and now obviously the
ripple fills that need but some code is
just really really hard to explore in
the ripple so and my work for example
cursive builds on the IntelliJ framework
that's like there's millions of lines of
Java code it's all stateful that's
mutable and it's just really really hard
to explore on a ripple so I mean I do
have a ripple on my open IntelliJ
instance and I can play around with
theirs and I can test things but it's
not the same as if all the code was
closure that I wrote myself and I think
the same is probably true of very large
closure code bases so those of you
working in large companies multiple
developers maybe you don't understand
ponen written by somebody else works in
my case somebody else is myself three
months ago and I still can't figure out
how it works half the time so no cursive
has a lot of different components so I
work on one and then I work on something
totally different for three months and I
have to go back to the previous one and
just stepping through it is just much
easier and problems with concurrency and
much much easier to debug than to them
and the ripple I mean sometimes you just
need to be able to stop the world you
can look at all the threads you can see
what your threads are doing you can see
how they're interacting that's much more
difficult to do to doing a ripple and
the other argument is that maybe a
debugger stops people thinking about
their problems and they just fire up the
debugger instead of thinking about it
I'm a huge fan of thinking I think
myself I recommend you all think as well
but sometimes it's not enough right it
doesn't matter how long I'm in a hammock
I'm never going to understand I'm never
gonna burst and the IntelliJ framework
any better it's only documented at a
very superficial level and its massive
it's just enormous so rather than
actually just talking about a debugger
which is kind of boring I thought I
would show you a debugger which is much
more exciting for all involved so I have
some example code here this is an
example taken from the joy of closure I
have - I had some examples from the joy
of closure and close your programming
find books both I recommend them so this
is one from the joy of closure just
looking up a chess board so we have some
code here this is a representation of a
chess board just a victor with a series
of characters and the characters the
positions and the victor represent the
piece that set that board and then we
have this function look up here which
takes we can see how it's used down here
so it takes a position and cheers'
notation and it will tell you what it is
so we can place a line breakpoint here
hopefully and then we can just run this
as a script and debug it
and it stops there so no muss no fuss
that's very easy so I'm in the interest
of time there's a lot to talk about I'm
going to assume that most of you have
probably at least seen a debugger or
perhaps used by on the society by go
before so I'll go through this pretty
quickly so down here on the on the lis
we have the thread view so this is the
stack of execution that shows how we got
to where we are at the moment for those
of you with morbid fears a jar of Java
stack traces this is where they come
from and you can see that this is
actually pretty similar it has all the
same information that you were getting a
stack trace so the method the line
number and so on here you can look at
all the different threads and here
there's only a couple here cuz it's just
a script but in a larger application you
can see all the threads here you can
flip between the threads and see what
the thread of execution is it's quite
useful the other nice thing here is you
can see that these ones here have have a
kind of yellowish color I'm actually
color blind so I'm assuming this
yellowish but this color here anyway
this is lines of execution that are not
in your program so these white ones here
are lines that are actually in my
program and these other ones here come
from external dependencies so they're
either come from the JVM or they come
from some library that using in this
case they mostly come from closure
itself and and we can actually filter
those out so we just see the lines that
that are from our program which is quite
nice and you can go back through the
through the execution it will take you
to that point and the execution and show
you how you got to where you are and
then on the right here you have your
variables view so this shows the this
object that's obviously more important
if you're working with Java so that this
debugger is still fairly Java focused
and that kind of leaks through a bit
I'll talk about more about that later on
so you have you this object which is not
so useful in closure
I mean it's generally the class that's
compiled from the current function that
you're executing but it is still useful
sometimes and we'll see a bit about
there and a wee bit and then you see
your local variables here so board and
pause which were passed in and then we
have this funny Vik 17 they'll talk
about a bit later on so there's quite
nice we can see everything here and then
there are other ways we can actually see
so I can hover over a symbol here and it
will pop up it will evaluate it and pop
up the value of it right there and if
it's a more complicated funk structure I
can actually open that out and then we
can drill down into it and see so this
is obviously pretty simple it's just a
victor of characters but if it were a
sort of nested met with victors and one
that you can drill down into that and
see it that's quite nice and you can see
the locals are actually painted into the
editor here as well or a sort of
representation of them that has to be
painted on a single line so collections
you just get a summary
because have actually renders lazy
sequences as well that tell you how many
elements and the sequence have been
realized and things like that and the
values are actually painted right in
there so that's actually really useful
and just as you're going through you can
see the variables that are kind of
relevant to where you are right where
you need them that's quite nice and so
when you're actually just hovering
around like this it will actually only
evaluate symbols that won't evaluate
expressions because they might have side
effects and you don't want you you know
your database being written to what he's
just hovering around in your source code
but if you do what you want to do there
you can actually just evaluate this
expression here to you and I can X you
evaluate that's different cause we're
really keen and it'll give us back a
function so this is actually going out
to the debug JVM and just execute the
code on the JVM like any other code so
that's quite nice and it's really useful
to be able to even look at functions
coming up to see what the return value
will be when you get there again as long
as your functions are pure a few
functions have side effects and all bits
are off but that's that's more lesser
and you have all your standard sniffing
commands as well so I used to step over
before which just dips to the next line
we can step in here and go up here we
can step in there and see again the
locals are all painted in the editor and
we can also step out which again these
are very short functions but that will
run to the end of the function and take
you back to the the point their function
was called from and the other nice thing
to notice which actually the screen here
is a little bit small but and the
variables view here it actually shows
the value of the last function
invocation as you're stepping through
and this is really nice so you can step
into a function and then immediately
step out of it and just to see what the
return value is as you're going through
as you step in through your code which
is which is also quite nice the other
thing you can do here is you can drop a
stack frame so let's say we drop the
stack frame here so there were just the
top stack frame it will completely blow
it away and take you back to where you
were previously so what your local
variables get dropped and assuming that
your function is pure that you're not
you have any side effects there's just
like a back in time basically so what
will actually often happen when you're
debugging you have an eye
dear of where your program is starting
to go wrong so you're stepping through
your function and you're looking at your
variables and all of a sudden you'll
notice that your variables have started
to go bad and you've actually either you
accidentally pushed if7 too many times
or or you weren't quite sure where it
actually started happening and when you
can start to see your variables going
bad you can actually go back and then
just re execute that function again to
see what happened again as long as there
are no side effects if there are side
effects like if your function is
memorizing something then the next time
you come back you'll get the memorized
value which may or may not do what you
want and right for those of you who may
be a little bit IDE phobic and you can
see me using my mouse for all of this
you can drive all this with the keyboard
IntelliJ you can do pretty much
everything with the keyboard it's just a
little bit easier in a demo to show what
I'm doing with the mouse so now
obviously this is Clojure we don't want
to be running scripts it's kind of awful
so we will run this in ripple if it will
actually I can't see on the screen still
annoying
you know why that font is really big so
this is this is a ripple here basically
and it's actually being run in debug
mode so what we can do will just comment
it out so it doesn't get run immediately
so we can load that namespace and to the
end of thing we'll switch the namespace
and now we can execute that function and
it will stop so again it's the ripple is
totally interactive you can load code on
it or whatever and you can debug the
code at the same time which is quite
nice and so we can go through there and
if I execute the same code here the
ripple will stop as well so there's a
nice it gives you this sort of I mean
when someone asked me why would I need a
debugger if I have a ripple I would ask
why don't you want both I want both and
so here we are we have both so we can do
some more quite neat things and just so
the breakpoints are configurable I can
hover over this breakpoint here and we
get a bit of a summary of what the what
the breakpoint is doing and then I can
control click on it so there's various
things we can do to it we can enable it
and disable it you see it kind of goes
green there it's odd that it's green for
disabled but I guess it's red for
enabled so they probably make scenes and
I can do that in the editor as well just
by alt clicking on the break point the
break one is currently configured to
suspend and you can configure whether
you want the breakpoint to suspend the
entire JVM or just the current thread of
execution you pretty much will always
suspend the entire JVM I guess you might
use the thread one if you're debugging
something in production then you only
wanted to debug a particular transaction
then you wanted your rest of your
application server to keep going
something like that and and you can
actually not suspend at all and you
might ask you know what uses a break
point that you don't stop at and what
I'll show you in a little bit and
there's a condition here as well so so
what we could do is we can drag that
break point down a line and then we'll
add a condition here say
HP so we're only going to stop we know
that our bug is provoked just on for
certain parts of our chess board so we
can look that up and it doesn't stop and
but when we start looking at b8 it does
stop so their conditions are close your
expression it's a it's a sort of
arbitrary expression and here it's
actually using local variables so you
can use all the variables from your
local context as you would expect and
even much more complicated expressions
here if you like see whatever and one
thing to notice is that cursive will
actually auto import order require
things as it does in a normal editor so
we can Auto impact that they import that
there and so that is not required in
there in your main file it doesn't
actually touch your source code it's
just kind of locally required and this
little expression here so when we close
the expression editor that's gone well
it's stored with the with the expression
so if we change the expression then that
goes away but again Auto importing it
again is very simple and it does the
same for Java classes if you have a
reference to a Java class and they're a
little important okay so look at that so
I mean it's a debugger we should
probably so you can actually read those
comments how I put here to explain kind
of what I'm doing so right so when
you're debugging Java code your code is
quite static right so you write your
Java code and then you execute it and
you can place breakpoints and then why
are you executing your code doesn't
really move around and the same way it
doesn't close you so IntelliJ in in sort
of conjunction with the JDI when you put
a breakpoint in the source line it maps
that to the to the corresponding
executable bytecode because at the end
of the day you're really debugging the
executable stuff you're debugging the
bytecode itself right so you have to be
much more careful of that and closure so
here for example a breakpoint has little
ticking it over here but if I delete
this comment for example all of a sudden
has a little X in it
and that's because we've moved our
source around so the bright the compiled
bytecode no longer contains any
executable code at the line where the
breakpoint is because the breakpoint has
been moved around by editing the source
so if you actually debugging in a ripple
and you're sending code to the ripple
and you're you know you're adjusting
code in the editor you do have to be
quite careful to make sure that what the
code being executed and your ripple
still corresponds to what you have in
your editor there's quite an easy
mistake to make the easiest way to fix
it of course is just to reload the code
and the ripple and then so that
recompile it and that means that the
compiled code now once again corresponds
to what we have an air editor so if
you're better start debugging a
namespace in the and the ripple I
recommend loading the whole namespace
first if you can but fortunately you do
actually get some feedback there about
about the fact that the breakpoint is no
longer valid but if you just move up one
line that will not be marked if there is
actually executable code at that line
but it's not the code you think it is
and then you'll get extreme strangeness
which you don't want so this being a
debugger we should actually try and try
and debug a bug and see so if we we do
this say for some clearly absurd
position whoops we're going to get an
index out of bounds exception because
it's going to calculate some position in
our victor that doesn't exist so we can
get the stack trace of there here which
obviously on a normal monitor you can
actually see and again this code here
it's simple enough that you could just
read it and trace through it and your
head and figure out probably what the
problem was but in a real program you're
going to have a lot more stage it might
be a lot deeper in your stack it's going
to be nowhere near as obvious what's
going on so what we'll do is we'll
create an exception breakpoint so four
index out of bounds exception and now
when we do this it actually takes us to
the point where the exceptions drawn so
as soon as that exception thrown the JVM
will break it'll stop the whole thing
you can look here
here on this tiny monitor it's a little
bit difficult but you can see the stack
trace you can see how you got to where
the exception was thrown you can see the
local variables and all the contexts
leading out to it so it's quite easy to
quite easy to figure out what's going on
and that's probably the breakpoint type
that I use the most when I'm debugging
cursive often a problem will start with
an exception so I just say stop us in
this exception of throwing and then I'll
go back and see see how how I got them
okay so we'll look at another example of
that and again we just hide this here
this is another example from the joy of
closure it's actually slightly modified
so they have some examples about
exception handling so they have a
function here that accepts two
parameters and just divides one by the
other and then they therefore broken
exception by dividing by zero and then
they catch that exception and just print
out something went wrong and then they
have a second function that catches it
and Andry throws the exception with an e
X info with just with some information
about the parameters that provoked the
problem and then when they actually call
that they printout received error and
they print out the X data so you can see
a bit more about what actually happened
and then I just have a little driver
function here to do that so again we can
load it into our repor hopefully oh I
just wish that I rippled in
and so we can load that in Webster
Network okay so we'll load that in we'll
switch to the namespace and then when we
when we run this sure enough something
went wrong and then we get our
information so it's throwing the
exceptions that's catching them as
printing out what you would expect so
it's that one I mean this monitor is
kind of annoying we'll just get rid of
that what are you there sorry about this
that's not working for me I'm gonna take
this out of presentation mode which
might make the text little sore our
smaller sorry can you read that oh right
still cool right so oh my god it's still
doing it okay so so we'll do an
arithmetic exception here and we'll do
the same thing and sure enough it stops
in numbers dot dot class and that's it
so the numbers class is what cloture
uses to do a lot of its arithmetic
operations so it stops here and then we
can run and we'll do it again for the
second one and take us out so that's
quite nice so we can do that and we can
actually keep snipping from here as well
so so one thing to notice is that I
don't have the source for closure
attached here so IntelliJ actually
compiles the class and shows me where I
am in what looks like Java and in fact
this does come from Java but even if its
closure sauce it'll be compiled into
Java so you can sort of see more or less
what's going on you don't have to
actually be looking at the bytecode and
then the latest version IntelliJ 14.1
you can actually debug decompile classes
so if you're something you do have to
source for you can actually place
breakpoints in the decompile java and
step through it for all your heckling
needs so we can actually keep stepping
from where we are and we can
to the catch block and then once we're
done with a catch block it takes us back
to where that was cooled from because
the same thing again we can step out it
takes us into that catch block and then
where this next exception is thrown and
record and takes it to the catch block
there as well so that's quite useful
again you can sort of trace through from
where an exception is actually caught to
see what I see what's happening so one
thing that I do quite a lot in cursive
so one of the major subsystems in
cursive is the indexing infrastructure
so this generally gets run when IntelliJ
starts up so it'll find any files that
have that have changed from when the
index is were actually cached and and
will reindex them and it's a fairly
complex thing so I quite often get bugs
in it and these bugs are often
exceptions and I want to have an
exception breakpoint that catches it the
problem is that if I just start a copy
of IntelliJ opening the project that I
know provokes the problem and I have
maybe it's a generic exception that's
thrown like a runtime exception or
something like that
something run class a runtime exception
and its various subclasses are probably
thrown and caught quite a few times in
the IntelliJ platform while it's
starting out and I don't want to be
looking at all of those because they're
not interesting so I can actually place
a breakpoint here and I'm not going to
suspend on it so this is like a
breakpoint that does nothing right
there's it doesn't stop it doesn't do
anything but then I can look at the
arithmetic exception here and I can say
this breakpoint is not enabled until
we've hit this other one so now when I
do this we stop here but we've actually
when we go back through the stack trace
we've stopped at the second one so the
first one didn't stop because the
breakpoint was disabled until we hit
that so you can actually use this so the
conditions on your breakpoints you often
use to delimit kind of the state of the
program that you know causes your
program so a certain set of parameters
or part of the the actual state of your
program you can do that and you can use
these breakpoints to delimit the area of
your program like the region of code
that you're interested in which is which
is very very powerful and I use that all
the time when I'm
because so you can do other things with
these breakpoints that don't they don't
do anything we can log a message here so
now when we when we do this reason and
so it'll just log a message saying this
breakpoint was reached so you can put a
little marker there to see if it's even
getting to a particular part in your
code if just knowing it got there is not
enough you can actually log an evaluated
expression
yeah
and again so this is like a sort of a
fancy form of print l'm debugging and
you might say well i just put a print
then and reload my function right and
that's fine if it's your code you own
the code there's one problem with that
when you're debugging which is that in
modifying your function you're going to
move your source lines around again so
you get that problem we spoke about
previously if you're not careful but
also maybe you don't control the code
maybe it's in a dependency maybe it's
Java code like I quite often want to see
what's going on in some Java code and I
can't just put a print line in it and
load it into the ripple so you can use
these as sort of like a print than I
could just put anywhere anytime and see
what's going on and again it's a totally
arbitrary closure expression you can use
your locals you can use variables from
estate static method calls whatever you
want so this is an example from closure
programming actually they have this is
the game of life commerce game of life
so they have a much more complex example
of this it has a swing GUI and then they
go through various iterations of that
work so I've just got part of it here so
put a breakpoint here so the other thing
we can do when we're here is we can we
can evaluate some expressions right and
we can look at against our it's a bit
annoying to see the local variables but
we have some local variables there
called X and Y and we can look at the
board so they're using a different
representation here they have a victor
of victors to make a 6x6 board so you
can see the different values in here so
again you can sort of navigate down into
it and see and we can so again these are
totally arbitrary expressions and again
because that's because of the
representation you really want to be
doing something like an exercise in our
board so again it's totally totally our
tree expression you can require whatever
functions you need here you can you can
pretty much do whatever you want so this
is sort of like a ripple while was the
the main ripple doesn't work at the
moment because the JVM is totally
Rosen right if you into something in the
and the ripple it'll just sit there but
you can use this evaluate expression it
has a slightly more annoying interface
than the ripple but it does also allow
you to do things like drill down into
data structures and things which is
quite nice so that there are some
interesting tricks with this so normally
in in Java when you're evaluating an
expression when you stopped at the
debugger you have various things
available to you you have the this
object and you have your local variables
and so we have more or less the same
here except in closure you can't
normally refer to this object there's no
way to do that and Java you can always
just refer to it so but we were actually
evaluating expressions previously with
with variables that are not in our local
things so we also have variables under
add this object we have two closed over
variables so because we have some nested
functions here this function refers to
some variables that are outside at scope
so the closure compiler has created a
closure and has placed those variables
in there and we can refer to those in
our expressions so in our expressions we
can refer to x and y new board board and
but what's interesting is we can also
refer to other variables here we can
refer to the width and the height and
these are actually right at the top of
our stack here and if we look here
they're actually not available in a
local context at all they're not
available and our local variables and
they're not available in our closure and
so what cursor does is it actually walks
up the stack over here looking for where
those local variables are found and then
when it finds a stack entry with local
variables matching what you're trying to
use it will just check that that stack
trace entry actually comes from
somewhere within your top-level form
here because it knows the file that's
coming from in the line range and if it
does then it knows that that's a local
variable it's like I sort of potentially
closed over variable and you don't
normally have to think about this when
you're programming in closure right and
you just sort of you use your variables
in here and then the closure compiler
takes care of automatically closing over
the variables that you need and crystal
tries to do the same when you're
evaluating the expressions so when you
evaluate an expression here it tries to
give you access to the
to the variables all the variables that
you would have available to you while
you're while you're actually working in
your closure code there are some cases
where this doesn't work properly and you
have to be a little bit careful so one
case is if you have an anonymous
function that you're debugging and that
anonymous function is actually in the
endless calling and this function here
where it's contained it's actually
returned on a lazy sequence so what will
happen there is that the lazy sequence
is not usually realized at the time it's
returned it will be realized your
function will be called at some later
point when something else is realizing
your lazy sequence your function will be
called at that point and all this local
context will no longer exist
that's totally gone right it's just you
you only have your local variables and
your function and you have your whatever
variable is the closure compiler closed
over so then you'll get some weird
message like variable W can't be found
and that could be quite surprising if
you don't understand what's going on and
you get the same there if you create an
anonymous function and you pass it to
another thread it was obviously this
local context is per thread so if you
create an anonymous function and you
pass it to P map or you pass it to an
agent or you put it in an executor or
you're working with swing and you put it
on the ADT then when closure tries to
when cursive tries to walk up the stack
to find these local variables it won't
find them and you will probably be
surprised if you don't understand what's
going on so you do it to be a little bit
careful about there so this is great
right it's a fantastic tool and I can
see you all forming orderly queues here
to give me money orderly and yet highly
concurrent queues obviously but there
are there are definitely some tricks you
have to be quite careful with so the
first one the first obvious thing is
just that
that there's a lot I would say the main
problem with the debugger at the moment
is there's a lot of leakage of the
implementation into the debugger and
this is because you're actually
debugging the executable code so it's
easy when you're looking at your editor
to think that you're debugging your
source code but you're not you're
debugging the executable code and
they're quite different so in Java
there's more of a mapping between the
source code and the executable and
Clojure there's a lot of different ways
that there can I open so firstly the
most obvious one is that you can see a
lot of like Java stuff and here there's
lots of ugly mangled names and your
variables have lowercase names
locate these underscores and them rather
than dashes that's actually an
intelligence oh this is because when
they split IntelliJ into the platform
and the Java part the debugger did not
get fully migrated across so the
debugger is still somewhat legacy code
and they've actually over the last
couple of major release has been
migrating their to the generic framework
that they used to implement debuggers
for Ruby and Python and things like that
so I'm optimistic that in the next major
release of IntelliJ I'll actually be
able to prettify all of this and will
look much nicer for everyone's eyes but
there are also there's quite a lot of
the implementation of closure leaks
through here as well and so we'll look
at some examples of them so if we go
back to our original example here and
switch this namespace execute this again
now if I step over this here ice tip and
I get some local variable appears here
and it doesn't go to the next line
what's going on and I step here again
this is because to understand what's
going on there we just need to look at
the macro expansion of this so this is
what the structuring actually looks like
right when if you look behind the scenes
it takes the pause which is the original
variable and then it picks the pieces
out the D structured pieces within and
vÃªoc now you can see that in your
source code but these are actually two
different executable things so the macro
expansion is creating more executable
functions than you had in your original
line of code and that so there is it's a
general problem with a lot of these
debugging tools which are line oriented
so the JDI is very very heavily line
oriented rather an expression oriented
which you would really want so sometimes
this is quite obvious so if you have a
line of cloture code and you're sort of
calling various functions and we can see
a simple example here like there's at
least two executable things on this line
right and dicks and either call to index
and the call to board so sometimes
that's very obvious but sometimes it's
not so obvious generally because of
macro expansion so you do have to be a
little bit careful you have to sometimes
understand a little bit about what's
going on behind the scenes enclosure to
be able to understand what the debugger
is doing it's not really a serious
problem you're just but if you have a
more complicated destructuring
expression here you can easily end up
with ten expressions on their line so if
you're just stepping over there's not
really a problem but if you're stepping
into things that can be more of an issue
here's there's some other craziness here
I can put a breakpoint here and it stops
at your breakpoint when you're loading
your namespace in to the ripple and if
you're from coming from a Java world
you're like what is going on and that is
because the execution model the
compilation model and closure is very
very different so when it loads a
namespace mm-hmm what it's actually
doing goes through it reads every
top-level form one by one it compiles
there and intervals it right so the
loading the namespace is actually
executing your code so you do have to be
you do have to be quite careful about
that that can be very surprising and we
look at another example here so a lot of
people ask me if you can use this to
debug web applications and you can of
course it's just executable code all of
it
so you think hey I'll put a breakpoint
here because I want to see what happens
when I call this particular URL and
again when I'm loading that namespace it
hits the breakpoint even though I'm not
the breakpoint isn't on a top-level form
and again this is the this is basically
the same problem difference here as a
macro we expand it out and it turns out
to be this diff thing here which and
these macros compile out into more
executable code and you can see here
from that single line of source code
there's a ton of executable code in here
so you do have to be quite careful with
that and you need some sort of
understanding of what the code you're
actually using
right so and the other big problem I
think is performance so this is a little
glimpse into the eye of madness here clj
1330 so the JD I really wants to know
the class that that you're working with
and it would really like you to be able
to say for this particular line of
source what is the class that's being
executed at that line and then so when
you look at this you realize there's
really no way you can actually predict
that so there are all these different
cases down here on the left so maybe you
think oh well you know I'll just have
like a big Condor something to figure
out what the cases are and and match
them to this thing on the right but of
course again it could be macros right
you can have any macro form that expands
to any one of these forms and so there's
really no way unfortunately to predict
for a particular line of Clojure source
what the class name is that's being
executed on that line and JDO really
hates that so unfortunately JDI will
often ask me that and and I pretty much
have to give it back all the classes for
the current namespace and say could be
under any one of these I can't help you
basically so when you're actually
calling out to the JD I often it allow
you to use a filter they have a
hilarious thing in the documentation
where they talk about restricted regular
expressions and that turns out to be the
exact class name star name or name star
so when they say restricted regular
expressions are at least half right
right now it's certainly restricted but
it's even worse than that because
sometimes you actually can't use those
filters and so in those cases my only
option is to go out to the debug JVM get
back every single class and the JVM and
filter them out get all the classes from
that namespace and then give those back
and say could be any one of these can't
help you so the performance debugging
closure code sometimes I haven't
actually fully identified when these
different operations are used
so sometimes debugging the closure code
can be slower than debugging Java would
be so I guess I kind of felt like I've
spent a lot of this talk almost
apologizing for the experience of
debugging closure code but done did they
put you off it's an awesome tool I use
this every day it I couldn't do my work
without it basically for the sort of
work that I do and lots of other people
cursive users are using it it's really
it's
it is a really fantastic tool I wish I
had more time I could talk for two hours
just about the debugger and and demo all
the stuff there are watch expressions
you put an expression there and as
you're stepping through your code it
will show you how the values evolve you
can put field watch points so it will
break when a field is accessed either
read or written you can stop on a break
when a method is called this is kind of
annoying to use in closure because again
you're talking about the man's name so
so these are not I don't actually use it
very much you can group your breakpoints
for your really complex debugging needs
you can have temporary breakpoints you
can look at three dumps you can analyze
for three there's all sorts of stuff
there and yeah it's a very very
sophisticated tool because again
JetBrains been doing this for years
right I'm gonna be adding some more
stuff to this these first two should be
coming pretty soon actually so instance
marking this is actually in the Java
debugger so you can when you have
something in your local variables view
you can actually mark a particular
object instance and give it a label and
then later you can refer to that in your
expression so you can actually have a
watch point for a particular object
instance and the JVM even if it's in
some stack frame somewhere for some
other thread than the thread you're
looking at so you can refer to that
anywhere you can refer to and breakpoint
conditions and watch points it's really
really useful so somebody asked me the
other day how they were debugging a
concurrency problem and they wanted to
know they wanted to be able to debug
promise that was in a local context and
another thread this will allow allow you
to do that so that's hopefully coming
and I think in the next release I'm
going to add their smarts Tippin also
helps when you have this problem with a
lot of executable code on a single line
so when you step into a line that has a
bunch of different executable code on it
cursive will actually work out what the
potential calls you might be making
there are and it will present a little
drop-down list so you can say actually
want to jump into this function here
again the ripple is fro that the ripple
is frozen while you're debugging I
actually but I actually think you should
be able to make it work by by using the
expression evaluation on the debug to
JVM so I want to get that going
I think there's a lot of scope for
specific closure breakpoints as well so
you might say I'd like to break I'd like
to break when this atom or if are
updated I'd like to break when this
promise has a his
result delivered to it make the method
break ones easier to use again by
probably undone geing the names or
something like that I'd like to try and
do something about the performance I
don't know how much I'm at you gonna be
able to do about that but I'll see what
I can do and I'm also going to be
developing a clojurescript debugger so
I've been talking to David Nolan about
this so you'll have the same sort of
interface and you'll be able to debug
your clojurescript code right from the
IDE and a browser and nodejs and it's
like that with react native you like to
be able to debug right on your device
which should be pretty cool and
everything in the in the IDE will be
displayed as clojurescript objects not
actually as closure as Java as
JavaScript objects so that's it thank
you very much if you have questions come
talk to me afterwards I'd love to hear
from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
