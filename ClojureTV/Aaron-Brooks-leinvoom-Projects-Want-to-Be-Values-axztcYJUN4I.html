Aaron Brooks and I work at the lone
cloud group at viasat viasat is a
cutting-edge satellite and
communications company with products and
services in government commercial and
consumer markets including exede
satellite internet service by the way I
should mention that we have satellites
in space
there we go
so ViaSat acquired low no cloud nearly a
year ago and these are my beloved low no
cloud coworkers and as a distributed
team this is where we work every day and
I show you this because these are the
characters in the setting for our story
before I introduce my talk I want to
take you on a journey a journey that
starts nearly three years ago with our
first commit and brings you to where we
are today with over 100 projects and a
thousand namespaces our journey starts
on a fine morning in april of 2011 and
it started as many projects do with an
empty read me in six months time our
team had grown from 25 engineers we had
89 namespaces across 11 projects a total
of six thousand lines of code most of
our projects were exploratory in nature
but we're also building the groundwork
for our core infrastructure two months
later in january and december we are
ready to build our project to showcase
our technology infrastructure in the
form of a mobile health demo the mobile
health demo the video is available on
youtube showed live remote clients
streaming data in a scalable and
fault-tolerant matter to a distributed
processing and monitoring infrastructure
the particularly cool part of this demo
is that it was not offense thin facade
but in fact all the parts were actually
working this is a very productive time
for us and it was a testament to closure
but it was also a testament to our team
and our workflow we had one project with
one branch in one repo we were
practicing a form of maximum continuous
integration and at many points were
pushing new commits every few minutes
the workflow was great for our code but
as a project grew we found we needed to
fork and fix a number of third-party
projects outside of our one project one
repo fits all model for a brief period
we installed artifacts manually but soon
set up an artifact repository to share
canonical artifacts by July things were
going great our team had doubled in size
and we picked up several clients we now
had 10 engineers and the rate of was
really starting to pick up we started
splitting our demo project into a number
of proper dependencies
automated the snapshot in dependency
builds in bash now you can see where
this is going to go by the fall of 2012
we have the same number of Engineers but
we had more than doubled the number of
projects and unsurprisingly a build
infrastructure of bash scripts does not
scale well so we set up a proper
continuous integration server however
see I wasn't a server wasn't enough it
wasn't able to keep up with our peak
rates of integration and was slowing our
workflow down we also had to use either
snapshots which developers had to
remember to constantly pull or we needed
to remember to bump release versions and
dependencies and neither these were
working well for us to address these
problems Alan diaper Chris Hauser and
Jonathan Claggett created a tool called
mine cya lime cya when run computes the
dependencies between projects within a
single repository and builds and
installs snapshot artifacts in
dependency order because lines see why
it understands dependencies based on the
entire set of checked out projects all
projects have to be in the same
repository this meant that you couldn't
have one project depending on a nut on
an older version of another project
without reverting the changes of within
the repo and this is tricky because
multiple projects were already living in
the same repository by the way for the
curious I'm led to believe that cy
stands for continuous your integration
nearly a year ago low no cloud was
acquired by ViaSat and this acquisition
brought with it a number of new projects
new deliverables and the opportunity to
open source several over components this
pushed us solidly into the territory of
multiple repositories but since line see
why I only works with a single
repository we had to solve this with
more bash scripts by this past fall our
band aids couldn't hold any longer our
team of 12 engineers was now managing
roughly a thousand namespaces in more
than a hundred projects across 23
repositories with increasing levels of
pain it was this pain that led to the
creation of line boom and we've been
using line boom for the past several
months and I was rescued us from the
pain and misery of our
managing our dependencies I share this
story so that we can look at the
different phases of productivity and
pain as projects grow pain occurs when
the tools are ill suited to our needs
and productivity happens when our tools
and processes align with what we need to
accomplish as your project grows and our
needs change and to remain productive
and to avoid pain we need our process
and tools to adapt to our needs line
bloom works at a number of scales and it
should be considered whether your
project is small or large but I'd like
to quickly add that this is not a talk
to tell you how your workflow should go
or that you should be using our process
the point of this talk is to introduce
you to new workflow options that can
help keep you productive and help you to
avoid pain and now a proper talk
introduction first we'll take a look at
questions that any dependency system
should be able to answer we'll take a
brief look at complexities of the
dependency and build and delivery space
and will introduce line bloom and box
utility and see how they work through
several workflows finally we'll take a
look at where these tools are headed
Lisa let's take a look at several
questions which exist in the building
dependency space and particular these
are problems that most tools struggle to
deliver sufficient answers for first off
how do i find the commit that was the
origin of a particular dependency
secondly given a dependency chain what
is the process between fixing E and
using it in a and in particular how much
effort does it take and how long does it
take also we'll take a look at branches
how do I manage project across multiple
branches simultaneously and thirdly will
look at third party dependencies what is
my process for using unreleased upstream
fixes or creating my own forked fixes of
an upstream project and using those
artifacts
so when considering tools that provide
answers to these questions we need to
take into account how these tools
interact with our existing tools and
processes it turns out this is no small
task the building dependency space is
massive and complicated and so much so
that I won't attempt to address the
complexities in this talk so let me show
it show you what I mean now this this is
sort of unfair this is not a regular
graph the various nodes and edges are
different types of things and have
different types of relationships also
this is a simplification the truth is
much more complicated it should however
give a sense of what's involved and why
I'm not going to delve into this deeply
during the talk I'm not evading the
addressing the complexity entirely
rather than trying to address all the
different approaches and variations in
this space I'm structuring the talk so
that we can talk about issues that are
important to you I expect to have about
10 minutes at the end of the talk where
you can ask whatever questions you have
so be sure to write down your questions
and have them ready when I take a brief
moment to give some background on the
behavior of releases versus snapshots
specifically I'm talking about them in
the context of dependency specification
by the way in this talk anytime I say
snapshots assume that I mean snapshots
and version ranges since they have
approximately the same behavior you're
unfamiliar with maven version ranges
that's perfectly fine you can continue
to remain so so to understand what's
wrong where snapshots go wrong let's
first look at release dependency
specification at work so if you specify
release version 1 2 3 you get the
artifact 1 2 3 however if your
dependency specification has the word
snapshot maven will be clever and will
fetch the latest ie highest sorting
artifact that it can find for that
version if you and I are working on a
project that depends on foo 1 2 3
snapshot you and I may be using
completely different versions influenced
by the timing of our last dependency
fetch this creates a it worked for me
set of problems that compound severely
when you're working with permutations of
several dozen snapshots so why do people
use snapshot dependencies well this is
the easy path for continuous integration
integration just happens
continuously and while it's true that no
developer diligence is required to bump
project versions and their corresponding
dependency specifications this isn't
really saving anyone effort in the long
run it's a recipe for automated mayhem
and developers are ever faced with new
permutations of dependencies as closure
developers which would immediately spot
the mutable state as the source of the
pain so why don't people just work with
releases well release dependency trees
don't have the mutation problems that
snapshots do but they do require
considerable effort and diligence
developers must remember to bump version
strings any time they want to create and
release a new version and then they need
to update dependency specifications
pointing to that new release often this
process must be propagated across the
dependency graph to be useful in other
words if a depends on be depends on see
you obviously need to update these
dependency on C but now you've created a
new B and a is still depending on the
old be so A's dependency on B also needs
to be updated because of the extra
effort required dependencies tend to
stagnate across the dependency graph and
this turns out to not be good for
continuous integration finally we're
ready to introduce line boom as its name
suggests lines room is a line again
plug-in which can satisfy dependencies
directly from source commits in a
repository but it will only build
dependencies if a canonical artifact
cannot be found at the core is a version
specification that will impact in a
moment most fundamentally line flume
allows us to eliminate the need for
snapshot dependencies by being able to
use any commit as a dependency no
version bumping is required it also
gives us a mechanism to safely and
easily update those fixed dependencies
line boom is inspired by a number of
previous projects several companies ago
joel martin and i created a
configuration management tool called CM
project CM project could fetch and build
sources from a number of different
source control systems they could peg
and freshen versions and I knew how to
manage dependency relationships between
those dependencies
but it was built on going to make and
this is not a great fit for the closure
and maven an ecosystem also related are
several features of the mix tool for the
elixir as well as a very similar version
scheme used by closure skip script there
are also a number of line again plugins
that touch on various aspects of the
line bloom deliveries and I've
highlighted ones that I think are
particularly relevant so what do these
versions look like well here's a typical
line again project on CL J notice that
we have a dependency on the seek
ex-library by adding the line bloom
plugin and adding some metadata to the
dependency we can now use boom
specification so let's take a closer
look at this new enhanced dependency
specification parts of the dependencies
specification should still look similar
we still have our group and artifact ID
as well as our semantic version but at
the end of the version specification we
now see a git commit Shaw which is
preceded by a git commit time so why
have we added these well many
traditional CI systems and maven plugins
will create artifacts with a build
number build numbers are typically a
monotonic counter that's managed by the
continuous integration server this gives
us two properties uniqueness and sort
ability now there's a caveat on the sort
ability but I'll get to that in a moment
instead of using a build number that
gives you using a sha instead of a build
number gives you a different set of
properties a sha by definition it has is
globally unique they're also
reproducible at any point in time you
can drive it the Shah from the commits
that you started from you also have
source mapping which is the reverse
property the ability to get to the
source from the Shah using a commit time
presents different trade-offs commit
times are not guaranteed to be unique
for example a rebase operation will
often yield several commits that have
the same commit time but commit times do
have useful sorting behavior as with
Shahs commit times are reproducible
we can extract them from the originating
commit the commit time is also
meaningful to humans if we have a
version that combines the Shah and to
commit time we get all the above
properties combined now I'll note that
sort ability is of interest to legacy
maven tools that use sort of Bill
Sorrell versions to find newer versions
based on sort order now all of these
were solutions the build time is a weak
sense of order later sort values may not
mean the most recent versions of code
the above dependency specification is a
metadata annotation which provides the
context for the three line boom commands
shown here we have build depth freshen
and wrap the build apps command behaves
like lined apps except where the
artifact cannot be found in this case
there's boom metadata the sorry in the
case where there's blue metadata the
dependency source repository is cloned
the artifact is built and installed
locally in the m2 repository I should
note that for the separate build up step
this we expect this to go away the
functionality will happen as part of the
line depth phase at least if it's not
prohibited by a profile setting the
freshman command is used to update the
project on clj with the latest versions
of dependencies that match the
constraints of the boom metadata freshen
will only update a project file if it
finds a single unambiguous newer version
if it finds multiple possible
resolutions it will show the user a
table of those resolutions let's take a
look at what this looks like so in this
example we're going to make the clj
chop-chop dependency of boom dependency
the first thing we need to do is add the
blue metadata so lion boom knows how to
find the source repository now we run
the line bloom freshen command this is
what freshman looks like when it finds
more than one version to update it will
and it will present a conflict
resolution table now because the table
so larger split it into two parts for
better viewing the repository the
project and the version are all the same
so that's not going to help us
disambiguate these but in the second
half of the table we see that the branch
the commits time and the Shah are
different and we can use those to
determine which one we want so after
considering the details from the
multiple resolutions table we've decided
we want the master branch so we'll add
that as a constraint to room dependency
metadata now we can run freshen again
now impression finds a single version
matching our constraints it will update
the project sale J file and we can see
that here finally lines room provides a
wrap command with the wrap command we
can run line again subcommands using the
project version set to a boom version
this does so without modifying the
project at clj using this command you
can install or deploy boom version
artifacts or wrap any other commands
that you as you please to be clear
there's a difference between using
snapshot in version strings and in
dependency specifications from a
maintainer standpoint we don't want to
take your take away your ability to make
statements about version quality
continue using snapshots to qualify your
versions the problems occur when
snapshots are used in a dependency
specification and my recommendation is
please stop with linesman we have
fundamental ship shift from the existing
maven dependency model firstly
dependency specifications are names
instead of mutable references secondly
they're immutable values instead of
opaque and staple objects as closure
developers we know the value of
immutability over state but with an
immutable tree of dependencies how do we
keep things that we need to do quickly
and easily such as setting up arbitrary
debug state or experimenting with
several projects simultaneously we know
that we want bounded mutability in some
places so we can get stuff done this is
where box comes in box helps us address
the difficulties imposed by mutability
boxes are about mutation and about ease
they also provide a context of related
dependencies so that we can build
helpful
Automation across the multiple related
projects box is a tool is a tool managed
directory that allows us to bring
several projects together when project x
is added to a box of any other projects
that depend on Project X will use the
box project directory for X instead of
the box artifact instead of the project
X artifact in other words never mind
with the dependency specification states
use the project X I have right here it's
time to be a bit frank about box boxes
have much as of yet unrealized potential
boxes use what I have right here
mechanism is built on line again line
against checkouts feature and the rest
of it is built out of symlinks a bash
script a bash alias and the line boom
plug-in so it's slow the symlinks can
confuse editors and all of it and
confuse users but box is useful right
now and addresses issues which need to
be addressed so I think it solves a
minimum subset of functionality in the
most expedient way so what could we do
with automation well with the knowledge
that box has of the interrelationships
between dependencies there's several
processes that box can automate to help
you work across several projects one of
the most obvious is ordering check-ins
according to dependency depth so that
developers don't have to get the
dependency ordering right on their own
it would also be handy to have projects
toggled between their stated dependency
version and the tip of the branch that
they're on all of that automation is in
the future features category and it will
be added soon because we need it but
there's not much to show right now with
box functionality since box is mostly
just a place but here's an example so
this shows how to create a new box and
how to add a project to that box adding
additional projects looks very similar
the one thing that I would note here is
that we can provide additional context
to the box add command which is the same
sort of data that we add to the
boom-boom metadata for whom so if we
need to say what branch or
what context we want this we can specify
the same sort of thing so here's how
lines loom in box help address the
questions that we posed earlier in a
talk for sources we can either manually
copy and paste of the repo URL and the
commit Shah from the project out clj and
check it out or we can use box to help
us automatically get the proper version
of the dependency for integration we
have several options first we can
freshen each of the projects directly
finding new versions as we go along or
we can wait for an auto freshening which
takes the zero effort but somewhat more
time or we can temporarily integrate
dependencies directly together for our
own use in a box boom versions and
branches don't collide as a natural
property and so this makes it possible
to do branchy work without worrying
about trying to reconcile brant project
versions on both branches simultaneously
and this also applies if their party
dependencies because third party
dependencies are managed in the same way
they're just like branches we can when
we're using boom versions they naturally
will not collide one of the next
projects is to split out split up the
monolithic line boom into a boom library
a separate line boom plugin and a
separate box command once we've split
these things apart we can create a maven
plugin which will enable maven pom
projects to use voom versions and will
also enhance line boom usage as well as
I noted earlier there's plenty of
opportunity for improvement with box
particularly around box automation and
the user experience so the images used
throughout this talk come from a Libra
shows fantastic webcomic hyperbole and a
half and I'm very appreciative of her
generous Creative Commons licensing also
she just published a book of her comics
back in November
so hopefully we've learned that
snapshots bring us uncontrolled
mutability and we should stop using them
we've also learned that line of them
helps us avoid snapshots by making every
commit a potential release candidate
we've also learned that boom freshen
allows us to easily and safely move our
dependencies forwards and finally line
boom in line box give us options but
don't force us into a particular
workflow so this brings us to our
discussion time and now it's your chance
to see how line zoom can work for you by
the way I do have extra slides and can
add the ad nauseam if we have periods of
awkward silence so fire away sure
right so there's a number of features to
be implemented this is this is one of
them so the question was how do you keep
boom from updating certain dependencies
so we have a notion of being able to say
that a particular dependency should not
be updated or should not be auto updated
so we can lock them in right now the
mechanism would be you'd run fresh and
it would update the dependency in the
work and copy and you could revert that
one line back but shortly we'll have a
don't touch this sort of option other
questions yes
yes line check out still works all we're
doing is augmenting it so that we can
manage it better so so how many people
in here are actually using closure
excellent how many of you are using line
again foreclosure okay how many are
using something else oh oh so how many
of you are using snapshot dependencies
how many of you will continue to use
snapshot dependencies see me after class
so how many of you are could potentially
use line boom if it were better suited
okay how many of you are actively
thinking of using line boom awesome so
what sort of things do you guys see as
needed before you actually adopt this
right that's something we actually have
right now we can within the semantic
version we can right now the default
behavior is to not go past the first to
the major minor the incremental is open
and right now you can we have a couple
of ways to sculpt that but you'd still
get freshening within incrementals
yep
good question so the question is is this
focused on a single project / repository
or can network with multiple projects in
a repository we started doing this
because we have multiple projects in a
single repository and it works well with
with either and in fact you could sort
of see that in the fresh in table one of
the fields was path so one of the ways
to disambiguate if you had two projects
of the very same name in the same
repository you could disambiguate
according to path yeah
no it's actually doesn't type box
doesn't touch so the question is does
box update the version in the the
project file right is that yeah no box
is all about using what you have on hand
and if you have something right here in
the directory it might not be checked in
it might not have a version yet so we
can't point to any particular version
what box is doing the way line checkouts
works is it it actually adds a series of
directories to your classpath live and
so boxes built on top of checkouts and
it's doing that so effectively box is
overriding for any project that's in
your box it will override that instead
of the dependency specification so if
you as soon as you remove a project from
your box you'll go back to the artifact
version that's specified that make sense
yeah go ahead
right so the question is are we at
nirvana you know have we reached the
happy state I think we've definitely
solved all the problems that we have so
far all that all the different things
that we hit along the journey that
causes pain we would be addressed by
this and there's something sort of
fundamental to being able to lock down
versions and you know lock down your
dependency tree and you know get away
from snapshots oh snap shots was part of
the recurring pain and you know the
other part of the recurring pain is
having to remember to bump versions
every time you push something so boom
completely bypasses both of those you're
using fixed versions even if the CI
system hasn't spit out the artifact yet
you can use you can build the artifact
that you need so I I anticipate this
being able to take us a long way down
the road and it I think it addresses
some pretty fundamental things any other
questions
right so the question is if you have
multiple projects in the same repository
do you have to freshen all of the
projects and the answer is yes they're
independent projects if you're using box
as your workflow which you don't have to
i mean you can use boom without box but
if you're using box box will actually
clone the repo efficiently multiple
times and so you can independently move
your dependencies so one of the problems
with having multiple projects in the
same repos if you have one check out you
have one state of all the dependencies
so we want to be able to basically
virtualize we react as if they're in
separate repos and ignore the fact that
they happen to live in the same place
does that answer your question go ahead
right so I alluded to this in the talk
and I didn't talk about it I was hoping
somebody would ask so one of the things
that we can do is run adjunct to this
continuous integration server and auto
freshen or an auto bumping service that
is notify at any time a new project
version passes its CI tests and it can
off on the side check out any
dependencies of that product any
projects that depend on that freshen
them run tests locally and if that
passes commit and the CI system can
actually propagate all dependencies and
so what you can have is any time you
update dependencies they'll propagate
through the system automatically it will
cause you to make your continuous
integration and test better not a bad
thing go ahead
we plan to this is this is in the future
functionality but it's definitely
something we plan to do right now we've
been using this for approximately two
two and a half months and all it takes
is a couple of developers being diligent
to run freshen to keep things up to date
but it would certainly be nicer to be
able to have this automatically happen
and it really advances the state of
continuous integration to a new level
other questions
okay well on a last note i created a
hackfest entry so folks who are
interested in helping to improve the
notably missing features from line boom
and/or box can come join me on wednesday
and i want to thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
