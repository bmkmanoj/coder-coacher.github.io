closure with the twin media of music and
lies when I tell you a lie I'm going to
follow it up with an admission and an
explanation whether it's about closure
or music and you have to understand that
when you're dealing with the domain like
music that consumes people's entire
lives with study there's a certain
amount of lossy compression that's
needed to fit it into a 40-minute tour
in fact I've already told you quite a
significant line which this talk is that
this talk is about closure
it's not about closure at all it's about
music through the twin media of closure
and lies and I think that's okay because
I was looking back over the program of
the conference over the last couple of
days and it's surprising how few talks
are actually about closure I think that
in this community we see closure as a
starting point not a finishing point so
I saw talks of our logic programming
boardgames mountains of chicken but a
lot of the a lot of the ideas of things
that are taken from the language and
extended outwards and the way I like to
put this is that closure isn't so much a
programming language as a transmission
vector for the closure programming
philosophy so what kind of philosophy is
that well it's ambitious its evangelical
and it's pragmatic closure is a
programming language for people who live
in today's world of programming but who
want to see it made a better place and
that's not a small feat to achieve that
kind of a philosophical jump for example
Haskell which is one of my favorite
programming languages my first
programming language is such a beautiful
creature that I think it's easy
sometimes to think that Haskell is
itself the pinnacle of all things
Haskell but it's the artwork itself but
to us I think closure closure isn't an
artwork closure is the paints it's the
easel it's the musical instrument and
you could say that mainstream success is
just a side effect of a well-designed
programming language and if you did say
that it would explain why Haskell hasn't
quite had mainstream success yet because
it's pure and it doesn't have side
effect the closure does have side
effects
closure does have side effects both
literally and metaphorically and one of
my favorite side effects to play with
it's music so I'm going to show you
today some stuff using overtone which is
written by Jeff rose and Sam Aaron this
is not a demonstration of overtone
there's far more that overtone does that
I won't cover but it's a it's an
excellent vehicle as you might imagine
for a talk on music enclosure so to talk
about music so this is music well no
that's a lie this isn't music this is
this is dots on a page but it starts on
a page that's used by people to
represent music in particular from the
the western music tradition and if
you're not someone who's got music
training the way you read this is like a
graph so each dot is a note and its
position encodes when it happens and at
what pitch so the horizontal axis is
time and the vertical axis is pitch and
I'm going to claim that this is a
regular language in the same sense as
regular expression so there's no way to
to mention your abstractions within the
language itself there's a good reason
for that because Western music notation
is a strange kind of dsl that's designed
to be executed in real time on a
peculiar kind of finite state machine
called a musician and yeah a musician
doesn't have the mental bandwidth to to
decode nested abstractions when they're
in the middle of a performance when
they're trying to concentrate on their
expression and on their technique so
it's a strength of the language that
what you see is what you get there's no
there's no extra notions that the
execution environment has to work out as
they're as they're trying to remember
how to place their finger on the boat so
that that has a consequence which is
that we can't create new abstractions
that suit the the piece of music we're
working with we can't create things that
represent movements in the piece of
courses etc we also can't drop down any
lower and create a piece of notation
that describes how a violin sounds but
if we use a general purpose programming
ledge like closure we do have that
ability
so I'm going to start with the most
basic building block of sound and
gradually accumulate abstractions till
we get back to that piece of western
music we just saw so the most basic
building block of sound is the sine wave
so it's a pressure wave of high and low
pressure which is propagated through the
air between the thing that's making the
sound and then the ears of the listener
so that's why they say in in space no
one can hear you scream right because
there's no there's no medium to transmit
the pressure wave so if we have an
instrument called tone all that's going
to do is emit a sine wave of the
specified frequency so they're how high
or low the note is perceived is based on
how many times per second it oscillates
if we have two sine waves so double tone
that are cumulative we get another sound
and that's louder because we're talking
about a pressure wave so if there's two
waves in sync the troughs reinforce and
the peaks reinforce now what happens if
we have two sine waves that are slightly
out of sync they're ultimately
reinforcing and interfering so that's
the principle in which noise cancelling
headphones works so if you met a sound
that is half a wavelength out of phase
with another sound or you get silence
but we don't want to deal with infinite
sine waves when we looked at the western
music notation we had dots and a page
events they're bounded by time so we're
going to create something called a beep
and so the beep has frequency but it
also has duration and the way that we
control the duration is through an
envelope so an envelope is a wrapper
that determines the maximum amplitude of
the sound so when the envelope starts at
a maximum the sound is at full volume
and when the envelope snaps shut the
sound is finished so this is beep I
don't have to manually cut it off
anymore I just have an instrument called
P and by the way we're using not regular
functions but the deaf instrument
because with overtone what's actually
happening is this as a synthesis server
in the background so we're when we are
creating an instrument we're not just
defining a closure function we're
actually registering a synth tree with
supercollider now I've already told you
a fairly interesting lie about frequency
and to explain exactly what I've lied to
you about I'm going to need the help of
this slinky string right so I said that
the frit this how high or low you
perceive a sound is determined by the
frequency of that sound so imagine this
is a guitar string and you pluck it and
it vibrates at a certain rate that rate
is determined by how tense the string is
and how long the string is now if you
imagine this the greatest extent of the
movement of the slinky spring is kind of
like a sine wave that's wrapped around
on itself where it crosses the x-axis
where my hands are holding the spring
that's called a standing wave so there's
a particular size wave length that fits
in this string with a certain tension
and that's the one that vibrates but you
might also think well why doesn't a wave
that's half that size also oscillate
within a string and the answer is that
it can so if you have a fray a wave
length of half the size or double the
frequency it also oscillates within the
same string the same length and tension
so when you have a guitar string it's
not oscillating just at what we call the
fundamental frequency but it's also
oscillating at twice that frequency at
three times that frequency four times
etc in a theoretically infinite harmonic
progression as we go up the subsequent
harmonics are slightly quieter and
eventually they're too high even for a
human to hear so I've got here a
synthesis of a bell which not only has a
fundamental frequency which will use a
proportion of one for but it has a first
harmonic which has a smaller proportion
second harmonic etc when you use that to
create a more realistic sound so this is
what deep sounds like and this is what
bell sounds like
so it's a much fuller and more realistic
sound and you hear them as the same
pitch because your brain is listening
out the loudest and lowest of the sounds
but we can do a little bit better than
that because when we're dealing with
physical properties things aren't ever
quite as ideal as they are in theory so
with bells it turns out that as you get
up into the higher harmonics the smaller
wavelengths they're actually a little
bit higher still then the model would
suggest so if we re-evaluate the bell
form and then play again we'll hear
another sound so it sounds much more
like a real bill because we're taking
into account the physical
characteristics of bells and of course
you have a whole whole cornucopia of
instruments that have different
variations on the theme so you can still
hear them as the same underlying
principle but they have different color
now so far I've spoken about sound as
though it's an abstract signal but of
course in order to perceive music you
need a receiver for this signal and the
characteristics that the receiver are
going to affect how the whole thing
works so I've got three indications of
the Bell and I'm going to go from high
medium low so 600 Hertz 500 400
it's a high medium-low
but if you look carefully at what I'm
doing here the last argument and the
last two arguments here are actually the
proportions of those harmonics the first
couple of harmonics and so what I've
done is that are overridden the
fundamental frequency with a proportion
of 0 here and here I've overridden the
fundamental frequency and the first
harmonic with a proportion of zero so
actually the lowest sound you're hearing
when I play the 500 he's a thousand
Hertz and the lowest sound you're
hearing when I'm playing the 400 Hertz
Bell is actually 1200 Hertz so the order
of the lowest and loudest frequency is
actually the reverse from how you're
perceiving it so high medium low
but the physical part of the sound is
telling us the complete opposite and the
reason for that is that a harmonic
progression is something that is built
into real physical sources of sound it's
something that your brain is aware of
we're quite wired for sound so your
brain can recreate the parts of the
sound that should have been there and
this is quite important so for example
in it
if you're speaking to someone with a low
voice on a telephone I think the about
the lowest that mobiles emit is about
300 Hertz the speaker isn't loud enough
to go much lower than that but the
lowest frequency of a human male voice
is about half that hundred and fifty
Hertz so you're relying on the fact that
your brain is error-correcting back what
should have been there in the signal to
hear things coherent and that's just
obviously a little bit of an aural
illusion but there's there's a lot of
implications to how the how our brains
and how our our hardware is built that
you have to take into account if you
really want to understand how people are
going to perceive sound so frequency is
a spectrum how do we know which notes in
a spectrum to play well I've got a
another toy which I picked up in
Istanbul and you can see that this is
obviously a proper musical instrument
but it doesn't have a dial it has
buttons it's quantized the frequency
space so you know what happened to all
the other bits of the infinite frequency
spectrum I'll play you a couple of notes
and it turns out that there's very
strict rules governing the relationships
between these sounds so when you double
the frequency of a sound you're
generating what you could call is an
equivalent frequency so it's a little
bit like midday one day and midday the
next you can distinguish between them
but they share some kind of underlying
identity and if you had a male and a
female voice seeing the same song but
separated by a frequency ratio of two
you would hear it as the same song
although at the same time you could also
tell that the
woman's voice was higher and the
distance between the octave as we call
it is divided into 12 exactly so the
ratio between each adjacent button is a
frequency change of the twelfth root of
two so each time I go up I'm multiplying
the frequency by the twelfth root of two
so quite a small ratio and we can encode
that enclosure very easily it's a very
functional concept so I've recreated the
core media Hertz function from over time
and all I'm doing is I'm taking the base
frequency of a system called MIDI and
each time we go up a button or we go up
by one in the MIDI scale I'm multiplying
by the twelfth root of two so MIDI to
Hertz is just a pure function media
Hertz of 69 is 440 Hertz of close enough
which is known as concert a it's a
common reference point and so MIDI to
Hertz of 70 is four hundred and sixty
six because we're increasing the
frequency by a ratio of the twelfth root
of two as a slight lie in the model I
presented here which is that I've said
that we've divided the space between the
octave exactly into twelve
that's certainly what's done for
dominant paradigm of western music
called equal temperament but it's not
the only possible way of doing it and
there's a lot of fun to be had in
exploring other keys and other
subtleties both within old western music
traditions and other traditions as well
okay so we can start to build up more
abstractions so I've created here a
function ding which instead of taking
Hertz just takes a MIDI code so it takes
a numeric encoding of each of the
buttons here and plays a note
so just like when I was playing it on
the melodica and now we can start to
flesh out our model of music so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to model
each note as a map with just a pitch and
a time so this is just a simple
constructing function so it's very close
analog to what we had with the western
music notation each note had a pitch and
the time it was just represented
positionally whereas here we're using
numbers and so it follows that a melody
is a sequence of notes and we're going
to be able to transform a sequence of
notes using a function called where
which is just a mapping of updating so
let's now define our our core function
of playing music play so what play does
that takes a sequence of notes it
transforms each note by offsetting the
time so in other words when we play a
piece of music we don't want to play it
back in time at the beginning of the
UNIX epoch we want to off seat we want
to offset the time of each note by the
time at which we invoke the function and
then we just do a sequence so at the
milliseconds that the note has we ding
the bell easy and we just return
scheduled notes just so you can see what
we're doing so we can start to build
more powerful functions like even melody
which just takes a bunch of pitches no
times and uses a reduction to to space
them out by a third of a second each so
this is what even melody sounds like
so that's playing the MIDI notes from 70
through 80 but listen again and I think
you'll hear that there's something a
little bit non-musical about this
sequence of notes it's not actually
something you would hear in a real piece
of music and that's because we're
missing one very important abstraction
in music which is scale so we've got a
whole bunch of notes but it turns out
that in a piece of music we don't play
all the notes we pick a subset of these
notes for the effect of a particular
piece and so the interface to the
melodic are actually has a default scale
so the white notes represent a major
scale and the orange notes represent the
notes that are you could say illegal in
that major scale so if I pick the white
notes that scale to play I'm not going
to play any of the orange notes for that
piece it's something that's relative to
a particular piece and we can encode
that to in enclosure so a major scale is
defined by the relationships between the
notes you allowed to play and the ones
you aren't allowed to play so in a major
scale the distance between the first and
the second note is a double jump we've
skipped one then we've got another
double jump and then a single jump and
then a double double double single and
so this pattern of of skipping and
playing continues on in in both
directions but that's that's kind of a
relative measure because what we're
going to see is that the 0th note of the
major scale is at zero the next one is
at two four and then five where we've
got the single jump but what we want is
a reference point that makes sense for
our piece of music we want a starting
point for where we're going to do these
big and small jumps and so we can
enhance the major scale the major
function with a c function I feel
nervous talking about C functions today
at exposure comfortable so if we compose
together the notion of C and major what
do we get well we get a function but we
get a function that we can
we can give it a degree of the scale or
a position within the notes that were
allowed to play and will tell us what we
denote that means so the third or the
two of a major scale off by one errors
are not something that we're invented by
programmers it's 64 and then if we go up
I get 65 etc so because we're working in
Nice pure functions we can plug things
together and we can to use a closure
community expression we can decomp lect
the idea of what the relationship is
between the sounds were playing and the
basis from which we're working from and
so of course in music you have a whole
bunch of different starting points
they're just names given to places in
the MIDI scale so I've just defined here
D through B using a kind of a D
structuring def macro and they're just
names we give to the notes of the C
major scale and things start falling out
quite nicely when we use this model
because we're using functional
composition so we can have C flat major
and all flat ears is an alias for Dec we
could have you know C sharp major and
we're just altering the reference point
whichever don't know if this is a bug or
not we could have C sharp sharp major if
you want and the ways we can plug these
together are fairly limitless but as you
might be able to tell by the fact that I
called it the major scale it's not the
only scale so here's a few other kind of
scale the minor scale is similar but
defined by a slightly different pattern
of big and small jumps between the
allowed notes we have blues scale and
pentatonic and the degenerate case is
chromatic so I might play the chromatic
scale to start with
so as I said that's the degenerate case
that's when we're playing all the
available notes because there's a single
jump between everything let's play the
blues scale so you should have a certain
association with the notes you hear
they're partly because they're
mathematics because it has you know a
pattern of big and small jumps but
remember we have we have a receiver in
play here and you've also got kind of a
cultural bat and personal background to
the kind of music you've heard using
those relationships and it's a
combination of those that's producing
the effect so to make that point let's
try playing the pentatonic scale so the
only difference between those two scales
is that the pentatonic scale is missing
one of the one of the ones that's in the
blues scale but the effect is very
different and you'll probably you
probably hear that the effect is to
sound Chinese or Japanese because those
traditional musics of those countries
use the pentatonic scale
and so we can have a big difference
depending on what scale we choose it's
not it seems like a finicky small
mathematical detail but it has a real
emotional impact so play to you a little
melody using the major scale and I'm
going to play it again using the minor
scale
it's very shocking that is it in D minor
so if you're anything like me the second
time sounded a lot more a lot more
haunting a lot sadder but something to
know the only one of these pictures that
is interpreted differently by the major
in the minor scale is two or the third
of the scale in conventional musical
terms so you heard that really obvious
subjective difference based on the fact
that four of the the 14 notes have a
frequency that's different by the
twelfth root of two so we are really
wide the sound right where we are built
in such a way that that music and sound
is really meaning for us to us we're not
we're not really general-purpose
computers in this in this case we are we
are specialists hardware for
interpreting among other things music
and now we can start to build some
melodies so let's get a bit more
sophisticated so this is row row row
your boat ridden enclosure so the mill
the pitches are specified as degrees on
the scale so row row row your boat and
the durations are specified in beats
using ratios and so because we're in a
functional programming language we can
we can mash these together to make the
sequence of notes pretty easily just
using a reduction and a map so this is
what it looks like or part of it that's
row row row your boat and then in order
to play it we need to do a little bit of
transforming as well so the astute among
you might have noticed that when I
define play I was talking about
milliseconds but when I define row row
your boat I'm talking about beat lengths
so we need something to bridge that gap
as well so beats per minute it's a
pretty simple function in fact it's a
function that returns a function so
beats per minute of 120 so two beats per
second returns a function that can tell
me that three beats into the piece is
1500 milliseconds into the piece and of
course if we you know the fourth beat
it's at two thousand and if we want to
use a different beats per minute
it's going to give us a different answer
so we can use that to transform each
time key in the map and we can use the C
major composite funk
to transform each pitch key in the map
and then we just need to pipe it into
play okay but I promised you at the
start that we deal with abstractions
that are a custom that allow us to
express things that a general purpose
DSL can't
if general purpose DSL as a legitimate
term in programming so in defining here
run which is like a glorified range
function and the reason I'm doing that
is because if we look at a box music
there's a piece of box music there's a
lot of sections of notes that look like
a line there's kind of zigzagging here
going up and down so we should be able
to define these just by the peaks and
the troughs because I don't think if
bark was speaking about that music he
wouldn't say you know that you know that
great bit in the melody would go c d e f
g a b c what he would actually say are
you know that bit where it goes from C
and there's a run up to the next C so if
we just interpret this single line so a
run can fill in the gaps and allows me
to get a little bit closer to the actual
domain because the domain isn't
something that I can define a general
purpose notation for because each
different musicians expression is a
slightly different subdomain so you'll
hear in Bach's music a lot of things
that sound a bit like this
run with peaks and troughs and so with a
couple of other abstractions I'm able to
define the melody to that piece of
classical music we just saw and only a
low quarter and I'm taking advantage of
things I know about the structure so
it's made up of runs you know from zero
down to minus one three zero there's a
whole bunch of sections where there's
notes of the same duration repeated so
there are fourteen quarter notes in a
row in this section and so this
structure may or may not may or may not
make sense to you but if you have a
different idea about had marks music
works well then you write a different
abstraction so there's not necessary a
singular way to represent the same piece
of music because we've gone up the
extraction tree a little bit we're not
we're not notating every individual note
what we're doing is we're expressing a
theory about how it works so it's
something quite quite similar to what
how compression works and in Canole
other quarter there's also a bass part
another part and just to make the point
about the flexibility of using a
general-purpose programming language and
and Dada's closures data structures for
the bass part i've added another key to
the map so it's not only has a time and
a pitch but i'm giving it a bit of well
metadata that tells me that the part is
bass so if I want to distinguish and
often in you know an orchestra or a
piece you do want to distinguish between
what is the bass and what's not then I
can do so so I'm getting now to the
highest level of the abstraction in my
talk so if you imagine music is like the
OSI networking model where we started
with a sine wave which is like the
transport and then we had error
correction with psychoacoustics and and
various things like scale that allowed
us to interpret the signal well we're
well into the application layer now and
there's something called a cannon which
is a technique that bark employed to
write this piece of music so a cannon in
English is a melody that is accompanied
by a functional transformation of itself
well maybe not no normal English in
program or English
it's a melody that's accompanied by a
functional transformation of itself and
you can see that the closure to express
that is about as terse as the natural
language it's something that lends
itself quite well to closure so we just
concatenate the original notes with F of
notes and that can be employed in a
variety of ways so a simple canon is a
Canon where you take the original melody
and then you translate it across in time
or you delay the accompanying melody so
I'm expressing it here just with a a
function that takes every time key and
offsets it by a certain delay an
interval Canon is a closed analog but
instead of translating the graph across
Auden time it translates the graph up or
down in pitch so in the original melody
we start at a certain point and in the
accompanying melody all the notes are
either higher or lower in a fixed way
that's an interval Canon Amira Canon is
maybe slightly more interesting so it's
where we take the original melody and we
negate the the pitch of all the notes in
the original melody so what that means
is everywhere where the original melody
goes up the accompanying melody goes
down a crab cannon which is called so
called because in Bach's time they had a
theory that crabs walked backwards for
whatever reason is one way you negate
the time in other words the original
melody goes forward in time the
accompanying melody goes backwards in
time and as you might expect because
we're dealing with such pure and
functional concepts you can use
functional composition literally so
Baroque composers had a kind of cannon
they called a table cannon which is
literally a functional composition of a
mirror cannon and a crab cannon so the
accompanying melody is flipped in two
directions around the x-axis or the the
time axis and around the y-axis or the
pitch axis and the reason it's called
the table cannon is actually it's pretty
cool so if you imagine a piece of
western music notation on a table in
front of you you can play what you see
if you've got a friend who's on the
other side of the table they can also
play what they see and what they see is
the original melody flipped in pitch and
time
so hence a table counting there's a kind
of Canon that I didn't have time to
explore called a puzzle Canon which is
where a composer would distribute an
original melody and then just tell you
that there is a transformation you can
make to produce a nice sound there may
be multiple transformations so I guess
you could probably imagine implementing
something like that in in core logic
where you have a solution space and you
have some kind of predicate that
determines what harmonic relationships
you're willing to subject yourself to so
row row row your boat is a simple cannon
actually so what we're going to do is
we're going to play the original melody
and then delay it by four beats so you
should be able to you should be able to
hear that well raise my hand with the
second melody comes in
and you might have done that actually in
school like you might have had half of
the kids in the classroom sing and then
the rest yeah exactly and yeah so as
someone the audience has pointed out
it's actually more than a simple
candidates around so you can have you
don't display the accompaniment once you
can play it multiple times to load by
four bits and four bits and all the
parts work well together but um it seems
a bit of a pity that we've we've
abandoned the power of the positional
representation so we had a talk a while
a while back in the college where we
were talking about how we can really
easily perceive information when a
position is used and it's nice that we
have a linguistic way of conveying that
row row row your boat is a cannon that's
a simple cannon but it's kind of a pity
that we had to give up the the
positional representation but the answer
is because music isn't a side effect as
I lied at the start of my talk music
like everything else at this college is
data so we happen to represent it by
pumping it to our speakers which causes
vibrations in the air but why couldn't
we equally just graph it so that's using
quill and that's row row row your boat
and you can see the symmetry between the
two pieces in fact let's enhance our
definition of canons so we're actually
marking all the accompaniment
accompanying notes by by giving them a
part of follow up and they'll be able to
see what's going on a little bit more
clearly
there we go so you can see visually
using position what the original melody
looks like in the pink and what the
accompaniment looks like in the blue but
that's quite a simple transformation and
as you might expect a master like bark
use kind of more complicated concepts so
it can only have a quarter which is the
piece of classical music I showed you
right at the start of the tour is a
cannon that is produced by functionally
composing together an interval cannon a
mirror cannon and a simple cannon so in
graphical terms it's dropped by three
it's flipped and then it's delayed by
three which is quite a difficult thing
to pull off
so before I play you can only look
quarter I might just give you the
original melody without the
transformation just so you can hear how
complicated that is on its own
all right so that's the first little bit
of cannoli other quarter just with the
original melody you can probably hear
the runs going up and down that that I
talked about earlier um but of course it
has a transformation she'll put in here
it has a bass part and let's just for
the sake of seeing exactly what's going
on let's play it again let's play the
fool cannoli
Ella quarter with all three parts and
let's graph it
so you can see the symmetry between your
visual
so you can see there's a symmetry
between the original part and the the
translated part and you can also see the
triples that are that are part of the
base and because we're working in a
general-purpose programming language we
were able to express things in a quiet
domain and even custom domain specific
way but we didn't have to give up
translating it back into graphical
representation when we wanted to many
people like live music and my own
personal theory as to why people enjoy
live music is that just as every note is
being played just as the the strings
being plucked before it dropped was dead
on the ground there's a possibility that
it could have been something else the
musician could have changed their mind
they could have made a mistake so
there's the idea that it's it's a live
live music and so if you use code to
represent music what does that mean well
you could say the code is immortal music
this is on github right you could you
can fork it you can submit a pull
request you can as I have done use git
bisect to work out where you mess it up
this music can always be something else
so long as you know you have a closure
environment and you have a willingness
to transform it so I do have a
willingness to transform it so I'm gonna
play something slightly different so I'm
going to take the scale and I'm gonna
play it a little bit higher I'm gonna
use a as my reference point
I'm gonna use my in a rather than major
so the patterns are the vegan small
jumps I'm gonna be different and I might
make it slightly faster and so because
I've got these nice abstractions this is
a nice dry place that I can make these
changes if I'd individually annotated
every note literally I would have needs
to go through every note in the piece to
make this change so this is canola avec
quarter as bark would not have intended
it and I'll bet that the effect is a
little bit more like the theme tune of a
gritty cop drama and this a little bit
less like that the themes you know of
maybe a costume drama
you can you can play around with that
for hours right and that the shape is
still the same and if you hadn't guessed
that I'm just doing a simple filter on
which notes are in the past to work out
which ones to play and which ones not to
play but just because I've kind of
trivialized one of the greatest pieces
of western music - please don't imagine
that creating a cannon is a trivial
exercise it's it's really difficult to
create a melody that makes sense when
you play it on its own but also makes
sense when you you mess around with it
in a functional way a barque was
definitely a genius even amongst
composers you know he took a formal
austere system and managed to you know
using his human creativity give
expression to a really beautiful idea
and I find that really inspiring as a
programmer because I think there's a
little bit of an hour log with what we
do you know we take the beautiful crisp
but formal abstractions that you know
our programming language gives us and we
use that to express ourselves perhaps
not in in quite as artistic way as that
um but I know I take satisfaction in
having an idea and being able to
represent it and I've heard a lot about
how closure is a great you know language
for the enterprise we can build simple
services etc with it that's absolutely
true and I definitely believe that you
know closure is a like bringing or is it
a scimitar to a spoon fight or or
whatever Neil Ford's analogy was but I
don't think that's the reason that most
of you are here it's certainly not the
reason I'm here the reason I'm here is
that expressing yourself is fun and in
terms of programming language closure is
the best tool yet I've come across to
express myself thanks very much
