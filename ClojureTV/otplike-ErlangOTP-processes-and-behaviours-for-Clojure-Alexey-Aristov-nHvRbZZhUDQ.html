I'm Eric Sierra stop and I will speak
today about OTP like our approach
towards OTP like processes and behaviors
for closure
based on our experience from Airlink
unfortunately my pointer is slightly
hopeless here and I will have a lot of
code so I will try to sum up on the
upper side of the code lower side of the
code and so on winter doesn't work and
very sorry for that so first of all I
will start with a little recap of
chorusing who here in the audience has
an experience with chorusing almost
everyone cool so then it will be short
so correcting is a very good basis for a
synchronous programming in closure and
even in clojurescript it provides you
with lightweight processes go blocks
which in case of closure are implemented
they run on top of thread pool executors
it provides you with channels which can
communicate which allow communication
between go blocks and change data it has
a lot of useful primitives just some of
them you can do publish subscribe you
can do the tap on tab to broadcast
messages other thing you have arts and
so on it's a very good thing actually we
used it a lot for different applications
but unfortunately or fortunately just
it's not that bad but it just so it
works it's slightly to low level I mean
that you have to take care of a lot of
small things to get your application
working reliable stable and so on this
is a short example which will
demonstrate into what kind of problems
you may run if you are not very careful
with Nico I think I have two code
snippets the visible pretty well we are
on the left side I have a producer which
does nothing else than places someday
on channel recursively and on the right
side we have a consumer which reads the
data from the channel processes that and
loops again so what are the potential
problems in this code first of all you
can easily basically lock the whole
system by crashing the right side
imagine if our process function froze an
exception and this go loop terminates
forever
our producer will work for a while
depending on the channel behind it then
some bad pressure will get applied we
run out of channel and our producer will
stop it will never know that consumer
just crashed it's also little bit
unclear who owns the channel basically
way to declare it should it be disposed
together with the consumer maybe with
producer what if there are several
consumers it's easy to run into mistake
when you start to consume and to
consumer start to consume from the same
channel sometimes this is what you want
sometimes not just question of a lot of
a lot of smoke is I'm not talking about
time outs here yes we can easily
implement timeouts handling what if
consumer doesn't receive a message
within certain time but here it grows
and grows and grows and code you have to
do a lot of a lot of small things to get
your code properly done all you have to
build some sort of framework some sort
of structure on top of chorusing so we
did but because in our company we have a
significant not a big experience with
Erlang OTP who has a wrong OTP
experience slightly less but still we
decide okay why to invent something on
our own let's better reuse some ideas
from Arirang and try to apply it to
closure and core sync so it's a
functional language we are on the
functionaries conference so it's nothing
new for us it has lightweight processes
as the building blocks it's not
based on GBM it has its own very
specific virtual machine with soft
real-time properties and so on but all
in all its function language with
lightweight process it's an old thing it
was developed in 86 I think that's
release so it has a lot of experience
behind it and there are a lot many many
proven design patterns which can be
reused and they're tested with time it
has built-in distribution features that
means you can send messages between
operating system process nodes we're not
sure yet if we're going to implement it
an OTP like or not but this has it and
this has just small snippet for those
who haven't seen it's arguably but some
people say it's a little bit weird and
strange how to write in it yes so what
is OTP like it's a simple pure closure
library it has basically two major
dependencies it depends on Quora sync or
synchronous traffic channels and code
blocks and it depends on core match you
know in a long pattern matching is a
very important part of language so we
use it also very actively it emulates a
small subset of a long OTP features not
everything I think we we discussed it
recently maybe I don't know the cover to
three percent of her long quantity it's
in no way replacement for airline
quality auto very clear reason it's an
advert or machine basically it's no
chance even to try to approach along
with in Java world so it's not a
replacement it's just an idea how to
reuse certain patterns so from now on I
will start speaking about OTP like
itself normal introductions what if you
like as along introduces a concept of
process basic a process is a go block
we've attached in box it slightly more
than just the channel actuates two
channels but logical it's an inbox and
some control structures that handle
certain things which we'll discuss later
it's definitely possible to send
messages the process any closure term
can be
message processes obviously can receive
and handle these messages a process
definition the presentation-wise it
looks almost like a normal closure
function definition
you start processes with OTP spawn
function and family of these functions
every started process is identified by
its process ID so once you've found the
process you get back a process ID and
then you can reference this process for
example you can send messages to this
process it is possible to reduce the
process under a global name in global
namespace with all magic around that for
example and process terminates it gets
automatically unregistered so you can
address process not only by prosody but
with a global name so here is our little
example of OTP light process for the
first example I include all included
also some initial declarations when a we
require articulate process namespace
refer some of them they move when we
have approached progressing statement we
define a process name it hello world
inside this process we do nothing else
than receive a message and print this
message that's it and then we found this
process we use process bound function
pass hello world to it receive process
ad back and use a summation marks and
function to send a hello world message
the bid our process will receive this
message and safely terminate it's the
most primitive thing you can do with out
if you like
but with demonstrates how processes look
let's now take a closer look at how
process definition looks what's in there
so that's already extended version of it
we have received internally receive is
basically a pattern or managed structure
based on core match it consists of pairs
of pattern and some code to do so this
process can receive message two types of
messages one message is tuple or vector
Jesus closure with keyword print the
first element and some message as a
second element in this case it will
print this message and recursively
restart receiving again and it can
receive an exit message of keywords exit
which just returns basically terminate
the process additionally to that we have
to notice that life in Erlang if there
is no appropriate match shall profit
pattern process will crash and will
cease to exist and we added a timeout
feature which is very important so you
can optionally add after and then some
time out in milliseconds it means that
if no message arrives within this time
the timeout sender will get in in this
case will simply print receive timeout
and restart everything recursively so
this is our process definition together
with pattern match next process on their
own it's very nice but we want to handle
them somehow together look at Aaron
provides a very very extremely important
concept called process linking what does
it mean actually linking is a special
connection between two processes which
defines has the following property if
one of these processes crash exit
another one will do so as well we have
it in or if you like what is important
linking is be directional so if process
a is linked to process B process B is
automatically linked to put a this
operation linking is atomic be
directional and it is very important for
arrow recovery and supervision I will
speak about later actually the idea is
that you group several processes which
are some correlated together if one of
them crashes and perhaps leave something
in an inconsistent state it's quite
important to kill processes around it
which also may be a little bit confused
and inconsistent
it's a way to clean up an errant world
there is this idea of early craft le
fail approach so let's take a look at
the linking example so here we have two
processes process 1 and process 2 and
small snippet of course of code which a
does something process 1 is very simple
it starts spawned another process which
is processed to receives a message pass
this message is basically process one
can handle any message processes to
process tool and recursively continues
process 2 2 is slightly different it can
accept only messages of certain
structure again our tuple our vector of
message keyword and something and prints
a message and now with phone process 1
process to get spouts automatically and
we send an unsupported message to it
process 1 is still ok process message to
the process to process to crashes but
because here we use strong link function
before we spawn here Sparling these
processes are get linked together and
process 1 will exit as well in case of
such a year or so after we run the
snippet after some time out of things
things are synchronous both process will
process will die cutting
it's the typo typo sorry yes of course
you can do it by you can link processes
with using spam link function or you can
do it somewhere on the fly there are
linked and unlink functions which can be
used to build quite more more
sophisticated combination of that next
example trap exit every process has
certain number with the attributes flags
and so on I will not speak about all of
them I will speak only about one it's
called trap exit there's a function
called process vlog which allows you to
send a slide named trap exit here we
said true what does it mean exit flag
allows process to convert exits to
regular messages it means if I have two
processes which are linked together
one of them has attracted set to true
second one crushers in this case the
first one instead of being killed that
automatically will receive a regular
message of some predefined structure
which will notify that his neighbour
basic equation and here we have an
example we I skipped process too
from the previous example is just the
same code we start process - we are
trapping exits we receive messages I
will start from the second message M
just anything which stages all passed to
process - but if we receive message of
type exit it's a tuple of three elements
keyword exit process ID and the exit
reason instead of terminating we restart
process - and continue so here we have
the situation to have a process which
observes another one perhaps its exit
and restart it again it's a very very
primitive example of what is called
supervision in our own world when one
process basically supervises and
monitors another one without such a
ability will obviously get make could
get a situation when one crash will kill
basically the whole system
as a chain of subsequent linked exits
and here if certain process has trap
exits set to true it's a point where
crash
propagation stops and we can make some
decisions do something to recover
restart do some clever job next
processes are good but still it's two
level constructs to create something
more or less big what we need
usually we need some kind of worker
which can receive messages which are
will get already some semantics not just
messages usually some request you should
be able to respond to these messages it
should be able to maintain some state in
a consistent way and should be easily
usable theoretically and if this talk
would be longer I would demonstrate how
to in several step build such a
construct just out of plain processes
but we have not that much time so I will
skip this intermediate things and
immediately show how generic server
works so it's something which basically
internally is the process you can
receive synchrony owes a secure or a
synchronous requests to it it provides
synchronized access to state state
consistent is guaranteed in a sense that
if generic server terminates all its
state is discarded and becomes
unavailable it means we'll never get
into some data which is probably a
little bit broken or wrong that's what I
say discard state and crash internally
just the process so it has all
properties of usual process you can link
generic servers to other processes it
can trap exits and receive messages
about crashes and logically it can be
seen as a very very small micro service
which helps you structure your
application here I'm introducing another
very simple concept called behavior
behavior nothing else then in case of
along its along has modules and closure
has namespaces basically if I have a
module with several functions with
predefined with well agreed names I say
I define the behavior in case of closure
is the same we may have a namespace with
several functions with predefined name
in this case I have three functions one
function is called I needed require that
must be in any generic sort behavior
handle calls and dual cousins are a
couple of others which are skipped for
simplicity are optional and are required
only in case I wanted like to achieve
something on a lower level it's possible
to define behavior simply by
implementing ai-jen server protocol but
it usually leads to slightly more
verbose code and not to my taste it's
not as convenient as using predefined
functions or namespaces so here is our
first simple generic server what is
important we have a I need call back all
these callbacks are called with a by the
framework I need is impossible in is
responsible for a very simple basic
operation it receives some parameters in
this example it has no parameters and it
has to return initial state of the
process if these parameters are valid so
here we say that we are returning we are
we're fine we return initial state which
is an empty map and we can go ahead then
second callback is called handle call
this callback is invoked
every time someone wants to
synchronously access our generic service
first parameter is a message second we
skip for now and the third is very
important is this is our state so with
every request we receive a state we send
all this request and we are responsible
for returning new state if we want to
modify it or in this simple example we
return same state without any change
here we match on message we support only
one type of message wishes add
which adds two numbers so it's our very
simple generic server which adds numbers
and we reply with our result a 1 a 2
plus and we return the same state as
before state has not changed then for
convention we create a kind of wrapper
function just regular closure function
we add another parameter first one it's
a process ID of the server we have to
address it somehow and we use a GL
generic service called function to pass
the requests the server and finally our
example we start generic server and
invoke add function with two parameters
and expect that it will work properly in
case we send a wrong message our generic
several will crash and obviously its
internal state will get discarded here
we have slightly more advanced example
where show how to deal with internal
server state in addition to add message
which is same almost same we added
another one which is called count which
supposed to return how many times this
number how many times our generic server
was called for adding something imagine
you want to charge our customer for
adding numbers in the irony's method we
our initial state is already more
advanced it's not just empty map it's a
map with a count property with initial
value 0 our add function is almost the
same decides that we money modify the
state we receive you see the third
parameter of handle call function we
receive initial state and then we do
update in state increment count very
simple now with every call to add our
counter gets incremented and we have
another message called count we just
returns count
feel the account attributes of our state
and return return state unmodified we
have wrappers we have add and we have
get count and we use them here I use the
chance to demonstrate another thing that
we it's possible to register our generic
servers under some names so here my
service is a ID our instance of our
generic service the process associated
with it gets registered and we can use
it to reference without knowing process
ID directly if our servers will crash
our generic server will crash
of course this registration will be
discarded next supervisor's previous
example was good but it's like an maybe
scroll for a second too bad but if you
look to the strange where we should
reduce the way we should start our
services at which point and more
important what shall we do if our
process terminates out of some reason it
gets unregistered and our server will be
gone forever in this case we have to
have a special party who is responsible
for starting and maybe restarting our
servers so for this we have supervisors
they're responsible for starting generic
servers and by the way other supervisors
and providers are responsible for
restarting processes in case of crash
it's a special the generic server so it
has all the properties of generic server
internally it has a model of declarative
start specification I will show an
example later with more details but in
fact nothing else than a list of generic
servers that have to be started and
managed by the given supervisor
it initially starts it's children
according to start specification and
restarts them in case of crash in case
of any problems its soup or so-called
restart strategies and Here I am
specified one for one one one parole one
for the rest this is a very important
story because actually it's very often
there may have several generic servers
which are related to each other that has
to be have something in common to be
somehow synchronized and what is very
important to know that if one of them
crashes and other may get restarted or
not restarted depending on what your
program so we have three strategies they
specify how a neighbor processes are
managed in case of one for one it's the
simplest case our supervisor will just
restart the process the server's which
has crashed it's a simple case one for
all means if one of these processes
crashed supervisor will kill all its
neighbors and restart them altogether it
means we're sure that even if one
participant of our supervisor crashed
got restarted it means received new
state started from scratch all its
neighbors have to do the same this will
guarantee that they are synchronized and
can cooperate together properly and once
arrest it's basically something in
between it means that it's almost like
one for all we restart others but only
those others which started after the
crashing service usually you start
services in the order of their
dependents and obviously if there is a
there are processes which started
somewhere before the crashed one they
are not dependent on it and then there
is no need to restart it basically it's
a sort of optimization to avoid
necessary restarts as I mentioned it's
the absolutely normal practice to have
other supervisors as a child of another
so in the end you have something which
is called supervision 3i below these
pictures from some open source allen
book here green cycles are supervisors
and blue cycles are workers or generic
servers some process which are really in
charge of doing something useful if you
have certain experience and feeling for
this it's absolutely normal practice
when you design your whole application
is a big big big big supervision tree
with many many elements that that can be
10 20 50 of them each small server is
responsible for its own small part they
coordinate and supervisors manage them
and restart in case of something is
wrong discarded state and let things
move ahead here before our examples were
basically fake and here I decided to
make a snippet it's still very much
reduced just to fit on the screen it's a
small snippet from real-life code
it shows the supervision specification
child specification you see we have 1 2
3 how many 7 I think children and some
of them are generic services like is the
service responsible for configuration we
have an HTTP server we have a database
connection server some of these children
are supervisor supervisors in self for
example have a section supervisor which
holds session processes which are
definitely some kind of client-server
architecture and the session supervisor
is in charge of holding user sessions
why it's a separate supervisor the
reasons very simple this one is one
parole it means if one of these services
will crash all others will get restarted
but the user session crash is a normal
operation that we receive the incorrect
request from the client side and we want
to crash our session so obviously it has
to have impact only on the user
application the client application so we
move them to a separate supervisor means
user session will crash maybe depends if
we do it cleverly it will even crash and
restart reconnect and recover our
communication between client and server
but all other participant of the
application will never notice it so it's
kind of normal practice to have
supervisor so such let's say no more
more transient entities like sessions so
this is our real life supervisor and now
I will 30 minutes we have 40 I will go
again back to some generic words to just
about the conclusion so we internally as
a company we're consulting the
consultancy company based in Germany
we're from South from Stuttgart we find
it very useful actually we are
developing a big system for letting
prescribe so one of the major German car
producers from the south and part of
Germany put it that way and this
prototype project is pretty far now and
actually the story behind LTP like is
like I started our first version was
built just on plane and core I think it
is a job but it requires a lot of a lot
of attention a lot of a lot of let's say
policy and discipline to make it a
proper stable reliable and clean so we
start to think okay what can we improve
which is that ok we take our past
experience from rank and moved it to our
world currently OTP like is used in two
major project as far as I know projects
that our automotive project and this
the project in the field of engineering
systems actually produces a software
which is used by engineers who produce
you could design cars as far as I know
there is another project here in Berlin
in the banking there is some banking
financial technology in tech orders the
buzzword for that startup here they're
using it as well so what are the next
steps what we're moving we still have
plenty of things to do we want to get it
running in the closure script and
actually we're pretty close to that
point I had a dream that I could even
demonstrate it here but unfortunately we
had some other more urgent things and
we're not able to do it but I guess
sooner or later it will be there because
actually I want to have similar
structures inside the browser which is
able to talk with the server and hear
remoting and distribution comes in we're
not sure if we want to create a
full-sized remoting like in Erlang
perhaps it will be a limited remoting
which will only work between closure
script version about if you like and
closure version so it's nice way for
client-server communication and you can
build other things on top of it it's
nice and firm connection crashes it gets
restarted State gets recovered and you
can make very very interesting things
out of it we want to support so-called
applications applications of the kind of
higher-level unit in Erlang query group
basically super version 3 and to a more
less independent entity which can be
combined together this we don't have it
unfortunately distribution is
it was mentioned by me I think something
will be there but it's the open question
we want a more advanced purchase process
registry right now our Porsche process
Register process registry something
which associates um conventional names
we convenient names with process IDs it
it works now we have it as in the state
as it is in real life along but there is
such a thing as G proc it's an external
library for long which provides much
more advanced much more sophisticated
ways to reduce their processes for
example it's possible to register
several processes on the same name if
you do it properly and then you can send
message to the group of processes it's a
very nice way to create
publish/subscribe architecture so i want
to inform every process which registered
itself under some predefined name we
have of course flexibility and nice
chance to add additional things or
modify a little bit here and there
semantics of our lunk we don't have to
struggle for compatibility as along
people do actually I skipped it all in
the presentation but here and there to
have some nice additional gimmicks one
of the examples is our timeout handler
in diversity in the receive block
instead of time in milliseconds you can
pass a channel and this timeout will
fire once this channel gets closed you
can do very nice inter inter variability
between OTP like processes and still can
the conventional plain a coercing code a
little bit of information project on the
github welcome right now it's still
quite simple
but it's fairly reliable we have I think
several hundreds of who very thoroughly
done test cases
thank you for my calling Simon he did a
great job with testing and we are pretty
sure that in most cases
it works well if anyone is interested
about our Longo teepee there is a very
good open source book learn use summer
Lancome and actually pictures few
pictures in the presentation are taken
from this book I would encourage
everyone at least to take a look you
know if you don't language it's not
necessary you'll program it but you may
use some ideas or some insights on that
you can subscribe to my Twitter
supermagic AV I am NOT a very social
person
I don't tweet too often but at least
some reason almonds and other things are
there
our company is super Matic net if you
want you can visit us or apply for a job
who have some openings actually they
were in them this job letter or job
announcement for the conference or visit
us in Stuttgart we can have a beer one
more thing I mentioned maybe it's more
relevant to the previous slide were
several things which are also supported
but are not mentioned to the
presentation just for the simplicity and
to make it slightly shorter but we have
monitoring as well to linking it's a
very important thing and we have
monitors fully supported we have timers
so you can do some delays some regular
event and so on and they fight many
different things around minor things
copied from Aaron who TP here and there
for our convenience that was it it's 36
minutes out of 40 and now we have 4
minutes left for questions if you have
