tutorial on how to write a reducible
collection when I first started with
closure there was a very useful tutorial
on how to write a lazy seek in the
original closure book this is gonna be
the same thing a recipe on how to make a
reducible collection I will tell you
what that is in a moment but this was
spurred on by a tweet where it's at
closure to be a hundred times more
useful if it did stream fusion stream
Fusion is a feature that's in the
Haskell compiler where it understands
what map and filter are and it's able to
sort of elide them away and get rid of
them and get rid of all the intermediate
manipulation that they that that they
cause so closure 1-7 already really has
stream fusion essentially in user space
without any involvement of the compiler
it's super practical there are a lot of
tutorials on transducers this is not
going to be one of them but just as a
refresher if you have a bunch of
transformations that are performed with
a bunch of intermediate collections
transducers allow you to make an uber
transformation and get rid of
intermediate collections among other
amazing benefits so this is not I'm not
going to show you transducers what I
want to show you is how to make the
production of values more efficient so
if you think of the function into
enclosure it has three arguments a
source collection a destination
collection and a transducer well
transducers are about making the
transformation better you can think of
transience and persistent about you know
making the destination better and you
know what in a sense what I'm gonna show
you is how to make the source collection
better how to make producing values
better and specifically how to make a
collection that is only a collection in
the abstract it's something that knows
how to be reduced and it does so without
any lazy seeks or and or using any
reified data structures and so an
example of this is somebody on the
mailing list
used this technique to implement a
reducible collection on top of a jdbc
resultset you can think of result sets
as you know there's sources of values
and you could reduce over the source but
you can do so without using a lazy seek
and so what they did was you know they
they implemented this technique and it
didn't break any sweat it was fast they
actually had to put counters in to make
sure that it was really working which is
hilarious okay closure 1:7 already has a
lot of these improvements for specific
functions like range cycle iterate
repeat there's a few others I want to
show you how to make this happen for
your own collection it's all through an
interface there's a bunch of different
interfaces we're gonna just focus on I
reduce in it please don't call the
reduce parity without the net value
because you're gonna run into trouble
this is the reduce arity with the net
value three arguments the collection the
net value and the transformation the
reduction okay so here's the step we're
gonna break it down first thing you do
you remember your net value then you're
gonna start producing values you're
gonna call the reduction value the
reduction function on those values you
produce you're gonna check whether the
reduction function told you to stop and
finally you're gonna loop up to the top
so step by step we're gonna implement
range and a simplified version of range
that only steps up by one every time so
this is the lazy seek version looks
familiar so here's the skeleton
you're gonna reify this interface call
the arguments are f and an it it's just
going to make everything clear so ahrefs
that reduce the reducing function that
somebody's going to pass in that's a
skeleton first thing you do you remember
the emit okay we're gonna set up a loop
with an accumulator set that to the init
at the beginning
now you're gonna produce some values and
you're gonna call the reduction function
so a little bit more code so we're gonna
set up an intermediate I counter that's
just gonna step through the range and
we're gonna if if I is before the end
we're going to call the reducing
function and we're going to recur back
to the top incrementing I
okay now every time you call that
reducing function immediately check for
the reducing function telling you to
stop okay so you're gonna check for
early termination you should do this
right after you call reduce so that's
this is how you do it you call this
reduced predicate with the question mark
and if it is reduced you're gonna unwrap
the reduce value and just abort the loop
here's an example of using this function
that was it so here's how you use it so
here's the three arity into we're gonna
have a transducer in the middle it works
trust me here's an example of using it
with the early termination the take
transducer has to do this early
termination so that also works if you
kind of stick to this recipe
there's a couple other usages seán core
field implemented a reducible JDBC query
based on these ideas you should
implement your stuff with this with this
formula
and if you think reducing and reifying
an interface is gross and doing that
every time it's kind of a lot of code
and the the reduced handling is subtle
you can make it generic here's a version
of a function that takes sort of this a
stateful production function F and an
end of stream marker we call it will
call it fin and you can do that you can
use this to implement line seek without
the seeks it's just a pure reducible
version of line seek and you could see
the the production function there is
just reading a line from the from the
bufferedreader if it's done it's gonna
return nil so you're gonna say that nil
is your fin and that's it there's some
more generic functions on this gist but
I hope that gives you a succinct
tutorial on how to do these things
because it's sort of exotic knowledge
now and I want to make it more
accessible thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
