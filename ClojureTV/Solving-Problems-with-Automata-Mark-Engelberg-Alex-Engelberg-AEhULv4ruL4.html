and this is hi I'm Alex Engelberg and
our talk today is solving problems with
automata so hopefully some of you have
seen this kind of picture before this is
a standard picture of a finite automaton
which is another name for a finite state
machine there are a bunch of states
indicated by circles there are
transitions indicated by arrows there is
a start state and there are one or more
accepting States usually indicated by a
double circle the automaton we say it
accepts a sequence of transitions if
that sequence of transitions leads you
from the start state to one of the
accepting States so for example in this
automaton it accepts the sequence 0 1 1
0 because that leads you from start to
the one accepting state in this
automaton now I used to be a computer
game developer and for many years this
is how I personally use finite state
machines as a way to design and code
very simple game AI so what you see here
is a picture of a sentry in a game who
is responding to different events by
changing behavioral States from
attacking to patrolling and I've lately
actually been seeing very similar
diagrams being used to design core async
processes because this is just a great
way to show how a process responds to
incoming events and messages over a
channel to change its state now a few
years ago I became aware that there is a
lot more you can do with finite state
machines than just this though and once
I realized that I started noticing many
many different contexts where finite
automata can come into play so today
what I'd like to do
is well the two of us are going to show
some puzzles because I'm a big believer
in the educational value of puzzles so
we're gonna show a few programming
puzzles where automata give particularly
elegant solutions to these programming
puzzles and our hope is that at the end
of the talk you'll come away from it
with an expanded notion of what kinds of
things you can do with automata and know
how to do it in closure so the first
puzzle today is something called the
maximal nan segment some problem so the
idea is you have a sequence of integers
and you are trying to find the maximum
sum you can get by adding up some
numbers in this sequence some
subsequence of these numbers the catch
is these numbers can't all be in a
contiguous block we call a continuous
block subsequence a segment so we're
looking for ones that are not a segment
so here down at the bottom we see some
examples we have the sequence of numbers
and these are some different
combinations we might look at the read
numbers you can see we can't do any
single Tunes for example because the
singleton counts as a segment the empty
subsequence
doesn't count because that would be
considered a segment so you need at
least two numbers and they have to have
some kind of gap between them somewhere
in this particular example the maximum
sum you can achieve in this way would be
five by adding up the numbers four or
five and negative four but they're the
three numbers together do not make a
contiguous segments so that's the key
well that's a singleton and so a number
by itself is considered a segment so
that would not be a solution make sense
it's a little bit of a tricky concept
but we're looking for a subsequence that
is not considered a segment now when
you're faced with a problem like this
it's often not obvious how to proceed
one of the best strategies is to just
come up with any algorithm you can
that's gonna solve the problem even just
some kind of crazy brute-force method so
this would be an outline of sort of a
brute-force approach that might work we
need to generate all of the non segments
sub sequences sum them all up and take
the maximum right that's pretty much the
definition of the problem it's not
entirely obvious though how we write
this all non segments sub sequences
function now there's a couple insights
that can get us in the right direction
though the first insight is that every
subsequence can be expressed with a bit
mask of zeros and ones so here we see
like that in the first example we're
selecting negative 1 &amp;amp; 5 out of the
sequence so we put ones in those
positions it's very easy to implement a
closure function that takes a bit mask
and a sequence and extracts out the
subsequence
now the catch becomes how can we
recognize from these bit masks whether
it is a segment subsequence or a non
segment subsequence there's a few ways
we can do this but the way that leads us
in the most interesting direction here
is to think about the fact that the
sequences that form non segments and bit
masks can be described with a regular
expression so in this case we're saying
we start off with a bunch of zeros
perhaps which is the things we're not
selecting and at some point we have to
start selecting some numbers we get a
run of one
but then at some point we need that gap
so we're gonna have to pick we're gonna
have to stop picking things that's a
bunt run of zeros and then some point we
need to pick something again and once
we've done that we have our we have
picked some things that have a gap
between them and from now on we can pick
either 0 or 1 for a bit mass so this
would be a regular expression that
describes a non segment bitmask now the
next key point about this is that every
regular expression has a corresponding
finite state machine of corresponding on
tamo time this is one of the big results
of automata theory is that there's this
correspondence
the other cool thing is that Zack
tullman wrote a library called automat
that makes it really easy to build such
a a state machine so in this case what
we're doing you know we could maybe try
to use the built-in regular expression
machinery but we want to do this kind of
regular expression pattern-matching on a
sequence of numbers and so this is the
natural way to do it with this automat
library so what's going on here is you
see this is basically in fix notation
for the regular expression I mean not in
fix the opposite prefix notation for for
the regular expression and then you do
compile at the end and that builds this
finite state machine this is a very
useful library now there's a couple
other interesting things you can do with
of the automat library one is you can
visualize these automata that you've
built with this view function in the VIS
namespace and this is the picture you
see up at the top and you can see this
is doing exactly what we expect we can
have a bunch of 0 the transitions and
then we eventually need a 1 transition
we can have some more ones we eventually
you know there's 0 and eventually
another one and then at that point it
doesn't matter what we do the other
really key function in the automat core
namespace this is function advanced
we're used to thinking of automata as
very
stateful entities but the automat
library embraces the closure view of
these things as immutable data so
advanced is a function that takes an
automaton and it takes the current state
of the automaton which is some kind of
immutable object and it returns a new
state so a completely different object
representing the new state so that means
that we can advance through the we can
sort of step through all the processes
of an automaton by taking the output
from one and just feeding it right into
the next function at the very beginning
we don't necessarily have a state to
feed it and at the very beginning you
can feed in the automat library you can
feed it an initial value that kind of
gets stored and passed around and that
lets you do some interesting things you
can design your automata to update the
value in interesting ways
as you progress but in this particular
example we're not really using that so I
just pass a nil at the beginning in nil
just gets threaded through as a value
but what's really interesting here is
the way you keep sort of passing in the
return state to the next call the
function to step through it once you
have this advance function it's not hard
at all to write this non-segmented mask
predicate function basically we just
kind of do a reduction on the sequence
by keep stepping through the automaton
with each of the numbers as the next
transition and at the end we look to see
if it's in an accepted state or not at
this point we have the tools we need to
to build that all non segment sub
sequences function so what I've done
here is I've used the from the math
combinatorics library the Cartesian
product function which lets us build a
sequence of all of the zeros and ones of
the right length as as the original
sequence
and then we filter the drink water for a
second we need to filter on this
non-segmented mask and then we do that
apply bit mask function to extract out
all the sequences okay so now that
initial brute-force strategy it would
actually work we've implemented all non
segments sub sequences so this thing
would work just fine very slow though
right it's o of two to the N I mean
because at some point you got to
generate all the zero and one
combinations for the length of this
sequence so the question is can we do
better and the answer is yes
the first observation that kind of gets
us in the direction of doing this
quicker is that right now we are first
generating all these subsequence we're
making all the passes through and then
at the end we're summing it all up and
so the first question we might ask is
can we do both of those processes in one
pass and the answer is yes we can so if
we have a sequence in the bit mask we
can both check whether this is an on
segment subsequence and find the sum all
in one pass pretty straightforwardly we
start off knowing we're in state q0 and
with the sum of 0 and when we see a 0 in
the bit mask we update the state but we
don't update the sum when we see a 1 we
update the state based on the transition
diagram and we also update the sum and
we just keep moving through the sequence
like this and at the very end we see
we're in state q3 which means we're in
the accepting state we did find that
this was a non segment subsequence and
we know what the sum was okay well how
does that help us
it helps us because there's this really
cool thing we can do which is to analyze
all possible sub sequences and do the
sum or find the maximum sum all at the
same time in one pass and here's how it
works we start off again knowing that
we're in state q0 with a sum of 0
now for this first number as we're
making one pass through the sequence
what we do is we consider both
possibilities for the bitmask it could
be 0 or 1 if it were the 0 we would end
up in state q0 with a sum of 0 and if it
were 1 we'd end up in state q1 with a
sum of negative 1 makes sense now
for the next step again for each of the
two possibilities we found before we're
going to branch out and look at what
would happen if we did the 0 transition
what would happen if we did the 1
transition so again we get a bunch of
states and sums but look here we have a
duplicate for q1 and we only care about
finding the maximum so this q1 three is
irrelevant it's already dominated by
this q1 four possibility so we can just
collapse it down to this again for the
next one for every state and sum we have
we look at the different possibilities
what if we saw 0 what if we saw 1 next
in the bit mask with this particular
number in the sequence so we're either
going to add in the 5 if it's a 1
transition or not if it's 0 and again we
get all these possibilities and we get
some duplicates and again we eliminate
the ones that aren't the maximum so this
allows us to keep going down all the way
to the end each time we do sort of an
expansion and then a collapse and then
at the very end state q3 is the only
accepting state so only the sequences
that landed us in state q3 are the ones
that were the non segments and so this
is the maximum sum you can get 5 that's
our answer right there so that's so you
can do this with one pass and here's
what the code looks like in closure one
of the things I did here just to sort of
demonstrate how you would do this in
closure is I took the transition
information and embedded it right in the
code right here so this is a great way
if you already know the transitions and
you don't need a library like automat
you can just encode this directly in
closure as a map so we have a map that
says from state q0 if i sees 0 i go to
q0
if I see one I go to q1 so this is just
a straightforward representation of that
transition diagram and then this
reduction is exactly the algorithm I
described it each part we look at what
happens if the transition is 0 or 1 we
there's add to the sum if it's 1 or not
if it's 0 and we're using max to kind of
merge all this together at each step
then at the very end we look at what's
in q3 so this is exactly the algorithm I
described now interestingly you can
generalize this right because this
process works with any kind of sub
sequence where we can describe that bit
mask by a regular expression so let's
generalize this to a function called
maximum sum that takes the regular
expression that we're looking for for
the bit mass and the sequence so this is
the problem we just discussed because
this is the this is going to be how the
non segments reg X so this is the non
set maximal nan segment some well some
of you may have seen there's a fairly
popular interview problem is to find the
maximum segment sum which is actually
considerably easier than this problem
but this general purpose function can do
both of them you just plug in a
different regular expression or we could
do something totally crazy like the
maximum length where we're extracting
segments of exactly length 3 or
something like that as long as we can
describe it with a regular expression
this algorithm can do it and oh of n
time one pass we could even step it up a
little bit and have it show us both the
sum and the bit mask that it used to
find it now I've included all this code
for these the generalized functions on
the github site and also showed another
example with an alternative automata
library for closure called reduce FSM
and these are so you can look there for
more I we have a lot more we want to
cover but hopefully this gives you a
sense of some of the power of what you
can do basically what's going on in the
algorithm
if you look at the website is I'm using
insta parse to pull apart that regular
expression string and then I use the
automat library to rebuild the actual
automata and then at the automaton and
then extract the state transitions out
of it to do the exact algorithm that I
did before so the big ideas from what
I've discussed so far is that the
automat library is a very powerful tool
for working with automata it's
especially useful if you have in your
head like some sort of regular
expression style description of what you
want to match against and you want to
build a finite state machine it does
that for you and the other big ideas
here that pretty much anytime you see
something that looks like a reg X you
should be thinking of finite state
machines and for best performance as we
saw in this particular problem you
ideally want to interleave that process
of constraint checking with your
computation now these last two points
thinking of finite state machines as
constraints and interleaving constraint
checking with computation this might
make you think of a there's a whole
branch of programming called constraint
programming and that's pretty much what
that is all about is doing constraints
and interleaving the constraints with
computation now Alex wrote a library for
closure called loco which makes it very
easy to do constraint programming from
within closure so next he's going to
talk a bit about how automata fit into
the local library ok ok so I first
discovered constraint programming so so
first how many people here have heard of
that term constraint programming ok cool
so so it sounds like a lot of you have
at least heard that so I first heard
about constraint programming in a online
discrete optimization course and I was
really fascinated by that concept so I
think I like a couple years ago I
created a library called loco in closure
which is basically just a kind of a
closure friendly front-end
to a java library it's a it's a pretty
cool robust constraint programming
library called choko which you can also
go check out so in this talk so first
for those of you who haven't even heard
of constraint programming or those who
aren't really familiar with what it is
I'm going to give you sort of a
whirlwind tour of what that is just so
we're all on the same page then I'll
show you how we can sort of combine that
with automata so so the way loco works
is it works with finite domain integer
variables so basically any integer
variable that has a concrete minimum
maximum bound or some set of values it
could be so here we have a pretty simple
problem where we have variables x y&amp;amp;z
they're integers and they're in a finite
domain 1 to 10,000 and we have one
constraint which is X plus y plus Z
equals 5 so this is a pretty simple
program to just do manually brute-force
so it gives just a quick brute force
solution the problem is that this is
super slow mostly because of my
excessive domain size that really slows
it down
so I'll show you how how to do that in
loco and in a second I'll sort of
explaining you a kind of a secret behind
why this is faster than brute force but
first I'll kind of go through the syntax
of how I'm expressing this um logo so
here I'm creating a constraint model
which is a vector or a sequence of
constraints that I've constructed in a
loco namespace and here I'm saying x y&amp;amp;z
are in 10 in 1 to 10,000 and I have my
constraint here which is just kind of
elegant prefix notation that we all know
and like and I'm I have this model and I
can pass it to a function called
solutions which it just kind of consumes
that constraint structure and then it
gives you all the solutions or if I
wanted one solution I just say solution
singular and that would also work so if
I do this at the repple then first of
all it completes which is nice and and
also it gives you a sequence of maps and
for each map it gives you X Y Z so here
we have 6 possible solutions that were x
y&amp;amp;z add up to 5 so
what is the secret behind this so the
secret is a little thing called
propagators so in loco every time you
give it a constraint it's telling it to
to make a propagator for that so a
propagators job is to efficiently remove
from each variables domain all the
impossible values based on the
constraint that I gave it and so
essentially what a propagation engine
does is it sort of if you imagine like a
depth-first search but every time you go
into the search tree or make some kind
of decision then before you do that you
run all of your propagators to trim all
the domains first so here you're sort of
an example of that so here's our here's
our propagator model where we have the
domains and then we have one propagator
so the step one is to run all the
propagators and see what happens so here
we can deduce that x y&amp;amp;z cannot be four
or more just that makes total sense
because even if X were four then even at
the minimum values one and one for y and
z then that would already add up to more
than five so we can just deduce right
off the bat that XY and Z cannot be four
or more so we're just going to trim that
domain right that then in there then we
sort of start our search and then make a
decision and sort of guess that x equals
one and see what happens from there so
here we go back to the propagator step
and then there's there's no more
deductions we can make so we're gonna
make another random stab in the dark and
say y equals one and then see what
happens so our propagator picks in again
it says Z equals three so now we have a
solution so that was a very quickly
honed in on one possible solution and
then after that if we want to continue
finding solutions we would backtrack and
say okay remember that time when I said
y equals one now y is not 1 now let's
see what happens so I'm not going to
show the rest of the search but that's
basically the gist of propagators so
just to give you a taste of what kind of
constraints you might find in a
constraint engine these are all things
you can use in a constraint model and
they all have their own propagation
algorithms that do this so we have
inequality inequality
Jekel Mehta constraints which is kind of
cool and or not we have just some more
math stuff min max abs all that stuff
and then we have global constraints
which is sort of more advanced
properties on a list of variables so
here for example we have distinct which
is like all these very all these values
must be all different one more thing
before we dive in sort of just a little
loco trick I want to mention so you
understand the code a little better so
in a in in a constraint problem than you
know a lot of times have situations
where you have a list of variables or a
matrix of variables and in math notation
we would just use a subscript for that
we have like X sub I for all I in some
range so I just want to say the way to
do that in loco is I'm just having a
vector of the keyword X and a number and
I'm passing that to the in constraint
and just generating a bunch of
constraints and a for loop and then
concatenating those lists together to
create my constraint model so that's
pretty simple so now it's time for
fusion so that that's the first and last
meme I will use in this talk you're
welcome
so what if we could combine the
flexibility of regular expressions with
the efficiency and power that we just
saw with propagators so the answer is a
little thing called the regular
constraint and it's it's a constrain
that actually has the name regular so it
sounds really kind of boring and stupid
but that's actually the name of the
constraint so here were we we can sort
of create an atomic on and constrain
that a sequence of variables must
satisfy the automaton so as he was
saying sort of the way you've satisfied
automaton is you pass it through the
transitions and see if it gets to a
final state and so we're so we can
create on Tom a ton as he also said you
can turn a regular expression into at
otamatone looko has a function that just
lets you easily do that and it says it's
just called string to otamatone it'll
generate like a automaton object your
you can use in the constraint so I'm I
have this regular expression and I'm
passing it to this regular constraint
and if I were to solve this then there's
actually only two solutions for this if
you look at the railworks
and also consider the fact that the C
variable must be three so this is a
propagator that's surprisingly powerful
in constraint models also I want to
mention the regular expression is a cool
way to construct automata but if you
can't think of a regular expression to
express something you can also just
write out the transition table yourself
it's the same syntax we were seeing in
part one you also have to specify the
start state and also the set of all the
accepting States so with that code so
one of sort of the killer apps for
constraint programming that most people
use it for is something called
scheduling there's like so like job
scheduling work shop scheduling
warehouse scheduling all that stuff and
constraint perm is really good good for
that so I'm going to do a variation on
that called nurse scheduling so the
problem is we have seven nurses in I
guess a hospital and there's ten
different days we want to schedule all
those nurses shifts for the next ten
days so as you can see from this sort of
example solution then we can there are
seven nurses ten days and in each cell
is sort of what kind of shift they have
on that day so we can give a nurse the a
day shift or a night shift or no shift
on that day so constraint number one is
there must be three nurses covering a
day shift and two nurses covering the
night shift on any given day so if you
just pick something random like D seven
then we see two ends and three DS so
that constraint is satisfied so that
right there is sort of like a normal
scheduling problem and then now we're
going to add a couple more constraints
that sort of or a twist that require a
regular constraint so constraint number
two is that a nurse can't work on more
than three dates in a row I'm saying
date so it doesn't sound like day cuz
day and night shift are different things
but a nurse can't work more than three
dates in a row so that's satisfying in
this table you can see that you see like
chunks of
three at most because after three days
then they need a rest I guess lazy
nurses so yeah so and and the final
constraint is sort of on top of that a
nurse also cannot work three nights in a
row so all that really means here is
that in in these chunks of three you're
not going to see three ends specifically
so those are the three constraints we
have to work with so what are the
variables we're going to use in this
constraint so I'm gonna have a shift
shift
IJ using that sort of subscript notation
I was talking about where it's sort of
what kind of shift the nurse number I
does on day number J and logo only works
with integers so if we have something
like a kind of like an enum kind of
thing with day night or nothing we have
to map that to a set of integers to use
so we have days one night as - nothing
is zero I just kind of picked those
arbitrarily so those 70 variables are
working with and so the so constraint
number one is pretty straightforward I'm
not going to go into the details but I'm
just going to I'm using a cardinality
constraint which is just a really simple
way of saying there's this many of this
number there's this many of that number
in this in a series of variables so
we're just going to run that constraint
on all the columns so I'm not going to
go into depth on that but that's that's
covered
so now constraint two and three is work
it's more complicated so what I'm gonna
do here is as I have written in
automaton or well I haven't written it
but there's an otamatone that can parse
a sequence of shifts and then sort of
validate whether that sequence of shifts
were given nurse is okay based on the
constraints that I just outlined so this
is the transition table you can't really
see at a glance exactly what it's doing
so I've written just a quick like
rhizome code so here's the here's the
diagram for that so right off the bat
you can see something kind of
interesting which is that all of these
states are
accepting states they have that double
circle on them and so what that means is
that the way that this automaton passes
an input is if they is is if the input
can go through all the transitions and
not hit a node where there isn't a
transition coming out of that because as
you can see there are certain nodes here
like q6 for instance or if you get here
you can only pass it in oh to get back
to the start and there is no N or D
arrow coming out of here so if you were
a pass it D D D then now you have to not
have D or n because the nurse needs a
break so that's basically the gist of
this otamatone for example if you were
if you were to say three earth if you
were to say n N and then you you're only
allowed to do D or a break so does that
atonement I'm kind of roughly make sense
so I've created this automaton called
shift otamatone because parsing all the
shifts and then I'm just going to use
the regular constraint here and use that
on all of the different rows for each
row of nurses so let's see how we did
so it only takes like a second or so but
boom we have the nurse scheduler so that
was sort of the first puzzle I think I
have time for them for another one so
okay so one more puzzle for you so this
is sort of a practical example of what
people actually use constraint
programming for I don't do that
I am a recreational constraint
programming user and I like to sort of
use use loko to solve like kind of
actual fun puzzled things so yeah I will
in big in this so here's the problem we
have a crossword puzzle kind of it's
actually just a 5x5 grid but we want to
fill it with letters such that such that
each row or column is a valid word so
that's pretty simple so what are our
variables going to be so again we have a
grid so we're just gonna say cell IJ and
AI is the row J is the comb pretty
simple and again we can only work with
integers so we have to somehow map
characters to integers that's really
easy we just kind of get the ASCII code
of the character because why not so so
the domain is 97 which is a to 122 which
is C so there we go so that's the
variables now we have to figure out how
to constrain the word piece of it I have
a dictionary of the 2000 most common
five-letter words courtesy of Knuth and
so here is sort of a slow potential
approach to this word constraint and
sort of the if you didn't have the
railer constrain available to you what
can you do so the answer is perhaps
something like this where you have a
giant or statement and for each case you
say ok it could be this word or it could
be this word or it could be this word
that's really slow but that's kind of
the gist if you were to do that and the
constraint engine doesn't even finish if
I were to just use
that awful terrible constraint in place
of a better one so the fast approach is
to use an automaton so here is the
transition table of an atomic on that
I've created for this and you could
actually probably figure out what it's
doing from here but I made a diagram for
you anyway so here I'm just assuming we
have three words in dictionary dog cat
and duck so let's just see how that
works so you have a start state and it's
pretty simple if you say do G you get to
this final state each state is sort of
how many letters you've correctly
consumed so far and and then the final
states of course are the complete words
so I assume that makes sense to
everybody this dictionary automaton and
so I'll just create a dictionary
otamatone from the dictionary that I
have and that ends up with like several
thousand states or so which is not
really a big deal so let's see how this
works
okay cool that was easy
this is easy let's let's make it harder
so here's the curve of the more complex
example so I give you the five by five
so you can get your head around the
constraints involved and all that stuff
here is I'm not going to go into any of
the actual code for this but this is
just like kind of a more intense example
where I have a more legit looking
crossword grid and so it's sort of like
solving an actual crossword puzzle you
find out a newspaper except there's no
like word clues or anything it's just so
the hard part's out of the way and we
just have to fill it in with a bunch of
letters so so I'm going to use the exact
same otamatone and the exact same
variables and all that stuff it just I'm
using it on sort of each chunk instead
of the entire row or column so I think
that's all you really need to know about
this to get your head around what I'm
doing in this
the code is on github if you want to see
so this takes a little longer this is
kind of take maybe so it takes some time
to just generate the otamatone because
I'm using a different dictionary instead
of the Knuth five-letter word one
because I want all the different lengths
I'm using a very very large word
dictionary for all the different sizes
of words and so it generates a giant
otamatone which is 6.8 seconds and then
7.6 seconds to actually sell models so
these are all valid words asterisk where
because the dictionary is like has a
really obscure words in it so it's not
going to be like yeah whatever just like
a real crossword so that's it so that
that's pretty much the extent of my code
demo you've seen two examples there's
the kind of like what people actually
use constraint programming for and then
what I use constraint programming for
okay so big ideas for part two so as I
mentioned propagators are super powerful
they can really easily pinpoint a
solution in a vast space of solutions
the the regular propagator in particular
is really cool because we can all we
have to do is give it an atomic on or a
regular expression and it can do this
cool propagator party trick and then I
guess the last takeaway is if you want
to try this for yourself you can go
check out my local library which has
support for constraint programming
integer finite domains and also the
regular constraint so that's it and we
have like a couple minutes for questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
