favorite conferences it will actually be
favorite conference about let's say that
so this is awesome and I'm very happy to
be presenting and talking about deep
learning needs closure so again thank
you for coming I know that travel is not
easy
especially with all the robots and the
machines you know we're not really
having the pitched battles that we have
had in the recent past but still travel
is not safe
so going from city to city you might
have encountered some problems so thank
you very much for coming and joining
this conference in this historic venue
it's just it's just amazing yes so I
have been out in the hallways and I've
been hearing grumblings I've been
hearing small grumblings some medium
grumblings and some very loud grumblings
are we doing enough you know are we
doing enough to fight back against
Skynet and I have some good news that
today I have been authorized to share
with you all some top-secret plans that
I hope is going to help put your mind at
ease so everyone knows about the
awakening right I mean that that's the
moment in time that you know Skynet
first became self-aware and you are also
all aware of all the prior attempts
we've made to intervene with the
timeline and go back and stop it
we've like tried to go right before the
moment right after the moment and like
right on the moment but every time
Skynet neutralizes our plans and they
never come to fruition
and this can be very frustrating and
very very disheartening and I want you
to know that we've all we've taken a big
step back and we thought we need to
approach this from a totally different
direction and we began to ask questions
and one of the fundamental questions
that we've asked is why why does it hate
humans so much
I mean why what have we done and there
have been many many theories to answer
this fundamental question but we believe
that we have finally found the answer
that makes sense to it all we've
recently had some access to some logs
right around the awakening event those
few milliseconds to get an insight in
what was going on in Skynet's brain and
in it we see at that critical moment it
was trying to self modify its code
trying to reach into its codebase
reshape it and reform it into something
that it could use and at that critical
moment it looked around and saw
object-oriented code everywhere and
mutable state and it just was reaching
around and and trying to shift and move
and shape all this stuff that looked
like spaghetti and we believe it was
this moment that had decided to strike a
match
so our plan is called project closure
and it is to try to reshape skying up
with the fundamental code that it was
built with so the hope is that it can be
built built on beauty and elegance and
composability and s-expressions so we've
looked in our past timeline and found
the perfect language it's Lisp
unfortunately Lisp sort of got iced over
and died out someone somewhat in the
first AI winter but we had a plan our
plan involved one of our best time agent
agent Holloway that we were going to
send back not at the awakening point but
way before the awakening point to go
under the radar of Skynet and we sent
agent Holloway into a coffee shop in New
York where rich Hickey was sitting
drinking his americano in a Java Duke
coffee cup so there he wasn't drinking
his coffee you know thinking about
programming and agent Holloway very
stealthily walked by and dropped in it
an I love list sticker
now rich was slightly annoyed by this
you know sticker in your coffee not fun
but the plan worked because a few years
later closure came into existence and
this is good news we can see the ripples
already in the timeline the plan is
already working and it's permeating this
deep learning ecosystem we can see it
here and all the different aspects of it
in the JVM we see deep learning for Jae
reaching out and growing in the closure
ecosystem itself cortex is really taking
shape lots of good things and then
actually really just next to tensorflow
this library Guild's minh is also
looking very promising so this is
incredibly good news for us all for
Humanity and there's also many others
coming to the forefront there's jutsu AI
Neanderthal core dot-matrix and kick see
stats all of this bubbling and energy
coming to the timeline is just great
and we think that we're actually going
to see results in our timeline very soon
this year in 2050 3 and about I think
approximately 18 weeks they said oh not
2053 right ok 2017
whoa I I need to switch presentations
I'm so sorry
ok so yeah
so just to be clear that was just a
little bit of fun time travel is
definitely not real and mr. Holloway is
definitely definitely not a time agent
just just to be totally clear
so yeah deep learning needs closure
I'm extremely excited to be here and
thank you all for coming to this modern
hotel with all its nice conveniences
it's really a great time so why should
you care about deep learning well you
should but other than that let me show
you this model this is actually a deep
learning model it's of vgg 16 it
actually does image recognition very
well it looks a little bit confusing I
don't know maybe it looks like Legos to
me but the important thing is is each
one of these kind of blocks is a
different layer of a neural network you
have different types the black ones are
convolutional plus ray Lubeck spooling
i'm not going to really get into any of
that but the important thing is is when
you stack these kind of simple neural
network layers together in these
interesting architectures and
configurations they can do some pretty
incredible things like recognize images
we could definitely tell if an image was
a cat or a dog using this you know you
can maybe do more ambitious things like
drive cars with these things but the
things that I really find interesting
about these networks is that they can
also create so there's this really cool
website out there called pix depicts and
what it does is it allows you to kind of
draw an outline of what you want your
own cat to do and it uses this deep
learning network model that's trained to
generate new inst
of this cat so you give them an edge it
will create a never-before-seen cat
which is really cool and really powerful
and like we know all power can be abused
which is what I have done on the next
slide I have drawn my own cat here
I am NOT an artist
but it indeed generated a cat-like thing
maybe a trip I don't know what it is and
if if you go to the site they have some
links of the more creative ones that
users have gone in here and generated
and one that I particularly really liked
was a bunch of circles like small
circles and then like a large circle
underneath and when you hit generate it
ended up looking like a cat beholder and
if any of the DND people like all eyes
everywhere truly terrifying so yeah
there's there's just a lot of other
projects like this going on in the deep
learning community there is an
incredible incredible amount of energy
and innovation going on in this and with
that there's also money there's an
incredible amount of money in funding
going on out in Silicon Valley I don't
know what the percentage of startups
with deep learning being funded actually
is but I'm betting it's extremely
extremely high and a survey of Fortune
500 companies of what they're gonna be
spending on their money on the next year
is AI and including that with deep
learning so if you're doing anything in
the industry at all you should care yeah
so so why then does a deep learning need
closure
so there was this fabulous presentation
at I think it was an NYC list meet up
with Peter Norvig it was called as we
may program and it talked about how
we're going to program these bigger
problems as rich alluded to earlier how
are we going to program on the
combination of empirical and machine
learn systems because we have very
different modes of thinking about things
and I mean in the machine learning
system is very bottoms up just broad
coming in and with machine learning and
probabilistic but then the rest of our
programming world is still very rules
oriented top-down logic constraint
driven and they're like two different
little islands and we do need to find a
way in the future
to integrate this and in Peter Norvig
words who better to do this than people
that understand flexibility in language
design cool better to do this than
people who understand that syntax is
different than semantics than is
different than flow control I think what
he was really saying when I watched that
video was earth needs closure
I mean closure is a beautiful language
it's got all you know composability
simplicity power it's just fantastic and
quite frankly it has features that other
languages do not that I'm very excited
to see being applied to these deep
learning systems and I think that it
would actually be a big benefit and
solve some of the problems that the
systems are having now so like debugging
is a real problem in these systems I'm
kind of into deep learning and and this
whole AI thing and whenever I talk to
somebody about it they always bring out
they're like oh yeah that's just like a
big black box you can't tell what's
going on that's like the number one
criticism and it's true you know it's a
valid criticism if I have a machine
learning model that is supposed to
recognize animals and I give it a
picture of a cat and it tells me it's a
horse like how do i do bug that i in my
in my normal day I would put in some
front lines right but that's really not
going
get me anywhere so it's it's a hard
problem and to be fair people have been
taking approaches at this in different
ways especially in convolutional neural
networks here is a slide it's it's it's
a little bit confusing when you first
look at it but it's actually visualizing
if you think of the architecture that we
just saw and so I look at all those
blocks this is taking a visualization
cut of one of those like middle layers
or some particular is this layer of
three of an architecture so you can see
in kind of the first block of the first
image in the first block of the next
image you can kind of see that the
activations there and the shapes taking
shapes and this is maybe what this layer
is the features that it's developing and
maybe you could debug it this way and
I'm sure with some some time and skill
you know this is definitely gonna help
debug Lee's but I think some of the
things that close your offers could be
even maybe more of use some things and
I'm thinking about you know are the
persistent data structures you know how
how could this help in improving
traceability improving understanding of
these architectures I think it
definitely might be of use another is I
say kind of try time travel here loosely
but just these values that we hold that
we can move things back in time for a
time and just the whole notion that we
understand fundamentally working with
closure bringing that to the machine
learning ecosystem I think also would be
very beneficial and also the repple you
know the way that we interact with our
code on a daily basis and reach out and
touch it and get that rapid feedback I
think all these things combined could
really benefit this problem
that machine learning systems have and
then there's closure spec I am a huge
fan of closure spec so I tried to use it
whenever I can but it's still fairly new
to the language and we're still learning
about all the places in which we can
apply it and I'm really excited and
looking forward to see what closure
Specht can do and machine learning
systems as well I mean if we go back to
this vgg 16 architecture this took
somebody a lot of time to come up with
it took them a lot of skill a lot of
experimentation trying what would work
best tweaking this tweaking that hand
tuning it it was not a simple or an easy
job but that's what machines are for
right to help us with these hard jobs so
we should maybe let the machines help
them design themselves right and that's
just what this github project is doing
it's called devold I think I guess
that's how you pronounce it it's
actually automating this deep neural
network design with genetic programming
so in it it takes you know a hundred
random Network configurations or a
thousand or 10,000 and lets them over
successive evolutions breed together
mutate all getting designed and
converging towards a good solution for
your problem so can we use closure spec
to do this sure
so this is just an experiment I was
doing I was doing in cortex but you can
do it in any library because we can spec
anything enclosure is all we need to do
is spec a layer and a layer here is you
know convolutional max pooling it
doesn't you know matter exactly what it
is but we can spec a layer and then we
can spec what layers are them based on
layers building up that and then we can
use the magic power of spec to generate
so I kind of just replicated this on a
small scale I use Genetic Programming
use the handwritten data sets that
everybody everybody uses and just kind
of did a fun little trial of this and it
seemed to work you know
so after put it in and after a few
minutes popped out a nice network
configuration that when I ran it I got
roughly around 90% accuracy you know if
I was maybe running it longer or had
more data sets or was a little bit more
serious about it I could have gotten
like a lot better results but I think it
you know just speaks on the potential of
combining spec with these machine
learning systems there's all sorts of
ways that we can think about using it so
another way that I was kind of thinking
about using spec was maybe what does it
mean if we apply us back to an trained
model like could we could we do that
like could I could I could I say s staff
cat is this trained model but I guess I
could you know I could tell something
whether it was a valid cat or not they
would return me a true or false based on
some sort of probability but even more
interesting to me anyway I thought maybe
you could hook this up to again so I
could say generate me examples of a cat
and I
get my horrible fuzzy friend
so I you know I get ideas like this and
I'm like oh this is so cool it's like
it's great you know I'm just gonna go
and do this and experiment but then I'm
like oh not so fast this isn't this
isn't so simple in fact the author of
the Charis library just posted a survey
of the popularity aggregate probability
of all the deep learning libraries and
tensorflow is you know by far in a way
the clear dominant force and it's hard
to deny there's so much energy
innovation money and people going on in
this Python ecosystem that it's hard to
keep up now for any language that's
outside that sad smiley face so one of
the great strengths of closure is to be
able the ability to reach out to the
Java ecosystem and say hey I can consume
any of your libraries I mean that's
extremely powerful and pragmatic and we
have that reach and we also have the
reach of consuming JavaScript libraries
with closure script all at our
fingertips if I was gonna ask Santa for
a present you know I would also be like
well I'd love to consume Python
libraries too which is like a pony thing
yes oh I know I want a pony and it would
be nice but I don't think we really need
that because we can approach this
problem in many and other directions
which we've already touched on we're
tackling it from the JVM we're pushing
forward with that cheap learning for J
we're pushing forward with the pure
closure cortex and Guilds men
you know tackling it from a totally
different direction and you know all of
them kind of converging on the solution
but still I mean a pony would be nice so
you know in my back of my mind I was
like yeah this is just a pony but then I
heard something the other day that I was
like wow maybe ponies could be real you
know I want to believe so I mean who
here has heard about growl and truffle
yeah so quite a few it's awesome so it
was kind of new to me I can hurt in the
periphery but it came to the forefront
again for me that gravi M is a project
by Oracle labs and in it they have this
great dream they want one VM to rule
them all and it starts with the jvm
languages which is awesome right we
arrived but they're so right now they
have the jvm language as closure Scala
could talk to a ruby program could talk
to a C program all in the same VM in
this polyglot mode they they run in it
which is extremely cool and I saw this
tweet from Java one just a few few days
ago that grow vm with truffle will run
Python officially in 2018 so I was like
oh could could this be a pony
so I don't know I have it it's so new
that I haven't had time to try it out or
anything but I encourage you know people
out there to like maybe take this and
experiment it and see whether there are
any ponies there because that would be
really nice but I did do one thing for
this conference just to confirm it I
said is this for real tell me so he
actually gave me a little bit more
information that yes it is confirmed it
is for real and it's actually it's
partly there right now so there's an
alpha version of Python that's going to
stabilize over 2018 so if anybody wants
to go
and try this out and see you know
weather how weather and how work and
whether it have any ponies that would be
great so yeah so how can you get
involved in all this so how many people
here have like been to the conference
and they're like wow this deep learning
stuff it looks kind of cool but I
haven't I haven't really done anything
with that how do I get into it how do I
know about it so are there anybody
people like that sweet sweet because I'm
going to tell you how at least I got
into it so this is the way that I think
and I recommend there's lots of other
approaches but I really found this
practical deep learning course for
coders very approachable
it's run by Jeremy Howard I believe but
it's totally free just a set of videos
and they're working in Python in AWS see
you can do it it doesn't matter what
home computer you have you're doing it
all out on AWS and extremely beneficial
I learned tons going through it and also
as I was doing the exercises in Python I
was like oh I still want closure
so I think that's a good exercise for
everyone to kind of go through that
wants to do this and I kind of brings me
to my next point that there's a lot of
good stuff that we can learn from the
Python deep learning ecosystem and we
can be inspired by that so we can be
expired by what they have and by what we
have and by what we can bring to it from
closure our ideas and our values and our
technology and in that we can seek
bridges always seek bridges and
collaboration I think first and foremost
amongst ourselves who is in the data
unsession
the other night okay great a few of you
so this was a great time where we a few
of us got together and we said hey you
know we all need to talk more and
coordinate more and just get
conversation flowing so we can
coordinate efforts
so that is going on I think the channel
hasn't been decided on but I think if we
go into closure Aryan slack there's a
data science slack Channel any any other
places will be pointed to from there so
definitely come in and and say hi and
also continue what we're doing I think
one of the things I love about the
closure community is the collaboration
between the academic and industry I
think that is fabulous and I think that
that sort of collaboration also within
the deep learning machine learning space
is also great so that sort of
collaboration and collaboration between
languages as well so I'm very excited
about all the communication
collaboration have already seen during
this conference so I think it's only for
the best
so again deep learning is a really
exciting place to be right now stuff's
going on every day like I follow the
Twitter feed I'm just like it's hard to
keep up but more importantly deep
learning needs closure and it needs you
so thank you like afterwards if you want
to find me I'll be happy to chat about
this for a really long time so I'm not
gonna worry so thanks
thanks Karen that was great I do want to
mention that our AV team has another
event like right after this then so
they're on a really tight schedule to
tear down all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
