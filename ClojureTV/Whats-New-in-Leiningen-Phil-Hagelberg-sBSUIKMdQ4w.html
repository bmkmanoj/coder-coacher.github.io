lying again talking about
work that's going into version 2 why it
works that way and how you can make the
most out of it and also a bit about
where we're going in the future show so
actually before we dive in if I could
get a show of hands who's using a
version 2 of lying again Wow okay
fantastic so great so little history
here lannigan was created in 2009 and it
was sort of born out of the frustration
and lessons learned from using maven for
a closure project for six months and
kind of distilled the issues we ran into
and turned that into into line again so
I spoke on it at the first conch about a
year after had been going and then at
the last cons spoke with the maintainer
of the closure cake build tool and kind
of join forces with them for working on
line again too so version 2 has been
like about a year in praat in progress
had lots of contributors lots of
momentum 152 people contributing so
really really proud of how that's come
about getting over a cold so have to
forgive me yeah so lining into has been
a chance to kind of re-evaluate some of
the decisions made in Lanigan one and
revisit a lot of the assumptions so
probably the most basic probably the
most basic thing is that we're focusing
that the mistake that we made with
lining and one was actually calling it a
build tool and
that's sorry who can open this colds
really getting to me so right with
Lanigan one we had this problem that it
was it was always framed as a build tool
and that brought along a lot of
assumptions and baggage with it so this
brings to mind the notion of the
rectification of names so in Confucius
analects he says if language is not
correct than what it said is not what is
meant if what is said is not what is
meant then what must be done remains
undone if this remains undone morals and
arts will deteriorate justice goes
astray and the people will stand about
and helpless confusion hence there must
be no arbitrariness about what is said
so the it really matters what you what
you call it and how you how you frame
the problem so this notion of being a
build tool you know it brings along
preconceived notions it it kind of puts
you in in this this red of thinking like
oh well it should work the same way
maven does or the same way rake does or
whatever so we address a stepping back
from that allows us to think about
addressing the problems unique to
closure rather than just finally
following so lining into we've we've
taken the focus on project automation
rather than a build tool so obviously
that means that it operates on projects
and that's that's pretty key you know
you can use it outside the context of a
project but that's not the what's
designed for and this notion of
automation means that it's you know it's
designed to encode actions and be able
to get repeatable results out of them so
it's not designed to support the use
case of just you know throwing stuff
together and make it happen and of
course you you can do that but that's
that's really counter to design so
the primary way in which the notion of a
build tool became problem was that the
the version one was designed strictly
for development time only so this notion
of being a build tool was kind of
tightly coupled with a notion of being
used for development so we the thought
was that some point closure would
include a command line launcher of its
own and that you know we just didn't
want to go there but that didn't pan out
so we added this line run task so you
know you can you can just kick off your
dash main function or whatever from line
again so this made it somewhat suitable
for word production use but it turns out
that we had a lot of assumptions built
in about about development so things
like the tests were always on the
classpath and you had development time
tools that didn't make sense to be
loaded in a production situation so for
Langan when we included this line no dev
flag which you could enable to to switch
that stuff off but it was really tacked
on and it didn't have a cohesive design
to it it was just you know trying to
undo some of that so in in lining into
every thumb that kind of stuff is
expressed in terms of profiles and we'll
we'll talk about that more minute but
yeah so some of the other problems that
we're addressing from Lanigan one this
notion of isolation between the project
and the line again itself in Lanigan one
you would have plugins and certain other
directories bleed through to affect both
Flanagan's classpath in the projects
class path and turns out especially with
plugins
the fact that there's two separate
dependency resolution times there's like
plug and install time and then run time
means that you can't actually cohesively
perform deduplicate the dependencies and
that leads to a number of really hard to
debug problems so that's no longer the
case in lining into and then landing and
one had a really really half-hearted
repple implementation because basically
everyone who was working on it was using
slime and so you know it included a rep
lab of the box but it was really pretty
lame just this socket socket Ruppel
thing with a command-line client so in
version 2 the repple is based off chess
Emmerich's and ripple project so this is
kind of like a become the de facto
standard in the closure community this
and ripple stack so it means that the
tooling can be shared across all all
clients so everyone is rather than
having a separate repple server for like
Emacs and vim and what have you the idea
is to just converge on this single
unified implementation so you can take
advantage of shared infrastructure and
stop reinventing the wheel and in
addition to that the rep and client that
ships with is much improved Colin Jones
reply is offers a lot of great
completion and documentation
functionality so yeah it's a big
improvement over line digan one and then
the other problem is just that in
Lanigan one snapshots get included by
default and number of problems with that
slows down dependency resolution and it
can lead to unexpected behavior with
version ranges so we're looking at
moving away from that
lining into and I'll cover that more
later so like to talk about kind of the
big picture conceptual overview of lying
again so one of the things that you know
you've probably come to appreciate
living in closure land is this notion of
you know X as data everything if it can
be expressed in terms of just simple
maps and functions than it is and this
just leads to great level of clarity and
obvious pneus so one of the obviously
one of the central Central idioms in
line again is the project and the
project map so this is just excuse me so
if you look at the the Deaf project
makarov say you're you're checking out a
project and you want to get started on
hacking it you see this here and the the
idea is this this turns into a map that
line again can operate on and so I
mentioned you know it everything is data
and obviously the the Deaf project macro
is a macro and so it's not it's not just
a map but it's a pretty straight forward
transformation to turn it into a map the
Deaf project macro exists because it
would come be it would be infeasible to
include or infeasible or annoying to
include everything like this you you'd
have to end up putting in a lot of
repetitive defaults and you'd also have
to quote all your symbols for dependency
dependency names so the Deaf project
macro cleans that up a bit but
conceptually everything behind the
scenes is just just map and you can use
the line p print plug into
you omit that map so if you're ever
curious about you know you're making a
change and you're wondering what the
effect is going to be on the project map
you can pull that in and give it a run
and get an overview of what it's going
to look like so another benefit of
everything just being a map is you know
certain types of manipulations are
possible so I mentioned earlier with
profiles in lining into you can adjust
the behavior in different circumstances
profile a profile is just another map
that gets merged into the project map
that can can change the settings so this
when the profile gets activated right
there's just this this deep merge going
on and it's not it's not a simple merge
in terms of like closure core merge it's
a it's a merge that kind of honors tries
to to do whatever makes sense in terms
of whenever there's a conflict so like
sequences will get concatenated and maps
will get merged etc and then you can
override that behavior by attaching
metadata onto onto a value if you want
to have it replaced or something like
that so right so that's that's projects
really simple data and simple
manipulation of them in terms of merging
and the other main concept and Lanigan
is the task and so if you think of I
think of projects in terms of maps I
think of tasks in terms of functions so
here you see lining and invocation of
the hello task with these these
arguments and that really translates
into this function call so you find that
the task function and pass in the
project map
and then pass in the XYZ command line
arguments so every task invocation can
just be thought of as a as a function
call and when you are so the goal here
with your with your task is to is to
achieve referential transparency with
these function calls so if you think of
the arguments to this task like
abstractly as the project map the
command line arguments and the files on
disk and the quote unquote return value
being the exit code whatever gets puts a
standard out and files are into the
target directory if you think in terms
of of those of the function that way
then if you can achieve our functions
referential transparency there then you
get a lot of benefits in terms of
project automation repeatability and so
on so right so that's the big picture of
lining into the the big big issues there
and talk a little bit about some of the
pitfalls of problems people run into
with lining into so I mentioned
referential transparency in project
functions and one of the most common
blockers there is the notion of
snapshots if you think of the analogy of
task being a function than a project
that includes a snapshot could be
thought of as having dynamic binding or
taking advantage of a dynamically bound
value because the what this means is if
you have a snapshot that means the the
state of your remote repository is
actually going to affect your project in
I'm possibly unpredictable ways and you
don't have one hundred percent
repeatability so obviously snapshots are
valuable sometimes but it's important to
realize that when you do bring them in
there's there's a cost to paying in
terms of determinism another big problem
similar to snapshots is the notion of
version ranges version ranges look like
a really good idea you know you say you
test your project against version 1.2 to
1.4 of closure and you want to express
that in your project on sale J file so
it looks like looks something that
really makes sense there but
unfortunately there's some really
unexpected semantics and version ranges
where the underlying library for
handling dependencies with with lining
and treats a version range is a hard
dependency and so if you put a direct
dependency on say closure 1.4 in your
project and somebody else has a range of
1.2 to 1.3 then it's gonna the your
version that you explicitly specify is
actually just going to be ignored and
this other one is going to take
precedence so I strongly recommends just
a avoiding them entirely so open-ended
version Rangers obviously have the same
non determinism problems that snapshots
do because new versions could get
published and that could change the
behavior of your project but even in the
case of a closed a close range we're
both you know the upper end is specified
there's still some really unexpected
semantics there and it's probably best
to avoid when you're debugging these
kind of problems there's a new tool in
lining into called line depth tree that
you can use in this will this will
explain
how why you're getting the versions that
you're getting where they're getting
pulled in from so you can see here you
know Commons codec is coming from Marine
Corps and if you're ever wondering why
you ended up with the versions that you
are it can be coupled to get some
visibility in there another tool in this
case is the line pedantic plugin you can
use this is excuse me the line pedantic
plugin will actually completely refuse
to resolve dependencies if there's any
ambiguity so if if one of your
dependencies is once a certain version
and you want a different one it'll tell
you that there's ambiguity and it'll
just it'll just give up and that forces
you to address the these kind of
problems but and it can kind of point
out any potential potential conflicts so
that man end up getting merged in at
some point but for now it's a plugin you
can use so
what a really common question people ask
about using Lanigan is they you know
they come with this this you know
standalone jar file and I want to know
how to make that work with with the line
again project and there's ways to make
it work you can use the line local repo
plug-in to install jar file into your
local repository or you can use you can
deploy it to like a static http-based
file server or an s3 bucket or something
like that but it's important to realize
that these are really just addressing
the symptoms and the problem is really
that someone's giving you the jar file
and expecting you to use it that's not
based out of a real repository from an
automation perspective a file that's not
in a repository just might as well not
even exist so the thing to do there is
to make a lot of noise about that fact
and if you've got you know a Java
project that refuses to publish to a
repository you know open a bug report or
something like that because it's really
not acceptable so for the final pitfall
i'd like to tell a story imagine if you
will a resourceful nefarious attacker
and this guy wants to mess with a person
or company using closure so he comes to
the college and late at night after
everyone's gone to bed he comes down to
the wireless router and sticks a paper
clip in it and resets it and tweaks the
dns settings to point to server of his
choice that he controls and then he
heads off early the next morning some
closure programmers come down to get
some early morning hacking in and they
are in for a surprise so
me show you how this this works if you
would like to follow along you can try
adding this to your etsy hose but it's
uh yeah let me just show you how how
this works here you can configure pseudo
to insult you and you get the password
on a fun fact they're so I'm going to go
in there I'm and so this is simulating
this attack on DNS I'm going to clear
out my cached copy of closure 1.4 and
then oh goodness yes okay cool so yeah
I'm gonna clear clear out my cache copy
there I'm going to run line new hello
just get a new project in there
once I launched a ripple see what
happens so it's going to try to fetch
the closure jar from my fake repository
and boom right remote you know arbitrary
code execution there so the moral of the
story here is that really we've got a
long way to go for a project automation
in terms of what we can really trust so
you know this story might seem a little
far-fetched but really it's it's
interesting to think about how little
there really is between you know your
project and such an attacker like
there's it's really people people put a
lot of trust into these tools where in
some cases there's really not a lot of a
lot behind that and this is not unique
in any way to JVM infrastructure this is
a problem basically any language level
you know cpn rubygems things like that
and the only systems that aren't subject
to this problem are you know os-level
systems like apt and yum where all the
packages are signed through a central
authority so right so the solution here
in you know in that goes part of the way
towards a drastic the problem is getting
signatures on your your packages and
systems like apt and yum obviously
they've got a bit of an advantage
because they do have a centralized
Authority so it's much easier to to
handle signatures first for something
like that maven central does require
signatures for artifacts deployed there
but they they're older artifacts in
there that predate that policy
and even though the signatures are there
they don't really get checked very often
so doesn't really really make much of a
difference so um what I've been working
on and kind of parallel to lining into
is this notion of a releases repository
in clay jars so the idea is that you
know Chlo jars right now is really this
kind of wild west anything goes a
situation and I think that was really
probably pretty appropriate for the time
you know early on in the evolution of
the language it's helpful to have fewer
barriers to publishing but bottom the
notion that we're working on with the
releases repositories there would be a
bit of a higher bar to getting something
in there for instance it would not
include any snapshots it would require
certain level of metadata on all jars
getting in there so you would have to
declare a license and things like that
but then also you would have to have
signatures for all the all the artifacts
deployed there so that I think is
necessary but not sufficient for
addressing this problem it's kind of the
the building blocks on which a good
solution can be can be constructed so
once you have signed deposit with signed
dependencies you can actually run
through your dependency graph and you
know you can check verify them so I'll
show you here there's this experimental
feature in lining into line depp's
verify that will run through your
dependency graph and it'll tell you what
this the signature state of each
veitch dependency is so ideally if
ideally in a scenario where you know
you're getting all your dependencies
from the new closures repository you'd
be able to get a full list of fully
fully signed dependency tree but you
know that's that's really not the
solution in and of itself all that a
signature tells you is that you know it
was signed by somebody with a given key
and that doesn't tell you about whether
the that key is trustworthy in any way
so right i mentioned the apt annyeong
signatures you know they've got a
centralized authority to say you know
these keys are trustworthy because this
person is a debian developer or whatever
and in a decentralized setting it's much
more difficult you have to build out
what's called a web of trust so I'm
hoping that this is something that the
community can work towards and that you
can actually build this transitive
notion of trust between you and the
authors of the libraries use by having
the various Keys be signed and by having
people sign so right use it with the gpg
you express the fact that you trust key
by signing that key and you can build
out this this web by following the links
of the signatures between yourself and
the author of a library and so it's my
hope that eventually in line again we'll
be able to not only verify what's signed
and not but what's trusted and not
so I hope is the new clothes hours
repository will will encourage this so
we've we've got that still in
development but if you publish
repositories if you publish libraries to
college I zone with lining in you
version 2 you'll notice that it
automatically signs it and so now you
can actually go into closed ours and
through the web interface you can add
your public key there and then soon once
we get the promotion working there will
be tasked to upload from the existing
repository into the releases repository
for qualified jars where the signature
checks out and the metadata is all there
so right so i think the closure
community is kind of in a unique
situation here in that you know we're
still a fairly small community where you
can have you know like the majority of
closure library authors actually in one
room here and but we are also building
on this existing infrastructure where
all the all the all the infrastructure
for signatures actually already exists
and is not really terribly difficult to
to build on so even though Noah even
though no other decentralized web of
trust system has been able to pull it
off I think we actually might have a
chance of building out that that level
of trust and using signatures
so let's take a look at how this works
oh yeah I missed that sorry slides out
of order so if you have gpg installed
can generate a key there I the defaults
are typically pretty good apart from I'd
recommend having it having a expert eid
aight in there and then you can publish
that key to a centralized key server so
other people can pull it in and write
like I said line again will sign
artifacts upon deploy but it can also
use your key to encrypt your credentials
so you're close ours password doesn't
have to be in plain text on disk which
is you know probably a good idea but so
like i said i think the closure
community has a opportunity to build out
this web of trust if you i think
actually now would be a perfect time to
do that so why don't you go ahead and if
you don't have a gpg key installed
generate one if you have gpg and you
don't have a key generate one and and we
can actually do some of this
verification right here right now so
right if you if you go ahead and just
generate your key or pull your key up
and you can verify the identity of just
the person sitting next to you and we
can you know take the first step towards
towards building out this web of trust
so right when you're building up when
you when you're signing someone's key
its you know it's important to verify
their identity so this is not something
you can do online this is something like
you have to do face to face in person so
you can you can you know check to make
sure they're who they say they are so
right once you've got your key generated
look to the the person next to you and
verify their identity using you know
driver's license or so on so forth and
then you can if they've published it you
can you can call receive keys to pull it
in and check the fingerprint and confirm
that it matches what they're showing and
then you can sign it and and then send
the signed key back to the the server
and the server will will record the fact
that this person is someone that you
trust so yeah if you ever the select the
Debian community they have these these
key signing parties that are really kind
of an imp important part of building out
that trust but I think that's something
that we could we could learn from and
then work towards so yeah so right the
long-term goal is to be able to build a
system that you have good reason to
trust that you can like verify and
that's resistant to attacks and I think
this is feasible and you know the first
steps here are clear but it's gonna it's
going to take some work to build up the
necessary connections and make the you
know get community involvement to make
it happen so I'm closing group hug let's
do this yeah that's it thanks for having
me
