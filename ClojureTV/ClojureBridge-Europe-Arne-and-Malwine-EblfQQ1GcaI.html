are you ready okay let's start so we're
going to talk we're going to tell you
all you ever wants to know about your
closure my name is our nuh I'm a
freelance programmer I also teach
programming I'm originally from Belgium
but I'm based in Berlin and my main
activity nowadays is creating
screencasts about closer and closer
script you can find those on lombok
island calm hi my name is Medina I'd
like programming and drawing i did some
sketch notes last year maybe some of you
remember that um I'm actually a Berliner
em stay in Berlin I'm currently working
with the cool people of wounded list at
Microsoft billion and yeah also studying
computer science so before we start we
would like to mention that we have a
booth over there in this corner we like
to invite everybody of you to come
around and ask us questions how to get
started we're really happy to to help
out we have lots of stickers so what are
we going to talk today so and we're
going to talk about closure bridge why
it's important why we're doing it then
how we do that in Berlin and M how you
can get involved so let's go alright so
what is a closure bridge can everybody
who's been at a closure bridge workshop
either as an attendee or as a coach or
as an organizer please raise your hand
alright that's a good amount of you so
for the rest it probably needs a little
bit of explanation so to put it briefly
what we try to do is introduce
underrepresented groups to programming
with fun free workshops so closure
bridge their workshops held around the
globe organized by volunteers they're
typically one day workshops where we
introduce people to programming
especially with closure now the word
underrepresented groups probably needs a
little bit of explanation so when you
look at society at large you see this
amazing diversity in people there's a
wide range of genders people have
different nationalities different
cultural and racial backgrounds people
have different ages different abilities
different interests different
experiences and backgrounds but then
when you shift your gaze to the tech
community to your average developer team
then that diversity is a lot less and so
what we try to do is create a safe and
an encouraging environment where people
of those underrepresented groups can
figure out if maybe you know programming
is something for them now you'll notice
in this talk that we mostly talk about
women and we mostly focus on women as a
closer bridge chapter it is actually
open to you how you want to define your
target group so we in Berlin
specifically reach out to people who
identify as women or hard non-binary the
reason that we focus on that is that a
it's an obvious starting point women are
fifty percent of population and that's
just not the case in the programming
industry the other reason is that as a
large part of our organizer team are
women this is a group of people that we
can relate to and that we know how to
create a safe and good environment for
them so that's what why we choose that
as our current focus which doesn't mean
that we might not do something else in
the future and diversity really matters
like you might be wondering okay that's
all fair and well but why right the
thing is that my first teams are more
creative they're more innovative in a
more productive than other teams so it's
not just a moral imperative but it's
also just good for business and to put
it with a cloak quote from Lena Reinhart
you can find some other talks on YouTube
she does some really good talks on these
subjects diversity is the default
diversity of the
if it's not diverse it's broken and so
this is true in nature you know diverse
systems are more resilient or more
adaptive are stronger than homogeneous
systems or groups and finally it's about
representation so if you want to build
software that is relevant that is usable
that is accessible by a large part of
the world's population then we need to
represent a large part of the world's
population and not just a small slice of
it so that's why building software is an
act of representation and that
representation really matters to build
stuff for for now and for the future so
this is what a lot of teams look like
unfortunately and the thing that I want
to point out here is that it's there's
there's an additional problem not just
that we need to bring more of these
people into programming but also if you
look at research a very large amount of
women in the first ten years in the
industry they leave again and there's a
couple reasons for this but they're
there the obvious ones of everyday
sexism of the fact that it's harder for
them to to get career opportunities they
need to work twice as hard to be taken
serious and to be seen as equal to the
next guy and so all of these things kind
of compound and means that you know we
have a leaky pipeline so it's not just a
matter of shoving more people in but we
also need to stop them from leaving
again and so that's why you know you
might be thinking okay you know closure
bridge that's cool you know that's for
women has nothing to do with me but it
is something that really is important
for all of us and we're all responsible
for turning this culture around and for
looking at ourselves getting to grips
with our own biases and to read up on
these issues and to look at our
companies cultures and see what we can
do there to really change things so that
we can move towards something that looks
more like this
so um I want to tell you my story as a
concrete example of what Anna just
pointed out because I think that open
Tek initiatives like closure bridge
rates goods open tech school etc can
really change lives so I started
studying computer science right after I
graduated from high school and this was
in 2012 and yeah in 2013 I found myself
in this debt and wrote why was that I
hadn't learned programming university
was a really tough place to be it was
really hostile environment there I made
absolutely no progress it was not fun at
all and the stress level was super high
so I was asking myself should i quit
computer science did I dropouts but you
know this situation was really hard
because I was studying with 200 guys and
maybe three to five woman and i won I
didn't want it to be that girl you know
that drops off because she's a girl you
know and yeah I didn't know what to do
and in this moment I heard a radio show
there was actually Turkish radius so a
show but they switched to germ and at
some point to say that there will be a
programming workshop for woman in
Istanbul and it's organized co-organized
by red coats Cologne and this sounded
somewhat interesting to me so yeah I
just searched for red skirts and I found
it they had a chapter in Berlin and they
had a workshop coming up and yeah i went
there and this day was really a life
changer completely 180 degrees around
because they gave me a completely new
perspective on programming my coat
showed me a very different way of
learning
and I met a community there that has
ever since supported me you know in
every single bit through them and I'm
few months later I found a job as a
developer and i also changed university
and yeah what they really did for me was
building a bridge you know and I
wouldn't be here if I hadn't found them
at that day so um thanks and this
experience has then created a very
strong wish for me to you know offer
this opportunity to more woman and I
think that clergy bridge can change life
too and I just want to give you another
example so actually one of our
attendance here today are named Oscar
and she was also a computer science
student like me and she was struggling
at some point if she was still on the
right way because she had almost no
support and through a coincidence
actually she found us and I was so happy
when she told me the following like
after I attended clearbridge I new
programming is exactly what I want and
what I should do and you know and the
next thing is really more amazing she
said like I was super motivated and
continued learning every week and
through clergy bridge I got an
internship to work three months
full-time on closure which was in a
magazine experience so give a hand to
the Oscar for that
so yeah let's start from the beginning
like how everything veloped right so a
little trip down memory lane it all
started in two thousand nine so that's
already seven years ago with railsbridge
so railsbridge was one of the first
initiatives to kind of bring that you
know that concept of workshops for women
and and you'll see that you know a lot
of these initiatives kind of trace their
roots back to railsbridge rails girls
was also inspired and came afterwards
since 2012 railsbridge has turned into
an official foundation that supports
these initiatives under a bigger
umbrella called a bridge foundry so they
do a number of things including a mobile
development workshops angular dealing
with kids and so they also do closure
bridge so closure bridge is a relatively
new addition on the scene the first
workshop was only two and a half years
ago in april 2014 but since then it's
really gone global and there's been over
40 workshops all around the worlds in
europe we've had workshops in five
different countries so far so there's
there's London we've had a couple in
Finland Germany that's us and then
Sweden has also been Ireland jizzed on
the slide and Amsterdam is coming up and
I hope after this presentation many more
chapters in Europe will be starting up
but we'll see we we're rooting for it in
Berlin we have a pretty strong team
we're quite happy with that we've had
three workshops so far we've been going
for almost two years so we try to kind
of go every six months to a new workshop
so question is how we got started in
Berlin it's actually kind of a funny
story that's why I want to tell you that
so bit complicated and a long time ago
before we knew anything about closure
bridge or anybody was involved in
closure or anything and i met with em on
a and Bettina
we were talking at lunch time about a
project that patina had found or I think
you people had found it before and it's
about music that grows old with you
because apparently your experience with
music changes and somehow we came to
talk about how we would realize this and
yeah the topic overtone came up an
overtone is this music library for
closure and we saw it well why don't we
learn closure and we found it learner's
group called clj art with the heart and
we were hosted at red skirts and owners
group called Ruby monsters and a few
months later we went to this German
clergy conference called closure d it's
also happening soon again right and
y'all invited to come over to Berlin and
what we had to figure out there was that
me Bettina and Nicola who had joined our
group at that time were kind of the only
woman there and yeah that it was not a
nice feeling and then a few weeks later
we found out that there I she workshops
and the first closure bridge workshop
would be happening in Germany and zoning
and and then we thought wow you know we
need we need closure bridge in Berlin
and so yeah another few weeks later we
had our first workshop and Berlin in
July 2015 with 30 students and 17
cultures so yeah I want to tell you also
about the experience we had from this
workshop so you know it's clear that
after one day workshop you won't have
senior developers right away you know it
doesn't create you them junior or senior
developer but it helps to break down
three major barriers that people face so
these various are and that many people
say especially woman well i think i'm
not interested or i think
to it and some people actually a lot of
people say you know I'm interested in I
would like to learn but they have no
idea where to start and reasons for
these barriers are like there are so
many reasons for that but and just to
name two so I mean you know it's social
society and media and social networks
and stuff they give completely wrong
picture of what programming this and who
can be a programmer and also the ongoing
sexism and keeps woman out and also
other minorities out of our tech
communities so this these are all really
things we have to tackle but on our
workshops we see that and we achieve
something for the individual attendee
that they can break down for themselves
these barriers because now they see what
kind of projects they can realize with
what they've learned and and now they
become interested in the topic they also
get in realistic idea of what
programming is like and so they get
capable and they say you know what I can
do that and all the people who wanted to
learn and didn't know how they get lots
of tooling and they get learners group
and so they find a way to learn what
they wanted to learn so yeah also we
have this bow effect at the workshop of
course it's not about understanding you
know exactly what every line of closure
codes you know does but it's about this
feeling of achievement so people say
after after the workshop like wow you
know I built this myself and very little
time here actually some outcomes of what
people did and they get a concrete
example of you know the code they've
Road created some specific outcome so in
our workshops they built a quill app and
quill is a graphical library for closure
and yeah then they get really
interesting outcomes that
can move or change on click and stuff
yeah so he also two quotes from our
attendees some feedback we got that I
want to read out to you pleasure ridge
was my start into programming and it did
change everything I thought I knew about
people who do computer stuff and another
Tandy said it took the fear out of
learning something which could be
potentially difficult and I now have the
confidence to do this okay so in the
next part I want to talk a little bit
about the Berlin chapter specifically
and some of the things that we find that
we do quite well and they were proud of
so this is the team from the eye thing
from the first two workshops so there's
patina Lisa Yulia Nikola Martin Malvina
yella Francesca myself Ben and then we
have a couple new recruits here Saskia
and Tibor ward in the picture yet so can
these people please stand up a lot of
them are here so can we please have a
hand of applause for them
so this is already one thing you see
that we have a pretty big team a pretty
big group that sort of supported by the
wider community and that means that we
we can pull out of stuff off so one of
the things that's really important for
us is food because you know if you're if
you're learning stuff all day if you're
if you're focused you're burning a lot
of calories and you know we we need to
we need to make sure that we keep
everybody well fat so this is you know
we get these cute vegan muffins for the
afternoon snack but then we get caterers
for for lunch that you know make sure
that we have good wholesome healthy food
that really charges people up now this
is this is optional what for instance
other chapters do sometimes it's just do
a pop lock so we're lucky that we've
always had a pretty good experience
finding sponsors and we can do stuff
like this but really you can you know
you can do a workshop wit with already
very little effort now it all starts so
a month or two before the actual
workshop we put a big google form online
and that's where it really starts as
where people can sign up and we already
try to ask up front all the information
that we might need so it starts with you
know identifying information we put a
text field in there just sort of
open-ended asking people for their
gender that's mostly because you know we
sometimes get men who didn't really
understand the concept and so instead of
sort of guessing by people's name we
just kind of ask up front like you know
and and you can fill in a wide range of
things in there we asked for people's
language preference because we're in
Germany but we're also in a very
international City so we have but
english-speaking and german-speaking
groups and the whole workshop we try to
run bilingual so there's a presentation
there always be two people on stage you
know always saying the same thing in in
Terminator in English we ask for
people's prior experience so we can
group them you know from absolute
beginner to intermediate to sometimes we
have a few people already know a bit
more
food preferences allergies for the
caterer and then you know whether they
need special assistance or whether they
need child care and then we do our very
best to to accommodate that so this is
the sign up form and that all goes into
one big Google spreadsheet and then the
fun part comes where a couple of us
basically once registration closes
that's a couple weeks before the
workshops a few people spent a lot of
time going back and forth between our
email and the spreadsheet and what we do
is we we pick a number of people at
random at first that we invite for the
workshop because the thing is we get
many more signups then we can actually
accept so we've been growing slowly we
kind of want to you know ease into a
bigger capacity but at the moment to
around 35 now the next workshop will be
40 people but we also do a lot of
outreach so we kind of want to get
beyond you know just our Twitter
followers we want to reach people who
you know like Malvina who just heard it
on the radio like people who will find a
flier at their bakery or something or at
the library or at their University so
through this outreach we get a lot of
signups but that means for instance for
the last workshop that was 150 people so
then what we do is we pick a bunch of
red random send them an email say okay
you've been chosen you can come you know
you're very welcome we really want to
have you there but please let us know as
soon as possible that you're absolutely
sure that your coming and then if people
don't reply in time or if they say sorry
i can't make it anyway then we invite
more people and so this kind of you know
we just keep doing this keep inviting
more people until the very end now what
this does is make sure that we have
almost no no shows and this is really
valuable because we've learned this from
similar initiatives we've learned this
from experience with rails girls berlin
we hear this from other chapters that
this is a really big problem you know if
people sign up for something that's free
three months in advance then you know
maybe half of them will not show up
that's just how it is so if you ask him
to confirm very shortly before the
workshop you know we get this almost no
show
almost zero no show which means that we
can really give the maximum amount of
people this opportunity now another
thing we do that kind of trickle down
from railsbridge to closure bridge and
then we also do that now is a coaches
training event so one or two weeks
before the workshop will have an evening
where we get all the coaches together
and we have a slide deck we do a bit of
introductions get everybody to know each
other and then using the slide deck we
have an evening of discussion basically
we get everybody to pitch in and this is
just sort of to get everybody clued up
to make sure that they kind of know what
it's about it's for the practical things
you know what and where and where is the
curriculum but it's also for things like
you know how do you do with social
comfort how do you know you have people
who are way out of their comfort zone
doing something they've never done
before how do you make sure you keep
everyone comfortable things like you
know talking about unconscious bias and
use of language just to make more people
more aware of these things and then
finally just giving everybody some tips
of okay what's you know what are good
coaching styles and habits and what can
you do when you're struggling with your
group so we impact this we usually have
groups over four maybe five people with
two coaches and then we have some
floating coaches that can sort of go
around and help people that need some
extra attention and then finally and
this is you know where it gets really
cool and exciting this is an idea that
we took from the rails girls Berlin
community which is also very active and
as far as I know we're still the the
only closure bridge chapter doing this
so once a workshop is over we ask people
okay do you want to continue learning if
so then you're invited to our weekly
study groups and so there's there's
coaches available there every Wednesday
evening they meet up they do a bit of a
potluck and then people can start
working on whatever project they like
and now after this next workshop we're
gonna put some more effort into making
sure that there's a smooth connection
that we have kind of a beginner's
curriculum to go into when people just
you know have done the workshop
so obviously now it's your turn I mean
you see the meme right so that's the
only mean we have in the talk so it
means you have to get involved so and
yeah actually there are different ways
of getting involved because we know that
not everybody of you has as so much time
to organize a workshop yourself but of
course I mean we would appreciate it a
lot if you organize the workshop but you
can also help out and coach for example
and you can sponsor a specific workshop
maybe new area or you can donate to the
nonprofit organization closure bridge
and you can also improve the curriculum
it's if that's what you like and of
course most important spread the word we
have the stickers there just give them
to people you like so and yeah I'm was
there to help you if you want to get
started organizing your own workshop
there is the closure bridge board with
which I will introduce to you in a
second and there we have a mailing list
the workshops mailing list where you get
lots of help if you ask questions there
you will get a mentor assigned and other
past organizers have really yeah really
excited to help you so this is the board
at the moment it consists of Chris me
Yoko David and Anna and yeah you can
find more information on Club rhetoric
and we have lots of material and on
github / closure bridge and yeah like
our main tasks are actually helping you
getting started organizing so yeah and
spreading the word of course and we
maintain all these documents
on github and yeah we try to moderate
and lead discussions between past and
future organizers on the mailing list
and yeah we we keep our logistics like
the nation's and stuff in good shape
that's what we do mostly so young how to
organize that's the big question me so
how to get started I have a little time
line here for you so the first and most
important thing is that you decide to do
it right and then a big yay if you do
and then you should sign up to the
workshop mailing list just say I you're
there and then you can either send us a
mail to the board or you open an issue
directly at clear the bridge / workshops
on github and then we will assign you a
mentor and to open the issue you don't
really need everything to be set up you
can just say hey I want in this area I
want to make a workshop and then we help
you getting started gun and you need to
start so yeah again some resources they
also linked we will we will tweet this
slide deck later and yeah basically
there's a workshop smelling this and the
curriculum mailing list and everything
is on github too and this this
repository search organizing is really
interesting because we have lots of
fights there that will help you organize
and yea though what do you need for a
minimal viable workshop and you need you
don't need many things basically the
most important is that you have a venue
a safe space where you can have your
workshop so that can be in a university
or like space in your office maybe and
yeah if you want to have your venue you
you can find a date in Berlin we do the
installer fest on Friday evening and the
workshop on saturday but really it's up
to you like you can see what works best
for your attendees and
of course then you need to find coaches
and we found out that it's a good ratio
to have two attendees per one coach so
if you find let's say five coaches you
can invite ten to ten years over and of
course the most important is to find
attendees and here you can reach out on
different mailing list you can print
posters everything what we heard already
and yeah please keep in mind that the
workshop should be free and then once
you have that you can upgrade your
workshop so if you have time and yeah
you can find sponsors and yeah if you
found sponsors then you can have food
and drinks maybe coffee cake whatever
you like to just make this a really nice
event and maybe your sponsors are also
sending you some slack over so now or
you print sticker so that for people it
stays a memorable event and as we
already heard setting up a study group
can be a really nice thing for your
attendees to you know continue learning
and stay on that path so this is the
most important section and also the last
one why should you do it maybe I
convinced you already I'm not so sure so
I collected some quotes and reason
number one you can change someone's life
for the better and here's another
attendee feedback that we got and she
wrote I'm surprised that i managed to
program that it's fun and actually
exactly what I should do classic gender
issue nobody ever considered it for me I
learned that I can do it and now this
feels super good then reason number two
it's rewarding Yoko one of our BOTS
number set it's true both students and
teachers have lightbulb moments during
the workshop this is this absolutely
makes people feel happy and inspired
reason number three you can grow your
community Martines also
year one of our organizers also
organizer of closure Berlin meetup that
it's great to be part of an initiative
like this where you can truly see the
effect of your work we did two workshops
and it changed the face of the community
in Berlin reason number four you will
learn more about communication teaching
and a lot about closure the tivo one of
organizers said no matter whether you
are starting with your first steps in
programming or you join closure bridge
as a coach you will grow and learn from
this experience and then the last and
most important reason it's fun so yeah
we are really happy to have you over at
our booth there was I will talk about
closure bridge thanks you thank you
everybody for listening and yeah have a
nice evening
thank you very much you want to
for questions but we're still here today
and tomorrow you can find it out our
boots pleasure bridge Berlin can also
still use more sponsors for the upcoming
workshop so if your company wants to do
something awesome come talk to us thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
