get this started on a good note but if
not you'll forget it by the time the
conference ends so here we go fertile
ground the roots of closure in their
talk about influences of poetry here's
my agenda I'll try to get to all of
these things but I can't promise
anything
given the direct kuhnian rules Who am I
well that's me right there haven't
gotten that out of the way the years
1994 there's a great year great year for
me I was starting college trying to
decide which philosophy program I was
going into but less important was a
language called C++ was really starting
to gain some traction actually it was a
very popular language by this point was
four years three or four years away from
standardization but it had already
gained a great reputation as a language
that was what strongly typed it that we
were people were coming from C and C++
really filled a filled a sore spot for
them now this this this was the common
view but this is also the view of a
certain person you might know rich wrote
a paper back in 1994 that put together
this this really cool functional way to
do things in C++ and it's a very good
paper and he has nothing but praise for
C++ in their recommended reading what
would change you know why why are we
here talking about closure and and
instead of rich being home fighting with
C++ well like all good stories this one
starts with a camel many camels actually
see that there was a language called
pearl maybe you've heard of it
it's supposed to have a release sometime
soon it really it came out of nowhere
and and and got people really excited
about dynamic programming and in fact it
was among other things it was the it was
the glue that held the web the early web
together and people were really excited
about Perl we're really excited about
the possibilities of dynamic dynamic
languages and and and another person
came along this guy named Paul Graham
and he he was talking about another
dynamic language but it was called Lisp
and his essays got people really really
excited about Liz and the confluence of
the excitement on parole and other
languages in programs essays you would
think we're ready we're on the cusp the
Lisp is gonna break out well
unfortunately that wasn't the case there
was a real there is there wasn't there
is a really visceral reaction to to to
Lisbon and whether that's founded or not
it's real and and the world was just not
ready I think so another language came
along that sort of filled a lot of sore
spots that that existed from C++ and
that was Java job I have a lot of good
things about it and many of them
influenced closure itself but
unfortunately Java has a lot of problems
and and and and it's those problems that
probably have influenced closure more
because not all influences are positive
and and I'm gonna try to touch on all of
these points at some point but just keep
in mind that Java is a is a big
influence on closure but not in the way
that you might expect oh not always a
notion that expect Disney tight so
there's a there is a there's a quote
probably already it's by guy Steele and
and he's talking about C++ programmers
when he says this and it was
it was tongue-in-cheek I believe it was
tongue-in-cheek but I think that there's
a lot of truth to this statement but
unfortunately I think that Java falls on
the wrong side of the halfway mark and
and so as a result there's still there
still was that people were not ready for
a list but it just wasn't close enough
not the list to to to get people to
adopt it so really clearly something had
to change something had to change in the
in the overall mindset of the
programming community and I think that
it did and and and there are two big
reasons among others but there are three
big reasons among others and those are
Ruby Python and JavaScript and I think
that these languages have really opened
people's minds for what this what what
they list has to offer
and if you're if you come from a
background in these languages I want to
say thank you because it's it's through
your hard work that you that we've
gotten to the point where we can
actually have a conference where 200
people show up for a live those
languages help to help to work against
the kingdom of now so this is this
phrase comes from an essay that Stevie
Iggy wrote that basically refers to the
way that Java makes you cram all of your
your your functions to be attached to
two classes and you know whenever we're
writing whenever we start with a new
Java project we we have these these
classes these domain objects and we
figure out all of the attached behavior
and eventually get to the point where
you have this big util thing that's
where you put all of these these methods
that don't quite fit anywhere and there
was a really functions and actually
those those other things are actually
functions too but we won't talk
right now so there's there's a few
languages that that take a different
approach to this they don't they do not
attach their behavior to the classes in
fact it's separate
I have clips in the middle it has other
influences but I'm going to stick to
this for now so Lisp and clips and dill
and they take a different approach
innate the their their unit of
programming is the function and to do
object orientation Erik functions and
the generic functions dispatched on on
the the types of their arguments and one
of them being there the classes of the
dealing with so they they handle the
problem where if you want to extend the
class how do you do it well in Ruby you
would just go into the class and you
would you open it up and you put it in
there but unfortunately we we know how
that ends that's that's that's not fair
we we love Ruby and there's a lot of
Ruby programmers here so maybe this is
more
but in any case there's a monkey in
there another way you know mr. Devlin is
going to talk about this further so I
won't go into detail about this so you
know we've heard all this before close
your head pulls things out at the
protocol and and you extend the protocol
and and and your things are not your
your classes are not directly directly
manipulated Alfred North Whitehead he
was the star of this great movie that I
saw are we there yet
it's a did anyone see that but that
movie was it was it was a great film I
think rich really opened a can of worms
when he when he made Alfred North
Whitehead the hero of his his movie
because for two reasons well one that
there are other influences like less
than Lamport that I think they're
probably equally important but but more
importantly zombies like me went out and
found process in reality and looked in
there and said where's the part about do
sync I don't see anything about Malkina
it's what's going on it's really dense
stuff but one thing that enriches talk
beside state time identity is the the
notion of subjectivity which I don't
think that a lot of people have given
play to so again like it like all good
stories this one starts with the man in
love or the man of the world
Ricky he's he's not in love but he has
desires like oh man and he hates he
loves a woman who's funny if he loves a
woman who's lovely and he wants a woman
who hates the show
I Love Lucy reference so bear with me
here there's a woman named Lucy she's
lovely she is lovely she is funny but
she does not hate the show so you know
how will probably figure out that
there's a match between these two people
well at any given point in time we can
we can check if there's a matching and
we see if they there's a Ricky can fall
in love well at this time at this point
in time no he doesn't there's not a
match but there may be another point in
time perhaps Lucy is is disenchanted
with the the world of Cuban big-band
music and and she decides she hates the
show and so that's the time that that
Ricky meets her and and there is in fact
a magic he falls hopelessly in love and
is in big trouble there are high jinks
ahead I think that's the way we need to
approach programming in closure we can't
we can't always have such control over
the world where where we just stop
everything and say what is the value of
now what
now the word now in closure is
meaningless because things are just
moving along and we have to be able to
deal with that a subjective view and
it's important it's an important point
and and and I'm not sure that I'm not
sure that that point is stressed enough
so Prolog and data love these are these
are two languages logic languages that
that have a profound influence on
closure but I'm not sure that we've
quite seen the full influence yet and to
explain what I mean I'm going to talk
about
but not the one that you think I'm
talking about and what that means is not
not everything should be test driven I'm
going to posit that perhaps maybe maybe
our programs aren't supposed to be test
driven either and so because our
programs are made of of thought stuff
it's it's a real it's a real nebulous
term I have a copyright on this it by
the way and perhaps perhaps our programs
need to be need to be proven they need
to be they need to be dealt with
logically in order to to to get up to
four four that's right I'm not sure what
I'm trying to say but they think we need
to approach the programs logically and
we need to be able to improve them
instead of just throwing a bunch of
tests of them now that's not to say that
that PVD is not important I just think
that in the case in the direction the
closure is going it just has too many DS
we need to test it's important it's part
of the bigger picture
so Haskell Haskell has huge influence
over closure
it can't be understated and a lot of it
is superficial in that if you just line
up a bunch of core Haskell functions and
and put them side by side with closure
functions it looks exactly the same and
in a lot of cases it that the idioms for
using them are exactly the same but but
more importantly as the the influence of
laziness that hospital brings to the
table and what laziness gives us is it
helps us avoid among other things
explosion
exploding computation non termination
and full realization of intermediate
results so that we can process large
chunks of data well Haskell's laziness
is pervasive
but closures is not so two things are
less solved by laziness than they would
be in Haskell
whereas full realization the most
important part in my opinion is fully
supported with closures laziness and
that but but closure is placing this as
a windowed view meaning that we deal
with things not at one of the time
laziness we deal with things in big
chunks of laziness so that although and
this is why things like exploiting
computation aren't fully supported
because you can taking a windowed view
part things at the end of your window
things at the end of your chunk could be
extremely expensive to calculate if this
windowed view has has influence in
something called mony and DB which is a
database that tries to solve problems of
query speed by trying to align the data
sets that it deals with with cache sizes
so there's a paper we can talk after
this find me if you're interested a
really good paper that describes you
when a maybe and you'll see a lot of the
same influence you'll see a lot of the
same talk that you might see about
closure in there but databases in
general have a huge influence on closure
in many ways but mostly the way that it
deals with with mutation and these these
you know we know what these are they're
closures model for mutation and the
semantics deriving
the way the thing that's changed
speaking of mutation if we if you if we
view our object-oriented programming our
procedural programming as as a set of a
graphical mute of interlining
interlocking mutations it becomes very
complicated and and this is what we're
constantly dealing with and this is part
of the reason why I think that maybe
taking the T the approaches is not
always the best way because this can get
extremely complicated and it's hard to
cover all of these paths but what
closure goes to do is to bring that down
to one point and that's the reference
type which it's it's motivated by a
language called I'm Ellen and now also
has breath types the semantics for
change are very different but that that
that isolated point of changes is the
same across both languages and they it
actually looks similar if you if you put
them side by side bearing in mind that
the semantics are different Erlang
Erlang is another interesting language
it's it's a beautiful language and it's
very strong for what it tries to do and
which is providing distributed
computation among other things and to
take the example of a simple counter you
would just you package your your
functions and then and you're matching
on certain parameters and when you wanna
update your counter you you're matching
on the end of the process and on the
side of
process and and and you know your your
logic for acting your logic for updating
is is tightly packaged with the process
itself of closure picked a slightly
different approach to that and that just
the state itself is is hidden is
packaged in the agent and the function
to perform on the on one on that state
is given instead of so it's an open
system it's more open than Erlang and so
it's very it's very closer it's very
close your closure is very open very
open there's ways to extend things at
runtime and so although over length has
a as an influence on closure it's it's
more along the negative influence
whereas closure tries to back away from
certainly design decisions that are made
okay so Homer describes a scenario where
my scene
my scene chariot races occurring and
chariot technology that he describes is
actually more advanced than the the
chariots in his own culture this is
exactly how I feel every time I read a
paper or a book from the 70s ranges and
it's just an amazing thing there's so
much information back there that the
closure is built upon that if you just
spent a you could spend a lifetime
reading about it and and and and never
exhaust the well
but thankfully for us rich has read all
of those and he's put them together in
closure and he's made a beautiful
language and I think that one day when
we get to the point of we've been here a
few years and enclosures being some
influence some other SAP is going to be
at a conference talking about this
beautiful language and these are the
throw is agenda that's going to look
something to this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
