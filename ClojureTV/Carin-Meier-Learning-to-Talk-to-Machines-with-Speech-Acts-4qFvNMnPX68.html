okay great
so I really like stories I think stories
teach us I think stories entertain us
I think stories are a fundamental way
that humans communicate so this
presentation will be in the form of a
story and it begins as a lot of stories
do once upon a time
so once a long time there was a
programmer and she was quite a happy
programmer she liked what she did she
had a company that she liked to work for
she liked all her co-workers and she
looked forward to going to work every
day but there was one thing that she was
missing and that was time there was so
much cool stuff to look into papers
talks that she'd heard new libraries
that she heard about on Twitter and
stuff that she wanted a hack and by the
time that she got home from work cooked
dinner
cleaned up she just didn't have enough
time to do it all before going to bed
and getting up the next day so she was
in this frame of mind when she saw an ad
for a cruise to the Bahamas and she
thought I haven't taken a vacation in a
while this is a perfect time I'm gonna
take a vacation for me and it's gonna be
a hack vacation and it's gonna be great
I'm gonna have time to do all the things
I wanted to do so she prepared she
invested in a waterproof suitcase for
her laptop and her AR Drone that she
wanted to hack on just in case because
she was going on a boat you know you
don't like any spray on it no when she
packed her things and set off for the
vacation day one was beautiful blue
skies warm weather adult beverages
perfect day to however things started
changing sky started getting dark this
big weird clouds started rolling in and
the water started getting choppy and the
crew started running around muttering
about how they had just entered the
Bermuda Triangle and things just got
worse from
there the boat started rocking as she
was running below deck to her cabin she
even thought she saw something that
looked like a sea monster but certainly
that couldn't been the case so she she
ran down to her cabin
grabbed her suitcase with her computer
equipment in it was reaching up to
secure it and the boat tipped upside
down and everything went black when she
came to she was clutching onto a
suitcase and there was just sand she was
okay she brushed herself off took stock
of her situation no boats or anything
anywhere in sight she appeared to be in
an island that had nothing on it
no one there but she didn't panic
because she realized that the first 24
hours in this situation was critical and
she'd watched a lot of Discovery Channel
and she came prepared so she very calmly
opened up her suitcase and took out her
portable solar power generator and
hooked it up to her laptop and she was
ready to code
so one of the things that she'd always
wanted to look into because she'd never
been formally trained in computer
science was actually how to make a
language this parser thing seemed to be
very interesting to her so before she
left she downloaded this closure library
called insta parse and what she really
liked about it was one of the features
it said insta parse aims to be the
simplest way to build parsers in closure
and it seemed like he could do it with
regex
expressions so she wanted to start small
she'd never done this before so she just
wanted to say just put in a 1 like an
integer and get back an integer it'd be
a small step but it would you know be an
important step so she sat down in a
first requiring the library insta parse
and then she started defining her
grammar her foot in her parser and it
was really nice
in insta parse because it looked exactly
like a red-cheeked expression she could
just define a number as a regex
expression for a digit and when you
executed this function parser string 1
you got back a parser tree node with a
number in the string 1 very cool but
insta parse had an even better future
than this because you could apply
transformations on it and a bottoms-up
fashion so you can use it for evaluation
as well so she could find a
transformation on this number node as
just read string and parsing it through
the input you put through the parser and
then transform and evaluate the nodes
and outcomes a one very small step but
very exciting for her so she wanted to
push it a little bit further what if now
you could just put in number speech
delivered numbers and have it
automatically turn it into a vector
wouldn't that be cool and she could do
this by building up the parser a little
bit more so now in addition to having
numbers she also had this thing called
spaces and when you put the angle
brackets around an instant parse that
means you want to suppress that parser
nodes who didn't want that in the parser
tree but to know about it in the grammar
and he had vectors which were spaces and
numbers and then we have expressions
top-level expressions that he could
either be a number or a vector so now
when she ran it through the parser one
two three four
she got an expression which had a vector
in it which had numbers which had values
which restraints cool so let's build up
our transformations a little bit more so
in addition to the number read string we
want to transform vectors by the
composition of a vector in a list and at
the very top level we can't have it in
the form we want to so we'll just give
it the identity function for an
expression the parse function didn't
change and that when she put in parse
one two three four it automatically
turned it into a vector very cool she
wanted to push it a little bit farther
so what if we had an operation and said
plus one two three four and had
automatically sum up the vector that
would also be cool again just to build
up the grammar a little bit more so now
in addition to everything else we had
before we have operators which are just
a string plus string - and an operation
which is an operator and a space in the
vector and we have to again add it to
our top level expression of which is
either now a number a vector or an
operation so when we go ahead and try
this we get an expression which contains
an operation which contains an operator
and our vector so we have to build up
our transformation again so this is just
like a little helper function if we get
an operation in here whether it's a plus
or minus that just gives you back the
actual closure operation which is plus
or minus and we add that to our
transformations so and if it's an
operator we choose our operator and then
the operation we actually apply that
plus to there are values the purse
doesn't change of course and then when
you execute it it indeed sums them up
so she was really happy about this but
she felt like it was kind of missing
something cuz if it was gonna be her
language she like wanted a repple with
it so it would come up and say it's my
cool language to type things in it would
be really nice and since it was written
in closure she could do this pretty
easily so she required her parser and
then she just find a really short
expression to be her repple so it would
print out you know the prompt for her
cool language and then it would read in
the input and parse it and then just
print it out and just recur pretty
simple and of course he'd have nice
little hello greetings of whatever she
wanted to say cute yeah coming up so she
brought up her own very own repple with
her own language for the first time and
it was great she could put in one she
could put in some numbers she could add
them up and it was really cool so she
had a lot of fun with this and the days
passed on her Island and she had her
ar.drone and she flew her arrow drone
all around the island she was indeed the
only person on it and she found some
fruit trees and you know some stuff to
eat and some wood and she built them a
really cool treehouse and she started
building up more features of her
language so that was a lot of fun to to
her but even though she kind of had this
and had all this time to hack she kind
of felt really lonely you know because
there was no one to talk to and she
really didn't realize how much she
missed talking to people until she was
just in this alone situation and she's
kind of sad and feeling this way and
walking along the beach when she noticed
a suitcase had washed up it was an old
battered suitcase and waterlogged and
when she opened it up it had mushy
things in it that I guess used to be
papers completely unreadable but there
was one thing that has survived it had
been packed in the ziplock bag and it
contained a book and a paper and the
book was speech acts
an essay on the philosophy of language
by John Searle and the paper was
elephant 2000 by John McCarthy and she
took this as a divine act of Providence
and sat down on the beach right there
and started reading the book first and
it was all about what does it mean to
speak so when somebody says pass the
salt what does that mean I mean
certainly sounds come out of your mouth
these utterances but there's a higher
meaning to that whether you're speaking
in English or French or Spanish
you actually want somebody to give you
that salt so this is what's what this is
all about it's a higher order of meaning
to language and this higher order of
meaning to language is called in
philosophy speech acts in particular
they're called elocution area acts
these are coined by Austin and how to do
things with words in 1962 and later
expanded on by Cyril in 1969 and it's
easy to explain it kind of examples so
an example of an elocution your act is
assertions it's hot or commands and
requests please pass the seaweed or
queries do you see a coconut so there's
another kind of speech act as well and
these are a little bit different these
are called parallel cushion Airy speech
acts and these were coined by Cyril in
the speech X book in 1969 and these are
not so much concerned with direct
actions but the effects that these acts
have on the actions thoughts and beliefs
of the hearers so examples of these
would be to persuade to convince to
alarm to scare so she's been picked up
the paper by John McCarthy the elf in
2000 and it talked about these speech
acts as well and in it it had his ideas
about programming language in which the
communication and inputs and outputs
were based on these speech acts so why
would you want to do this
computer language well he thought in
computer language use of speech acts
learn from the extensive use of
philosophers and what light can be shed
on the philosophical problems when we
consider how we want to use speech acts
of computers and finally that speech
acts are necessary in a common sense
informatics in in peach which people
interact to achieve goals and this is a
cool thing that it's independent of
being human if we took a spaceship and
actually went off to a planet with their
aliens they would have some sort of
language where they communicated which
would include speech acts some Martians
or robots would need the same thing so
she thought to herself why should my
rebel have speech acts so she started
trying to program the men so she started
the easy ones first
a serving right lots of programming
languages have assertions an elocution
your speech act she could search that
sunny was true and then she added
answering queries also an elocution Airy
speech act you could say query the value
of sunny and it would be true and she
added in requests which is a elocution
or a speech check as well like pass the
salt but this is kind of interesting
because when you accept in a request it
actually creates an internal commitment
that is performed at some future time so
she thought hmm maybe I'll add a new
data type and I'll call it a commitment
and I'll denote it by an asterisk so
could be like pass a salt and then my
repple can keep an internal list of
commitments and then I could have like a
cron like process that could to muley
check to see if there's any commitments
and needed to be performed so for an
example of this at the bottom if you had
a request to pass the salt
with a that would perform a function of
just returning back a keyword salt it
would actually create this commitment
mushu's also you know this was cool at
the speech hacks but she thought would
be cool of my rep also had beliefs and
she remember this is something
that John McCarthy had also talked about
in one of his papers ascribing mental
qualities to machines it might seem kind
of strange but there some good reasons
that you might want to do this I'm just
gonna kind of read some Joe McCarthy's
thoughts on this although we may know
the program it's state at a given moment
is usually not directly observable and
the facts we can attain about its
current state may be more readily
expressed by scribing certain beliefs
and goals and in any other way and the
believing goal structure is likely to be
close to the structure that the designer
had in mind it may be easier to debug so
she added another data type a belief
denoted by a pound sign and this belief
is described by a predicate function and
when this predicate function eval so
true the belief is helped so now she
could give you a parallel push nary
speech act she could convince her rebel
so she could convince her rebel that it
was a nice day if this function sunny
evaluated to true and she gave it a
string that would describe it it is a
nice day so now she was getting
somewhere so now she could do requests
with beliefs so she could first ascent
assert to her rebel that it wasn't sunny
then convinced it of the belief that it
was a nice day when it was sunny and
then give it a request to open the
window when it believed that it was a
nice day so if she asked it of the state
is your request done did you open the
window it would say no it's not a nice
day and the minute she asserted that it
was sunny it would go ahead and open the
window
so this is cool she had her repple
couple had speech acts it had beliefs
it'd be really nice if she was here
somebody talking to her too so she
decided to give her Apple a name Bob R
and to actually have it talk to her
with the sake command so we're gonna try
to do a demo of this right now I'm sorry
okay so first she gave it a speech
config so it allow her to speak to her
and we're just gonna go through the kind
of example it did before so asserting
that ofany was false and now convincing
the rebel that it's a nice day when this
function sunny evaluates to true and now
giving it a quest to open the window
when it believes it's a nice day it'll
print out the open the window that was
my question
sorry getting nervous snippets okay so
you asked the query is the open window
done false so now we assert that sunny
is true it is a nice day
so now we can ask it is the request done
true sorry
so now this is cool she had something to
talk to speech acts she could ask
questions I could talk to her but why
couldn't ask her questions itself like
if she put in something silly like some
unbound bar why couldn't her repple ask
her hey what's X so she programmed it in
and as an asking fig and we're gonna do
demo of that too so again until it to
speak yeah ask him fig okay so here
we're giving it a request to do a task
with a function that is has an unbound
bar X so it asks her you know what what
what is this and then you could ask is
the request done well no because it
doesn't actually know what X is so now
if she goes ahead and asserts X and asks
it then it'll go ahead and perform the
request for her
so she was having so much fun with this
talking to her repple having
conversations that she almost didn't
realize when she was having this that
she saw a ship on horizon so it was you
know she it was a sailing round she no
try to signal it the best that she could
she was hoping that it wasn't too late
she took her drones she flew it up she
tried to signal the the boat with the
drone but it was too late
the boat had sailed on so she sat down
with her repellents and what could we do
how can we how can we make sure that we
won't miss the boat again and it came to
her that she needed to get her drone in
on this speech acts action so luckily
the directive a our drone has a camera
so while the boat had been out there had
been taking some video of it and she had
OpenCV already on her computer so she
used the video to train the drone to
recognize the boat so the next time that
the boat would come by it would
recognize it and her plan was to have
the drone fly up with some earrings that
she had in her suitcase she'd attach it
to be nice and sparkly and would fly up
and kind of do like a dance shake thing
and then the boat would see this and
then she would be rescued so this was
her plan so she wrote a program in her
language first she of course wanted it
to speak to her and she imported some
libraries that she had he had enclosure
to control the drone and just did some
drone initialize functions to talk to it
and she just made some helper functions
to so this is going to go ahead and get
some navigation data from the drone the
AR Drone
parrot drone is a wonderful thing I'll
speak a couple minutes on it real quick
it has a camera in the front and a
camera in the back and it's got sonar
and you can get back all sorts of
navigation data so you can tell how far
is off the ground
and whether it's in a flying state or a
landed state so she wanted to hook into
all this information in her program so
the first thing she was going to do is
to assert that it didn't see the boat
and then she's going to convince it that
it is going to see the boat when see the
boat bar is true and then she's going to
convince it that it's flying when it's
navigation data and this is the
navigation data coming back from the
drone oh so the drone itself has a Wi-Fi
in it so you connect the computer to the
Wi-Fi and talk to it this way so when
the navigation data is in a control
state of flying or hovering that it
would have the belief that it's flying
and it would have a belief that it was
high enough when that navigation data
from the sonar got to one point three
meters and so now that she had the
assertions and the beliefs now she could
make these requests with the beliefs so
she wanted to take off when it spotted
the boat so that drone take off is the
command to control the drone she wanted
to go up at a rate of 0.3 until it
reached a cruising altitude and then it
would and stop when it was believed that
it was high enough and then she wanted
it when it was high enough and it had
done it had hovered and done this like
little dance thing she wanted it to land
so that's a plan
but it's hard it's hard where demos so
we're gonna we're gonna see what happens
so at this point I'd like to give just a
short safety okay so the air drones are
really they're just a really safe
consumer product and I have caught it
the wrong way before and put my fingers
in there and it just hurts and look I
have all my fingers so it's it's an
incredibly safe thing but there is like
a little technique so it should just go
up and do a dance in them come down
right here but if something goes wrong I
want you all to be aware aware of how to
catch it if the need may be especially
you guys in the front row right you
didn't have this coming in so this is
how not to catch a drone okay doing this
no that's not a good good way to catch
the drone so this is how to catch the
drought
so catch you on the bottom and then flip
it yeah and then the engine cuts out
okay so we're all we're all good on this
all right so at this point I'd like to
introduce my drone catchers that are
gonna be on the stage these are the ken
from you as well and john from neo so
they're just gonna cover this this side
and you guys are responsible for this
side okay so let's go on so first I'm
gonna plug it in and in case you're
wondering about all these strange
markings on the floor here this is just
so the drone is when it takes off it
went hovers and need something to look
at on its downward facing camera and if
it's a featureless floor it tends to
drift more which we're gonna try to
minimize at this point okay make sure my
earrings did you all see my sparkly
earrings that's wonderful so I've
sparkly earrings on here but I gotta
make sure it's straight okay all right
okay so the first thing we need to do is
connect to its Wi-Fi and there is wait
for green come on green yes yeah we're
going to switch to a fresh shell and
we're reading in that program that we
just kind of went through
so that's spot boat okay here's our
commitments and our beliefs in speech
acts and those sort of things all right
you guys ready all right I see the boat
I see you burned
I am flying
I am smiling the boat Eileen said no and
eBay
I'm so happy it actually worked that's
awesome okay that's all fun from here
now oh I had a backup video in case this
didn't work but we didn't need it yeah
so she was rescued yay and the first
thing she said to the real person that
she saw they came with the boat was
thank you and that's a speech act too
but she hasn't worked that in her wrap
up quite yet so uh I guess in closing
recap here insta parse is a really
beautiful parser and I encourage you all
to check it out and just create your own
languages because it's it's really just
a wonderful way to do it and if you
haven't done that or played with the
language or created language before
please try it it's a lot of fun so
computer science can learn from
philosophy and philosophy can learn from
computer science and I think this is a
really interesting area especially in AI
and these speech acts
are meaning behind our communication so
whether this is with humans or with
machines and I think it's especially
important when we're considering how
interconnected we all are with machines
and other humans oh okay so this this
was just like a tiny toy programming
language that I was playing with but in
the in my explorations I came across a
real full-blown programming language
that actually uses speech acts and this
was just released and
Tambor and it is open source it's the
star programming language on the Java
platform and it was coke oh it was
created or co-created by Frank McCabe
who was also a co-creator of the go
programming language so it is indeed a
full-scale programming language and it
incorporates a simplified model of
speech act theory as a basics for its
programming actors so it's kind of cool
the star has actors and speech actions
so kind of a cool thing but I found out
and also you should definitely read John
McCarthy's papers they're just a
goldmine he he has wonderful thoughts on
philosophy computer languages AI they're
great the thing that makes me sad is
this link won't work for you anymore
because just last week the site was
disappeared from the internet so you can
get to it on the wayback machine but if
anybody has any contacts at Stanford
that I could talk to somebody and
convince them to get it back up or you
know move it somewhere else
I would appreciate it so and playing
with drones and closure is just great
fun I've had a wonderful time doing it
I've the few libraries that I've written
her out on github and you can feel free
to check them out there's a Babar which
has all the stuff that we've talked
about in the in the demo and also clj
drone which you can control your drones
as well I haven't worked core async into
controlling multiple drones but it's
definitely on my list so and that's it I
actually I ended a little bit early so
if anybody has any questions oh just
remember like if you're answering
questions like I don't really know a lot
about philosophy or language parsers or
anything like that I do know fairly a
lot about the ar.drone so you can feel
free to ask about those questions there
but anything no I totally shut down the
questions okay
very good I do actually have recurring
commitments so yeah he could have them
be recurring or you could also have them
being executed until they had a belief
so instead of yeah so I have a little
bit more in the in the readme and then
the Babar
so anything oh sorry yeah I've heard a
little bit about the blackboard method
but I don't understand it all so I view
if you want to explain what a blackboard
is to everybody that would be
has anybody used blackboards stuff
enclosure
sweet sweet everything else oh yeah okay
um so OpenCV has Java bindings now so
you just build the opencv library you
have to have the native libraries in
there and then just use a jar to
communicate with it and I think that
somebody's written maybe uh or they've
been playing with closure wrapper for it
as well Sam yes hello I'm sorry how long
until I have had multiple drones flying
the farthest that I've done with
multiple drones is have to fly with
goals and beliefs they took off and this
is an interesting thing that this one
doesn't have tags on it but there's a
little tags that you can put on the side
of this and the hull they're predefined
that the drone can recognize it you know
and see it and tell you what you know
distance it is from it so I had the two
drones fly up and kind of turn around
until they believe that they saw each
other and then they wave to each other
and then landed so but yeah you can get
multiple drones flying in coordination
to each other you need to fiddle with
the network settings a bit let me see
one building time okay fiddle with the
network settings a bit to get them in
pure network mode and then you can get
them all talk together so and if
anybody's interested in how to do that I
had to get a shell strip that's kind of
custom that you put on the actual
busybox
Linux there so it's it's documented on
the CL J drone github if you want to get
your fleet swarm going
anything else
yeah well cool well thank you guys very
much I enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
