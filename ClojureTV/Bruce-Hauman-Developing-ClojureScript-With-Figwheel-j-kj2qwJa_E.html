and it's been mentioned a couple times
and I and I'd just built the pressure up
I've never talked in front of a group of
people before at a conference and so the
more times the fig will gets mentioned
if this pressure starts building I'm
like oh great but uh now I have some
expectations to fill so fig wheel is
basically a live coding foreclosure
script so if you're working on single
page applications and you want to do it
more rapidly and you don't want to go
through the difficulty that I'm going to
explain in a moment
that's what fig was for it also works on
node but I'm gonna I'm going to
concentrate on applications in the
browser because that's where it's most
understood I was Believe It or Not
really dissatisfied with a the feedback
loop you get when you're working on a
front-end application and the browser so
and this is the current state right we
we write code we reload the browser we
lose our application state and this is
the key one right here we lose the
application state and then to verify we
manipulate the code back it we
manipulate the application we fill out a
few form fields you know and do other
things
maybe tab through a couple forms to get
the application back into the state so
that we can test or verify the behavior
that we just modified and then we do it
over and we do it over and we do it over
again and it now what's not on the slide
is just how painful that is it's you do
the same like once you fill out the same
form like three times
your mind turns off our mind does maybe
some people really like that but my mind
just kind of starts going black
and I get out of flow right this this is
a very Cecotto experience then it just
breaks your creativity or mine you may
have a different experience some people
may like this it seems like they do
because a lot of people are doing it
alright so that led me to this very
simple question what experience do I
want and the answer came very quickly I
want to change my code and then see what
changed in the application I don't want
to you know fill out another form filled
with my first name and my last name in
some fake town name that I thought of
just now I so I came to this experiment
I said well what if I just do that what
have I just take a file that's been
compiled and reloaded back into my
application live in you know I had some
strange feelings about this that was
maybe this is a bad idea
maybe I shouldn't do this and not nobody
else seems to be really doing it you
know I was worried about the high
potential for instability you know I'm
just cramming JavaScript back into the
browser every single time I I compiled a
file and I was worried about the burden
of paying attention to the load time
side-effects of a file right now I not
only have to think about my code but I
have to think about what it's doing as
it's getting loaded now what happened
was is soon I I made its little
experiment I created a file that
reloaded itself and I found the the
feedback like amazing I found the fact
that I could like change a file and then
see the changes it was it was an aha
moment I would it is funny the
experience of it is different than
hearing about it or watching people
doing when you finally experience it
you're like what the heck you know I
mean this is this is the return on
investment for doing this for
thinking about the load time
side-effects is very very high because
you're iterating so much faster and
you're actually enjoying yourself
because you're staying in this state of
flow so ultimately I became an advocate
you know this people need to experience
this at least and on the extreme side
everybody needs to do this all the time
this is the best thing in the world you
got to try it you really do I mean you
really do so but there's a trade-off and
the trade-off is in order to get
instantaneous feedback you have to write
reloadable code and so the question
becomes oh I have a special definition
for reloadable code in this case in
order to get the experience you want you
want to write code so that when it's
changed and reloaded you see the
behavior change in your application so
that's a little different right you
could have functions in a closure
somewhere that if you redefine them they
didn't get changed so and I have this
other requirement that the apparent
state of the application is unchanged
again so these are qualities that you
can you can cultivate in your code and
it's really not that hard now can you
guys hear me okay okay so then the
question becomes how hard is it to write
reloadable code well closure has this
culture of reload ability and so because
we isolate state transitions and because
we mostly deal with pure functions and
we're really careful about these things
anyway you know closure script idioms
are highly reloadable but on the other
hand javascript api is the dom you know
adding an event listener you really only
want to add that once you know
and you don't want have to think about
removing it into data so the DOM is
stateful to the max it's really hard to
work within a reloadable way so it
requires strategy but then something
really really good happened react.js
came along and lets you to find
basically to find the dom as a function
of the state and so I'm going to ignore
that I already I think it's awesome does
anybody else think react is awesome I
mean it's awesome right and it's
inherently reloadable which again
eliminates a big problem with writing
reloadable code on the clients side so
this is a threshold this defines a
threshold that we kind of move past
we're writing reloadable code became
really easy almost inherent and what
you're doing ah yeah which means that
you can get instantaneous feedback if
you just reload the code all right up
the slide is broken well you know it's
it's code I wrote you know this
slideshow is a react application and you
know I'm going to change it I happen to
know where the bug is I put this extra
can you guys see this okay all right
this is extra G after JPEG I'm going to
save it now fig wheel isn't running
right now so I'm gonna do the thing
right I'm going to reload the slideshow
and then okay we'll get there soon which
slide was that you got okay it's down
here somewhere
and this is our experience right I
changed it I fix the code I recompiled
it I got the application back in the
state and it still doesn't work that's
because I need an S on this directory
here
it's okay though you know I changed it
I'm gonna reload the browser all right
everything's under control I mean this
is how we do you know everyday I'm used
to it you're used to it you know we can
do this we can we can reload the browser
I mean I forget what I was doing
oh yeah that's what I was doing I was
showing you uh my house I live in this
plastic bubble here no I really I do you
know it's a literal it's a literal
bubble and and you may have known
there's something about the shape that's
near and dear to my heart okay so I
don't know which came first here
actually you know what could have been
subconscious I don't know but uh and
also there's this paint job I'm thinking
about getting alright so I put this
transparent image on here and I wanted
to position it over my my don't I
thought I had it in the right position
but I don't so that's a bug I have to
fix it
are you guys ready to walk through all
the slides again no okay so maybe I'll
do something about that I will turn the
gweal on because I spent a long time
working on it for people how many people
use fig wheel alright that's good that's
great uh how many people use closure
script alright that's awesome
so four people use big wheel I have this
feature autoload false so if you want to
just do repla development you can just
turn the autoloading off for a period of
time and because it's on the client it's
really quick to turn it on and off so
but I have to reload it anyway to get a
to get this code because big wheel
wasn't on alright so here's where we
were
Figg wheel all right so we have to
position let's see
so that moved did you see that
so the Dom change the actual Dom on the
page just changed now granted it's not
like a flappy bird flying around but
it's this is kind of an amazing thing
it's a completely different experience
than say walking through your slides
over and over and over again and this is
how I wrote my slideshow I had the I the
power is that centered you guys anyway
does that look good or should I go with
this paint job burn I mean all right so
this is a completely different
experience and again it's experiential
until you actually do it you might think
yeah I can live with it you know am i
reloading it doesn't take that much time
but you should try it at least once and
you could write your own tools I mean
this stuff is not you know it's not that
hard
uh well there's like 360 commits on the
repository but all right so next I have
something much more exciting than say a
slideshow and that's a game and the game
is called crash verse so this is running
a fig wheel as well and so I had this
idea on the plane about a game where a
rocket with bad AI
is moving across the universe avoiding
obstacles like like that
wait I have to turn on resetting the
plants so the top level you know when
you're using fig wheel you know the file
is getting reloaded so if you want to
reset the planets and bring them into
your atom every single time that you
reload the file just uncommon or reset
the planets and so now you have the
bread thing that the ship is trying to
avoid but they're more of them this is a
great thing no and then toby Crawley
said you know you really need to have a
son so he added that himself it was
really cool and then you have explosions
as well wait he just went right into
that okay now you can change the
properties so this is live coding right
you are just working right in
experiencing and you're like you know
the sun's kind of big that red planet it
should probably be bigger and that's
really I mean let's watch that again he
gets blown up twice really because the
collision that he comes back anyway so
it doesn't matter so
this gives me a chance to interact and
have a conversation with the game as I
built it and so let's look at some of
the things you can do when you're using
think wheel let's look at some of its
features what is going on here all right
so I'm open up the dev console so you
can see the output here all right so
like I said you can modify you can use
the top level right as kind of a ripple
all right so I just printed out my
application state and I can look at it
all right
that's really convenient you can also
say you're working on a function and you
want to see the output
I'm just going to print this function
the output of the function and then I
can I can change it a little I can say
well does that look right no no no that
doesn't look right does that look right
and so again you're getting
instantaneous feedback and because
you're in the buffer that you're saving
anyway it just feels natural all right
you can say remove the planets you set
the plants wait there's some contention
there isn't there huh all right so again
the top level can be used to inspect
your application but not just the top
level right you've got these you've got
these functions being called while this
game is being played and you're like I'm
not sure if this P data here is wait is
it control I'm not sure this P data here
is is actually a planet coming in so I
just look at it so this is print line
debugging and that's a compile error
wait that's another feature
all right so this is print line
debugging and I got you know I got a
nice sampling of data here and I can
just verify these are planets you know
they have a position a speed a color and
a width great so again you can reach
into functions and because your programs
running normally your functions on the
execution path and you can actually get
quick sampling of what's going on you
may have noticed this hey they come up
every single time that's because I made
this really simple macro now this is
something that think wheel does that
it's inferior competitors don't I think
wheel will I don't know I could be I
could be wrong somebody can correct me
fig will reload your macros and then
recompiles all the dependent files
instantly and so there's a bug in this
macro I'm trying to I'm trying to log
the word hey and of course it's treating
it as a sequence instead of a string and
so there's this bug here I save the
macro and instantaneously I see that
it's fixed it's printing out the
complete word hey I mean come on hey you
know now it's that's I mean what's
happening there is kind of amazing you
know your your enclosure land and
everything kind of propagates instantly
and you see the result so again I'm I'm
advocating that fig wheel is pretty cool
so there's a heads-up display right
there's a heads-up this way you see that
the the green circle keep popping up
whenever code is loaded in the heads-up
display also tells you when you have a
compile error and let's say if you're
you're really wondering where that error
is you can just click on it and it goes
to the line in the file where you made
that error and I made another
somebody actually submitted a commit for
this actually recently for that
particular exception does not have a
line number but somebody recently was
very helpful and out of that this also
is true for warnings
now this heads-up display took took me a
long time to write because it's
completely non intrusive it doesn't use
any external libraries it's just a div
at the bottom of body and it it does
everything internally with Ja is no
extra code pulled in from the outside to
do this it's just pretty much straight
JavaScript doing this now another
feature is you know you're in this live
programming environment so if you create
code that's generating warnings you
actually don't want that code to load
right because you want to keep your
environment stable and so right down
here there's whenever you generate a
warning or if there's something to auto
saved or something like that it does not
get loaded into your project until you
get rid of the warning all right so
another thing that big wheel does is
reload CSS which is kind of a minor
feature but actually turns out to be
pretty helpful so I just changed the CSS
it was instantly loaded but this gives
some insight into a little insight into
this game here I didn't really want to
think about how to Center the explosion
and so the rocket really is the size of
the explosion and this is and this game
is all div it's all in the Dom it's all
divs it's it's in ohm its react and it
runs really it runs really quickly it's
great it's a great you can actually
build quick demos now in react just to
see how things work and it's pretty
great
alright and then we'll go back
now we're going to talk about broadcast
I actually have this so one of the
things right when you're developing you
have how many devices and how many
platforms you're needing the target and
it's helpful to see the same program
running in two different environments at
the same time one of the things that fig
wheel does is broadcast so I changed the
code and it broadcasts the changes to
all connected clients and so you can see
if there's a difference in Safari and
Chrome or if there's a difference on
your phone and what you're doing on your
desktop or the tablet so that yeah that
is I'm going to keep doing that so uh
and I can add the planets back and so
that does anybody like that feature
right okay I'm going to keep asking for
that I needed I needed I really do uh
now besides broadcast there's this other
thing that people asked for that I
really didn't want to do and they wanted
multiple builds they they like we have
an admin build and we have a dev build
you know these are both closure script
builds and we'd like to work on them
live at the same time in the same you
know line process and so I don't know
why I did it but I did it and so here we
have tests running in one tab so right
now there's two Live builds going on so
I have tests running in one tab I've got
the application running in the other
right and the difference between builds
is that the test build is just getting
the test code as well as the core code
so now if I reload both environments are
getting this new information they're
have one of the tests happens to be on
center that
and so if I change center now notice the
fav icon there's a fav icon that's green
that means the tests are passing and
this is just seal J s test and did you
see a go red all right all right and
that's just because the code is shipping
the code is shipping both places and you
know the test Runner is just getting the
tests are just getting run every single
time it gets new code and so I'm not
like creating a phantom Jas thing I'm
not doing anything I just have another
tab open and the tests we're running in
it and we can fix it too right we can
fix the test and the code shifts both
places now there's a delay because the
tab isn't focused right but you can
focus the tab and you can see you can
see your failures I'm pointing at my
screen but I'm assuming you can see your
failures
they're right here right I get yeah I
can see it oh yeah okay great
sorry and so that's now another thing
though like if I change let's say I
change the test so have I changed the
test code is not going to ship here
right so you saw no greet you saw no
green circle and you saw this turn red
and code did ship here so that you know
multiplexing builds where the bright
bill against the right code has turned
out to be kind of helpful so that is
something else that fig wheel does
alright so multiple bills did oh and so
then I was working along and now I
really I have to say thank you to the
early closure script repple for not
working at all I mean we've almost been
better if it wasn't there because you
spend hours right he'd spent hours and
and and then it wouldn't work so it was
a big motivator for me to create fig
wheel which I'm really glad I did like
if the rapper worked I might not have
done it and I wouldn't have had
broadcast and I wouldn't had multiple
bills and I would have had this on save
reload workflow that I really have
become accustomed to so thank you early
JavaScript no close your script repple
but now the rebels started changing and
becoming good which is good and and I
found myself in this position I have a
closure script compiler running with all
the compiler information and I have a
connection to the browser that shipping
code up to it I think I need to include
a ruffle as well you know so I there's a
ripple that comes with fig wheel and
it's different than other ripples is
this the right one no good this is the
right one okay and it's different from
other ripples in that it shares States
and shares state with your application
so it knows what's going on yeah in your
application man next time I'm getting
somebody typed for me crash bursts crash
burst core alright so I'm changing
namespaces and I can just look at my
half state oh thank you you guys
crash verse there we go
so I can just look at my off state now
if you guys have used other rebels and
connected them like say in your
application a warning would get thrown
and say whatsapp state I have no idea
what a state is this is sharing this
compiler information it's sharing the
compiler information with your auto
build process with your repple so it
knows what's where so things like doc
and all these things work pretty well
and let's see I mean you're having this
direct conversation right right now your
your in your application what was it
remove and then it's ba-bang and they're
gone and this actually is ripple what
now one thing about this ripple is then
it's a broadcast ripple which is a
unique which is a unique thing it means
you type your command and anybody who's
listening gets it it's worth it right
it's worth it you only get one response
back and that is the fastest response so
not perfect but helpful in what else is
going on so this repple multiplex is as
well
Wow I mean let me put this a different
way so you can only have a ripple into
one build though like because the repple
is built around a build configuration so
you have the dev ripple and in this case
I have a test so I have a test build and
a dev build but I can only have a raffle
into one of them so when I when I hit
print you're not going to see it here
right it doesn't it doesn't go to this
connection
but this cool thing that I did I can
quit and then choose a different rebel
and now I have a rebel to the test build
and I can print to for instance and it
only goes there and it doesn't go here I
have no idea what that is but and I
think there's something else about the
rebel that I'm that I'm forgetting but
I'm going to quit back out of this one
go back to the dev oh yeah you see all
these big wheel controls at the the
lately there's before we used to have a
closure repple and then the clgs rebel
would boot on top of it and it'd be kind
of a second-class citizen this takes a
different view and it just boots a
closure script rebel directly into your
application and then just gives you a
few select operations that poke through
the closure script repple into the
closure process so you can control your
builds so let's say you want to like
here's a function you can do you can say
switch you can actually see the current
status of your system so I can see that
the auto builder is actually running I'm
focusing on these these two builds are
building and I have one connection
freeze each of these builds I can also
do something like ax but I feel like
something's funky I can just I can force
a build I can just switch to one of the
builds
and now it's only Otto building on the
test build and shove in sending code to
the test build so again that's another
feature of fig wheel ah how's this look
yeah okay all right applause really
fixes everything you know even a dry
throat so I've just run through all
these features anybody have any
questions about anything I just showed
you okay shoot him in the back yeah yeah
crash verse is is on my github account
so you can totally and it's it's naive
you know it was like a 15 minute yeah
thing it's super now I mean yeah yes oh
the gentleman the back sorry I didn't
see you
what like a debian test no yeah you
could but that would be a separate line
again process you sooner saying yeah oh
yes
Leslie yeah so n ripple and ripple would
be a solution for that but yeah we're
not going to talk about that right now
so unless somebody really wants to now
there's somebody else had a question yes
so that's the same as the N rebels story
so in closure works really well for this
is that make so it's its closure mode
but for inferior list mode and so the N
ruffle story is coming online like in
the next month or so because
all these changes are coalescing so it
will the cider story will be actually
and it works with perfect like it works
in cursive wears yeah right yeah it
works in Kherson yeah the end repple for
fig wheel works in cursive and if you
have it and if you're really if you know
what's going on you can get a working
insider and everything but yeah yes
website web sockets just that's actually
how I do it with sound effects all right
yes yes that's correct that is correct
that's why it looked really painful yeah
any yes yeah yes I can
the most important thing is this right
here but besides that they're a bunch of
libraries where you can just add them on
the phone like you don't want to reboot
line right it takes a while and you're
like oh I meant to pull in moment or I
meant to pull in this library but I'm
going to and I really want I'm in the
flow I want to use it now so you could
just add a dependency and if it passes
all the requirements which sometimes are
esoteric you know it gets put in and if
it doesn't it doesn't
but like ohm there are a lot of
libraries that do they just come right
in and then there's some that have more
difficult dependency situation and they
don't come in but this just uses
pomegranate underneath and tries it's
best to load the library yes John
okay that's a good yeah it's a good
question all all I think we'll does in
that case is it just shells out to
configure you know to a shell script of
your choosing so if your editor is
sophisticated enough to listen to a
shell script that has remoting
capability then it can just it could
just pop the line number Colin oh okay
okay oh yeah maybe you're wrong
curse of everyone that's pretty it's
pretty awesome isn't it
come on alright any other yes sir
so uh wait I can't unfortunately I can't
hear you that well
so fig will provide yet there's an
onload hook but at the component level
yeah no but there's an onload hook that
you get with fig wheel where you do your
bookkeeping and stuff like that now one
of the things that like one of the
things about ohm or react render is it
rear Enders the whole tree right
I don't know this helps your problem but
so you can have react render at the top
level just rear entering your whole tree
every single time you make a change and
the state's maintained and even in the
Dom so does that speak to your problem
or not okay yes sir wait I mean am i
hearing your question correctly now you
want you closure to be as good as
closure script
No
sorry I just had to take that what
that's a that's a really like so you're
saying you'd like a tool like this for
closure yeah yeah I mean the ruffles
the closure ripple is pretty powerful
and you could probably put a hook in
your editor that on save it you know it
shoves the file through through the pipe
but yeah it's the same thing like you
could write something like this for
closure but the onus is on you to write
reloadable code and then have a hook
that just reloads it when you save your
file does that make sense you want me to
do it is what you're saying
okay okay okay yeah the question is why
not that's probably not for me to answer
but I'm going to take it as a compliment
though all right okay that's just the
way I am all right anybody else yes sir
it does work with node I know that some
people are using it with node it is
different you know nodes a different
environment because you don't have
visual feedback right and so when I was
working with node and giving it a try I
was always printing things out you know
to the terminal to kind of see what was
going on so it's a it's a different
value proposition but it can still be
done and I don't have a lot of
experience with it but the set up is is
the same the set up is basically the
same does that answer your question okay
yes sir oh how are you already there
wait did you have a closer script
question all right yeah
yeah yeah yeah so I'm really tempted to
talk about that but I want to like
preface it with like I've never used it
I've only read blog posts about it
curse early right I just skimmed them
right and so I'm now I'm going to answer
with authority so hot module
there's a I would say there's a problem
in the JavaScript landscape in that
they've chosen closures for modules and
so reloading them is it's much more
difficult much much more difficult than
the object literals that are in the
Google closure system Google closure
system you have a global basically a
global object literal that has all your
namespaces that you just redefine on
onload so what they're having to do
right is they're having to rear acquire
these libraries and then walk and then
walk up that so my convenient phrase for
is its its point of require reloading
that you kind of have to manage it so
everywhere this file is required there's
potentially you're going to have to
manage its its reloading somehow
specifically so that and that can grow
arbitrarily large right and so whereas
with fig wheel its point of definition
so you're reloading the code at where it
was defined and it's just getting is
getting pushed in now I again like I
said that with authority but you know I
have none
yes yeah okay so you've been using it
you have okay wait is it better though
okay all right um home living compose
and cons do people want to hear okay
uh boy I just remembered this is on
video huh uh it's it's really great I've
been experimenting with domes for a long
time and uh I my friend said you know I
really want my friend said I really
wanted to build a dome in my backyard
and he taught me was I didn't believe
him anybody said it for like six years
and so finally I was like okay and then
I came across a design that I came up
with that I really liked and so I did it
and it's small it's 18 it's uh it's 18
foot diameter and it's a bet it's a
glorified bedroom all right there's no
there's no kitchen there's no bathroom
that's in in the house and it's really I
don't know it's fun to build your own
structure and live in it and then
actually enjoy it you know so I really
like it you know some you know some
people I was going to say some people
don't like it but that's not true
okay might not be for some people having
to go to the house to to use the kitchen
and whatnot but in its I mean that the
mountains in the southeast and that the
climate is pretty nice most of the year
most of the year it's pretty nice and
it's what you put it people always ask
me does it get cold is it too hot it's
really Pleasant it's really Pleasant all
around any other questions
alright so I just want to conclude with
I really enjoyed myself here at a
closure West's life you can find fig
wheel I think pretty easily now it's a
my repository does everybody feel
comfortable they can they can find it at
this point I think you can type it in in
it like it's the only thing with that
name so and if you want to play with
crash first it's in my repository as
well it should be at the top because I
was messing with it and thank you
everybody this is really fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
