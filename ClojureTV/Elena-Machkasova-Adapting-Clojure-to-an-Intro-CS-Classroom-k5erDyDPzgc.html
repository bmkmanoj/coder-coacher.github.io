I'm very happy to be here this is my
first closure conference I come from two
worlds that are not very common here
probably academia and rural Midwest so I
work at the University of Minnesota
Morris and one possible confusion here
is people ask me so how do you students
react to close an introductory class the
answer is I come taught it yet and I
wish I did and the last sort of three
years of my life was trying to make that
wish come true so I will talk about why
I would like to do this what are
possible issues with that there's a very
long to-do list and I'd be happy to take
any suggestions for how to make it
possible so because this thing has been
going on for a couple of years now we
actually have a name for this project
this it's called closure and closure and
education and the goal is to develop an
environment that will allow students who
have not had any programming experience
whatsoever to use closure in their
introductory class this is very much
work in progress this picture she
reflects different work in progress and
that's high school robotics that I'm
involved in but this is not the subject
but it illustrates nicely the state of
our project right now so lots of work
still needs to be done a little bit
about the background of where we're
coming from you can see that little red
dot on the map we are part of the
University of Minnesota but we are three
and a half hours away from the main
campus in a town of 5,000 people
we are a small liberal arts college
small means fewer than 200,000 students
we run a very small computer science
program and if you're thinking small um
well regret it about 15 to 20 students
with computer science major if you're
wondering how many faculty takes to make
that possible the answer is 3 3 full
time and we have sort of on and off
maybe one more person so we are small
when I interviewed and Morris that was
12 years ago i actually had a couple of
other offers or potential offers that
were closer to what i call home at the
time which was boston very different
place i was a city girl I didn't know
anything about small towns made a
mistake of ordering stir fry the local
restaurant because how can one screw up
a stir fry what I knew about Morris was
that they do a lot of undergraduate
research and that sounded really cool
because I wanted to include under
graduates in my research that's an
excellent idea but I didn't know hold on
more and I asked them a question that I
asked everybody every place that I
interviewed in and that was what
programming language do you use on your
introductory classes and they said well
you may have not heard the vet it's
called scheme so it says it was the most
common dialect of Lisp at the time and
at that point I started listening and by
the end of the interview I knew that I
wanted them to make me an offer and I
would take that offer and I would have
to explain to my two kids while moving
in the town in the middle of cornfields
and it all worked out 12 years later I'm
still there so but i'd like to point out
that that question the answer to that
question was
the size of thing so a language that we
use in an introductory class matters one
thing that you may have noticed is that
I don't say which language do you teach
in an introductory class I say what
language do you use in an introductory
class so an introductory first computer
science class that students are dropped
in with no background whatsoever uses a
programming language as a tool not as
something the students learn there so
the question is then what do it ceej
there and we see a lot of concepts and
skills that would be useful for their
future career in computer science and
with each computer science style
problem-solving meaning you take a
problem you formulate it in a way that
could use an algorithmic solution you
implement that solution you test it
maybe you look back at it and you change
things slightly so that when you look at
the two weeks later you'll still be able
to read it that would be ideal so those
kinds of things and there's a lot
involved there but it's not about
learning a language so um my CSV licen
whose work was mentioned here actually
the talk yesterday who developed a
curriculum called how to design programs
define what a good introductory language
is and it should be simple have
well-defined semantics sorry JavaScript
and should be non distracting so the
focus should be on concepts on skills
and problem solving north on learning
the language so um some thoughts on that
Phyllis and suggested and that I agree
with and some additional source and what
that language would be first of all I'm
a strong variable that it should be
dynamically typed because explicit types
are a distraction that's really not what
students should be focusing in yes we do
think in terms of types but but we don't
always think in terms of types and
statically typed languages tend to
introduce type syntax when it is
distracting when it's not needed
functional languages are great is first
introductory language because they focus
on function abstraction so you write
small functions you combine them compose
them to create your solution that's
modularity abstraction all of that good
stuff and one thing that I should
mention is that although i've been on
morris for 12 years and i am very happy
there the first six of those years I
didn't get to teach the introductory
class that I was so excited about and
that's okay because what I so later on
with the benefits from students taking
those classes and you see that in how
they use functions how they use model
arity how they tend to write small java
methods as opposed to one huge thing
that students tend to do otherwise so um
a couple of extra things to throw in
this is a new benefit of functional
languages that came up um students in my
software design class seem to be getting
JavaScript callback switch is the
essence of what happens in web
development now they tend to get it much
better if they came through the
functional programming introductory
class so that's really important for the
modern world parallel processing also
has callbacks and however their function
so MapReduce all of that good stuff they
may may not encounter it but web
development I'm sure they will encounter
for better for worse and another benefit
of actually not just functional
languages but languages that allow
interactive development ripple is great
again forces a lot of testing
interactive testing right
a so these are benefits of many
languages but lisps definitely fit into
that category currently we're using
racket language which is the descendant
of scheme and that's again the how to
design programming programs curriculum
and we're pretty happy with it but I
think there are some things that closure
can bring to the table that racket
doesn't quite offer and that is the
ability for students to build on what
they have learned immediately I get math
majors who try to use programming in
doing the math homework because they
want to model something I get students
who would like to write an interactive
game using stuff that they have learned
enclosure offers a lot of opportunities
for students to use was developed in the
community interact with people on forums
participate in open source program open
source projects attend meetups well
unless you live in Morris Minnesota but
all of that good stuff so thank you very
much that really is something that
students can use all of the work that
you guys do another great reason to work
from closure is concurrency and easy
access to simple concurrency you
changing my up to PA up and you see all
of the course go and that's an exciting
feeling and if you're doing some sort of
processing statistical processing that
requires a lot of processing power were
speed matters then that's a direct
benefit so um other things that closure
brings to the table integration with
Java that gets helpful later on I do
hope that in classes such as data
structures students would be able to use
closure in conjunction with Java and
kind of integrate that seamlessly rather
than using
lambdas that were added to Java recently
so another benefit is and this is my
personal opinion although probe the
educated personal opinion is that
closure has collections that are done
right so if you're doing your own
collections you can use that as a model
and that would be great so these are
reasons why I think closure brings
additional benefits compared to other
lisps in an introductory class now why
I'm not teaching it quite yet well the
first bullet point is probably
sufficient right okay that's why we're
all here right usability of error
messages so that's definitely something
that needs to be improved and i'll be
talking about what we're doing in that
direction very briefly other things ID
is that kind of getting there in terms
of being beginner friendly but none of
them is quite there yet beginner
students don't really know their way
around the project and it gets really
complicated for them to use even a light
table probably well I and I tried it not
in a class but with students who didn't
know closure and ID's I still still have
a way to go for that project manager
command line doesn't work for new
students beginner-friendly graphical
libraries again things may be getting
there but a lot of work needs to be done
there there there is a lot of weirdness
with strings that I'm sure you are aware
of but again throwing it at unsuspecting
students is probably difficult when you
apply a map to a vector and you get back
a sequence that makes sense to us how to
work through that with introductory
students I'm not quite sure I have some
ideas I don't think it's the end of the
world but there are some things that
need to be done to at least explain
what's happening here in a consistent
way which brings me to the last bullet
point here which is we need at least we
need some sort of textbooks that focus
on learning talk about big picture of
things rather than assume that somebody
already knows PHP or java and is just
learning closure and that's not quite
there yet so okay so now some things
that need to be done with error messages
and that's something that we've been
working on we have some ideas and i'll
show you what we have done so this is an
error message and you can imagine how a
new student would be looking at it it's
well it's confusing in many ways comes
with Jen step trace I deleted the ad the
other 63 also lines of that so that's a
problem eof we kind of know what that
means students don't and the lot of
error messages well all of the error
messages have phrased in terms of Java
terminology and we're talking to
students who are just learning their
first programming language we can't
expect them to learn to that's not
reasonable and some of the integration
with IDs again it's getting better but
more can be done there so highlighting
where they're happened doesn't
necessarily give you the entire
information and ease of navigation to
where there was actually caused could be
an improvement so um what we currently
do would do some error message
transformation so this is what that
error message that you so we'll look for
us will look like for us so it says it's
a compilation error that's important
that it's a compilation error and it
says in the file and it says probably a
non closing parentheses or brackets a
pretty easy guess here
it gives us a much harder and I'll talk
about that we do filter stacktrace to
leave pretty much just the core
functions and Student Code there are two
approaches that we use for transforming
error messages assuming that we have
them as Java exceptions we transform
them by applying regular expressions and
we add preconditions to common functions
now none of these ways is ideal but one
thing that we really don't want to do is
to change anything Ian closure compiler
because somebody would have to maintain
that and that's not going to be us so
we're a small group we're trying to be
very realistic there okay so adding
preconditions to common functions i will
talk about that first what that looks
like so if student code um uses a map
and they have a string as a second
argument and not a function you see the
original message and that's a
classcastexception java.lang.string and
closure laying I FN that speaks to new
students and tells them this is a
function no so what we do here what we
do here is we actually tell them that
the first argument of map and will show
what that is must be function but is a
string so how is this done we actually
redefine map and we do a check to check
that the first argument is a function
and the rest of the arguments are sick
herbals the two functions that you see
check a function check of psychobos
records what they're fainting argument
was and will only check for the first
one because of the first recognition
fails then we don't go to the next one
and if brigid the preconditions pass
then we just apply
the standard closure core may up to two
its arguments that generates a bunch of
warnings because generally you're not
supposed to overwrite slender closure
functions so we need to deal with that
somewhere in our system and just swallow
those and not show them to students
because they'll freak out but that's a
minor point there are bigger issues so
the nice thing about it is that we can
determine specific arguments that have
caused an error and the downsides of
that approach are that we need to
overwrite a bunch of functions and I
said my up filter that's how I was
thinking usually and then I realized oh
it's a plus and it's less than and it's
a bunch of things we need to somehow
load all of that into students code
because although they probably will know
that this is happening I don't want them
to focus on this this change and think
of these as specific functions that
they're using I want them to think that
their programming in real closure yes
they do we cannot overwrite all
functions that's impossible so the would
you need you have a second approach that
I'll be talking about on the next slide
and we need to be careful so far we've
played with that within see any issues
but the trouble was this approach is
once we have overwritten map because
we'll have over overridden it everywhere
so there may be potential issues we did
have done a lot of poking around but of
course that's not a guarantee that
nothing will come up so we're kind of
watching out for that okay the second
approach is a regular expression
matching so we have a list of regular
expressions for all possible exceptions
that we know might happen that's a lot
it's not an exhaustive list at this
point but we're expanding it and there
we just make sure
regular expression and we rewrite types
definitely and sometimes the wording of
the message in this case the wording is
fine or at least we couldn't come up
with a better one and we just replace
the types so sequence and number the new
idea that we've been playing with for
the last well maybe half of a semester
using what we call user scenarios so
imagine yourself as a new student who is
trying to program this stuff and try to
see what possible errors that person
might make this is much harder than
you'd think because it's very difficult
to pretend that you don't know something
that you actually do know but right now
we don't have interactive system that we
can use on real students and we're also
looking into an idea of adding what we
call hints so suggestions for what could
have gone wrong and maybe a sample code
snippets um and see if students can
figure out what's going on there and
we're thinking about maybe adding
keywords for those so saying if you're
using a map that's what you're is what
your error may have been caused by again
this is just an idea where actually saw
paper that shows that this sort of thing
did not work for one group that was
trying to apply it to Java that's not an
indication that is not going to work for
us but there is this is still working
progress and the rest of my slides are
pretty much work in progress as in this
is the stuff that we're just approaching
we haven't done it yet we don't want to
do it in the wrong way we're trying to
figure out how to do it right of that's
been taking longer than I thought so
again just as we don't want to rewrite
closure compiler we also don't want to
rewrite at least to a significant degree
any of the ID
years would you currently use line
engines as our project manager we do
need to use it because we need to dump
all of the overwritten functions and
some additional libraries into student
code so that's going to be there we want
to make sure that we can process errors
from Student Code run as a file repo
testing we use expectations great
library so all of that stuff and want to
use it consistently so our naive idea
two years ago was to just put try-catch
around student code well that doesn't
work in ripple that doesn't work in any
of these concepts so doesn't work with
lazy sequences either so we also would
like to integrate some of our stuff with
the IDE because as I said we can't use
command line or we can have students
with command line so currently we're
looking into using and ripple middle
where we sort of discovered this on our
own and then everybody started telling
us oh you need to use a map of
middleware wherever you guys before but
okay so now we know that that's what we
need to do it's nice to have it
confirmed by people who know what
they're talking about so we're working
on it we also need lining in plug in as
I said because we want to integrate
student code with our stuff so it has to
be a project so when they start to file
they actually are starting a new project
and then we want to integrate this with
IDE to do a little bit more of
highlighting possibly incorporate hints
currently we don't know what id will be
using and actually we would like to stay
reasonably ID independent so I don't
know what people will be using five
years down the road light table or night
code or both or neither so trying to be
flexible there is a goal again so that
our students can use these IDs
whatever ID is there are and may be used
something that they prefer not everybody
will be using the same one and that's
fine we do need to add project
management into IDE menus so that
students can start a new file which
means a new project and have all of the
stuff integrated in it save it in a
reasonable way all of that good stuff ok
so that was already sort of a to-do list
so the technical setup is all of that
stuff that i showed in the previous two
slides and until we do that we can't
really test it on real students because
right now we have a little pop up with
an error message and it's fine for us
but it's not going to be good for
students and we need to run code
separately depends on whether we're
catching runtime error or so compilation
errors so that's another issue so once
we have a system that's reasonably
usable at that point we can have
students play with it and then we can do
things such as fine tune the wording of
error messages I understand that many of
them are our guesses and sometimes I
know this is probably not the right
guess but I don't know what will work
and hence all of that stuff actually
would be very much interactive process
of we give it to people to try do
usability study record their feedback
talk to them to see what would have been
useful here see their pass how they
arrive at a solution and what would be
helpful for them and work from there and
then of course we need to eventually
hopefully and that was a textbook but
for now start with series of lecture
notes to help guide students through
this process because there are a lot of
things that we need to explain at that
level from what they already know and
guide them through that including the
difference between collections and
sequences and all of that good stuff so
nail a lot of things that require very
specific explanations when your students
okay there are many people who
participated in this project so Brian
gasps Linda was a ummm student graduated
in 2010 who first mentioned closer to us
and I actually taught an upper level
class using closure on parallel
processing and Brian technically wasn't
that class and practically was
co-teaching it with me so that was
really cool steven adams who is
currently working on his ph.d on not
entirely unrelated subject but not using
closure at university of kent and he was
a big push behind that project in the
beginning so he really thought this was
an excellent idea idn was very
encouraging and contributed a lot of
time at earliest stages of the project
and joe anderson also another student
who graduated and actually is currently
working at a start-up in twin cities
that uses closure so that's really cool
and he did the first implementation and
then we work from there and then a group
of students who are working with me on
this project in the last couple of years
have been working with me and many
thanks to my colleagues and friends for
many email exchanges on the subject and
both minnesota closure group and boston
closure meetup will really help for
providing ideas and all of that okay we
do have our code on github um I have
some of the related paper student papers
on my webpage
so you can find all of this and really I
kind of would like to have a discussion
here about what yeah yes I'm somewhat
familiar with his work here she overlap
pass was Morris long time ago and then I
was looking up his name because of his
work on visually disabled users because
somebody asked that question and came
across some of the new stuff that he has
done i I looked over it probably should
look more into it but yes the name was
familiar and I'm and okay sounds good
thank you
alright i have participated in closure
bridge in march this year minnesota
closure bridge it's a very active
organization I will be helping out
teaching one of the tracks in June and I
one of the things about what we do what
closure bridge does um I think it's
important again to focus on learning
goals and i'm not sure if they're
exactly the same and the background of
students again if most students have
absolutely no background or they have
background in different programming
languages and these two things are
totally different in Minnesota we don't
get a lot of students who have any
programming background although they do
that and there is a percentage of them
there that creates a very interesting
sort of difference in a classroom where
people have done a little bit of PHP and
they think they know it all and that
that moment when they ask me so how do
so I understand about define and all
that and they ask me so how did I change
your variable here and I say you don't
and they look at me there is that moment
of they just can't believe that I'm
saying that what do you mean you don't
and I say no in racket you don't it's a
functional language and that after i
talked about you know parallel
processing and why immutable data is
useful here and all of that stuff yeah
it's still it's an interesting moment in
the classroom it's a teaching moment yet
right well nothing prevents students
from actually continuing using our error
messages hopefully we can handle things
in a fairly general way at some point
probably java step trace becomes useful
we don't hide it actually you can still
see it so you can still see their
regional error messages and that may be
a nice transition point yeah so we we
filter it and we show them a
user-friendly one but you can also go
into the original one and see step trace
in its entirety and maybe that's a good
way of approaching it when they start
doing that because they need it and
that's helpful that will allow them to
transition to general tools I don't see
why it can't be a mode of say light
table or night code to use
beginner-friendly messages sure yeah and
again I'm not exactly sure to which
degree of beginner friendliness we want
to go racket has messages that for good
reasons are not very precise so again
for for real developers but they also
have they have a system of languages
beginner languages that's stratified so
you start off with for example system
with no higher order functions and then
you eventually get to the next level
where you can pass functions two
functions but it doesn't unfortunately
get to full-scale racket and that's a
pity because I I've been working with
students who really would like to start
bringing in all of the racket libraries
but
you can do it at the level of student
languages a semester yeah a semester
course the next programming course the
dick take would be data structures in
java languages on top of it easier to
make it it's an interesting point I find
I it's on record right I find racket a
little bit verbose so and I'm not sure
what's easier really but hash maps are
fantastic and racket does not support
them I understand it you could yes you
could yeah you could and that's not the
direction we're going in
there's one of the main reasons why we
haven't done more with things like that
inside closures performance impact to
that and if you're checking title Eri
every argument for every function call
it has a really significant impact
however we have this new feature
additionally put things into your code
and it would be entirely feasible this
point to have to change the build
process to actually build a version of
closure that had pre comedian and virgin
approach that did not have provisions in
it you can choose to use the one that
happen so this is something that I'm
really interested in I'm hoping that we
will be able to move forward with that
idea this year there might be like a
closure that have a class of ironic
that's like closure friend leaders
yes I think using reader conditionals
would be fantastic i saw that last night
and i was very excited about that yep
sure well and it's an interesting
question of whether there is such a
thing as beginners friendly specific
error messages or just making error
message is better for everybody else and
if that's the same thing or not and I
don't know right now I guess my goal is
to kind of get this thing given that
it's been already close to three years
to actually try it in a classroom with
sort of the minimum set a possible see
what will learn and maybe bring that
back to closure community but I kind of
i'm a little pragmatic right now because
i was hoping to teach it you know in the
fall after the year when i started
looking at at first I wasn't sabbatical
and I said I'll put a couple of months
into that yeah that was three years ago
um well I just think that incapable of
greeting stack trace I mean I'm also
concerned about the fact that you know
when we have 40 students in an
introductory class we hope the 25 of
them will take data structures in the
fall and if that's not happening my
colleagues and I'm going to be happy
neither were wise so you know yeah yeah
yeah and it would be great that sort of
higher levels but beginners are just
they don't have the capacity of doing
that
um I'm I think you're exaggerating a
little bit of how much time and every
student is willing to put in before they
you know give up and do something else
and that's my concern and it's sad note
on that is that we also would like to
increase diversity and sometimes
students feel that they're coming from
less exposed background anyway and
everybody else knows what they're doing
and everybody else just sort of says
that they know what they're doing but
that doesn't matter and I think beginner
friendliness helps students who already
feel a little out of place for various
reasons and I want to make sure that
we're not that were supporting these
students so okay I think we need to wrap
up but thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
