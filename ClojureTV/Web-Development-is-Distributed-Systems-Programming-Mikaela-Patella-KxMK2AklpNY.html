get started I'm gonna take a just a
second to talk about what diversity I
got my start in tech my first step' job
ever was at a Baltimore company called
stack and I had I went to a Ruby
apprentice program and that's my first
tech job and then a year ago the first
tech conference I ever went to was
cloture West on their Opportunity Grant
and now here another year later I'm on
stage so so if you have the chance at
your company to sponsor mentorship
apprenticeships scholarships please do
so they make a difference it's not
perfect but it helps so the title of
this talk is web development is
distributed systems programming so
distributed systems right they're hard
they're complex
they're like infinitely complex it's
like a pit of despair of complexity and
just nodes failing and yeah nasty stuff
not web development right web devs easy
to solve problem you got your monolith
you just configure it however you want
someone else has made all the decisions
for you it's done so web dev is just
right glue code right that's when I've
heard a lot web dev isn't real
programming we're done there's no more
work to be done in web development hi
I'm Michaela patella this is me you can
find me here I'm a senior software
engineer at yet analytics and we have
distributed systems we have tables we
have queues we have web apps now a huge
part of my job is web development but I
don't call myself a web developer
anymore it's how I got my start in the
industry
but anybody else here consider
themselves Webb does like I know it's
early but hands alright
it's a few fewer than I thought people
are hesitating but we've seen these
biases against web development firsthand
right they're encoded in our companies
you compare salaries for web developers
as people who call themselves software
engineers there's a massive difference
now this is one of those really deep
problems in tech that we're gonna figure
out one day so how many web devs are
there if you look at the salary samples
it's pretty significantly smaller than
people who call themselves software
engineers what about distributed systems
engineers there's 25 samples on this
site at least so it's this small
emerging field maybe a specialty so
considering there's nobody here to stop
us let's take on this role ourselves
let's take up the mantle of distributed
systems engineers let's use the
perspective of distributed systems on
our web applications and we're going to
look at the history of web apps we're
going to apply the same kind of rigor
and respect that you would expect
distributed systems engineer to apply to
a web system because web dev is changing
this fields about as old as I am and
it's getting more complex over time many
of these forces at play here that are
just pulling our systems apart we're
creating new systems in the middle to
deal with this with new complexities and
new powers so how do we deal with
complexity of software engineers well we
name things so part one web dev can not
not be distributed systems programming
so what's the system
Kyle Kingsbury in his Jepsen series
calls the system of anything you can
draw a box around and that box separates
the system these behaviors from their
environment and you can look at the
inputs and the outputs that come from
this environment and sort of
characterize what goes on inside the
system so from this perspective
everything's the system but for our
purposes we're looking at software so
what's a distributed system well when
you start to look it up a distributed
system is a network of computers to be
any number of computers arranged in any
number of ways they all have their own
processors memories they work
concurrently they have different clocks
usually and a distributed system is the
software that runs on that these
distributed networks and the arrangement
of these systems of these networks they
matter one node broadcasting to four is
very different from four nodes
broadcasting to one so what's a web
developer
well web devs make websites that much
has not changed
you got servers you got clients talking
back and forth so let's zoom in on just
one of these connections got browser on
one side and a server on the other they
talk with HTTP hypertext Transfer
Protocol sort of an abstraction around a
file system most of us are familiar with
it semantics are pretty useful
they send strings back and forth and
these strings are interpreted into the
browser browser has a layout engine puts
it together and you have a website
browser sends a request server responds
and two essential properties of web
development came out of the simple era
of sending strings over HTTP we have
routing we have templating
so with routing the server gets a
request and it can respond however it
wants it doesn't have to map to a file
the assumption is that the file exists
but you can just return whatever you
want in the template well the file
doesn't have to exist so if you take
pieces of HTML and can cap them together
you have the early version of web
development which was clever people
writing scripts on their servers to put
whatever content they wanted together
guided by this URL and speed users
really happy they wanted more they
wanted apps to know more about them they
wanted to do more on the web so the
server's responded in kind so in order
to keep track of all this user state all
this app stays that way if you just flip
the switch on the server you don't just
lose everything we had databases this is
when things get real real programming
right so teff in programming is terrible
lessons learned from a life wasted cause
web apps skins around databases and now
we are definitely in the era of web apps
we don't just make web sites anymore the
data comes from this back-end this
distributed system HTTP it's not just a
file system abstraction anymore it's
that messaging protocol so here's a
pretty typical setup the browser sends a
request goes the router you do whatever
magic you want on the back end and you
just send back the HTML magic can call
into whatever kind of system client just
sees the server
and the server's take many many shapes
say maybe a stream processor batch
processor some twisted nest of business
logic we have to get input from
somewhere so it comes from our data
vortex harvested from the souls of our
users anyway backends can get pretty
complex there there networks in and of
themselves you can drill down to meet
whatever your needs are the client sees
this consistent view from the web server
so the backend it's all the same to the
client the backend is definitely a
distributed system is that everything
what about me says the browser I've been
here the whole time even in the simplest
case when it's just a server sending a
string over HTTP the browser's doing
meaningful work there's a peer in this
distributed system and even before we
added these databases and these complex
backends it's always been a distributed
system and they're full citizens and
they should be respected as such and
thought of as such
so part to help I can't tell my back end
from my front end and what to do about
it
short answer is embrace it but every
typical distributed system right it's
changing or not we're moving away from
these monoliths now templating is going
into the client we have more powerful
JavaScript runtimes than ever and that
same server that it existed before well
it's not concocting these templates on
the server it's using HTML and
JavaScript together a sort of this
delivery system for web apps hTML is
this rocket and the JavaScript payloads
at the top there's CSS and there
somewhere for styling this is a really
powerful property that when the client
does this kind of work it works more
like the native applications we have on
our phones and our computers and they
can be treated consistently we have
these beautiful api's that send data
back and forth and aren't concerned
about the messy sort of client specific
details that's the dream at least but
the asset server still has to exist that
file system abstraction that the web is
based on for us to come from some server
and the separate from our data machinery
and a lot of our web applications and
this is sort of become the accepted
practice for larger businesses but that
sort of remote templating the HTTP
paradigm the roots of web development
still hold
it's kind of this quirk sort of emerged
and this is kind of caught on web
systems are powerful are native apps
every single framework you have has a
webview there's trade-offs but in
exchange for maybe performance you get
the power to upgrade at any time it's a
really good development property but you
take on complexity in exchange for this
power we have an asset server we have
this beautiful rainbow api and there's
interconnected web of servers and
exchanges and there's many to many
relationships on our servers so where's
the front-end now this is the client is
it the client server serving the assets
there's definitely a back-end right like
data machinery complex systems but the
API has a front-end to talk to the
clients talks to users who want to
implement it even our clients have
backends they have to do meaningful work
and they definitely still have front
ends but they have state now - so
front-end and back-end these terms that
we've taken with us from the origins of
web development they're contextual and
that they're relative in these intricate
graphs we have of our software we have
multiple backends multiple front ends
every connection between the servers has
this relationship and they're passing
messages back and forth and doing
meaningful work under this distributed
computing umbrella and these useful
domains that we have our outer software
these complexities that we have about
clients about specific servers databases
they're being compressed into these
terms front-end back-end that really
don't hold anymore
the relics of the old server paradigm
carry with them assumptions and
expectations about the work that we do
that really don't hold it anymore
they're fading further back so we have
the small self-contained system server
clients part of a much larger whole
so right three I have a simple example
for you
it's what a new relationship between a
client and the server not-so-new so we
have a simple app state we have an index
and we have a count it's wrapped in an
atom with all of the semantics of
closure atoms this app state exists on
servers on clients and they connect with
WebSockets and WebSocket is this
advancement on HTTP where people are
like we're not happy with one request
one response there's way too much
overhead and it takes the latency down
to something a lot closer to the bare
metal so let's take a look
we have a heartbeat here every second
the server sends the state of the world
to every client that's connected the
index the count the entire state of the
world every second the clients can send
events and the server responds in kind
it sends the state of the world in
response to the event and if a client
happens to miss that broadcast still has
the heartbeat to get synced back up you
could have as many clients as you want
as many web sockets max out your server
at another server so how can I approach
like this scale right send the state of
the world every second it's nice for a
little toy app but can it work with real
systems well you can do something about
taking the delta of the app state you
look at what's changed the client sends
up what it knows about the world and
then the server responds in kind so for
a new user it knows nothing the Delta is
everything so what systems have taken
this approach before it's the foundation
of networked games massive network gave
the player positions hundreds of them
hundreds of objects in the world all of
these intricate connections and infinite
shapes of these networks interacting we
see certain patterns emerge though that
we're familiar with
so here's our takeaways web apps are
always distributed it's in the
definition you can't get away from it
our web apps include the clients always
and web devs we already use distributed
systems thinking in our jobs so this is
more just career advice but if you're a
web dev just call yourself a software
engineer demand that kind of respect
from your company
it pays so our internet is changing
looks very similar it's built on the
technology as we know but it's moving
forward our work is not done if you have
the largest network of computers in
existence it is growing fast faster than
anybody can comprehend so how will you
shape it
thank you
so if anybody wants to talk about how
the app works or just talk about talk in
general I'll be in this room for a while
I'll probably be out in the hall too
I can finally enjoy the comp now so
thank you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
