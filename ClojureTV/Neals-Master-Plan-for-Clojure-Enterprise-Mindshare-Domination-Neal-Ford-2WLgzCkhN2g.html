started today I had the distinct
experience of drinking whiskey and
discussing politics and religion and
with Uncle Bob last night and if you've
followed him either of his either have
his internet personas you can have some
idea of what that's about
and in the course of in the course of
that conversation I divulged to him some
things that I'm going to say about Neil
right now and he said that he didn't
believe I think he didn't believe either
that they were true or that I was going
to say them but in fact they are true I
am going to say them and Neil is just a
really really very close friend he is a
real Mensch he has has been a huge
inspiration and support to me throughout
my career over the last several years
and he is one of only two people here in
the room that I've slept with and but I
really am looking forward to getting to
know a lot of you better as the
conference goes on there's so I also
want to say that that it's really cool
that the joy of closure guys are even
signing their book but I think you
really have to put pressure on sort of
what they're willing to do so I had them
sign my forehead and I think I think the
rest of you should all approach them and
ask to have different body parts signed
throughout the day they would they would
really appreciate that particularly if
you make it suggest that you didn't
actually bother to buy or read the book
that you're just you know sort of
pursuing Fame so I'm gonna get out of
Neil's weight this is Neil Ford meme
Wrangler at ThoughtWorks
and he's going to help us dominate the
world we'll see so welcome everyone this
is a Neil's master plan foreclosure
enterprise mindshare domination which is
what I was kind of asked to talk about
here because I'm
I don't get to spend a lot of time to
enclosure at my day job yet I'm working
hard on that with a bunch of my
colleagues that don't works to make that
more possible but the thing I do as part
of my day job an awful lot is talk to
enterprise-e developers and CTOs and
folks like that so I thought I might
have some perspective that you guys
might appreciate and so I've put
together some plans for ways to
penetrate the enterprise and I've
hashtagged all of them so that they're
easier to talk about later and dispute
me over drinks and that sort of stuff so
most of the talks here are about this
not surprisingly since we're in a a
closure conference but most of my talk
is going to be more about this those of
you who know some physics know that this
is mu which is the coefficient of
friction in physics and that's what my
talk is about more than lambda is about
mu which is about friction and
overcoming friction for things and I'm
going to do this for three topics how do
things become popular in the enterprise
world how do you make something popular
and how do you build a bridge to
popularity if you're not popular but you
really want to be so the first one else
I'll ask is how do things become popular
in enterprises because they don't work
like the rest of the world they don't
work like Hollywood or books or anything
like that there are two different ways
that things become popular in big
companies and enterprises they either
rain down from the top or they sprout up
organically from the bottom so let's
talk about both of those things because
if our goal is to get closure more
deeply penetrating the enterprise and we
can take either of these two approaches
and there are some strategies around
either of these two approaches as some
of you probably know I do a lot of other
conferences I speak at the no fluff just
stuff conferences or so ultimately met
you and that's where that shirt came
from was a stew camp which is kind of
loosely related in a no fluff just and
this is one of the talks that I'm doing
on the no fluff just stuff tour this
year and a bunch of other conferences
I'm speaking at this talk called build
your own technology radar and this talk
is based around this thing that thought
works creates called
the thought works technology radar which
is put
together by the thought works tab which
is a group of technologists from all the
offices in the world we get together
three or four times a year and come up
with this radar which is now published
as kind of a white paper II kind of
thing that looks like this I'm not gonna
spend a lot of time on this I just want
to give you a flavor for it it's
basically the technologies that we think
are hot and where they are and then each
page each subsequent page takes one of
the quadrants and goes into a little bit
of detail about why we think that's so
or if there's some controversial things
we try to explain what the controversy
is and then there's finally some
marketing stuff when we do this we have
these rings on our radar the outermost
ring is a ring called hold and those are
things that we're saying don't avoid it
but don't start anything new with this
technology and then as you creep inward
further you get assessed which is things
that you should be trying trial which is
we think this is going to be useful we
should do some real projects on it and
see what it's going to be like and then
finally adopt in the center ring so the
idea here is when you put together a
radar you think about the technologies
that you want to pursue and you put them
in one of these circles and then over
time hopefully the good ones will move
toward the center as you adopt them and
part of the exercise that I have people
go through for this is to build two
distinct radars one radar for developers
to help manage your own career which is
a good idea and another one for you this
CTO of your company so realize it - no
fluff just stuff conference series is
mostly people who work in the corporate
world and enterprises and they're mostly
Java developers in the corporate world
and so they have a pretty good
perspective I think on their CTOs the
kind of things that they're interested
in and as part of building this CTO
radar I have them put together some
litmus tests for how to choose new
technologies this is how you determine
if you're going to choose a new
technology or not how do you determine
the next big thing what are the litmus
tests that you apply to a technology to
decide do I want to spend more time
delving into and finding out what that
technology is about and the interesting
thing about this is that for the
developer radars it's all over the map
you get all kinds of interesting litmus
tests in fact when I do the talk I kind
of crowd
outsource and let people put together
all these litmus tests for things that
they choose new technologies but more
interesting than that is when they put
on the CTO hat the calls universally the
litmus test for the CTO those are the
same across the entire country I've done
this talk this year and it's universally
across the u.s. that there are a few key
litmus tests that CTOs apparently
everywhere apply on things and one of
the biggest ones is got to be able to
hire tons of inexpensive developers
that's what CTOs care about a lot I need
a whole lot of warm bodies to fill my HR
queue for people whether they're very
good or not is not even that much of a
concern its availability that seems to
be the big thing that's the big fear
this is a big fear a lot of you are in
the Ruby on Rails world and a lot of you
as we tried to get rails into
enterprises that was the number one fear
people had was if I adopt this
technology stack how am I ever gonna
hire people to write code in it of
course there's kind of a flawed
assumption here is that you need dozens
or hundreds of developers to do stuff
and we thought a really hard time
convincing people that you know if you
just hire eight or nine really good
developers you can build a lot of really
good stuff but that's a really hard
argument as well but really what this is
is I'm afraid because I don't want to
choose something that is might put my
job at risk and so I'll easily pick
something that is less effective but
more industry accepted rather than
something riskier where I might risk
really good success but also failure I
was in a meeting this is years and years
ago I a long long time ago and this will
come up a little bit later I was really
in the Delphi world and my first book is
a Delphi book and I back in the Delphi
world powerbuilder was also a big thing
and I literally was in a meeting at one
point with a CTO and he said we believe
that the only way this project will ever
be a success is if we pick Delphi but
we're picking powerbuilder
knowing that it's going to fail but
that's the safer choice politically
because if they pick Delphi they might
win but they might lose if they lose
they pick something weird then they get
fired but if they pick the
industry-standard thing and they still
lose
and they don't get fired they just got a
failed project and so they I was
literally sitting in a room with people
who said we're going to let this project
fail by picking the wrong technology
rather than taking a chance on it might
being successful so that's the kind of
mentality that you have to deal with a
lot of times in the enterprise world and
so that's actually my first suggestion
about how to get into the enterprise is
mollify you've got to make these guys
less afraid of you you've got to find a
way to tell them look it's not a brand
new platform it's just a new language on
top of an existing platform they're
afraid of changing languages and not
being refined developers so you're gonna
have to find all those fears and address
each one of those fears before you're
ever going to make them happy about this
or make them think that this is not too
risky a choice to risk success on a
project because that's the only place
you really need to get to is get them to
the point where they're willing to risk
success not all the way the point to
prevent failure and one way to mollify
them is to create new closures
everywhere you possibly can so this is
something the communicate community can
do so do things like sponsor sick pee
groups which I know you're already doing
some of this stuff but try to get this
far and wide as much as possible build
some assets to make it really easy to
work through sick feet I know there were
some people that were working through
getting getting all the sick people's
working closure that's a really great
idea post some tutorials and guides out
there in the world and get people
interested in that create something like
the poignant guide in Ruby something
that's really compelling and it's freely
available you really could use it why
the lucky stiff in the closure community
but we don't really have one of those
not one of those exactly but we need
something like that only a closure
flavored one if that makes sense
you should lurk around schools
not in the bad sense mind you but get
closure in two schools everywhere I mean
listens a great language is a first
computer language in my teeth did that
for years try to get some local high
schools interested miss or try to get
some high school user groups of people
one of the speaker's here seventeen it's
not that unlikely in fact he's already
lurking around schools so just get him
to go ahead and send your message around
do things like cone contest you know
that's that was really huge in the Ruby
world to get people used to Ruby with
all the Ruby cones and edge case put
together this really slick easily
downloadable thing where you can play
with those that something like that is a
really nice thing to have around they
have it okay so that's just something I
haven't seen so that's exactly the kind
of stuff you need I know they're
functional codes but is it as packaged
nicely as the Ruby ones I'm seeing that
okay good so CTOs don't fear lists they
don't even know what Lisp is they fear
different universally so don't try to
sell them on Lisp that's just a waste of
time you just using a word they don't
know you've got to sell them on there
some reason that this is different is
good for whatever you're whatever you're
trying to do and the other thing you can
do is make closure commonplace and I'll
talk more about that in one of my other
strategies here in just a second but
make it a building block for a whole
bunch of other stuff so that the closure
jar file becomes this viral thing that
ends up everywhere and people are using
it whether they realize it or not so
that's how things rain down from above
and become popular you get the CTO
interested in it and he rains down on
people and says you should use this the
other way that technology is penetrated
Enterprise is by sprouting up from the
bottom and so Steve told a little bit of
embarrassing history about me I'm going
to tell you a much more embarrassing
history about myself my first actual
professional development was in clipper
how many people here you could know what
clipper is I'm sure that a few of you do
but it's a pretty rare thing these days
good you used it when you're sixteen
there you go so you were lurking around
schools at sixteen trying to get him to
use clipper instead of closure clipper
was an X Bay
a little language you could actually
turn a clipper into the fully
object-oriented and we wrote some
redonkulous lis cool object or even for
building clipper applications but as we
were doing that and I was actually the
CTO of a little consulting training
company that was doing some clipper
development and it actually disappeared
overnight when Windows came along it was
shocking how fast he just went away and
so this is kind of my technology stack
after clipper I did debase for Windows
for a while which is a horror I did
Adelphi was actually really nice because
you get a lot of really cool stuff done
in delphi it was way ahead of its time
I didn't Borland C++ builder which is
also a horror you know there's a lot of
Borland stuff there I did a lot of Java
stuff and the J builder I've done Ruby
on Rails and a bunch of other stuff but
other people who came from the same kind
of background I did the clipper world
didn't take this same route through
technology they took a different route
they took from clipper and the supposed
logical upgrade step from clipper was
this thing called visual objects that
the company that made clipper was making
and it was supposed to be this really
nice you know it's one of those
marketing things that it does everything
including cure cancer kind of things and
it never came to fruition it was not
that great but a lot of those folks
moved when they moved to Windows to
Delphi because it was the quickest way
to get stuff done this is in the rad
rapid application development world and
Delphi was the best rad tool out there
for really cranking stuff out fast a lot
of those folks when they moved away from
windows and desktop development and
moved to web development a few of those
moved and then to Ruby on Rails there's
a group of developers now I'm going to
characterize here as what I refer to as
productivity pirates they don't care
about the underlying technology or the
beauty or the elegance of the underlying
technology they just care about getting
 done and they'll take any platform
that allows them to get stuff done with
as little friction as possible and
that's one of the things you can do to
get this kind of grassroots support is
build some tools that really supports
these productivity pirates hoist a
pirate flag for productivity for these
guys because these guys are very very
focused on being
able to get stuff done if you give them
some treasure chest you'll get really
really big fans because they'll start
using your stuff like crazy all over the
place so one of the things some of the
things you do to address these guys well
you can build a web framework but that's
kind of boring everybody's got web
frameworks now sorry Howard
but that's everybody's done one of those
but there are some other really
interesting problems that haven't really
been addressed and haven't really
touched this productivity pirate crowd
yet I don't think things like restful
integration this is a big deal in
enterprises right now switching from
soap to rest and getting everything to
talk to one another all the tools
universally suck in that space
I could imagine creating a really nice
piece of restful integration with some
dsls and some other stuff that would
make that way less painful that it is
now really nasty pervasive problems like
a war mapping I think we've probably
spent a trillion dollars on aura mapping
so far and we still haven't solved this
problem and so addressing that would be
a really cool thing another thing that I
see pop up all over the place I think
closure would be absolutely beautifully
suited for or things like rules engines
I see a lot of companies investing time
and effort and these rules engines with
this fantasy that they'll let their end
users create and massage these rules
which never works in my experience
because end users are not developers so
they end up creating is horrific sets of
trees of decision trees
you can't refactor these things and so
you end up with duplicated logic all
over the place there's a wide-open space
because a lot of companies want that but
all the existing tools out in the world
are terrible for this there's a
wide-open space there to move in there
and kind of take over that space or some
new category of tool we haven't even
thought about yet that obviously is the
coolest thing but a little bit harder to
come up with so if you are going to
sneak things in from the bottom there
are two ways to do that you can either
do breaking and entering or you can do
it via cat burglary breaking and
entering is exactly how Linux and rails
made it into the enterprise and by
breaking and entering I mean they force
the enterprise to accept them and do all
the work that it took to make that stuff
possible Linux got in because people in
the data center started running it as an
alternative to all the commercial
software and it took a foothold and then
it became popular rails is the same way
you had to convince people to move to
the lamp stack it's a really hard
discussion to have with enterprises
because that is you think put a CTO hat
on for a second
switching to a new deployment stack is
gigantically expensive because you got
to have machines and people and all the
support infrastructure and all that
stuff but Linux managed to do that
because it was compelling enough to be
able to break and enter and get enough
of momentum going so was Ruby on Rails
and this is of course part of that
hoisting the pirate flag is pushing
breaking one of these technologies into
an enterprise this is really hard to do
it's got to be super compelling and
everybody in the world has to believe
that that's pretty compelling because
the thing that you're trying to get over
is the fear that I might get fired for
choosing this technology stack you have
to get enough of a groundswell to say
okay this is not crazy risky it's only a
little bit risky and that's enough to
make them say well maybe we can try to
be successful that's the hardest way to
get something in it's got to be really
splashy there's got to be a really
clear-cut elevator case for that
technology to be able to break an inner
cat burgler is actually a lot easier and
probably the better approach for this
community a cat burglar is where you pee
back your technology in on top of some
other technologies based on yours Ruby
is making it into a lot of companies
right now that it could not make it in
before on the back of cucumber because
people want cucumber and oh it has to
have Ruby to be able to run in fact one
of my friends is also another speaker
Nate Judah he works for big giant
insurance company and the development
group have been trying for several years
to get Ruby as an approved language and
they couldn't CTO is like not with you
job that's it that's the approved
language but then they're another
completely different business analyst
group said we want cucumber they said oh
you guys want cucumber okay that's fine
and you need Ruby okay that's fine and
they checked off Ruby and now the
development group has Ruby because it
got
through the door via cucumber that's cat
burglary the same thing is happening
with groovy on top of Gradle Radel is
this build tool that's based on groovy
people are picking Gradle and they don't
realize that grooviest piggybacking in
on on its back companies that you ask
them are you doing Ruby development oh
absolutely not are using cucumber oh
yeah it's great so they don't realize
that they're doing it but they are this
is exactly how XML piggy back in on the
back of well pretty much everything so
this is my strategy there I refer to as
camouflage camouflage your tech and
build it into other tools and get it all
over the place kind of by accident you
get the closure drawer file in all these
places and people can start assuming oh
that's just infrastructure we can start
using that stuff try to make closure jar
file as commonplace as the antler jar
file have you seen how many places the
antler jar file shows up it's everywhere
that's exactly what you want to do with
closure is get that everywhere because
it's already on people's machines and
it's P backed in on something else then
it's not such a scary thing anymore
because we're already using it we just
didn't realize we were using it this is
also a great way to mollify CTOs
about scariness because if it's
camouflaged they don't really see it and
they've been using it for a long time
before they realize they've been using
this new frightening scary thing so
that's all about how things become
popular so how do you make something
popular for those of you who know me
this is going to be a shocking statement
but i need to say it one of the ways
that you make something popular the
community like closure just be like fox
news not in the misinformation kind of
part of fox news but in the stick-on
message part of Fox News and
propagandize now when your propaganda
you almost always have a negative
connotation for it but the denotation of
propaganda is not a bad thing it
basically says a form of communication
that's aimed at influencing attitude
it's not necessarily good or bad we
kind of put bad things on it but it's
not a propaganda is actually a good
thing if you're propagandizing something
it's really good
vaccinations in the early days there was
a big propaganda campaign by the US
government to get people to use
vaccinations because it was a health
benefit and that was a good propaganda
campaign and my point here is that
you're trying to get people to do
something that they're a little bit
frightened of stay on message create a
good unified message that the closure
community can project and stay on that
message really hard and I don't know
what that message is going to be the
communities gotta decide what that is
but as a community you should really
hammer on these things anytime somebody
brings up this topic this should be the
message you give them first you'll give
them a bunch of other nuanced messages
as well but you want to be able to hit
them with this message first because if
you can do that then that the knowledge
of whatever that is will spread through
the community and make people less
afraid of things so maybe it's something
like high performance maybe it's
something like Rich's talk on a simple
made easy which is a really really
compelling talk I thought it was really
good I saw that a strange loop this idea
that closures a vision for software not
just a language rich in his simple made
easy talk had this beautiful beautiful
metaphor that we should use a lot which
is the knitted castle that is the
awesomest metaphor ever for
object-oriented Castle versus a Lego
castle where when you're doing
object-oriented States you're needing a
castle and can you imagine refactoring
the knitted Castle it's such an awesome
metaphor so pimp the knitted castle
everywhere you can this is a a kit that
you can buy on Amazon in fact every one
of you should buy the knitted castle kit
and make a knitted castle at home just
so you can carry it around and say this
is what your software looks like so try
to stay on message
try to stay relentlessly positive I
think a good exemplar that this
community could look at to make good
head roads even against strong odds is
the JRuby community and particularly
Charlie Nutter who is despite coming
against really steep odds the very early
days because the Ruby community really
had a lot of disdain for JRuby I never
actually were cried and it's slow and
all this other stuff but he has stayed
we're literally positive and he has made
the community a better place over and
over and over again a lot of people in
the J Ruby community have managed to
stay positive and keep building cool
stuff and now they keep getting
mindshare and more and more people in
the Ruby community care less about what
the underlying tech is they care more
about the technical characteristics like
do I want native threads or not and
they've gotten away from the bias that
was there before a lot of that is he
stayed on message and he's been really
positive forever the last thing I'll
talk about is how do you build a bridge
to popularity if you're not popular yet
and I'll come to what I view is probably
the most significant technical advantage
this community has over all the other
communities that you're competing
against for mine share is that you guys
are bringing a gun to a knife fight
because you have Lisp and that is a
serious advantage over everybody else
you're going to be dealing with so pack
heat if you believe you have an
advantage I think that you do then prove
it every time somebody comes up and says
something about mine is simpler or more
elegant or whatever it is prove it
say oh no we can write that but it'll be
better than yours is because of the
characteristics that we have I firmly
believe that a good list developer can
run rings around a good developer in any
other language X and I think the
community should really show that that's
one of the ways that were going to
mollify people is to show that we can
really build effective stuff in this
community you should also know who your
enemies are and I think you've got a
pretty good idea but your enemies are
absolutely not agility and agile and
things like testing which you guys know
it's not things like Scala even though
you are competitors you're not enemies
your enemy is absolutely status quo that
the thing you've got to fight is status
quo don't in fight amongst functional
programming communities or agile
communities because that's not the
problem you need to solve first that is
a battle you can fight ten years from
now when the enterprise mindshare
domination talk is is it going to be
closure or Scala then you can start
fighting with those guys until that time
you need to stop fighting with them and
I believe that Scala has a head start in
fact I have a quote that is a counter
example of what I just showed you which
I believe Scala is going to be the next
big thing on the JVM because it
fetishizes complexly exactly the way
jolivet Java developers are used to
fetishize in poisoning them and this is
going to be a hard thing to beat because
it's going to be hard to make closure
look as complex as Scala but actually
you should not do this you should stop
saying things like this as a community
you can say it as individuals but as a
community because these guys are not
your enemies impurity is more an enemy
than Scala is at this point in time you
need to befriend these communities
you've got to be able to sell first
alternate language to Java that's hard
you're going to mostly not be successful
with this that's going to be your first
battle but if you can get past that
battle then you've got a sell functional
if you get past that battle then you've
got to pick dynamic and you can actually
flip-flop functional dynamic and once
you get to that then you can start
talking about specific technology things
like closure but getting to alternative
language to Java is a really really hard
thing to do and realize that in the
other communities that you are casual
competitors with but not enemies with
that a rising tide raises all ships so
if the Scala guys are really super
successful getting functional
programming into the mainstream then you
can piggyback on that success very
easily because you're a functional
language too but remember you're
bringing a gun to a knife fight and so
the other strategy you can use here is
to encapsulate the entire world they're
not going to build a bridge to you
you've got to build a bridge
to them other communities are not going
to make it easier first cut for closure
to work with their stuff but the closure
community can make it easier for their
stuff to work with you remember you're
bringing a gun to a knife fight
integrating your stuff with theirs it's
going to be way easier them integrating
their stuff with yours nice thing that
right I think I said the same thing
twice no no no integration toward
closure is going to be a lot harder than
integration from closure to something
else because you have a gun and a knife
fight you have a language that is
infinitely morphable and can wrap up
other things that are going to be hard
than the wrap your stuff up with
encapsulate all the cool stuff that's
out in the world I think it'd be awesome
if somebody created a rockin cool
closure library that sits on top of akka
which is the actor library from Scala if
you could create a better front end on
akka then Scala has then you've won
because you're using their underlying
bits but you've created a better
interface to interact with that
capability that's there even if you
already have that capability in the
closure world and even if your
capabilities better first you've got to
build a bridge to all those other
technologies and get them used to you
before you can start just placing those
other technologies so I would say
wrapper everything take any interesting
Java API in the world and create good
closure protocol versions have a really
clean nice API and wrapper all then the
message that stuff up and get people
start using your rapid version of stuff
just because you have a really clean API
that solves a bunch of the messiness
underneath so here are the parts of my
master plan that I've talked about one
piece at a time and I haven't actually
said anything that's surprising to
anyone here I don't think because
there's no silver bullets to make this
happen it's just not something that is
an easy problem solved but the point
that I wanted to make here is that if
you if this is an aspirational goal for
this community if the closure community
really wants to penetrate into the
enterprise you're going to have to as a
community do some work toward that
you're gonna have to have a little bit
of strategizing it doesn't have to be
really sophisticated you know
invade a country kind of strategizing
but you need to choose some messages
that you can stay on and hammer home
anytime you're talking to a CTO or some
decision maker about closure you want to
always hit them with the message that
your that your that you have established
look at the successful open source
projects that have penetrated
penetrating the enterprise things like
spring spring in the early days there's
a whole bunch of open source guys
putting together but very quickly once
they started getting penetration they
built a strategy around spring at spring
source and very just very decided least
assigned people to do particular kinds
of work that they didn't really want to
do
volunteers are easy in the open source
space but to solve real problems you
have to do messy things and so spring
hired people to solve these messy things
that needed to be done and they have now
penetrated very deeply in the enterprise
so it takes some work to do that but it
has to be an initiative that is run from
the grassroots I think because it's
going to be really hard for closure to
rein in from above until we get some
super super compelling either tools or
success stories or something like that
that makes it to overcome the friction
enough and the fear until then the best
strategy is definitely the grassroots
from the bottom up strategy and the best
way to do that is to encapsulate all
these other guys and to well do all the
stuff that's all I have does anybody
have questions or disputations about
this I should probably say before you
start disputing this that I was telling
a Mike Nygaard who I was with in Sweden
two days ago that I was doing this talk
and he said I would love to come right
after you and do the cynics rebuttal to
your talk I said well you have to do
that next year so cynical Reba Reba
tation is a welcome but that's all I
have yes
so his question is basically and you
should not believe this as I thought
works approach this is just a me
approach I just happen to have thoughts
on my business cards just to make sure
that this is not some grand strategies
we've come up with this is just all my
stuff but his question basically is
should we even bother the enterprise I
mean is that just a lost cause and
there's a certainly a good argument that
says you know we should ignore those
guys and I can certainly understand that
but there are pros and cons to that you
can always stay in the kind of small
middle sized market but it's really hard
to get huge penetration and get that
tipping point kind of level of language
where not only do you have a huge
community but you have other people
building tons of stuff to support all of
your other stuff so that's a good
question I think the community needs to
decide do we really care about doing
this much penetration the enterprise is
that some place we want to be or do we
rather be and you know smaller small to
minimize a small medium-sized company or
aggressive startups or something like
that I think it's a good question I
don't I don't have a firm answer that I
would really like to see it in the
enterprise because the overwhelming
characteristic of enterprise software is
ridiculous complexity and a lot of
really stupid tools that are doing Swiss
Army chainsaw all kind of tools that do
40 different things poorly at one time
so I would love to see simple elegant
standalone solutions in enterprise which
is why I care about it there but I don't
know if the community cares about it as
much as I do
Oh exactly that's so his point is that
this that's basically a grassroots if
small companies start using it and a lot
of small companies using companies that
start thinking and start noticing it
that's really my mollify hashtag of
mollifying because it's become so
pervasive and it's not scary anymore
it's like a Ruby on Rails did I mean you
can absolutely if you want to see the
classic case study of a brand new
radical technology penetrating into the
enterprise Ruby on Rails the classic
case because it was below everyone's
radar and then managed just by proving
itself over and over again that it was
worth investing time and effort into a
less radical version that spring but
spring has also been super successful
starting from open-source volunteer and
then look at spring source now it's it
is as big and complicated as Java ever
was now by itself which is also
something it always happens to a tech
community so can't make that go away
well I in fact he said so why not just
build an automated tool that translates
between these two languages please build
me that tool and I will take it to every
enterprise on earth I think you will
find that the hard problem because it's
been tried a bunch of times before so
but yeah that's I'm sorry I'm sorry I
couldn't hear you call me in a month
okay good I'll count on that so his
question was nobody got burned by poor
for performance by Ruby in the 70s so
how can we overcome that now yeah they
got burned by Ruby for poor performance
in the 90s the late 90s ruby has never
been a high-performing language but I
understand what you're saying yep so and
so the question really is the baggage
that Liz passed but see from an
enterprise standpoint it has no baggage
because they don't know what it is
nobody in the enterprise knows what lisp
is unless somebody's got a computer
science background and he remembers it
from a class he took in college I really
don't think it has much baggage to
enterprise it's a complete unknown in
most places in fact you could sew a
closure not even say it's a lisp and
most people would say it would not even
thinking about it until I saw the code
and then they're obviously gonna react
to it but that's at the developer level
not at the decision maker level so
actually I think the baggage is not a
bad thing for a closure in fact there
was a great or an interesting thing not
too long ago called the blog inter
called the curse of lisp that why Lisp
has never been a really big thing is
because it's so easy to build your own
stuff that nobody ever built standard
stuff you always just build everything
from scratch because it's so easy to
build stuff from scratch so you never
really had standard web frameworks and
all that other stuff but see I think
closure actually solves that problem for
the most case because look at arc the
Paul Graham knew verse
he talked about building Ark was easy it
was a month month yeah I'll build Ark
but building all the stinking libraries
is a several hundred main years worth of
stuff because you got to talk to
relational databases and soap and rest
and all that junk riding all that stuff
takes forever but closure doesn't have
to rewrite all that stuff cuz it's
already there in Java so I think that's
a huge selling point that actually a lot
of the baggage that list has it gets
discarded because you have that that
underlying strata of Java code that you
can call you can still build your own
stuff on top of it but there's now a
standard strata of stuff that you can
call so I think that actually solves
some of that curse of Lisp stuff and
actually I've never once as I brought
this up to anybody in an enterprise had
Lisp as the number one disagreement
about it the characteristic of Lisp it's
always the unknown that's that's more
yes
what every person
they really under battery people they
want she
that's richer makes an outstanding point
here is that one of my first premises
was about the CTO really want have low
value for people I want low value cogs
that they can fit into do development
and closures the opposite of that you
really need engaged people to do that I
think that's another thing that we've
got to convince CTO and other people of
that you don't need 200 developers you
need four or five developers or ten
maybe at the max and I think ruby is
helping that some because ruby teams
tend to be a lot smaller but they're
also more expensive right now which is
hurting us some but I think that they're
they're kind of blazing a trail toward
you can have get more done with a
smaller team so we really need to push
that idea that you know it's it's been
frustrating for me forever and for a lot
of people in this room that companies
that spend money on 50 developers could
take a fraction of that money and buy a
bunch of ten really good developers and
pay them like kings and still save money
and get more software out the back end
that's such a hard argument to make
because it's deeply unintuitive it's
really unintuitive that more people
can't dig a ditch dig a deeper ditch
faster but we're not digging ditches
where we're doing knowledge work so
that's one of the things we're gonna
have to overcome and fortunately ruby is
helping that some and we're pushing that
hard everywhere we go but you know it's
a it's a small candle in a hurricane
right now unfortunately yeah I got time
well
so it makes a good point that you don't
really need to displace all these
developers that are already there you
need to teach them because nobody wants
to wholesale replacement all their staff
fire the 200 people in hire 10 really
good people you got to build a bridge
toward them and that's part of kind of
subtext of this is create closures to
everywhere you need to have a really
strong outreach to create and that's
probably gonna have to be grassroots
because if you try to rain it down from
above then you've gotta sell them on the
idea of training classes and all this
other stuff whereas if you get people
learning it on their own and then
starting to evangelize it internally I
think that helps but I think that
writing good closure code just like
writing any really good dense code takes
a lot of thought and consideration and
that's not super valued at a lot of
enterprises now for stupid reasons but
that's something that's another bind
shift that's gotta happen but I think
that's mine's just got to happen for
software development in general so I
think that's another rising tide we can
kind of help that as we do this for a
bunch of other languages tronic we're
coming to the end of this can this
experiment that you can take really
languages are designed to keep people
out of trouble and put a lot of poor
developers working in those languages
and produce useful software I think that
idea is kind of lost its a lot of its
Sheen if it ever had any so I said that
was last one but I'll do one more so
that's exactly right so his point is
it's it's all nice and good to move in
the enterprise because we're all hippie
evangelists and want to make the world a
better place with closure but the
enterprise also has tons and tons of
money and tons and tons of money allow
you to build other things which is the
spring guys discovered most of their
delight there's a lot of money in the
enterprise so that may be another reason
you want to get there just if you use
that money to fund other things that are
more altruistic get into the enterprise
just so that you can get all that good
paper from them from the enterprise so
I'm guessing there are lots more
conversations we had about this I'll be
happy to have those during drinks and
other stuff tonight but my time is up
and I want to give room for someone to
say something actually really useful and
so I will leave the stage I thank you
