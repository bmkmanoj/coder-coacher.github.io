talking about a library I've been
writing called zelkova this is an 800
year old zelkova tree it's living in a
shrine in Japan the zelkova trees are in
the same family as elm trees zelkova the
library is basically a reimplementation
of parts of a language called elm into
closure and closure script Elm was made
by this guy Evan kabuki he he did his
senior thesis a few years ago on this
language that he made it targets the
browser and it's specifically for
building graphical user interfaces with
functional reactive programming Elm is
really fun Bodil Stoica at Strange Loop
last year described it as if Haskell
were designed by a usability expert so
it's pretty nice so there's lots of
different kinds of FRP out there
functional reactive programming if
you're curious about how Elms model of
it relates with other kinds then I
highly recommend Evans talk from
strangers of last year controlling time
and space he really goes into the
trade-offs in a good way but zelkova is
is based on Elms version of FRP and so
it's really all about signals what is a
signal in this case it's a value that
changes over time in the closure
community though we have this really
strong separation between values and
identity we rich has made this very
clear to us all and we we have this
notion that a value is just an inert
immutable snapshot in time and that an
identity has different states of
different values over time so what our
signals are they values or identities
well I like to think of signals as
values which represent ident
in in all the ways that are really
useful when you're working with signals
in Elmore zelkova they are immutable you
can pass them around and not worry about
anyone else messing with them and
screwing up your your code and but they
do represent sequence of values over
time and this is this is kind of what
makes them cool so I'm going to get into
a demo okay so I'm gonna show you a
little flyer game not not quite a game
at the beginning of one and here's the
beginning of it I'm using quill to do
the rendering quill has its own ways of
doing managing events coming in but
we're gonna use zelkova for that part
just whoops just to just to show how it
works okay so just to show you the code
that's already here I won't get into the
quill rendering code too much but
basically it's just drawing this
triangle on the screen and it it has
state that quill manages in an atom and
I have this namespace of some vector
math functions to use things like
converting into angles in radians or
messing with the magnitude so we're
gonna use that for some geometry but
most of the code I'm gonna put into this
namespace my signal name space and I've
already included some required some of
Zeljko BOS namespaces for this one we're
just going to be using the mouse and the
core signal namespace which are
typically aliases
xever zelkova okay so let's get started
just to show you putting something on
screen I'm just gonna get the
the ship to follow the mouse for now
just to just to be just to be quick
about things so here we're gonna make a
steering function eventually it's gonna
like steer the ship but right now is
just gonna the ship is just gonna follow
the mouse it's gonna take a state of the
shape that we have over here its flyer
with position angle velocity and mouse
position which is going to be a vector
of X and y and so we're just gonna so
since state fire okay so we're just
updating the flyer position with the
most position we're gonna write this app
signal function which is going to take
in an initial state and return a zelkova
signal for this game we are gonna want
to manage the state in zelkova and be
able to change the state based on like
update it in a using a reducer function
basically so I'll show you how this
works is zelkova we have this reductions
function if you used to Elm this is like
fold P except its arguments are reversed
so it plays nice with closure so right
now we're just gonna take in steering
wheel just steering the initial state
and most position and most position is
itself a signal and it's I don't need to
call it as a function to get the signal
it's it's just already a signal and the
namespace provides it and because it's
just an immutable value it's fine it can
be assured by different signal graphs
that might have a bunch of them going on
but for now we're just doing one and
basically what this is gonna do is gonna
take the initial state reduce basically
the the reductions
signal becomes a signal of successive
applications of this steering function
on the state with incoming those
positions so here to wire it into our
quill sketch I'm going to do take the
initial States call that app signal
function to get it Zeljko of a signal
from it and then I'm going to use this
pipe to Adam function which is is going
to take all the values from the signal
and just reset the atom that you give it
so here I'm using the state atom that
quill the quill has baked in okay so
let's see if this does something yeah
okay so here we have it following the
mouse so it's a start okay I'll go back
to this signal namespace and now I'm
gonna make it so that it's actually
gonna steer instead so the first thing
I'll do is get okay I'll get the fire
position because we do need that to
figure out the angles
I don't get like a difference vector so
I'll use my vector math namespace and
subtract the mouse position from the
flower position to get an offset and
I'll calculate the angle with my vector
2 radians function and then I will
change this associate to update the
angle instead and then I'll update the
angle like that
okay so already I can see that this is
too boring for Tuesday morning so I'm
going to get an image that I have for
the for the flyer just so that it's not
a boring triangle and then let's see
down here I'm gonna get that out of the
state of the flyer and then get rid of
the triangle oops
okay so there okay so here's here's our
flyer now it's a little bit better but
it's it's it's a little big and it's
it's not pointed in the right direction
really so I'm just going to let's see
I'm gonna rotate a little bit more good
and and I'm gonna scale it down a little
bit we don't want him that huge good
okay so okay now we want to move rich
around so we're gonna add a new function
that's gonna update the state similar to
steering but it's gonna be thrust this
time so it's gonna take a state and a
boolean value of just whether or not
we're going or not
so we're gonna do something we're gonna
do some calculations if the toggle is on
so we're gonna get the angle from the
flyer and then we're going to update the
state's update the position of the flyer
in the state and the way we're gonna do
that is we're gonna take the angle we're
gonna convert it into a vector like so
it'll just be like coordinates in
whatever direction you're in and then
we're gonna add that to the current
position so we're just gonna wherever
your mouse is pointing the thrust is
just gonna go in that direction by like
one unit so to wire this in we're gonna
do basically at this point we have mouse
position and we want to be able to
control thrust somehow so I'm gonna I'm
gonna bring in the keyboard I lied
before we actually do need another
namespace oops
okay so we have the keyboard now and we
need to bring those together so in
zelkova you can you can use the map
function of zelkova it's not the regular
map function and it has the same basic
function signature as as in closure core
so you can pass it multiple signals to
get values from in the same way that
enclosure cores map you can get you can
pass multiple collections to get values
from and in this case our mapping
function is going to be vector so we're
gonna take the keyboard space signal
which gives you a boolean of whether or
not the space bar is down and and the
most position and then map them into
vectors so anytime either one of those
signals UPS updates this map signal is
gonna update as a vector of the two
current ones the two the current space
being depressed and the current Mouse
position so we're gonna call that inputs
and then we're going to put it in here
and we need to change this reducing
function pasture reductions to B instead
of steering it needs to be something
that knows about these vectors so it's
going to take the state and a vector of
space bar and as position and then it's
going to thread this state through the
thrust function passing it the second
argument of the toggle and also thread
it through the
during function okay I think this should
work now
so here I forgot the else clause of the
if so it just got rid of the state
entirely anyway so I need to say don't
do anything to the state if we don't
have this base for are depressed okay so
so now you can move around but it's
there's something weird well okay the
problem is that every time I hit the
spacebar no matter how long I hold it
down it's just like one pixel so but if
I move the mouse then it does that so
what's going on here is that the the map
function in zelkova is it's updating
whenever either of the inputs are
updating and the spacebar input only
updates when it changes so but the most
position changes whenever the mouse
moves so he can go as long as the mouse
is moving or he can go like that but not
otherwise
so the way we're gonna fix that is we're
going to use a clock so yet another may
suppose I forgot about so we need time
Elmen zelkova are have it it's a pretty
good model for working with time it so
you can you can do there's a few
different things in this namespace but
the one we're gonna use here is FPS so
FPS is gonna take the number you give it
as a number of frames per second it's
gonna give you a signal that updates
that many times per second with the
delta in milliseconds from the last time
that updated so we're gonna use that
we're gonna just slaughter it in two at
the beginning of that vector
we're gonna let our reductions function
know about it and then that should be
good enough to at least let me hold this
base bar down okay
but we want to we want to be a little
bit more realistic with our game or at
least it needs some it needs some
physics it's not going to be the most
real physics in the world but it'll be
some kind of physics so we're gonna
instead of talking just about thrust as
some fake you know a constant thing
we're gonna instead talk about
acceleration so we're gonna rename it to
acceleration and we're going to have
let's see so instead of updating the
position we're gonna update the velocity
and right now that wouldn't do anything
but we're gonna add another little bit
of physics called inertia it's going to
take a state and a time Delta this time
so we're gonna calculate a translation
to figure out how like how we should
move the ship so we're gonna multiply
the velocity by the time Delta to figure
out how much time has passed so how much
we should move the ship
okay so now that we have inertia so and
and this is just yeah using vector
addition to to translate the current
position so now that we have
acceleration we're gonna or and inertia
two now we're going to put the inertia
in here threading it into our little
pipeline give it the time Delta and what
oh that's really quick okay when you do
do some tweaking here
okay so clearly we need to multiply some
more so here it is slightly more
manageable but okay so we've the this
time you know every frame we translate a
little bit less but the the acceleration
is still pretty wild so so I'm going to
put a limit on it you know limit the
magnitude of the vector that we end up
with for the the velocity so we're gonna
limit the velocity to one so we're gonna
just think in like one is the max and
you do okay okay so that's still that's
better but it still feels a bit weird so
the problem is that right now it's it's
limiting to one but but actually it's
starting at one two I think because we
start with a normalized vector so we
need to just take the the off the the
vector that we're adding to the velocity
the the thrust that we end up with we're
going to make it a magnitude of point
two always so
every frame that you're accelerating
it's only gonna increase the velocity by
a magnitude of 0.2 and then that's
that's a little bit better but it's
there's something weird going on here
you can see how every time I every time
I move my mouse and goes faster okay so
what's going on here is that we still
have this map signal updating every time
any of the inputs updates which means
that and the the value at any given
point in time includes you know the the
fresh value of one of these signals
which just updated but also the previous
values of the others and we thread
through all of these different things
inertia acceleration and steering every
time so what's happening is that we are
calculating inertia not just every clock
tick but every time the most moves as
well so what we need to do is take this
signal and use another function in
zelkova called sample on and we're gonna
sample it on the time delta the signal
so we have this signal of vectors with
all our inputs and instead of just
getting all of them were only gonna
sample the current value of that every
time the clock ticks so everything is
mediated by the ticker now and now no
matter no matter how fast I move my
mouse
he's he's still he's not gonna go any
faster yeah okay so so that's the end of
this demo okay okay so those that was
good fun so this is basically the the
graph of signals that we made so we can
see that this is like pretty much
everything good in the world
it's a directed acyclic graph and you
might be wondering now why not just use
core gazing so quarry sink is you know
we you can manage incoming events with
quarry sink you can merge channels
together there's a bunch of good
functions in quarry sink to help you
with all that well zelkova is using it
it's implemented in quarry sink so what
happens is when you use the pipe to atom
function for example it it spins up like
a live graph of basically core async
molt's that are so multi layer you emit
values to multiple other channels so
Zhukova currently the implementation is
that it uses it quarry sink melts behind
the scenes to wire everything up this
red splotchiness is basically just event
propagation things are things are moving
and in fact you can take the same
zelkova signal and produce multiple live
running graphs from it because the the
signals are just immutable values so
they're like recipes for for spinning up
live graphs here's another way of
getting at an actual live graph object
from zelkova you can use the spawn
function and then
live graphs conform to the quarry sink
mult interface or protocol so so you can
use the quarry sink tap function to tap
a live graph on to on to multiple
channels if you want okay so why not
just use quarry sink though I mean it's
built on curry sink but what why do we
need this so the reason why it's good is
that signals are values transformed by
pure functions they can be shared freely
with different parts of your code and
the signal graph is synchronous and
deterministic I don't get too much into
that aspect in this talk Evon does in
controlling time and space more but
basically you can I mean we use quarry
sink to get this synchronicity but if
you do it on your own with a graph that
has diamonds in it and everything then
it's not obvious necessarily how to do
it and it's zelkova basically does all
that work for you so we can push
mutation to the edges and get a
reasonable language for talking about
time this is something that I think is
one of the big strengths of Elm okay so
we've played around with with fun little
game but now it's time to get down to
business
okay so a lot of people look at Elm and
they see a lot of games in the demos and
they think that it's kind of toy
language sometimes building big
applications in Elm is definitely an
area of active research but evan has
been and others have been putting a lot
of time and effort into figuring out and
exploring this space there's a great
github repo that evan has on how to
structure larger
locations in elm and it's it's really
interesting what they're coming up with
but for the demo that I'm going to do
right now I'm just going to instead of
instead of doing like a big application
all with zelkova I'm gonna instead have
an ohm ohm component and show you how
you can use zelkova to to have a single
graph operating on an ohm component so
so you can just use like a little
sprinkle of zelkova when you want some
nice event coordination stuff okay
okay so I have a project here it's got
some code in it already
basically what we're gonna do is have a
little Wikipedia search field that we're
gonna show some autocomplete suggestions
underneath it's not gonna be very
full-featured it's just gonna show you
how we can get some benefit from zelkova
with ohm and other libraries like it
like reagent and quiescent okay so right
now this is just a this is just a
template there's nothing going on there
so that's the HTML for the template and
we have a couple functions and I'm going
to be using so here is how we can
convert a search query into a JSONP
request for Wikipedia
here's a utility function to take a
channel and merge its values into an ohm
cursor so here you can see we're using
the closure core merge function to do
that and here is just a convenience
function for turning a channel into a an
input Dom handler that will put the
current value of the input fields onto
the channel okay and
so there is oh yeah okay so there's one
other namespace that we have with some
JSONP stuff so so talk to a Wikipedia
we're going to be we're going to be
using okay I do have a back-up plan is
the Wi-Fi on yeah okay that's the
problem
okay
oh great so okay so I'm not going to get
into this code too much but basically
this function is a JSONP pipeline we're
calling it so it takes two channels
chorionic channels from channel and a to
channel so from is gonna be a channel of
requests which are gonna be maps that
have URL and params keys in them and
then two channels just some other
channel that you want to eventually get
responses on and so we use the Google
closure libraries to do some JSONP we
convert back and forth between closure
data structures and JavaScript and one
other important thing that we do is we
attach the original request as metadata
onto the response then here we have a
function called fetch responses and with
this one we're gonna take in a zelkova
signal of requests and return signal of
responses so we're using the splice
function here and the gist of that
basically is that we get to tap into the
signal graph on the level of Cori sync
channels and we end up with a signal
that is ends up being not synchronized
with the rest of the signals but instead
it's it's like an asynchronous signal so
it's as if it's another it's as if it's
another source of input events like most
position so it the responses could come
at any time okay
okay so let's get started so we want to
wire this up so that when we type stuff
in we're gonna get zelkova to do stuff
so the first thing I'll do is start with
some states on this own component so the
first thing we're gonna do is make a
zelkova right port so a right port is
kind of signal it this is a signal
constructor in zelkova but the signal
that you get back you can also treat it
like a core async channel this is kind
of a gray area with like you know is
this really a immutable value anymore
because you can push values onto it but
the important thing is that this signal
can be shared between multiple running
graphs so you could have multiple graphs
that share structure and you can be
putting values onto one of the right
ports and every graph gets it they don't
compete for the values okay so we're
gonna initialize this right port with
the text in the in the props so this is
like an ohm cursor that we get and it
has a text field that we're gonna
introduce the right port with and then
the state that we're gonna return here
as the initial state of the component is
it's gonna have an input handler that
the text field is going to use so we're
going to initialize we're gonna use that
function that I mentioned before channel
input handler we're gonna pass it the
right port which can act as a channel
and we get back
handler that the input can use and then
the other thing is we're gonna just have
a key called signal which is gonna be
like the main signal of the component
and that signal is going to be we're
gonna say we're going to take in the
okay we're gonna take in the text that
we get from the text input and return a
map of texts to text okay
it'll still become a little bit clearer
in a second we're gonna implement the
will mount protocol of ohm so that so
this is where we're gonna wire up where
are things up so so far we just have
inert signals but we're gonna now take
these signals and hook them into the
component so we're gonna get the the
signal from the state we're gonna call a
another zelkova function this is like
another convenience function like pipe
to Adam but in this case it just gives
you a channel and increasing channel
back so we're gonna turn the signal into
a channel that we can get values from
that way and then we're going to merge
channel values into the cursor okay not
quite done this iteration yet so the
other things we need to do a couple
other things so one is we need to get
the text from the cursor and bind that
to the input fields value and then we
want to attach this text input handler
to
to the input and just to show that
things are actually doing something
instead of this text here we'll use text
from the cursor okay
so it's doing something so so that's how
we can wire up the the the states and
because I only have a couple minutes
left I'm going to just jump to the end
and show you how how this works so okay
so basically the this is the final
results but basically the we have we end
up using the debounce function that
zelkova provides to debounce the input
we fetch responses we drop the stale
ones by checking the metadata of the
response against the last request that
was sent out and the end results is that
we can actually search Wikipedia okay I
also have a reagent version of this
which I don't have time to show but I
will have it online so you can see that
- all right so zelkova is on github it's
on closures I just pushed 0 for 0 last
night it's got the functions that I was
using today there's a to do MVC demo
there's a Mario demo which is part of
the Elm version and there's this
drag-and-drop demo that shows you
dragging it up and shows you the as a
output of the state there
of the final signal and also I wanted to
give a shout out to Dan literal Porter
who is also giving a talk at closure
West and he actually has the as far as I
know the first production deploy of
zelkova and it's this magic card deck
building thing and it uses it for the
Dragon drop okay so things to do for
zelkova I want to make it so that the
states of the signal graph the running
graph is exposed this will make it
better for using it with food will and
and just better in other ways I have
been thinking of ways of compiling a
signal to a transducer of events to
output values that's gonna also play in
with how I externalise the states Elm
has a fantastic time-traveling debugger
which it's once I get the state
externalized and other stuff then
implementing something like that is
gonna be easier and also to go further
with signals as data so that we can you
know manipulate the whole graph and do
graph transformations on it and other
ideas special thanks to Richie key David
Nolan Alex Miller everyone else who put
so much time and effort into closure
Evans Palicki for elm and very special
thanks to my wife Julia Shea who has
been incredibly supportive and
encouraging through all of us thanks
