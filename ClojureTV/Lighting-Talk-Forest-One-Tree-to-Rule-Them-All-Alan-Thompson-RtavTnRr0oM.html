talk about a new library called forest
to help you deal with tree like data
structures so a tree as we know and
you've seen this in many different
libraries and tools is a directed
acyclic graph enclosure we like to use
generic maps for all of our entities and
that's what we see here a collection of
five maps in a tree-like data structure
and in this case they could be the
source could be anything it could be an
HTML page it could be an XML data set
that you read from disk really just
about anything and in this case they all
have a tag attribute and a color
attribute the thing that forest does is
it provides what I've been calling a
hexadecimal ID and this serves simply as
a unique pointer to each of the maps so
you have a handle that you can easily
refer to each of the entities by and
this facilitates either searching for
the entities updating the entities
deleting them adding new ones all of
your basic crud operations and in
particular the way it stores these is
that you have the on the left hand half
there you can see arbitrary keys and
values in each of the entity maps and on
the far left in red hid 11 12 and 13
those are the pointers so that first map
is has a pointer hid number 11 as a just
a generic tag and then the way you
specify children of each node in the
tree is now with the kid HIDs that's
what KH ID is for and it's just a simple
closure vector of 0 or more child h IDs
and this very simple data structure is
how you specify the tree and that is in
fact its internal storage exactly what
you're seeing here the leaf node as it
says there is just the null case where
you have a node with no children there's
nothing special about it
other than 0 length K H IDs vector for
getting your data in and out we have a
number of different formats here besides
the well-known hiccup and in live
formats we have a tree format which is
just a slight enhancement to in live and
then the examples you'll see next use
what I call the bush format
it's just a tree compressed it down a
little bit it's kind of about halfway
between hiccup and in live so it's a
little denser but still has all the
information there and you can either
consume or produce any of these
different formats on Io so suppose we
have some data as I said perhaps you
read in an HTML web page you want to
search for a given element the first
thing you want to do is specify where to
start that search so frequently this
will be the root of your tree but if you
find an element and you retrieve it's
hid that can form the root of a
secondary search which will then be
isolated to that subtree so that's a
very powerful feature when you're doing
this search you can specify arbitrary
keys and values
so you could say color red is one of my
things I want to search for and then
that will implicitly ignore anything
that is not color red if you leave off a
key in a value in your search
specification that's a wild-card very
similar to the way des Tomic does it and
the third and fourth bullet points here
are some of my favorites in that you can
specify wildcards so when you're
searching for something you can say okay
I know it starts at the root and I know
it's at the third level so I just can
put in a star star to skip two levels
and then say color red or tag you know
some HTML tag whatever you want but in
particular that fourth bullet point
shows if you've ever used the Z shell
which is one of my favorites it adds
something the the bash does not have
which is the star star keyword when
you're doing a directory search and that
will skip zero or more directories in in
the Z show but in our case it skips a
zero or more nodes in the search path
and so if you pull something in and you
say okay I know this guy has a color
attribute that is red but I don't know
exactly how many levels down from the
root it is this is where the star star
keyword wildcard is just fabulous the
result of the search is simply a vector
of paths where each path is a list of H
IDs so it's two-dimensional but each
path can be a different length so it's
kind of a ragged two dimensional object
there but you just pull them out one at
a time and then he
path is a simple closure vector so
modifying the tree it's very similar to
the ideas of Assoc and update enclosure
although it's done in the context that
is similar to a database transaction
like either do sink or the sequel
equivalent in JDBC and you can see an
example here the with forest keyword is
the key you pass into it the input
forest which is an immutable database
value exactly analogous to des Tomic the
output forest is also an immutable
forest value I should say and then
underneath that where you see the
forum's dot dot you can put one or more
closure forms now these act more
imperative lis almost like the each line
in a closure let statement so it can
either be an assignment or it can be a
search it can be an update anything like
that but those all see the in
transaction value of the forest that is
they're affected by the previous lines
of the with forest form alright and the
last point there the hid value doesn't
change so this is a bit like having a
closure atom all right you do a swap on
the atom and now the atom points to a
different value than it did before
that's the same idea here so inserting
some hiccup data you can see we have a
tree of hiccough data on the right you
have an A with three B's and 2 C's
excuse me 3 C's now we're going to add
that in with the add tree hiccup command
we get out a root hid which is one of
these hexadecimal keyword thingies and
in the middle there we start a search
with find paths and we give it the root
of our search that is the root of the
tree and we specify a path of length one
that starts with the keyword a so this
is a tag a how many things in our forest
have that exactly 1 and we have a helper
function for mat paths and this is
actually one of the unit tests so this
is live code if you clone it you can run
this change it and making little changes
and seeing the result is how you becomes
instantly obvious what's going on so
that's what the tree looks like you can
see it is hookup data the colon egg is
translated to an attribute tag
etc etc searching the tree all right we
had a intro to that on the previous
slide but now if you look at the find
paths function call again we're giving
it the root of the tree as a starting
point we're saying we want all paths
that have an A at the beginning and a B
at the end there's three of those and
you can see we did find all of those the
third one of course being a subtree that
has both of the c4 and the c5 values and
in the comment at the very end there you
can see actual hid examples so they are
20 byte hexadecimal values and that's
how the search results are returned a
list of Lists now since I'm already at 7
minutes here and I was supposed to end
at 6 I'm going to skip to the end you
can see all of these guys the file
forest examples down there on github if
you look at that they're all online as
well as probably fifty or hundred other
examples this last one here I wanted to
mention real quickly modifying the tree
you can see we do a find paths and here
we use the star star wildcard
so we're saying at any depth of the tree
find me something with the tag of being
a value of 1 now in this short example
there's only one of those it happens to
be the first one but we pull out here
the hid value that is the hexadecimal ID
pointer for that a b1 guy and now you
can see in the value update command we
pass in a pointer to that node and we
pass in the ink function very analogous
to the closure update for maps or update
in and the next line you can see we
verify the value has been incremented
from 1 to 2 and in particular that
update is pervasive in the rest of the
tree so in that last line I start at the
root of the tree I say turn it into a
bush and print it out and there you see
it's two entries with tag B value 2 all
right so that's a quick summary there's
some information there this is all on
github the forest examples file in
particular is where you can find all of
these examples and you can also email me
if you would like thank you very much
