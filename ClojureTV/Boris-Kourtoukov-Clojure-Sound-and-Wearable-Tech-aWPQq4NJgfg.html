my practice deals primarily with
wearable technology usually I approach
it from the research angle so less
gadgets and my main interests lie in
exploring worn light and lighting
sensing our immediate surroundings and
expanding our means of expression on the
screen right now you can see a couple of
the projects that I finished within the
last two years the two on the right are
projects that I've done with the social
body lab and the projects that I'm
talking about right now is called key
Pocomoke the primary goal of keep Okami
oak is to create a co-located network
between bonus IRS Argentina and Cusco
Peru facilitating a group of movement
artists to perform together in a shared
environment this is not a literal
translation of the body through space
rather it relies in approximation
symbolic representations and the lens of
a 16th century text compiling
pre-columbian Andean religious rites
what does khipu come I mean Icky Poo to
put it simply is a data storage device
and to put it very simply this is a
keeper and I would say that it is an
early example of wearable technology and
it consists of a single cord with
attached strands each trans contains
carefully placed knots and it is capable
of representing time numbers and events
from recording transactions debt to
specific or important historical moments
in either usually in the context of a
small social structure most importantly
for me I guess is that it is worn in the
body
and I keep a comma elk is an individual
that can understand this code and encode
it and proceed to decode it to pass it
on and continue the tradition so the
scope of the project is quite you you
are not supposed to read that it's it's
very ambitious it will happen the actual
event will happen in November of 2016
the exact date is still being set it
will take place in both boo and Osiris
and Cusco and it encompasses 15 one-hour
performances over one week this will
include things like projection mapping
dynamic audio generation live
performance both acoustical instruments
and as well as movement artists and it
will even include gameplay elements to
some extent again tying things back into
the 16th century text the wearables
component is what I'm working on as well
as a part of the dynamic audio
generation I'll warn you that not and a
musician and I actually know very little
about audio before I started this
project and this is why I've carefully
named the talk or at least a part of it
as sound and not necessarily music so
I'm going to do I think a quick demo and
provided that everything works let me
try it out so you hear some things so
the primary device in this in my
wearable experimentation has been a
little thing called a light blue beam
and the point of it is it is a very
small Arduino device but it's directly
at
to a Bluetooth low-energy chip and so
it's it's very simple to interface with
it and so on and you can use multiples
very easily which is very important in
this project as there will be about four
per person and there's our about ten
people so it needs to be scalable and so
so this could be is this the fire can
you find out well first of all let me
show my awesome debug system here and
this helps me figure out whether they
have disconnected or not so something
you hear is so this is a threshold based
interaction let me increase the audio in
this a little bit
an idea is that for this particular
device it has a kind of instrument
within it and the idea is that this
instrument is triggered by motion
directly there are others here in these
easy when silent one of these represents
wind and another fire this is the wind
and some rain
and this is the fire provided that
everything is working so you can still
hear the rain anyway so this is the
current status status of the project the
wearables still have a long way to go
and and I will continue hopefully onward
so this is a osto and we have already
done some workshops in Buenos Aires and
Peru in Cusco and he's actually holding
one of these beans right now and to kind
of show the range of placement
possibilities and so on this is another
bean on
Lorena's foot and she quite enjoyed
putting it here we've experimented where
one might go and what kind of movement
individual artists may preform and a
whole part of the process had actually
been cataloging various movements that
they do do kind of letting them express
themselves any way they want and then
making a small subset of a language
based on various movements continuing so
this is kind of my part of the project
I'm not going to go into code just
partially because I've very limited time
but the whole point is that I'm using
overtone to actually generate the sound
which is perhaps unsurprising and as
well as Gloria script and you may wonder
why I would want closure script well I'm
an I'm an artist I'm not necessarily a
programmer and so something that really
helps me with closure is actually having
the ability to interact with multiple
different languages and clora script has
helped me
immensely with interacting with nodejs I
can use very similar concepts that I use
in my for example overtone code and
other code open sound control code in
that area but I can also tap on to
libraries that I don't directly have
access in even on a JVM for example
Bluetooth Low Energy is fairly recent
and although there are options for it
they're quite beyond my scope at the
moment and so Bluetooth Low Energy
actually got picked up a lot by the IOT
community and a lot of it from Intel to
others are kind of using node as this
maker experimentation platform and so I
end up having the benefit of access to
this which has been really wonderful and
so you see that like the device server
which connects to all of the ble devices
is written entirely in JavaScript or the
script it transmitted ro raw data over
open sound control and then a subset of
the code that just generates triggered
commands and the reason for this is the
commands are would actually activate the
sound and they need to be transferred
over to between the locations and but
they all don't just make the sound they
will also create the aforementioned
projection mapping and various other
interactions so from then on it
generates audio but it can also go to
all of these other areas depending as
well as go across the Andes into the
other city
it's nothing sophisticated but so part
of the reason why I began learning
enclosure a year and a half ago is after
watching some of the talks from
conferences like this one I realized
that it is going to be a lot more
helpful for me to learn this language as
opposed to something like Java directly
and so I wanted to list some of the
things that really impacted me
I've worked with it and the best part as
I mentioned has been sharing the
concepts one of the best libraries that
has really simplified my workflow and
I'm using it very simply but its core
async and all I'm doing with it is basic
channel subscriptions and the thing
about that is that I'm not I'm not
really using the full power out of it
I'm not really optimizing it 100% but
what allows it to me to do as a as a I
guess programmer is to structure my code
in a way that I can kind of keep it all
in my head I can be very linear as
linear as I want with it and I can
separate a lot of my program out into
different parts that then reliably talk
to each other and so just learning a
little bit about it and kind of diving
into a lot of the wonderful tutorials in
fact the tutorial that helped me the
most was Bruce and I'm sorry I'm gonna
mess up the last name but helman a UI
tutorial about how to this was I think
from the summer of 2013 even about how
to structure a user interface
interactions and so I took that idea and
I went all the way to something like
these wearable devices where they
generate a lot of data and then I
generate a lot of events from that and
so transferring that from one stage to
the next has been really helpful the
other amazing thing is diverse interests
in the community and this has really
helped because the sound is not
something that is hugely done on the
node side like there are options there
are things but there's nothing in the
same realm as overtone for example and
the biggest benefit with overtone for me
is the fact that it was created with a
very specific mindset and in mind
primarily that of live coding and and
live coding is a way of creating
and I wanted to kind of have that as a
possibility within the project even but
also it deals not with not directly with
various nodes and cords and so on that I
have very limited understanding with but
it can kind of create synths and I can
pull in sound files and I can mix them
and really play with it without having a
very extreme understanding of music and
eventually I hope to have that
understanding but at this point where
while on prototyping it has been
immensely useful and again this is this
comes to the rapid prototyping
possibilities the repple and so on I it
that has been a very important part to
me as well just being able to even
closer script ripples have become so
robust in the last few months being able
to prototype on node deal with my data
transform the data structures from these
devices and then massage it to make it
useful to me and last thing I want to
talk about is kind of back to the
project and that is future work and so
we have another set of workshops in
October and the workshops that I'm sorry
the two kits that I showed are available
as video if you if anyone is interested
and the goal for these workshops is to
actually have these be wearable and so
part of my project right now is actually
exploring sensor possibilities and
direction that I'm taking is sensors
that are actually more communal as and
it's not just sensing the body's
movement but it's also allowing other
dancers and performers to interact with
each other for example touching certain
parts of the body will trigger certain
events and so forth and these will
eventually be integrated into various
costuming options and etc and
provided I think that is all that I have
for this yeah and I have a minute or two
for questions and I was wondering anyone
has any noble it is a nodejs library for
Bluetooth Low Energy specifically no BOE
I think was the sentiment behind its
name no so the way ble works is that
there are options with firmata but
they're actually observable which is the
difference between Bluetooth which where
you open a direct pipe and things just
go through the reason why these are
low-energy is that you can kind of just
look at them and then being very
simplistic but you can kinda just look
at them and that is what and you can see
various parameters with your store so
really all I'm doing on these devices is
I'm storing scratch characteristics
storing data in scratch characteristics
based on the sensor output and then I'm
observing that with clojurescript
and in that way I can control the rate
of the rate of the data on my and here
instead of constantly going back to the
smaller device yes
we have not tested that yet one of the
things that I kind of wanted to mention
is the the nice thing about this project
is you're dealing in human time like
very human time so audio which is fast
to create a pretty mean speed to
creative processes but actuals
sensing it and so on is we have a lot of
wiggle room with latency especially like
from these devices one of the feet one
of the primary feedback elements we got
was that people preferred to have a
reaction after they've completed the
gesture so there's some kind of moment
of pause which is not directly related
to latency but we got to that point
because of some latency issues I think
I'm out of time Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
