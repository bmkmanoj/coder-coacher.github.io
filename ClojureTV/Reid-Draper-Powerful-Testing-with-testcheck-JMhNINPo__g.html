excited to be here I think I've been
talking enough I'm close to losing my
voice already I said we'll see how this
goes
I'm gonna be talking today about a test
check which is a new closure contribute
esting so as I said today I'm gonna be
talking about testing but before I talk
about testing I went a little I want to
take a little bit of a tangent into
performance and I want you to think for
a moment when you have a function or a
program whose performance
characteristics you're not happy with
what sort of thought process do you go
through would you do to improve the
performance of a function or a program
so let's say that this is the complexity
of our function and we want to improve
it we can start playing with constant
factors we can do micro optimizations on
the function but what we really want to
do in order to get the most performance
impact is to think differently about the
problem and change our algorithm you
know oftentimes when you're learning to
program you hear the best performance
games you get are a change in algorithm
and I'm gonna claim that with most unit
testing and traditional example based
testing libraries we're kind of in this
area right here you know we all have our
favorite unit testing library but
they're all basic variations on the
theme and in order to get here we need
to think about testing in a completely
different way and I think that test
check is a different way of thinking
about testing so as I said tests check
is a closer contribu
it is open source you can get it on
github here it moved to contribute have
previously known it as simple check
which was just on my personal github and
before I dig too much into the details
of the library I want to give a
motivating example for the types of bugs
that we can find with this style of
testing that might not have been exposed
before so we're gonna explore a bug that
was found in closure that Tolman
actually
I found this bug so here's a simple
expression we're gonna create a set
we're gonna cange
and disjoin some things onto it and in
between we're going to create a
transient and then turn it back into
persistent and you might imagine that
this should be equivalent to not turning
it into a transient a transient is just
an optimization right so these two
expressions should be identical and it
turns out we have unit tests for this
how many of you have ever used
transients for sets or maps in closure
so we have a roomful of people who have
used this code before but there's a bug
here these two expressions are not
equivalent so I'm gonna show you how we
would test for this and find the test
with test check so with test check we
think about testing in a different way
we write what are called property based
tests so you don't have to understand
all of this but basically what we're
saying here is that for all actions that
we might apply to this set can join this
disjoin this turn it into a transient
turn it back into a persistent we're
gonna randomly generate these actions so
that's gonna be bound to a in here we're
gonna apply the actions which is
basically just a fold we're gonna look
at the action and apply cons and then
we're gonna test for equivalence to
filter actions which just removes the
calls to transient and persistent and
changes cons bang to cons etc so this
these should be equivalent to each other
right and we can run the tests so we've
now defined this property in this case
we're gonna run it a hundred thousand
times it turns out this is a pretty
insidious bug so it takes a while to
find it we're gonna pass in our property
and then we're gonna get back a result
in this case the test has failed the
result is false here and it took 2,800
random tests to find this this is not a
trivial bug that you're likely to run
into and here's the failing case but
it's actually pretty simple we have a
roomful of people who have never found
this we have unit tests for it but
taking
a different way of thinking about
programs is able to find some of these
nasty bugs
if you're curious I'm I don't have time
to explain the full bug but it turns out
that 109 and negative 110 have the same
hash code which exposes the bug so this
is clj 1285 like I said Zach fell in
this this is still broken in closure 151
and is fixed in one sex and I've created
a little example repository if you kind
of want to play around with just this
bug I wrote some traditional unit tests
I like 15 unit tests or so and I wrote a
simple property based test that shows
this so if you want you can clone this
and you know just type line test and see
the bug on your own machine so test
check has been used to find bugs in
closure closure script and it's used by
a few other libraries that you may have
run into pedestal core matrix collection
check is the library that Zack made that
found this bug initially he was trying
to test his own data structure
implementations to make sure that they
were equivalent to closures and in the
process decided well I might as well
test the closure data structures too and
stumbled across this fun error so test
check is based on a library or a suite
of libraries called quick check John
Hughes who's actually in the audience is
one of the original authors of the
Haskell one and around 2000 there's also
an Erlang one which John is also an
implementer of that started in around
2006 a scala one there's a bunch of
other less popular ones but these are
probably the three most popular
implementations and in my time at in my
day job at Bosch show I use Erlang and
we use the Erlang quick check and I do a
bit of Haskell as well so I've been
using these libraries for a few years
and as I would dabble in closure I found
myself really missing this style of
testing and about a year ago started
slowly working on it and it's you know
kind of finally in a stage that I think
it's useful to other people and it's
finding some pretty nasty bug
so quick check is based on this
different style of testing which we call
property based testing you may hear
similar terms like generative testing
and random testing but the core concept
here is that were we're putting constant
effort in to get as many individual test
cases as we want so we can write that
test as we did before and then I just
put in a hundred thousand that's how
many tests I want I can change that to a
million and I'm still putting in
constant effort to get these more test
cases whereas with traditional example
based tests for every single test I want
I have to write a new test by hand and I
think this is this as you start to use
it really changes the way that you think
about testing so we'll dive into some
more detail here this is a similar
property to the one we saw before in
this case we're going to test that count
and concat work together the way that
you might expect so if we can cat two
vectors together a and B the count of
that resulting vector should be the same
as the sum of the two original vectors
right if we if we concatenate two five
element vectors together the sum should
be or the count of the resulting vector
should be ten five plus five so we start
with this Universal quantification which
says for all valid input to this
function this property should be true
next we create bindings to something
called generators so in this case we're
creating two vectors a and B this is
sort of like a let clause we're gonna
bind a to a vector of any value so gen
any means generate any valid closure
data structure same with B and then
inside the property for each test run a
and B are going to be bound to randomly
generated values of that vector and then
we just return a boolean so we're just
returning true or false
is it true so we can run this again
we've we've bound that property to P
let's say we run it a hundred times and
we get a map back a data structure that
represents the result of this test and
unsurprisingly this test is true we ran
100 tests and we actually get the random
number seed
back so if you want to rerun the same
test with a numbers random number see
these tests actually are deterministic
and inserting the right tests this way
one of the the first problems that you
run into is since it's a completely
different style of testing you have to
change the way you think about the way
you change the way that you think about
writing tests and this means thinking
and properties as we're going through
these we're looking at our functions and
saying okay what sort of assumptions can
we make about what our function does and
this takes experience and I think is one
of the more difficult parts of property
based testing but I'm gonna go through
some common themes that I found the
first one is a roundtrip property so
let's test a hundred thousand cases for
Eden serialization and deserialization
and just a few lines of code so we can
say for any printable value a should be
equal to printing a and then reading a
back as an even string we can do this
for JSON for XML but it turns out
there's other functions that have this
types of relationship
zip and unzip partition and flatten so
if you start to think for a bit you can
start to find these pairs of functions
that do something to your data and then
undo that thing and if you run tests
like this you start to find pretty
interesting results another example is
using a trusted implementation so let's
go back to our example here transients
are just a performance optimization
right we should be able to test that
transients work by applying the same set
of actions to a regular persistent data
structure and testing against that
source of truth and this is actually the
same property that I showed in the
beginning so we're able to test the
implementation of transients against the
implementation of regular persistent
sets and maps etc the next example and
this one I think is a little bit more
ambiguous but thinking about how the
inputs to your function really
to the output so the example we gave
before of the count of the concatenation
of two vectors is the sum of the count
of the individual ones we're using the
input to describe the shape of the
output here so in order to write these
tests we have to write generators or use
generators that are already already so
as I said before on the left-hand side
of these properties we have the the
variables that our generators are going
to be bound to and then the right-hand
side we declare what type we want to
generate and test check comes with a
bunch of batteries included generators
for all the basic closure built in data
structures and there's a function called
sample which allows you to sort of see
at the repple what these what the values
actually look like so if we sample a
boolean unsurprisingly we kind of just
randomly alternate back and forth
between true and false integers we
generate positive and negative integers
vectors get parameterised by a generator
since vectors are collections we need to
know what we're actually generating
vectors of so in this case we're going
to generate vectors of integers but we
could soon enough pass anything in there
we can also sample in this case we're
just going to take one example because
otherwise it would take up the whole
slide but we can generate any printable
closure value so in this case I think
we're generating a map where the first
key is a keyword the value is a string
the second key is a list that contains a
map so we can create these really
complex nested things and it turns out
in a lot of cases for testing
serializers and deserialize errs these
kind of nasty nested test cases are what
you have to generate in order to find
some of the more nasty bugs we also have
a set of combinators to create more
complex generators from the built-in
ones that map to your domain so we can
create person records and such so the
first simple one is basically the
constantly of generators so Jen return
creates a new generator that always
returns the value that you've passed
them so unsurprisingly we just get food
back every single time we can also
specify a specific range for integers so
Jen nint will generate integers of
arbitrary size but let's say in our
domain we only want integers from 5 to
10 in this case it's inclusive we can
create a generator like that we can
create a generator that chooses a random
element from a list so we can enumerate
our values in this case we're going to
enumerate some programming languages and
then Jen elements is just going to
choose one at random one of allows us to
do a similar thing but instead of
choosing between different elements we
can actually choose between different
generators so in this case we're going
to randomly alternate between boolean's
and bytes so we see 119 is how a byte
gets printed so these are bytes and then
we can alternate between boolean x' as
well we can apply a frequency to that so
5 out of 7 times we can return a weekday
2 out of 7 we can return a weekend so we
can actually control the distribution of
these as well if the default uniform
distribution doesn't make sense for our
application we can filter the values so
if we want integers that are not 0 if we
want lists that are not empty we can
start to compose these things together
getting a little more complex we have
one called
F map which allows us to apply a
function to every value generated so if
you sort of think of the list of
possible values generated as a lazy
stream we can map over that stream and
apply the odd function to every element
so we can go from a sequence of random
integers that can get generated apply
onto it and turn that into boolean's so
in this case the function we're passing
in is going to return an actual value
sometimes we might want to take that
value and create a new generator that's
what bind allows us to do so we have a
similar shape here we're passing in a
generator in this case vectors of
integers ignoring the empty vector and
then we're going to return a new
generator
which uses the tuple generator which is
just a fixed length vector where the
first element returns the vector that
was just generated and the second
element of the tuple chooses a random
element from it so we take a look at
sample of this in this case we've
generated a vector of negative three and
negative three unsurprisingly we've had
to choose negative three an example here
we could we've generated this vector and
then we can randomly choose one so this
allows us to compose more complex
generators together that actually depend
on the values of previous generators
another interesting feature that tests
check and some quick check
implementations have is something called
shrinking so remember the counter
example before of the bug with
transients this is what it looked like
this is pretty simple you know we can
look at this and sure we might not
immediately know that these both have
the same hashcode but it's not something
like this and you might have been
wondering how did we find this after
only 2800 tests well it turns out we
actually found this this is the original
failing random case and this is hidden
somewhere inside of it so shrinking
allows us to automatically start pulling
things out and making the input smaller
and continuing to do that until the test
starts to pass again so we can actually
do that search that you might as a human
start to do yourself you know if you saw
this you're going to start saying well
probably all of those actions are not
required to make the test fail I'll pull
one out try in the repple see if it
fails but we've been able to automate
that and this just happens automatically
as you compose the generators together
you get this shrinking built in such
that when the test fails you get the
original failing example and you get the
shrunk case back I'm not going to go
into too much detail into how this works
but the basic idea is that for every
value generated we also create a lazy
shrink tree which represents the ways to
shrink that value when the test fails
we can start to walk that tray and
continue doing so as long as the test
continues to fail so for example here
this is probably too small to see but
the number 8 can shrink down to 0-4 and
7 so if we run the test and 4 continues
to fail then we can now expand 4 and
recursively do this lazily walking the
shrink tree as long as the test
continues to fail we also have built-in
support for a closure test so taking
these tests and running them with line
tests or whatever your favorite test
Runner is is as simple as using this def
spec macro so you just name the property
explain how many iterations you want and
then you just in line put the property
in here and this turns into a test
that's runnable with closure not test
there's also a fork of test check that
uses clj X so that you can use the same
code base to test closure script
applications so if you have closure
script that you want to test them in
this way you can use double check to
apply the same principles of property
based testing to testing your closure
script as well so I'm going to talk a
little bit next about something that
I've I've been working on and I'm really
excited about this is still kind of in
the proof-of-concept stage but I wanted
to kind of share it anyway and that's
applying some of these same techniques
for testing concurrent programs and I
want you to think for a moment why are
concurrent programs hard to test I mean
how many of you have had a race
condition that you couldn't reproduce on
your machine but your colleagues machine
you know well it works for me or it's a
heisenbugs and you only get a bug report
once a month for it so why are these
programs hard to test because their
execution is non-deterministic right
otherwise when we apply property based
testing when I add one in one I always
get to the execution of that is
deterministic but when we program
currently the execution of our threads
is controlled by the virtual machine and
the virtual machines goal is not
necessarily to explore all the
possibilities it's trying to execute
things as efficiently as possible so
what if we could make it deterministic
what if we could run your concurrent
programs in a deterministic context so
this is work that's based on pulse which
is also a tool for Erlang John Hughes is
also an author of that you're probably
starting to see a trend and it allows
our property to be for all interleavings
of these concurrent actions something
should hold true so let's give an
example of that schedule is going to run
this expression inside of our
alternative deterministic thread
scheduler so if we create a promise and
then we create two futures the first one
is going to deliver true to that promise
the second one is going to sleep for a
second and then deliver false then we
assert that true is equal to referencing
that promise now it turns out if you
just run this in a ripple on your JVM
you're gonna get true every single time
right the virtual machine has no
interest in ever making sleeping for a
second be faster than just immediately
running in action but in this case we
can all see clearly that there's a race
condition here we're not always going to
get true so what we want to do is be
able to randomly schedule the execution
of the executions of our thread so that
we can find those heisenbugs that most
of the time don't surface but
occasionally we get unlucky and when we
do we have no idea what execution
actually caused the test to fail and
when we control their scheduler we can
actually record the interleavings of
threads and return that to the user and
say hey this is the interleaving of
threads that I caused to cause this bug
so to kind of visualize this a little
bit better imagine that we have three
threads and we might actually have more
than one core as well so we might
actually be able to run things in
parallel
and each thread and each of these dots
is going to call some concurrency
function it might swap on an atom create
a new future deliver a promise and when
we run this under the JVM we have no
control over the execution of this and
once it's done we don't know what order
they executed them
so what we're able to do is inside of
this scope and I'll explain how this
works in a second we take over the
scheduler and we choose a serial order
to run these actions in and then we can
shrink that if the test fails and return
to you I only ran one action at a time
and I ran them in this order and the
tests failed here's the order of these
concurrency functions that I ran you
have a better chance of being able to
see why the test failed and if you pass
that random C then you can actually
reproduce the test again so the basic
implementation idea here is that using a
function called with three deaths fun
were able to redefine a set of built-in
closures concurrency functions so we
actually provide an alternative
implementation of functions like swap do
sync future call etc and instead of
calling the normal implementation we
first check with a user level scheduler
thread am I allowed to rotten so we
communicate with the scheduler thread
and the schedulers thread sits there and
chooses which thread is allowed to run
only let's one of them run at a time and
it records the order that they run in
then we can return that back to you to
see why the test failed once the thread
has been allowed to run the action it
does actually call the original
implementation of that function it just
only does so once it's been told it's
allowed it's allowed to run so I think
that's all I have you can find tests
check on github the example test that
sort of contrasts traditional unit based
testing
with property-based testing is on github
here there's gonna be an unsession on
test check at 9 p.m. tonight in this
room I'll be happy to take more
questions there go over the
implementation or perhaps help people
come up with some properties for their
own domain if that's something that
you're having trouble with so thank you
and I'm also happy to take questions now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
