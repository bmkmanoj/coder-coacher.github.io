want to talk to you about our experience
with using speck now to begin with how
many of you have heard of or reloaded
speck okay almost never fantastic so I
don't have spent too much time going
over the details just briefly glitter
speck is based on the idea that we can
actually have something like regular
expressions but for any kind of data
it's based on a lovely paper called
parsing with do bits there is and I
really recommend you reading this paper
itself easy to follow
not very long not overly opaque opaque
so it's a very nice example work feels a
good computer science paper or there's
also like an hour option which I highly
recommend ever this is this blog post
which goes through in actually enclosure
through an interactive version of the
main ideas of this paper and completely
interactive so you can interact with
online and it's been great to get the
feel of how things work behind the
scenes right now so the original
intention for spec as an esper closure
web page is the writing spec should
enable us to do automatic validation
error reporting destructuring
instrumentation test data generation and
the generative test generation now and
here what we'll see in this talk is it's
also normally this but there are some
other things you can use spec and it
works very well in those situations as
well and I think look at the spec is
mumbles ideal examples of what's elegant
enclosure and how closure people's
especially obviously which Vicki
approach solving problems meaning that
it really is kind of this stills to its
bare bones and I love this quote by Eric
normal process that composition is about
decomposing now when you first read it
it's comes almost sounds banal but the
more you think about it the more
sexually is very profound and this is
exactly what
you could say it's one of the guiding
design principles behind closure that
we're always kind of looking at how to
decompose what's in front of us to find
what are those elements that really kind
of then combine the solution back
together
so we're moving only can necessary
coupling and really finding the
fundamental simplest bits and then
building something up with that and
closure spec is a great example of this
thinking because it starts with already
a powerful idea of having a kind of a
description language for your data and
then decompose it in in decomposing it
what we'll see is that it enables us to
do a lot of very dissapointing which at
first glance might don't even seem like
they have a lot in common and yet they
openly done with spec so it's a really
great example of how closure the
language is also growing now drinka as I
promised this talk is going to be like
very concrete examples of using spec
harm like if you missed it they went
spec came out I can fell in love with it
and decided to test it extensively so
basically we went through the majority
or closure code base which comprised
about 15,000 lines of code arm and apply
spec to it so our code is maybe not
entirely representative of all the
things you can do with closure because
it's um basically very heavily tilted
towards doing analytics and data science
so what we have is we have our entire
ETL pipeline meaning all the
infrastructure to do with getting data
from run from one place to another in
transform it then we have various
algorithms like some which risk hedging
algorithms demand responsive pricing
packaging routing because we're in
logistics and also we build most of our
internal BI tools enclosure and
JavaScript so but again like I'm pretty
certain that some of the things I will
talk about aren't quite as applicable if
your main use case is building for
instance web applications with closure
so take this with a grain of salt and
kind of heavily based and this may be
not a super generic example but
it's like water I feel it has values
that is still relatively large code base
and actually something that's running in
production Oscar as a precursor we were
already before using schema for some
things I'm going to talk about has done
in Spanish also why we were able to
change over so quickly because some of
the things already kind of had an idea
where we want to go with them I'm gonna
simplified but and during this talk
Alice curve try to do some comparison
between like what how things can be done
in scheme or were done schema and what
spec brings to the table like ultimately
going forward I believe I'm hoping that
we as a community adopts spec overs
emails simply because it's obviously
part of the language and also it is just
kind of that little bit more generic and
in that it allows you to do massively
more things so it will make sense to go
rolling on the spectrum right so the
first and welcome vanilla
use case is ability kind of validation
now one thing that kind of I wasn't sure
about and at the beginning we went
slightly overboard is where do you
actually want to put your validation in
terms of code base so in the end what I
think is kind of the best compromise is
to find where the API boundaries of your
application it may be something like
library versus your actual domain code
or whatever and put validation there but
don't just kind of put it everywhere
because it just doesn't serve any much
purpose one very nice thing or something
is curve looking very promising although
it's not really been exploited yet it's
not my knowledge is that what spec also
brings to the table are essentially
structured errors if something goes
wrong you have a new description of what
went wrong is data which you can
interact with which is a massive
advantage over having of reasons some
exception that
even if you put some data in it in it
it's the kind of not as a rigid
description of what went wrong then what
you have inspect so that I think the
going for is going to be a huge thing
with what things like window and in a
sense for those of you who have common
list background I think it moves closer
closer closer to the restarts
conditioning start system we have in
common list because now you can much
more information what to do when
something goes wrong and you connect
from that and again something that I
feel really take some time that we
actually grasp all the consequences of
what this brings to the table now why I
said okay we're putting mostly speck at
the API boundaries and this why you want
to do this and have a little bit is that
it was it great it's not just up to
assured it's gonna be heavily in puttin
stuff of that even just with within your
own libraries where you don't have to
worry about the input or inputs we
already been sanitized the a big win for
me is that what then happens is that
actually fail fast faster in terms of
that the error actually happens at the
point where you made a mistake we're
closer to that point rather there's
somewhere very deep down the stack now
we all known that closure exceptions are
kind of let's say acquired taste and
pick sometimes can be getting used to
and the situation is massively improved
if you're kind of diligent with where
you put this validation because the
things gonna explode at that moment and
that's especially important if you are a
big user of either in Mill panning or
multiple artists now but I love both of
them and I love having carried versions
of my functions so forth so also like if
you look at our the libraries were using
we oftentimes will have a current
version as long side the full argument
version so a very common mistake then
happen especially like with people get
new to the code base is that they would
mess up the number of arguments somehow
that or wouldn't do wouldn't do a
current version when they needed it and
using a schema for validation is a great
way that he'll describe is can in your
in your face shells this is a problem
rather than having
kind of obscure error with something not
being a nice egg blah blah blah which is
it always like even when I've been doing
closure since 2009 and case there myself
relatively proficient but it still takes
some some brain cycles that you figured
okay what went wrong here's some
immediate while wait spec what happens
is that you have a very clear
description what went wrong and we also
kind of see we can actually even enhance
the error messages that we get and all
this can immensely helps with just
figure out what's going on so this is
something that's relatively new it's I
think came out in alpha 12 or even alpha
13 but we now can can have your own
explanations for the error so basically
you can define a function which as input
gets what when the kind of the data
description of the error you have and
then you can use it to produce any sort
of error message and this is our great
thing like again the error reporting
situation closure is not really ideal
especially if you look at something like
rust or elm which are light-years away
from us in terms of how user-friendly
they are but this is this is the
infrastructure that we need in order to
build things like that
we've already had great success with
just kind of figure out what were the
most common modes of error and having
messages crafted specifically for that
like oh did you forget to carry that did
you forget the last argument things like
the most common cases and the again
immensely help especially new people
coming on board with the codebase now
sadly here there are some limitations in
the current version I'm hoping this
means you can improve going forward
because we're still talking about in
alpha software but right now you only
have you can only define basically one
explanation function for all so this
kind of limits how much you can do and
if you kind of want to have more
libraries which would add their own
explanations the whole thing becomes
very messy very quickly and also you
don't get the information about which
spec actually expert so just know what
the error was but you don't know which
spec which again kind of complicates
things because if at least we have
information about which spec then you
could use something like multi methods
have a completely extensible error
description system but right now it's
not the case but as I said this is
something that just came out I'm really
hoping that we can have people come on
for a fourth with various use cases that
this testing that I can see being added
and greatly enhanced usability and also
like the last point about those error
messages which really want to drive home
how important thing they are is that we
can now actually build a database of
errors and we have actually widget data
to do this so they're also kind of going
forward in my additional pulling those
things together and what work best
solutions of those problems may be tiny
to it have changes in your version or
some of that we can actually kind of
have a very profound extending of what
the mistakes were on the level of code
and even maybe build systems and top of
that which would kind of already suggest
some common solutions and fixes and some
that you know that's kind of joke where
someone made an error handler where no
matter what exception is just kind of
fun to do the Stack Overflow something
like that project understanding what the
actual thing is proud and just letting
Stack Overflow do all the thinking right
so moving on the destructor is maybe
like one of those unexpected things
because most people when talking about
spec it's all about validation and that
generation so for but actually indeed
they programming also the structuring
adds a lot in terms of how flexible now
closure becomes in working with events
we were already talking about one of the
most powerful languages when it comes to
manipulating data and spec here adds a
quite significant amount basically what
it essentially allows you to do is to
pull apart any kind of data structure
you have and name
parts it can recombine it and this is if
you have a more complex structures this
is a very big improvement over the
vanilla destructuring or something like
that because then oftentimes when you
have different structures you don't have
to do some destructuring and then
dispatch based on the what you get out
and then the next destruction is so
forth and
we're gonna finesse that mass of
destructuring and ifs and so forth while
if you did with speck it you know first
of all remove all this logic from the
code it's actually manipulating the you
remove you separate the transformation
from the description of the data or
unifying the data and that's kind of
clears up things and you don't miss much
nesting because it's basically the spec
does most worried and also what I found
in practice is that spec plays very nice
with both kind of for simple cases the
case mark macro and furthermore involved
matching also called magic at first I
thought that actually just the come back
is going to source is more as going to
supplant a core match and it's actually
a question I posed to David sometime
back in it's like nothing that both have
to exist and now I kind of using it more
I understand the logic behind is it yes
actually you do still want poor match
for things like once the what you get
out of spec deep kind of confirmed value
meaning the baddie pulled apart and
names version that you get you then
maybe want to use pattern matching on
top of that and that's kind of both
posted to care provide very concise
solutions and it's also like in it's on
the other hand it does solve the
currently for me the biggest gripe with
a core match which is the very for quite
awkward when you have one to use guards
make if you want to scan an arbitrary
function in match that becomes is not
very elegant and here in spec it's
completely kind of natural to use any
arbitrary function in your description
of data so this can also solve this
nicely and but yeah this notion of kind
of separating your data description from
transformation I think it's very
important for the way we tend to solve
problems in computer science in general
especially like in Lisp live languages
because it allows you again to separate
problem into small pieces you don't have
to come
relate how I can transform data into a
shape which I know how to solve and
actually solving it you can have those
two separate with just the
transformation being encoded in the spec
and then your function just act acting
on the kind of the ideal the canonical
form of your data okay allow me a short
digression because this is like well the
things I can love thinking about and
this is a notion coming from which is
Gabriel which is one of the old school
this Packers and sequels it to schools
of thinking and basically his ideas that
fundamentally how we approach
problem-solving with computers can
envelop in two ways one is the language
paradigm where we first set an rigid
system most extreme etic system where we
didn't bounce what we do and then build
a solution within it and the other one
is the system paradigm where we actually
acknowledge that we are interacting with
some real-world or alive system and what
we do is we can slowly build up a
solution based on our interactions with
that system so it is like the system
paradigm is as you go you build your
experiment you try while the language
paradigm is more of a server upfront
rigorous way where if you kind of you
have to do all your thinking up front
and then just reap the benefits of your
thinking I one way of looking at this
dichotomy between discovery on one hand
invention on the other hand where the
system paradigm is very much of a
question of discovering something while
the language paradigm is more in the
domain of invention and I think this
this is traditionally whatever in the
system paradigm but also like with
spectating written in string interesting
blurring of lines is is starting to show
now just can we iterate because it's
something I'm going to return back to a
couple of times with at the point of
this of the system paradigm is that
we cannibal at the problem in different
directions and have small partial
solutions which we then take together
and can assemble it at the final
solution and this is why I think this
aspect is so important because it allows
us to even better decompose our problem
into smaller bits and pieces and then
put those together and this is like the
thing with simplifying is left um it's
you don't have to think it's about so
many things it's kind of you can hold
more things in your hand in your head if
they are simple and they can build those
just gonna help the interact rather than
having something doing having two or
three things at the same time now the
interesting thing here obviously is like
where the spec tie into this because
that now I was forty was explained from
the perspective written system paradigm
where it allows us more decoupling but
on the other hand it is also kind of a
at least a pseudo type system which is
real very much romantic of having a
language paradigm and this is the thing
is this interesting position Rousseau
opens the question of when they write
the spec expects something that's you
right up front like you would if you
were I'm doing more or less type
oriented programming or is something you
do afterwards when you already have it
so I don't have a clear answer to that
like I know that I've started to write
more and more spec at the beginning but
I'm not sure so just oscillating between
kind of two-week streams and not really
finding my group so then I would love to
hear it when your thoughts for those of
you who work with spec on that
afterwards present the other if thing
was talking about transformations of
data is kind of going even one step
further this is datum actress and this
is a term I stole from the jacks guys
who wrote about this in a blog post
which can deeply influenced me and the
idea is that kind of we can do we should
we should think about transforming data
for in the same way that we think about
transforming our code being Afrikaans
define recursive transformations which
end up with this canonical form which we
know how to operate on and in with
respect you can do this with the
conformer function and the nice thing
about this are the power behind data
macros is that it allow
to do more without code macros which
sounds paradoxically like we are lispers
we should be using macros but like what
you find is that the more and more
people are turning this idea of doing as
much as like all the things with macros
because it does introduce certain
problems like compressibility always
takes a hit when you have a lot of
macros reason just harder to control put
all these things together self there's a
lot of value in and trying to keep away
from actors as much as possible right
having very simple macros we just remove
the boilerplate while the rest you try
to kind of Express with just data
structures and again here having
something like this kind of data macros
is very helpful because it's it
simplifies the logic if due to their
recursive nature you can start with the
smallest bit and then transform it up
while in the other way if you'd have
just took a function which takes any
form that impressive transform it you
don't have to kind of start thinking
from the other direction and basically
go from the top down which in use
usually have more error-prone and more
verbose so just gonna give you example
of kind of like what I'm talking about
is um this is gonna run sort of like a
filter but slightly smarter from library
for working with data that I wrote and
what we want this kind of a pretty
powerful of filtering facility so we
want various things like having value
literals having the ability to just kind
of do current versions and also can say
something about several present several
predicates or attributes at once and
this is something that's kind of but at
the end we want we need to arrive is
what you see it below arm and but this
is something that you don't like in
terms of API you don't want to write
this out manually so basically the
options are either you write a macro or
in this case you can also do all those
things we're just kind of prints
starting with the map you see above and
then doing recursively transforming it's
from the Leafs up and you end up with
what in tears
canonical version which holds all the
information you then needs to actually
make it work and like the this is only
all the code that it takes do this with
just with spec so we can define for each
of those each part of our query form
means it and the left and right side you
can defined how this ties together no I
won't go
overly into this like a bunch of
tutorials about how you use spec online
which probably are more pedagogical than
this setting allows but it just kind of
to give you an idea what I'm talking
about and it doesn't really take much
code and it greatly simplifies the rest
of the code
and it's like a nice thing with spec is
that you can mostly uses keywords as
identifiers which also means that you
don't have to worry about sequencing of
how you of your definitions which again
is kind of convenient now these probably
the biggest selling point of spec means
kind of already how most people first
see the value of spec is that it allows
you it allows you to generate test
automatically and do property based
testing like property based testing
internal is something with should be
surprising for because it forces you to
be way more careful with how you write
your your code because otherwise if you
just kind of writes the normal tests
that often happen is that if you don't
really think hard enough about what
you're testing there's obviously case on
edge cases that you might miss while
kind of general testing I'll probably
base testing is usually Thurl enough
that it finds a little edge cases that
you might not have all about and it's
also here an interesting question for me
is how to even do testing when working
in the list spec I've another scanner we
may be controversial but I believe not a
proponent of doing test-driven
development when working in a language
which has a very strong kind of
rattle culture to it because I think
that it obviously yes pests are
something you want to have but then
something that you can have right
afterwards to ensure correctness and so
forth and it and is refactoring but was
actually finding a solution I think that
they again like the moment you start
talking about test-driven development
you are essentially talking about
language driven design you already box
yourself in this solution which you mock
with tests or kind of presume with tests
while if you did kind of purely from the
rapid perspective I think it craft the
finding a solution flows much more
organically and you can different
decisions for instance what kind of tree
encoding data and what encoding
functions much later and in the other
thing it needs to fill in your code
sooner but um I'm pretty sure and return
is going to become a very controversial
thing um but I think we can all agree
that property based testing is gonna
wrap our foot tool so our experience
with it we're kind of just what spec
gives you over the and vanilla
generative testing you get enclosure
anyway it's gonna mix back only one hand
like when it works it's amazing but
there are also some limitations we
stacked for our cases the two big
limitations are one is if you are
working with sequences which have some
internal structure let's say a time
series or maybe a time series which also
has some periodic component or something
that - it's this kind of tedious to
describe this way they can mass spec
relative defined generators and the NSF
doesn't make sense to stuff all this
into spec so this is one area where we
didn't find the spec to be a good fit
for what we're doing
and the other problem a limitation is if
you have very generic high order
functions because then it's kind of hard
to figure out what the function is going
to get in is going to be and again you
either test for a very limited subset or
just something that's not really
feasible look something I was very
surprised with was um that actually how
effective this is at a general testing
how effective it is in finding numerical
instability
in kind of mathematical numerically
heavy code I like how many of you know
what numerical instabilities are like
some okay the the problem is that like
if we are working with float points and
things like that where numbers with
precision it might happen that we start
to multiply or something that's kind of
is going to blow up in terms of how
large or how small a number we can
represent and kind of then what happens
is that either we get completely
nonsense results or at least you're
getting at vastly fluctuating and
neither dose is something that you want
so in fact that what this means is that
you sometimes have to be careful with
how you code your algorithms to avoid
this and it's something that's when
someone says is like obvious and yes of
course but in practice what turns out is
that which is kind of you don't always
think about it deep enough sure you can
look at when you seek any
multiplications and divisions that will
this work but there are often times I
can etch cases which just don't consider
and the genitive testing is rather good
at finding those etiquettes like for us
and we just like us being shitted
writing numerical code but like it found
three three bugs that we actually had in
production that this testing so this was
like a huge surprise and we're now
invested some more time and effort into
really pouring up our the testing we do
just looking for various numerical
stability this is something that
sometimes kind of hard to test for
because how do you detect that something
stable so sometimes you do have to kind
of do some math and figure out like
what's your upper and lower bounds are
instant things like that but luckily
here spec has this ability that when you
instrument functions you can also you
can say what do you expect the result to
be and also how do you expect your
result to be connected with your
arguments and like doing things like
making sure that various mathematical
invariants health is a great example of
where you want to use this kind of a
coupling of your inputs and outputs and
blasting this is a good trick is that
you can use exercise which is
spec way of just spewing out data that
um conforms the shape you've described
for locking so instead of just kind of
having one fixed mock data that you work
against or do it manually you can
actually just describe how your data
looks and then use that in this you get
out of it first of all fresh data which
and also comes more usually a more
varied data which can really uncover
some problems and it was just if you
would be using spec anyway it's just
saves you time not having to do two
things at once to things rather just
have the spec and then let the spec
figure it out
know now moving to more kind of things
that's weren't maybe intended at the
beginning when speaking out but
something that self we found to be of
great use of there is something that
we've already been doing before with
schema but like spec does add some nice
things to it and this is variable data
descriptions now like I said um a big
part of the our closure code base it has
to do with just shuffling that around
and doing all the kind of areas
ETL meaning and extract transform load
tasks and here you often in fact want to
know or understand what kind of data
you're working with and spec is a great
with it's going to describe how your
data looks like in a very declarative
way and then you can build tools around
it and start using this kind of greatly
simplified our entire operation side of
how we work with data and then like just
having those descriptions is pretty
sweet but you can go one step further
and what you can do is then kind of
stuff them into a graph so basically you
build a graph out of all the specs and
connect how various ranges if you have
several let's save data tables and which
tend to have joins between them so we're
effectively they're both contain the
same field and this is something that
can be very nicely expressed in a graph
or you can see that like both of those
tables are connected with the same node
being a certain field and once you have
this kind of description of all your
data in a graph you can do various
squaring on top of it and
becomes a very powerful building block
not like the only both in terms of
building work both in terms of
infrastructure and in terms of just
generating documentation and online help
and things like that said only here said
limitation is that currently you can't
also stuff in line Docs introspect which
would be nice because then you can
really have a complete online basically
documentation built entirely from this
description of your data but again like
it's one of those cases of the system
paradigm wearing its head where we have
what's essentially a type system with
one with which we can interact so it's
that system here is not something that's
removed from you and basically just
available to your compiler but rather
it's a part of your runtime with which
you can interact with and build and pop
off and that's like for me the essence
of system paradigm that's there is a
students there is no clear delineation
between your your runtime environment
and your rec sugar-work code or the
problem-solving part but there is kind
one just parts with continuous interval
right so how in how this little
descriptions help us is that what we do
is like we use a lot of materialized
views now the idea with a materialized
view is that you maybe want to do some
kind of transformations on your data and
put in the center of some shape and have
that stored because you used it often
why would you want to do this first of
all just kind of remove as much
duplication in terms of how you prepare
your data so we have it once and it's
this kind of canonical shape and the
other argument is the business but if
you're kind of clever with how you build
your materialized views what you can do
is greatly improve how much of
processing and then do just on your
laptop rather than having to do
something in a grid or something else
that's I think that's like if you talk
to most data scientists they can say
that they vastly prefer working on their
own computer rather than having to use
spark or whatever so it's kind of it a
it speeds up development and simplifies
it almost lowers variant
which is important so but the problem
with materialized views is obviously
that you then need to manage them and
make sure that they are up to date and
oftentimes what happens is that you have
a lot of materialized views but just not
the one you need like are almost correct
or almost cracked for what you need but
none of them is a perfect match that you
end up with raw data and here having
variable descriptions of your data is
greatly helpful because what we can then
do is we can actually produce
materialized views completely
automatically just based on inference so
what we do is we have some ontology
defined both in terms of spec and
someone just made some pipes and some of
it on can domain things prints okay this
is a user ID or whatever and then you
can do kind of define various rules on
top of that for instance like every time
you see a date a data stream coming in
which has a field called user also
create this derived view which in
enhances this data with also some
historical data about for it's like how
is this a new user or an old user or
what the cohort is the segment or
whatever you want to do and you by just
having like it completely this
data-driven description of this you
don't have to actually manage this
automatically just have the rules and
then this system does this on its own
and the other thing we are doing how
abusive doesn't human aspect doesn't
really help with this is also ducking
various statistical analysis on our data
to see if there is a strong seasonal
component then we're also kind of group
the data into sensible time chunks and
have various aggregates in that and this
is something that greatly simplifies how
our entire analytics stack works and I'm
kind of pretty excited about what more
we can build on top of because like I
hope this idea of stuffing yours back
into a graph is relatively new that's
also why we haven't released ending it
it's definitely something that I think
it could be a good contribution to the
closure system but it right now it's um
it's very promising in terms of what you
can do right so I just got loved this
slice and I stole it completely
shamelessly
I think that's right now where this
stage where spectrally nailed kind of
this simple part um but there are some
things still kind of not maybe as easy
as they could be so like the one thing
almost milites just define a couple of
quick macros which helped solve a most
and some of the common cases this is
also due to especially because maybe I'm
a big user of spec in waistt weren't
initially may be the focus of design
meaning doing various kind as a data
macros and destructuring which is to
solve um service kind of helps but I'm
not really certain if this is the
geometric way of going for it and like
this is its kind the last thing I want
to talk about is respect how do we
proceed with this like it's clear that
spec is something amazing but I think
what we right now we need to do is we
need kind of started discussions what
idiomatic usage of spec means but
they're always going to be kind of some
weird usages of spec and that's
fantastic but I think we should also
have this understanding of eight new
people coming on board and using spec of
how do you start using if and it's can
start with even like this very basic
things like for instance um should specs
be in line with your code or somewhere
completely separate which one do you
choose
like the these things I think that we as
a community should eventually settle on
risk have some good practices and
arguments what what to do and what not
and also like the other thing I was
talking about when to spec expect
something right up front or at the end
now all of those are obviously due to
personal preference but I think it's
something that's worth having a
discussion about because eight minutes
gonna lead to some reflections that
otherwise my go pass and obviously this
gonna this huge area opened with spec in
terms of the tooling which right now
just have not really taking advantage of
all the things that spec brings about so
I'm certainly hoping that in let's say
years time we're going to be listening
to Paris talks about
before leveraging spec just build more
powerful tools more powerful
environments in which you can actually
then solve your problems and there's
also interesting things like Ambrose is
doing a project we're kind of using
which is mashing a type type closure
with spec which is an early interesting
approach to sort of gel using the
generative capabilities to then arrive
at type descriptions and so forth so
there are a lot of interesting things
going on and I'm really excited about
all the all the things are going to
bubble up in the coming months and years
so um with this in mind I yield the
floor to you and any questions and
comments like to hear your options on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
