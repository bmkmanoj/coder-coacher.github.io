live in Austin Texas I work for dr w
trading i played the drums and i'm here
to talk to you about closure internals
and the way i'm going to kind of walk
through that is following a life of a
closure expression so a few disclaimers
before we dive in I'm definitely not an
expert on compilers in general or the
closure compiler in particular if anyone
here is and i miss state something or
make a mistake and you think you can
correct me without being too disruptive
please feel free to do that if it would
take too long we can follow up
afterwards and all I'll write up an
errata blog post or something so what
I'm going to be showing you is a bunch
of closure internals and those could
change I think everything i'm going to
show you is pretty stable you know given
it there a bunch of production closure
systems out there obviously the
maintainer czar pretty careful about
what changes and what I'm showing you is
you know right down there in the middle
of stuff but it could all change anytime
so hopefully this talk won't be still in
the next month and I'm going to show you
a lot of code mostly Java code not
closure code and I've kind of hacked up
the excerpts in all kinds of ways to fit
them on the screen and ignore things
that are sort of annoying details that
we can gloss over but I'm trying to at
least you know remain true enough to
what's what's actually out there that if
you go look at the real code hopefully
it'll look a little familiar after this
talk ok so what closure expression are
we talking about it's this one so
there's this simple function but the
expression we're really going to focus
on is this map literal that's the body
of this function it's got two key word
keys and a static or a hard-coded string
value and takes its its other valve from
an argument to the function so that
context is is relevant to what we're
going to talk
about and I'm going to talk go a little
bit into the details of that context but
at certain points I'm going to hand wave
and say okay forget about that stuff
let's just focus on the map because
there's a lot a lot more goes into
creating a function then goes into just
creating the map at the center of it and
we don't have time and I don't even
fully understand all of it all right so
really it's the life of that one map
literal expression let me in the body of
a simple function and I'll talk a little
bit about some minor variations like
what might be different if that map were
just a constant what might be different
if one of the keys came from an argument
to the function instead of one of the
values and what might be different if it
had more than eight key value pairs
those all kind of take you down slightly
different roads so at a high level we're
talking about the r and the E and repple
so those things are exposed pretty
conveniently enclosure core read and
closure core eval each of which are
basically just pass throughs to java
classes there's a lip reader read method
and a compiler eval method eval is is
serious business it basically breaks
down or the chunks that we're going to
spend most of our time on our an analyze
phase and then Annie MIT where you're
emitting byte code and then we'll talk
about what happens at runtime when when
that simple function actually gets
called so we'll get started so close
record read as i said is pretty much
just a pass through there won't be much
more closure code than this in the talk
so let's get into the java ok so this is
a few little excerpts from Liz breeder
Java that kind of gives you a flavor of
what goes on there so Liz breeder has a
static array of closure
of ifns closure functions but written in
Java they're indexed by the character
that the reader will see to say oh this
is what you just ran into so here's how
to handle it and the one were most
interested in or the only one we're
interested in today is the map reader so
the index into the array is the char for
the open curly brace and here's all
there is to map reader obviously it
calls out to some things that are doing
some some more meticulous work but all
the map all the map reader has to do is
read the list of things that follows the
open curly brace until it gets to the
closed curly brace make sure it found an
even number of things and then call this
our team map method and here's all that
is takes an array of objects as its
input if that thing's empty gives you
back an empty map if that thing's 16 or
fewer items you know that would be eight
entries in a map then it gives you a
persistent or a map via create with
check and if its larger a persistent
hashmap create would check ours is small
so we get into persistent array map
create with check with check just means
make sure you don't have duplicate keys
so it checks to be sure you don't have
duplicate keys and then returns a new
persistent array map and all that does
is wrap a persistent array map object
around this array of objects that you
know what a persistent array map does is
creates a map interface with just an
array underneath so at that point we
have an array map we don't have the
array map we're going to have when we
call our function we have an array map
of unev al uated code forms so it's got
a keyword and then a string and then a
keyword and then a symbol and it doesn't
know what that symbol is it doesn't know
where its value might come from someday
it's just the same thing you would get
in the repple if you just took our code
and put a quote in front of it you know
it's the whole expression the whole
function you've got a list and it's got
two symbols and then effect
and then a map and and nothing has
happened yet to you know make any sense
of that but this is important because
this is where you know so closure is
homo iconic so this is the stage where
you're familiar with all these types
from runtime and you can write macros
that manipulate this code in any way you
like using those types the same type to
use at runtime and then continue
processing to have the code Eve alt
which is obviously pretty powerful so we
move on to eval so closure line compiler
as I've already mentioned is serious
business it's it's a lot to take on so
rather than just jumping right into eval
here's sort of a pseudo code of if you
didn't have to worry about a lot of
annoying details here's all there is to
eval you get a form you macro expand
that form you analyze that form into a
compiler expert and then you'ii valve
that expert so let's we'll talk a little
more about expert since that's sort of
the only new thing here we're not going
to delve into macro expand so what's an
expert experts an interface inside
compiler that doesn't have much to it so
you can eval an expert that means
evaluate this thing and give me back the
resulting value that's going to be a
value you you know that's going to be
the return value of a calling closure
core eval that's going to be you know a
value you know how to use at runtime the
kind of value you see all the time an
expert can also be emitted what that
means is writing java bytecode using
these various arguments none of which
we're going to talk much about but we'll
talk a little about them that's a little
more that's the kind of thing you never
see at runtime you never what you almost
never have to worry about that as a
closure programmer but it's interesting
and
you know it might become relevant to you
one day and then it's got a couple
methods about Java classes that the
compiler can use to avoid reflection and
where you get experts from is often most
expert implementations expose a static
parse factory method that takes a form
of the type that's appropriate for the
type of expert well we'll see in a
minute how that gets called for most
special forms there's an interface
called I parser that just as a parse
method and yeah and I think there may be
only one I think the FN expert may be
the only exception to those two ways of
creating an expert but doesn't really
matter I hope or I just decided that I
just decree that it doesn't matter you
have to believe me okay so in in the
real world where you have to worry about
a lot of annoying details eval looks
more like this and I've put comments
into sort of its intentional that this
code runs way off the right-hand side
because I don't want us to to read all
the details but i do want to step
through what eval does and so we can
mostly I think just read the comments
that I put in there in some cases I've
just explained the code that's still
there in other cases i replaced the code
with just a little explanation so macro
expand is more or less the first thing
it does I've chopped a bunch of stuff at
the beginning so now we've got a form
that's that's been macro expanded the
first thing we do is or that eval does
is if the form is it do it basically
unrolls that do and just pretends all
the stuff in the do is at the top level
so it just evals each form and then
returns the result of availing the last
form I couldn't tell you exactly why
that special case is important but I'm
sure somewhere in the get logs it's
hinted at at least if not explained so
not not interesting for our case though
so then if the form is
some funny little bit of code that's not
a deaf then eval wraps it in a zero
error t function and then invokes that
function and this is also not really
relevant to our case but there's not
that much to it and I think it's
interesting to see that you know closure
line compiler could have access to all
sorts of weird private secret convenient
ways of doing things but the way that it
wraps the top-level random bit of code
in a 0 ard function is just two down
here create a list and make the first
thing in the list FN star and then put
an empty vector and then put the form
and that's how you make a function
that's the same way you make a function
in your in your closure code it's just a
lot more awkward because it's in Java so
you know again and we eval the results
of that and eval function you know an FN
is going to give you back a function
that you can invoke so that's what this
thing does and then finally we get to
sort of the standard happy path where
the thing your eval at least when your
eval you know your own source files most
of what your availing is going to be
top-level forms that are defs and this
looks you know almost as easy as the
pseudocode you just analyze that form
and then eval the expert you got back
from calling analyze so I want to sort
of check in on our simple code that we
were sending through the system so that
macro expand right at the beginning
depending on how well you know closure
you may you know have learned a long
time ago defin is just a macro that
makes it more convenient to define
functions but it just expands into more
or less def and that's our name and then
the FN special form or pseudo special
form for for our function so the reason
I want to show this is because we're
going to focus as I go through the
analyze path we're going to focus a
little bit on each of these
things that need to be analyzed there's
the Deaf seek so when I say the Deaf
seek I mean the list that has def at the
beginning of it then there's the FN seek
the list that has FN at the beginning of
it and then there's our map and that's
where we'll go into the most detail
neither to all hand wave away at a
certain point ok so we come in to
analyze and an analyze basically has
this form pretty much throughout I've
removed a whole lot of cases that we're
not going to run into in our code but if
it looks at the type of the form and if
that form is a symbol then there's an
analyzed symbol method for that if that
form is a keyword then there's a
register keyword to handle that if it's
an instance of I seek meaning it's a
list then there's an analyze seek that
will go into more detail on if it's an I
persistent map then here's that static
parse method I mentioned so map expert
has a parse method that creates a map
expert and so you know in that case
Annalise is going to return that map
expert or it's going to return what
evers returned by map expert parts which
actually may not be a map expert so well
we're going to i'm not going to go into
symbols or keywords but i am going to go
into analyzing sequences and the map
expert path so analyze seek so it's a
list so you know you kind of know what
to expect from a list it's generally
going to be you're calling a function we
don't have to worry about it's a macro
anymore because we macro expanded
already so again it's so I've removed
some things but not actually many things
you know where is this Annalise there
are a lot of other things in this big if
else--if else--if analyze seek you know
it does some checks for know it checks
to see if your form is being has in line
metadata which I'm not going to go into
any more length but that's a thing to
learn about and then it says okay well
are you the FN special form if so
there's a special parse
method just for f NX / because functions
have names that get kind of shoved down
into them from the context where they're
created so if you've ever if you've ever
seen a closure stack trace which you
probably have you've probably seen your
method names in there so you know your
method was just deftly as a top-level
VAR but via this name being able to get
shoved down in there from the Deaf
context that's why you end up with a
class that's named after the VAR that
your function was assigned to you know
you might intuitively thank you know how
does the right hand somehow the right
hand side of you know more or less an
assignment has to know that it's being
assigned to this name for the class to
have that and def is doing that trick
for you anyway we're not going to look
into f NX / parse though so then we
check to see if it's so FN expert is a
special form or rather FN star is a
special form all the other special forms
if i remember right all the other
special forms are in this specials map
and so we look up in the specials map to
see if our op is one of those specials
and our def is going to be in that map
and if it is you know the parser that's
in that map for deaf gets called and
that's what gives you back your def
expert we're not going to delve into the
parsing of a def expert and then finally
if it wasn't a special it wasn't the FN
special form it wasn't one of the other
special forms that has an eye parser
then I guess that must be a function
you're calling so you get an invoke
expert and we parse that we're also not
going to delve into that this is where I
wave my hands and say ok there's a lot
of code that we're not going to look at
today but you'll recall that the the
pattern was we analyzed and we analyze a
form we get back an expert we call eval
on that expert so when youíve alba def
exper it evals it's in it expression
that's going to be our function when you
eval the FN expert it's going to compile
a class representing that function the
first time it gets availed
and and it's so it's going to compile
that class into the dynamic class loader
and make it available so that's going to
be interesting and we're going to we're
not going to look at all the details of
what FN expert does but we're going to
look at what our map expert does when
you when you get there so each expert in
the body of the function is going to be
analyzed and then emitted and so we'll
talk about emitting a little bit but we
won't look at the code so on to map
expert parse you'll recall here you know
we said okay we had a couple of sikhs
and we went down the analyze seek path
if we had a map and which we do in the
body of our function we get to map
expert parse so here we are so I've cut
out everything almost everything but the
parse method from map expert and we'll
see the rest on in a couple slides maybe
the next slide so the parts method of
map exper kind of just does this little
boring dancewear ok it's got it has a
phone so the form that it's being parsed
is the persistent array map that we
created back in the reader so we're
going to iterate through that map one
entry at a time each entry is going to
get analized into an expert so here you
see each key and valued gets analized
into an expert and we're going to throw
those on to a key values vector that
that is the only instance field of map
expert so what we're doing is building
up a vector that we can then use to
create a map expert so we get a map
expert and now I've left out the details
but there's some special cases so after
after analyzing all the key valves it
runs through and figures out ok are all
those keys unique and are they all
constants are all the vowels also
constants and I think it just sets a few
boolean
to keep track of those things and then
depending on how that all came out there
are a few special cases so we create
this map expert but then so then the
things that checks for that I'm not
showing you the details of where well is
there metadata attached to this map if
so then it's going to map wrap a meta
expert around the map expert and return
that if they're non-unique keys it's
going to blow up but we've already seen
a couple of checks for that so hopefully
it didn't it didn't happen although I
actually sorry I know that's not true
the the checks earlier we're looking at
the code forms to be sure that they were
unique two of those code forms could
conceivably have been analyzed in two
equal values in which case your keys are
not unique and then you have problems
and then if everything is constant it's
going to throw away this map expert all
together and instead just create a
constant expert and that's going to
become just a static that gets loaded at
you know when the function that it's
that it appears in is loaded as a class
that's going to be loaded once and
they'll be it'll just be returned when
needed nothing interesting will happen
at runtime so we return one of those
experts but in our case we're going to
return the map expert that has our to
well it's going to have you know we've
got this vector of key Val's it's going
to have a keyword expert a string X /
another keyword expert at a local
binding expert so the results of the
analyze of that argument that becomes
the second value on the map will be
recognized as a binding to a local and
so now we know where that we know what
that symbol is going to be four and so
as I mentioned earlier the FN x / being
eval will call you know as part of
writing bike code for a class to
represent the function it's going to
call emit on our map expert and so now
we're going to look at basically
everything else that's in map expert
it all fits so you've got a couple of
statics here at the beginning this map
method and map unique Keys method we'll
see what those are used for in a second
but they're so these are ASM the ASM by
code library is packaged along with
closure sort of re repackaged along with
closure and these method objects are ASM
things and you can kind of guess they
represent Java methods and they're
parsed from a string that almost looks
like Java code so it's just a return
type of function name and a list of
argument types so we'll see how those
are used in a second so Amit so I've
left out the details of your going to
iterate through those key valves and
you're going to determine are all of
those keys constant and are all the
constant keys unique and based on those
two bullion's you're going to decide
what to do here down below so the first
thing you're going to do regardless of
those two is so this is a sm stuff and
this is you know what you're generally
going to see in Amit methods in in
compiler dot java so method expert has a
static method on it called emit args as
array so it allows you to hand it a
vector a persistent vector of experts
and it will write the bike code for
putting an array into your method and
now depending on those two flags we set
if all the keys are constant and unique
or if you only had one or no key value
pairs then you're going to write a
static method invocation the class is
going to be RT that's closure you know
this arty type is just a constant for
the closure lang RT class and and you'll
use the map unique keys method you'll
call the map unique keys method on RT so
that's this method up above that we saw
the static one static method at the top
if you're
keys are not all constant unique values
then we'll just call Rt map ours ours
are constant and unique so we're going
to go down the map unique keys path at
runtime and and we'll look at that in
more detail in a second here and then
this little this context i shortened
context to see TX but this little see
flag in in map expert and in most
experts throughout the compiler is just
used to decide if we were in a statement
which is closure line compilers way of
saying you were an expression in a do
like a function body or a let body or an
explicit do but you're not the last one
then you're you must be there for side
effects or just for fun but we're going
to discard the value so that's what that
that gen pop is just emitting a bytecode
to say throw that away we're not using
it we are not in the statement context
in our method we're going to use that
value it's going to be the return type
of our function so our map expert is
emitted as by code so our function is
compiled and we have so what's been done
you know I only showed you the map
expert bit which is the the last part of
what's on screen right now the stuff
that I didn't show you included some
things around static well just writing a
class in the first place and generating
these constants for the literal key
words that appear in the code so what
you end up with is the equivalent of
this Java code almost exactly i guess i
renamed the static the public static
final constants to you know the things
that we're using them for but here's
what you end up with you end up with a
class that extends closure length a
function and it just overrides the
invoke method with one argument and as
we just saw in the bytecode emission it
calls our team a puny keys it passes an
object array it uses it has static
constants for those two keywords
those aren't there's no interning or
looking up a registering of keywords
happening at runtime and and that's all
there is to it you know the one argh to
the function becomes the fourth element
in the four element objector ray so now
we get to run time so somewhere in some
other closure function there's going to
be some closure code where someone calls
our M function passes at a value inside
that function there's going to be the
equivalent you know it will have emitted
it's owned by code using a bunch of
experts that I didn't show you but you
know it'll be an invoke expert we did
see where invoke expert is kind of the
final fall back of analyze seek so that
invoke is going to end up generating
bytecode equivalent to this little line
of Java code this Java expression it's
that function will have a static
constant for the global VAR that M has
been assigned to it's going to call get
raw root on that VAR that's just reading
a volatile filled out of the bar and
then it's going to call that one
argument invoke method you know the
bytecode it's the invoke interface by
code passing that one argument so map
unique keys is going to run and all map
unique keys does it says okay if you if
there were no objects then that's an
empty map if there were less than 16
things then there you know eight or
fewer entries so we'll create a new
persistent array map and we've already
seen what creating a new persistent
array map does almost nothing otherwise
we'll create a persistent hash map and
it's maybe not important but you know
maybe useful to keep in mind as the kind
of thing you have to keep in mind when
you're looking at closure code this map
unique keys being called here at the
bottom here you know that that's for
element array is right there in the
bytecode it's always going to be a for
element array
so map unique keys is going to be
trivial from that call sitemap unique
keys is going to be trivial for hotspot
to in line to just creating you a new
persistent array map it doesn't have to
keep checking the size of that array
over and over again it's going to be for
from that call site and and that kind of
thing that you know in lining of the
checks that you see in the Java methods
that underlie the closure runtime
happens a lot which is you know one of
the reasons that our code runs fast
enough to use and that's it so you know
and the result obviously is this little
map a positive structure of a talk
that's all about what goes on inside
where you're following a sort of trivial
function along the way doesn't end with
much of a punch line but we got our map
as expected so what questions do people
have I guess I should look at time but
we're great on time yeah the the
question was what was the big motivation
or the biggest motivation for me to dig
into this I guess there were kind of two
things one was the local user group in
Austin was sort of desperate for people
to volunteer to give talks and I thought
oh this might be interesting but the
other thing was you know so i use
closure in my day job and it became
apparent to me that there were people
using closure every day including myself
who you know pretty experienced
developers who you know kind of know
their tools or think they know their
tools but there's some really
interesting stuff happening at the heart
of closure which we were using every day
that we didn't fully understand and
there were cases I mean there was one
case where somebody expressed a concern
about the performance overhead of a
function that returns an anonymous
function or something along those lines
I think it might have been about a call
to partial or comp or something like
that
and the concern was you know at runtime
every time you know we call that thing a
class being created to represent the the
new function we just created and I
thought that doesn't sound like probably
what's happening it doesn't seem like
you should need to do that and I at the
repple it's actually pretty easy at the
repple to figure out like okay well if I
call partial several times with the same
number of arguments am I getting a new
class back every time and pretty quickly
figured out no I'm getting back instance
is it the same thing over and over again
so that's good so we shouldn't be
worried about that but but it did seem
it was surprising to me that given how
long the team that I was working with
had been using closure we didn't know
the answer to that question off the top
of our heads and so that's sort of thing
concerned me enough that it seemed like
okay we should we should learn about
this like we should understand what goes
on in here well enough that we don't
need to go to the repple to figure out
what is going on we should be able to
look at the code and understand it
enough to know like yeah I understand
what I'm doing it right I'm am I taking
on generating a new class am I just
taking on creating a new instance of a
class that was already generated the
difference you know you shouldn't you
know optimize your code until you've
profiled at runtime but you should know
what's going on and so that that's why I
felt like it was worth worth the time in
trouble to kind of dig in and and start
to figure out at least how to find my
way around you know the closure
lang-java package yeah a lot of it or
you know there's a lot of interesting
stuff in there just the persistent data
structures or a whole or I suppose you
know maybe dozens of PhD projects in
there and I don't understand how they
work particularly you know I understand
how they work at the like I can draw you
know a few boxes about it but but I
couldn't create one I could probably ate
a list but but in any case so you know
that's interesting stuff there's also a
lot of stuff that's actually pretty easy
to follow java code but compiler is not
among that stuff compiler is not easy to
understand
and and so it seemed worth worth
studying one thing you'll if you've ever
opened up the closure Java source in you
know IntelliJ or whatever you might
notice that it'll tell you a lot of
things about like oh this method is not
called anywhere this method is not
called anywhere one of the reasons that
it thinks that is because a lot of those
methods are called the way that I showed
you via ASM by code that's generated at
load time and so intelligent know what
that methods used for you can't you know
the ID won't help you find it but it's
really important at runtime and gets
used constantly right on on VAR get raw
root as far as IntelliJ can tell is an
unused method but every VAR reference in
your code calls get raw route it's a
really important function so you know
IntelliJ is really good at understanding
Java code but even it can't make much
sense of compiler so I think it's
something you know we should at least
feel comfortable kind of peeling back
the covers and taking a look at what's
in there to figure out what's going on
yes
well in one kind of small way and I so
here's a few tangents if there weren't
questions this is the way to fill a
little extra time or we're doing pretty
well so skipping down to this third
tangent though it was interesting to me
to discover that there's no supported
API for creating small maps with compile
time constant keys as efficiently as the
literal map syntax so you know there's
like closure core a map and I wasn't
using closure core a map all over the
place but it was a surprise I mean not a
huge surprise but kind of a surprise to
me to find out it's not just were dear
it's also actually slower at runtime it
uses this create as if by a soch method
that kind of goes out of its way to I
wouldn't say goes out of its way to be
slow but there's a big comment and there
about why it why does a bunch of work
that you don't think it should be doing
so that was interesting to me right like
the literal isn't a bit literal is worth
using and like there was one case
there's a library we use where we have a
macro for just generating a small map
like if you have locals a B and C you
can just say k VF I ABC and that expands
into a map with keyword a value a key
would be whatever and that was using I
think that was using closure core hash
map or close recorder a map on remember
and part of the reason is you pass it an
odd number of arguments sorry let me
think about this you pass it you know it
takes an unknown number of arguments
those rest args are collected into one
local VAR and then if you were to try to
write a macro that had curly braces and
then you just in lined your rest args
there then the reader would read that
curly brace and then find your one rest
args inlining thing and say that's an
odd number of forms that's not a valid
map and so it was using hashmi a closure
core hash map or a map and but it was
you know suffering it run time because
of that and so we changed that
back row around to just return a map
rather than evaluating you know sort of
using the more awkward way of writing a
macro where instead of just syntax
quoting something that's just the code
you want to run instead you just create
a data structure and that data structure
is going to be what the reader gets as a
result I think that's maybe the only
specific thing has changed as a result
of this so far but at least now I sort
of know my way around so maybe they'll
be more in the future any yes ah no but
but I don't mean that as a joke I mean
the you know that I at no point in
looking through the compiler or I don't
there's nothing I can recall offhand
where I was like oh jeez come on guys
you know I mean obviously you know it's
a huge java file there's a lot of things
you know sort of obvious suggestions you
could make about ways to improve it in
some way you know make it more you know
supportable easier for people to change
but we don't really want people to
change it that much and it it does its
job so I would certainly be more you
know if if I found out oh look there's
some issue that no one's working on and
it's a really you know simple but but
it's in compiler so no one wants to
touch it type bug maybe I would you know
try to take that on I'm not aware of any
of those and you know there are people
you know keeping a pretty close eye on
those kinds of bugs and making sure they
get a dress pretty quickly so that's one
thing you know although this talk might
equip people a little bit better to go
playing around with closure line
compiler I don't want to suggest that
you know they're hoping to get a lot of
pull requests or patches on it because
it's it's a pretty carefully carefully
built piece of code but you know if you
see an issue if you run into an issue by
all means jump in there yes
this hasn't changed the way that I write
Java no I mean I think you know spending
some time reading the Java code for
closure it does make you kind of
re-evaluate a lot of the things that as
a Java developer you consider like this
is you know the way it ought to be done
you know for you know like there are a
lot of static methods in fact they're
almost all static methods I mean there
are also instance methods where it's
appropriate but there's a lot of cases
where there's just there's no you don't
need an object there you just need to do
a little piece of work on some data and
you know if it's pure then static
methods a good place for it but yeah I
mean I guess that's kind of all all I'd
have to say about that I I'm not totally
I don't remember I someone probably has
a schedule in front of them to the next
talk start at nine 950 okay anyway it is
940 i guess i can continue to take
questions if anyone else has questions
but i also want to let people stretch
their legs and use the restroom any
