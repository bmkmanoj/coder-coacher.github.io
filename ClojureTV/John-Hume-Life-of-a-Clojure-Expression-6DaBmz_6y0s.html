live in Austin Texas I work for drw
trading I played the drums and I'm here
to talk to you about closure internals
and the way I'm going to kind of walk
through that is following a life of a
closure expression so a few disclaimers
before we dive in I'm definitely not an
expert on compilers in general or the
closure compiler in particular if anyone
here is and I miss States something or
make a mistake and you think you can
correct me without being too disruptive
please feel free to do that if it would
take too long we can follow up
afterwards and all I'll write up and I
write a blog post or something
so what I'm gonna be showing you is a
bunch of closure internals and those
could change I think everything I'm
going to show you is pretty stable you
know given it they're a bunch of
production closure systems out there
obviously the maintainers are pretty
careful about what changes and what I'm
showing you is you know right down there
in the middle of stuff but it could all
change any time so hopefully this talk
won't be still in the next month
and I'm gonna show you a lot of code
mostly Java code not closure code and
I've kind of hacked up the excerpts in
all kinds of ways to fit them on the
screen and ignore things that are sort
of annoying details that we can gloss
over but I'm trying to at least you know
remain true enough to what's what's
actually out there that if you go look
at the real code
hopefully it'll look a little familiar
after this talk okay so what closure
expression are we talking about it's
this one so there's this simple function
but the expression we're really going to
focus on is this map literal that's the
body of this function it's got two
keyword keys and a static or a
hard-coded string value and takes its
its other valve from an argument to the
function so that context is is relevant
to what we're going to talk
about and I'm gonna talk go a little bit
into the details of that context but at
certain points I'm gonna hand wave and
say okay forget about that stuff let's
just focus on the map because there's a
lot a lot more goes into creating a
function then goes into just creating
the map at the center of it and we don't
have time and I don't even fully
understand all of it all right so really
it's the life of that one map literal
expression let me in the body of a
simple function and I'll talk a little
bit about some minor variations like
what might be different if that map were
just a constant what might be different
if one of the keys came from an argument
to the function instead of one of the
values and what might be different if it
had more than eight key value pairs
those all kind of take you down slightly
different roads so at a high level we're
talking about the R and the E and repple
so those things are exposed pretty
conveniently in closure core Reed and
closure core eval each of which are
basically just pass throughs to Java
classes there's a lisp reader read
method and a compiler eval method eval
is is a serious business
it basically breaks down or the chunks
that we're gonna spend most of our time
on are an analyze phase and then an omit
where you're emitting bytecode and then
we'll talk about what happens at runtime
when when that simple function actually
gets called so we'll get started so
close record read as I said is pretty
much just a pass through there won't be
much more closure code than this in the
talk so let's get into the Java okay so
this is a few little excerpts from Lisp
breeder Java that kind of gives you a
flavor of what goes on there so Lisp
reader has a static array of closure of
I FN s closure functions but
written in Java they're indexed by the
character that the reader will see to
say oh this is what you just ran into so
here's how to handle it and the one
we're most interested in or the only one
we're interested in today is the map
reader so the index into the array is
the char for the open curly brace and
here's all there is to map reader
obviously it calls out to some things
that are doing some some more meticulous
work but all the map all the map reader
has to do is read the list of things
that follows the open curly brace until
it gets to the closed curly brace make
sure it found an even number of things
and then call this our team map method
and here's all that is takes an array of
objects as its input now if that thing's
empty gives you back an empty map if
that thing's 16 or fewer items you know
that would be eight entries in a map
then it gives you a persistent array map
the create with check and if it's a
larger a persistent hash map create
would check ours is small so we get into
persistent array map create with check
with check just means make sure you
don't have duplicate keys so it checks
to be sure you don't have duplicate keys
and then returns a new persistent array
map and all that does is wrap a
persistent array map object around this
array of objects that you know what a
persistent array map does is creates a
map interface with just an array
underneath so at that point we have an
array map we don't have the array map
we're gonna have when we call our
function we have an array map of unev
alyou ated code forms so it's got a
keyword and then a string and then a
keyword and then a symbol and it doesn't
know what that symbol is it doesn't know
where its value might come from someday
it's just the same thing you would get
in the repple if you just took our code
and put a quote in front of it you know
it's the whole expression the whole
function you've got a list and it's got
two symbols and then a vector and then
and and nothing has happened yet to you
know make any sense of that but this is
important because this is where you know
so closure is homo a conic so this is
the stage where you're familiar with all
these types from run time and you can
write macros that manipulate this code
in any way you like using those types
the same type to use at runtime and then
continue processing to have the code
eval which is obviously pretty powerful
so we move on to eval so closure line
compiler as I've already mentioned is
serious business
it's it's a lot to take on so rather
than just jumping right into eval here's
sort of a pseudo code of if you didn't
have to worry about a lot of annoying
details here's all there is to eval you
get a form you macro expand that form
you analyze that form into a compiler
expert and then you evolve at expert so
let's we'll talk a little more about
expert since that's sort of the only new
thing here we're not gonna delve into
macro expand so what's an expert expert
is an interface inside compiler that
doesn't have much to it so you can eval
an expert that means evaluate this thing
and give me back the resulting value
that's gonna be a value you you know
that's gonna be the return value of a
calling closure core eval that's gonna
be you know a value you know how to use
at runtime the kind of value you see all
the time an expert can also be emitted
what that means is writing Java bytecode
using these various arguments
none of which we're gonna talk much
about but we'll talk a little about them
that's a little more that's the kind of
thing you never see at runtime you never
you almost never have to worry about
that as a closure programmer but it's
interesting and
you know it might become relevant to you
one day and then it's got a couple
methods about java classes that the
compiler can use to avoid reflection and
where you get experts from is often most
expert implementations expose a static
parse factory method that takes a form
of the type that's appropriate for the
type of expert well we'll see in a
minute how that gets called for most
special forms there's an interface
called I parser that just has a parse
method and yeah and I think there may be
only one
I think the FN expert may be the only
exception to those two ways of creating
an expert but it doesn't really matter I
hope or I just decided that I just
decree that it doesn't matter you have
to believe me okay so in in the real
world where you have to worry about a
lot of annoying details eval looks more
like this and I've put comments in to
sort of its intentional that this code
runs way off the right-hand side because
I don't want us to to read all the
details but I do want to step through
what eval does and so we can mostly I
think just read the the comments that I
put in there in some cases I've just
explained the code that's still there in
other cases I've replaced the code with
just a little explanation so macro
expand is more or less the first thing
it does I've chopped a bunch of stuff at
the beginning so now we've got a form
that's that's been macro expanded the
first thing we do is or that eval does
is if the form is it do it basically
unrolls that do and just pretends all
the stuff in the do is at the top level
so it just evals each form and then
returns the results of availing the last
form I couldn't tell you exactly why
that special case is important but I'm
sure somewhere in the get logs it's
hinted at at least if not explained so
not not interesting for our case though
then if the form is some funny little
bit of code that's not a deaf then eval
raps it in a zero arity function and
then invokes that function and this is
also not really relevant to our case but
there's not that much to it and I think
it's interesting to see that you know
closure line compiler could have access
to all sorts of weird private secret
convenient ways of doing things but the
way that it wraps the top-level random
bit of code in a zero arity function is
just to down here create a list and make
the first thing in the list FN star and
then put an empty vector and then put
the form and that's how you make a
function that's the same way you make a
function in your in your closure code
it's just a lot more awkward because
it's in Java so you know again and we
eval the results of that and eval
function you know an FN is going to give
you back a function that you can invoke
so that's what this thing does and then
finally we get to sort of the standard
happy path where the thing your eval
your eval
you know your own source files most of
what your eval is going to be top level
forms that are Deaf's
and this looks you know almost as easy
as the pseudocode you just analyze that
form and then eval the expert you got
back from calling analyze so I want to
sort of check in on our simple code that
we were sending through the system so
that macro expand right at the beginning
depending on how well you know closure
you may you know have learned a long
time ago
definite just a macro that makes it more
convenient to define functions but it
just expands into more or less def and
that's our name and then the FN special
form or pseudo special form for for our
function so the reason I want to show
this is because we're gonna focus as I
go through the analyze path
we're gonna focus a little bit on each
of these things that need to be analyzed
there's the Deaf seek so when I say the
Deaf seek I mean the list that has deaf
at the beginning of it and then there's
the FN seek the list that has FN at the
beginning of it and then there's our map
and that's where we'll go into the most
detail neither to all hand wave away at
a certain point okay so we come in to
analyze and analyze basically has this
form pretty much throughout I've removed
a whole lot of cases that we're not
going to run into in our code but if it
looks at the type of the form and if
that form is a symbol then there's an
analyzed symbol method for that if that
form is a key word then there's a
register keyword to handle that if it's
an instance of I seek meaning it's a
list then there's an analyze seek that
we'll go into more detail on if it's an
I persistent map then here's that static
parse method I mentioned so map expert
has a parse method that creates a map
expert and so you know in in that case
analyze is going to return that map
expert or it's going to return whatever
is returned by map expert parse which
actually may not be a map expert so well
we're gonna I'm not gonna go into
symbols or keywords but I am gonna go
into analyzing sequences and the map
expert path so analyze seek so it's a
list so you know you kind of know what
to expect from a list it's generally
going to be you're calling a function we
don't have to worry about its a macro
anymore because we macro expanded
already so again it's so I've removed
some things but not actually many things
you know where's this analyzed there are
a lot of other things in this big if
else--if else--if analyze seek you know
it does some checks for no it checks to
see if your form is being has inline
metadata which I'm not going to go into
it any more length but that's a thing to
learn about and then it says okay well
are you the f
in special form if so there's a special
parse method just for FNX / because
functions have names that get kind of
shoved down into them from the context
where they're created so if you've ever
if you've ever seen a closure stacktrace
which you probably have you've probably
seen your method names in there so you
know your method was just deft as a
top-level var but via this name being
able to get shoved down in there from
the DEF CON text that's why you end up
with a class that's named after the var
that your function was assigned to you
know you might intuitively think you
know how does the right hand somehow the
right hand side of you know more or less
an assignment has to know that it's
being assigned to this name for the
class to have that and DEF is doing that
trick for you anyway we're not going to
look into F n expert parse though so
then we check to see if it's so FN
expert is a special form or rather F n
star is a special form all the other
special forms if I remember right all
the other special forms are in this
specials map and so we look up in the
specials map to see if our op is one of
those specials and our def is going to
be in that map and if it is you know the
parser that's in that map for def gets
called and that's what gives you back
your Def expert we're not going to delve
into the parsing of a def expert and
then finally if it wasn't a special it
wasn't the F n special form it wasn't
one of the other special forms that has
an AI parser then I guess that must be a
function you're calling so you get an
invoke expert and we parse that we're
also not going to delve into that this
is where I wave my hands and say okay
there's a lot of code that we're not
gonna look at today but you'll recall
that the the pattern was we analyzed and
we analyzed a form we get back an expert
we call eval on that expert so when you
evolve at FX / it evals it's an it
expression that's going to be our
function when you eval the F n expert
it's going to compile
klas representing that function the
first time it gets evil and and it's so
it's going to compile that class into
the dynamic class loader and make it
available so that's going to be
interesting and we're gonna we're not
going to look at all the details of what
FN expert does but we're gonna look at
what our map expert does when you when
you get there so each expert in the body
of the function is going to be analyzed
and then emitted and so we'll talk about
omitting a little bit but we won't look
at the code so on to map expert parse
you'll recall here you know we said okay
we had a couple of sikhs and we went
down the analyze sikh path if we had a
map in which we do in the body of our
function we get to map expert parse so
here we are
so i've i've cut out everything almost
everything but the parse method from map
expert and we'll see the rest on in a
couple slides maybe the next slide so
the parse method of map exper kind of
just does this little boring dance where
okay it's got it has a a4 so the form
that it's being parsed is the persistent
array map that we created back in the
reader so we're going to iterate through
that map one entry at a time each entry
is gonna get analyzed into an expert so
here you see each key and valued gets
analyzed into an expert and we're going
to throw those on to a key valves vector
that that is the only instance field of
map expert so what we're doing is
building up a vector that we can then
use to create a map expert so we get a
map expert and now I've left out the
details but there's some some special
cases so after after analyzing all the
key valves it runs through and figures
out okay are all those Keys unique and
are they all constants
are all the vowels also constants and I
think it just sets a few boolean to keep
track of those things and then depending
on how that all came out there are a few
special cases so we create this map
expert but then so then the things that
checks for that I'm not showing you the
details of where well is there metadata
attached to this map if so then it's
gonna map wrap a meta expert around the
map expert and return that if they're
non unique keys it's gonna blow up but
we've already seen a couple of checks
for that so hopefully it didn't it
didn't happen
although I actually sorry I know that's
not true
the the checks earlier we're looking at
the code forms to be sure that they were
unique two of those code forms could
conceivably have been analyzed in two
equal values in which case your keys are
not unique and then you have problems
and then if everything is constant it's
going to throw away this map expert
altogether and instead just create a
constant expert and that's going to
become just a static that gets loaded at
you know when the function that it's
that it appears in is loaded as a class
that's gonna be loaded once and they'll
be it'll just be returned when needed
nothing interesting will happen at
runtime so we return one of those
experts but in our case we're going to
return the map expert that has our -
well it's going to have you know we've
got this vector of key Val's it's gonna
have a keyword expert a string exper
another keyword expert and a local
binding expert so the results of the
analyse of that argument that becomes
the second Val in the map will be
recognized as a binding to a local and
so now we know where that we know what
that symbol is gonna be for and so as I
mentioned earlier the FNX / being eval
will call you know as part of writing
bytecode for a class to represent the
function it's going to call emit on our
map expert and so now we're going to
look at basically everything else that's
in map expert
it all fits so you've got a couple of
statics here at the beginning this map
method and map unique keys method we'll
see what those are used for in a second
but there so these are ASM the ASM by
code library is packaged along with
closure sort of repackaged along with
closure and these method objects our ASM
things and you can kind of guess they
represent Java methods and they're
parsed from a string that almost looks
like Java code so it's just a return
type a function name and a list of
argument types so we'll see how those
are used in a second so Amit so I've
left out the details of you're gonna
iterate through those key values and
you're gonna determine are all of those
keys constant and are all the constant
Keys unique and based on those two
bullying's you're gonna decide what to
do here down below so the first thing
you're gonna do regardless of those two
is so this is ASM stuff and this is you
know what you're generally going to see
in Amit methods in in compiler dot java
so method expert has a static method on
it called omit args as array so it
allows you to hand it a vector a
persistent vector of experts and it will
write the bytecode for putting an array
into your method and now depending on
those two flags we set if all the keys
are constant and unique or if you only
had one or no key value pairs then
you're gonna write a static method
invocation the class is going to be our
tea that's closure you know this our tea
type is just a constant for the closure
Lang our tea class and and you'll use
the map unique keys method you'll call
the map unique keys method on our tea so
that's this method up above
that we saw the static one static method
at the top if your keys are not all
constant unique values then we'll just
call our T map ours hours are constant
and unique so we're gonna go down the
map unique keys path at runtime and and
we'll look at that in more detail in a
second here and then this little is
context I shortened context to see T X
but this little C flag in in map expert
and in most experts throughout the
compiler is just used to decide if we
were in a statement which is closure
line compilers way of saying you were an
expression in a do like a function body
or a let body or an explicit do but
you're not the last one then you're you
must be there for side-effects or just
for fun but we're gonna discard the
value so that's what that that gen-pop
is just emitting a bytecode to say throw
that away we're not using it we are not
in the statement context in our method
we're going to use that value it's going
to be the return type of our function so
our map expert is emitted as bytecode so
our function is compiled and we have so
what's been done you know I only showed
you the map expert bit which is the the
last part of what's on screen right now
the stuff that I didn't show you
included some things around static while
just writing a class in the first place
and generating these constants for the
literal keywords that appear in the code
so what you end up with is the
equivalent of this Java code almost
exactly I guess I renamed the static the
public static final constants to you
know the things that we're using them
for but here's what you end up with you
end up with a class that extends closure
like a function and it just overrides
the invoke method with one argument and
as we just saw in the bytecode emission
it calls our T map unique keys it passes
an object array
it uses it has static constants for
those two keywords so those aren't
there's no interning or looking up or
registering of keywords happening at
runtime and and that's all there is to
it you know the one argick to the
function becomes the fourth element in
the four element object array so now we
get to runtime so somewhere in some
other closure function there's gonna be
some closure code where someone calls
our M function passes at a value inside
that function there's gonna be the
equivalent you know it will have emitted
its own byte code using a bunch of
experts that I didn't show you but you
know it'll be an invoke expert we did
see where invoke expert is kind of the
final fallback of analyze seek so that
invoke is going to end up generating
bytecode equivalent to this little line
of Java code this Java expression it's
that function will have a static
constant for the global var that M has
been assigned to it's gonna call get raw
root on that var that's just reading a
volatile field out of the bar and then
it's gonna call that one argument invoke
method you know the bytecode it's at the
invoke interface bytecode passing that
one argument so map unique keys is gonna
run and all map unique keys does it says
okay if you if there were no objects
then that's an empty map if there were
less than 16 things then there you know
eight or fewer entries so we'll create a
new persist in a Rhema and we've already
seen what creating a new persistent
array map does almost nothing otherwise
we'll create a persistent hash map and
it's maybe not important but you know
may be useful to keep in mind as the
kind of thing you have to keep in mind
when you're looking at closure code this
map unique keys being called here at the
bottom here you know that that's for
element array
is right there in the bike coat it's
always gonna be a four element array so
map unique keys is gonna be trivial from
that call sitemap unique keys is gonna
be trivial for hotspot to inline to just
creating you a new persistent array map
it doesn't have to keep checking the
size of that array over and over again
it's gonna be for from that call sight
and and that kind of thing that you know
in lining of the checks that you see in
the Java methods that underlie the
closure runtime happens a lot which is
you know one of the reasons that our
code runs fast enough to use and that's
it so you know and the result obviously
is this little map a positive structure
of a talk that's all about what goes on
inside where you're following a sort of
trivial function along the way doesn't
end with much of a punchline but we got
our map as expected so what questions do
people have I guess I should look at
time but we're great on time yeah the
the question was what was the big
motivation or the biggest motivation for
me to dig into this I guess there were
kind of two things one was the local
user group in Austin was sort of
desperate for people that volunteer to
give talks and I thought oh this might
be interesting but the other thing was
you know so I used closure in my day job
and it became apparent to me that there
were people using closure every day
including myself who you know pretty
experienced developers who you know kind
of know their tools or think they know
their tools but there's some really
interesting stuff happening at the heart
of closure which we were using every day
that we didn't fully understand and
there were cases I mean there was one
case where somebody expressed a concern
about the performance overhead of a
function that returns an anonymous
function or something along those lines
I think it might have been about a call
to partial or
or something like that and the concern
was you know at runtime every time you
know we call that thing a class being
created to represent the the new
function we just created and I thought
that doesn't sound like probably what's
happening it doesn't seem like you
should need to do that and I at the
repple it's actually pretty easy at the
repple to figure out like okay well if I
call partial several times with the same
number of arguments am i getting a new
class back every time and pretty quickly
figured out no I'm getting back
instances of the same thing over and
over again so that's good so we
shouldn't be worried about that but but
it did seem it was surprising to me that
given how long the team that I was
working with had been using closure we
didn't know the answer to that question
off the top of our heads and so that
sort of thing
concerned me enough that it seemed like
okay we should we should learn about
this like we should understand what goes
on in here well enough that we don't
need to go to the repple to figure out
what is going on we should be able to
look at the code and understand it
enough to know like yeah I I understand
what I'm doing here right I'm a my
taking on generating a new class am I
just taking on creating a new instance
of a class that was already generated
the difference you know you shouldn't
you know optimize your code until you've
profiled at runtime but you should know
what's going on and so that that's why I
felt like it was worth worth the time in
trouble to kind of dig in and and start
to figure out at least how to find my
way around you know the closure lang
Java package you know a lot of it or you
know there's a lot of interesting stuff
in there just the persistent data
structures or a hole or I suppose you
know maybe dozens of PhD projects in
there and I don't understand how they
work particularly you know I understand
how they work at the like I can draw you
know a few boxes about it but but I
couldn't create one
I could probably eight a list but but in
any case so you know that's interesting
stuff there's also a lot of stuff that's
actually pretty easy to follow java code
but compiler is not among that stuff
compiler is
not easy to understand and and so it
seemed worth worth studying one thing
you'll if you've ever opened up the
closure Java source in you know IntelliJ
or whatever you might notice that it'll
tell you a lot of things about let go
this methods not called anywhere this
method is not called anywhere one of the
reasons that it thinks that is because a
lot of those methods are called the way
that I showed you via ASM by code that's
generated at load time and so IntelliJ
doesn't know what that methods used for
you can't you know the ID won't help you
find it but it's really important at
runtime and gets used constantly right
on on var get raw root as far as
IntelliJ can tell is an unused method
but every VAR reference in your code
calls get raw root it's a really
important function so you know tell J's
really good at understanding Java code
but even it can't make much sense of
compiler so I think it's something you
know we should at least feel comfortable
kind of peeling back the covers and and
taking a look at what's in there to
figure out what's going on yes
well in one kind of small way and I so
here's a few tangents if there weren't
questions this is the way to fill a
little extra time we're doing pretty
well so skipping down to this third
tangent though it was interesting to me
to discover that there's no supported
API for creating small maps with
compile-time constant keys as
efficiently as the literal map syntax so
you know there's like closure core array
map and I wasn't using closure core
remap all over the place but it was a
surprise I mean not a huge surprise but
kind of a surprise to me to find out
it's not just wordier it's also actually
slower at runtime it uses this create as
if by a soch method that kind of goes
out of its way to I wouldn't say goes
out of its way to be slow but there's a
big comment in there about why it why
does a bunch of work that you don't
think it should be doing so that was
interesting to me right like the literal
isn't literal is worth using and like
there was one case there's a library we
use where we have a macro for just
generating a small map like if you have
locals a B and C you can just say kV fi
ABC and that expands into a map with
keyword a value a a key would be
whatever and that was using I think that
was using closure core hash map or
closure Cordrey map I don't remember and
part of the reason is you pass it an odd
number of arguments sorry let me think
about this you pass it you know it takes
an unknown number of arguments those
rest args are collected into one local
var and then if you were to try to write
a macro that had curly braces and then
you just in lined your rest args there
then the reader would read that curly
brace and then find your one rest args
inlining thing and say that's a number
of forms that's not a valid map and so
it was using a closure core hash map or
a map and but it was you know suffering
it runtime because of that and so we
change
that macro around to just return a map
rather than evaluating you know sort of
using the the more awkward way of
writing a macro where instead of just
syntax quoting something that's just the
code you want to run instead you just
create a data structure and that data
structure is going to be what the reader
gets as a result I think that's maybe
the only specific thing has changed as a
result of this so far but at least now I
sort of know my way around so maybe
they'll be more in the future any yes
ah no but but I don't mean that as a
joke I mean the you know that I at no
point in looking through the compiler or
I don't there's nothing I can recall
offhand where I was like oh geez come on
guys
you know I mean that obviously you know
it's a huge Java file there's a lot of
things you know sort of obvious
suggestions you could make about ways to
improve it in some way you know make it
more you know supportable easier for
people to change but we don't really
want people to change it that much and
it it does its job so I would certainly
be more you know if if I found out oh
look there's some issue that no one's
working on and it's a really you know
simple but but it's in compiler so no
one wants to touch it
type bug maybe I would you know try to
take that on I'm not aware of any of
those and you know there are people you
know keeping a pretty close eye on on
those kinds of bugs and making sure they
get addressed pretty quickly so that's
one thing you know although this talk
might equip people a little bit better
to go playing around with closure line
compiler I don't want to suggest that
you know they're hoping to get a lot of
pull requests or patches on it because
it's it's a pretty carefully carefully
built piece of code but you know if you
see an issue if you run into an issue by
all means jump in there yes
this hasn't changed the way that I write
Java no I mean I think you know spending
some time reading the Java code for
closure
it does make you kind of reevaluate a
lot of the things that as a Java
developer you consider like this is you
know the way it ought to be done you
know for you know like there are a lot
of static methods in fact they're almost
all static methods right I mean there
are also instance methods where it's
appropriate but there's a lot of cases
where there's just there's no you don't
need an object there you just need to do
a little piece of work on some data and
you know if it's pure then static
methods a good place for it but yeah I
mean I guess that's kind of all all I'd
have to say about that
ie I'm not totally I don't remember
someone probably has a schedule in front
of them to the next talk start at 9:00
9:50 okay anyway it is 9:40 I guess I
can continue to take questions if anyone
else has questions but I also want to
let people stretch their legs and use
the restroom any thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
