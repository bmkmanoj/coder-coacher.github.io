up on the slides without talking at
least a little bit about
of complexity I'm going to use this is
closure cons and we all like very finely
parsed definitions so when you talk
about complexity there are a lot of
different definitions available there's
an information theoretic definition
called Kolmogorov complexity how many
bits do you need to write the program to
output the complex system that you're
trying to create complexity theorists
like the folk at the Santa Fe Institute
they like to talk about the number of
parts in the system and the richness of
their interconnections chaos theory
people talk about the unpredictability
of the results so the sort of surprise
that you get when you actually run the
simulation and you see the output and
its sensitively dependent on initial
conditions I'm actually going to sort of
discard most of these definitions and
say for today we'll use the more or less
intuitive definition of complexity
something that's hard to understand it's
got a lot of stuff and you can't really
see how all the stuff is connected so
that's the definition that we're going
to use and to explore this I'm going to
start with a story we've all been here
or one of its equivalents something that
implements the Appleby's interface TGI
Fridays Chili's Max and Emmas Gordon
Biersch chotchkie's flingers one thing
you know is on the menu of all of these
is this dish chicken tenders and french
fries I have a seven-year-old daughter
who probably would have starved to death
if not for chicken tenders and french
fries now this dish is on the menu at
90% of restaurants that I go to actually
I just made that number up but it's it's
almost all of them even my local Mexican
restaurant El Toro has chicken fingers
and french fries on the menu it's not a
very Mexican dish but it helps bring the
kids in and the kids help bring the
families in now anytime something
becomes this ubiquitous it kind of
becomes invisible you wouldn't consider
it remarkable to find chicken fingers
French fries on the menu at a restaurant
but I actually think it's worth asking
how it got this way because it wasn't
always the case
that every restaurant in the world had
chicken fingers and french fries on the
menu so we know that these chicken
fingers don't actually come from
chickens they come from here the rise of
this kind of food supplier is actually a
big change if you went to a restaurant a
hundred years ago the menu was whatever
they had killed that day if someone had
come in with a couple of chickens and
sold them a couple of chickens then
chicken was on the menu until the
chickens got eaten well we know el Toro
doesn't kill their own chickens and as
it turns out
Cisco doesn't kill their own chickens
either we have to keep going a little
further upstream and we see this kind of
a place Cisco gets chicken tenders from
a warehouse this is actually a
refrigerated warehouse it's as big as
this hotel and it's kept below freezing
most of the time you hope all the time
but one never really knows in a
distribution center like this
Cisco brings together chicken fingers
from wherever they get them from
together with french fries and bagged
lettuce tomatoes ketchup and whatever
else and then they distribute them out
to restaurants so where we would like to
think that our food supply sort of looks
like this
you know we've got Applebee's and they
get food and they serve food this is
actually not the case
there is a much more intricate network
of companies bringing food to that plate
we can look upstream and see suppliers
for basically everything fryer oil fryer
baskets cutlery dishes cleaning products
print shops for the menus ink suppliers
to the print shops for the menus and so
on many of these don't even touch food
there's an outfit called centralized
supply chain services they
manage suppliers in the supply chain for
Applebee's so if you are a supplier it's
to your advantage to sign up with these
people otherwise you can't get into the
market if you're a franchisee it's to
your advantage to sign up with these
people because they've got enormous
buying power now they don't grow food
they don't make food they don't prepare
food they don't serve food but they sure
manage a lot of it like 95 million
pounds of chicken that's kind of a
staggering number it's hard for us to
visualize 95 million of anything so to
put it in perspective 95 million pounds
of chicken would make a cube of chickens
about the size of this Mesa that's not
very appetizing but it's certainly a lot
of chickens this outfit manages the
distribution of these chickens and if we
start mapping out what the supply chain
looks like it looks a lot less like food
to Applebee's and a lot more like this
complicated distribution network we've
got first tier of suppliers of
distributors people who actually put
things on trucks we've got truckers
we've got independent suppliers we've
got a second tier of people who manage
all of those services and supply the
distributor's we've got a third tier of
suppliers that are 10,000 miles away so
that we can get grapes and tomatoes in
the middle of the winter we've got a
fourth tier of financial services to
these people and derivatives on those
financial services and parasites upon
those somewhere out here way out at the
periphery we've actually got chickens
tomatoes and potatoes
and we've got software developers
providing services to all the rest of
this now the thing is you can go into
any business today and play this game so
you can go sit in your coffee shop and
look at every single thing in that
coffee shop and think about how it got
there
every bit of it goes through some
complicated upstream process every one
of these bubbles has their own upstream
supply chain and network all of this is
here to hit that that point at
Applebee's of serving my seven-year-old
daughter chicken fingers and french
fries there's a downstream as well so
anytime you get waste you have to
dispose of it but it turns out if you
get enough waste it becomes a resource
of its own so fryer oil now has an
entire industry devoted to the
collection of fryer oil and turning it
into biofuel so there are companies that
go out and collect the oil from the
restaurants there are companies that
make the equipment that helps the fryer
oil companies collect from the
restaurants there are monitoring tools
so there are mobile tank measuring
devices that will send an SMS alert when
the tank is sufficiently full that it
should be emptied and there again there
are you know cell phone companies that
supply services to deliver the SMS and
there are software developers who work
for the phone company to deliver the SMS
and some of those developers have kids
who eat chicken fingers and french fries
so this is this really intricate network
on both sides of that particular point
of the transaction and it's radically
different than it was just a hundred
years ago so it's worth asking how did
it get that way to understand how it got
that way
we need to go back to the 1970s and
1980s a pair of companies these two
companies whose names I won't say
allowed because they're highly litigious
they have lobbying groups and political
ties and they had found that they were
buying essentially all of the corn in
the US now they were buying this corn
largely on the basis of positive
externalities like subsidies for buying
corn that were put in place by the
government and then they had a positive
incentive to buy more corn and as I
bought more corn they got larger
subsidies which has allowed them to
lobby more and get more subsidies to buy
more corn even though the subsidies were
kind of meant for the family farmer the
family farmer hasn't really existed in
quite a while well it got to the point
where they were buying so much corn that
they couldn't sell it all as corn and
they had to start finding other ways to
create it and distribute it some of you
have read books like Food Inc Omnivore's
Dilemma in defense of food and so on
well so they created products like
high-fructose corn syrup and sort of
created this industry of restaurants to
dispose of the corn surplus by feeding
it to us and my seven-year-old daughter
in later days they started mandating
lobbying the government to mandate
certain degrees of ethanol production
from corn just to soak up some more of
the market so that the corn prices would
go higher so this is a pretty
interesting situation we've got this
complex of government and industry and
agriculture and if you're interested in
more of it Kurt I can wall wrote about
it in a book called the Informer it was
made into an indifferent movie this
funded the creation of us the this
distribution chain and the restaurant
industry and so on there's just one
problem with this explanation the
problem is that the explanation is
basically as humans were were
biased towards these kind of stories
were biased to believe narratives
we look for causality in everything and
we look for agency in everything the the
attribute of having an intention behind
it we frequently believe that large
consequences had to have large actions
and negative outcomes must have had
nefarious intentions so we look at
complex systems like this and we look at
a set of outcomes and we say it must
have been designed with intent we're
sort of psychologically hardwired to
believe in these things and we call this
teleology now I'll caution you that any
time someone tries to explain a complex
system with a simple narrative you're
being manipulated because complex
systems don't arise by design it's
virtually impossible to design a system
this complex and have it work at all we
know because we try to design simple
systems and they sometimes don't work at
all I'll give you an alternate
explanation for how this restaurant
system evolved and it goes something
like this
running a restaurant is a brutally
difficult business most of them fail in
the first three years so if you start
with a hundred restaurants like this
starting up in your typical city after
three years ninety five out of a hundred
of them will be gone well if you start
with one chain that hits on an
innovation that makes them just slightly
more likely to survive those first three
years then after the rest of them die
that chain now makes up a larger
percentage of the population it's much
more likely to spread
either through deliberate copying or by
that chain itself spreading and
reproducing through franchising and so
on so in the next generation when
another hundred restaurants start up
more of them are copying that innovation
and after the usual percentage of those
die
our innovator our upstart become
more prevalent in the population as a
whole now I haven't said that they're
any better I haven't talked at all about
the quality of their food all I've
talked about is their ability to survive
and it turns out in a business like this
survival is all it takes to spread your
view of the world through the population
I can give you another story that's sort
of along the same lines which is about
the very first technological revolution
way back the first technology was
agriculture and it happened more or less
by accident some grass produces more
seeds than others so if you have a
certain area of grass and you collect
all the seeds from it more of the seeds
are going to come from the plants that
produce more seeds so you take what
you've got for seed you eat a bunch of
it and then you plant the next season
you're planting a larger proportion of
seeds that came from plants that
produced a lot of seeds so that fall
when you harvest an even larger
proportion of those seeds are going to
come from the plants that produce more
seeds and without even trying to your
breeding for grass that produces more
scenes and give it a few hundred
iterations of that and you have created
a dominant and highly productive strain
of that grass and you probably give it a
special name and you build you know
towns and eventually cities around the
places where you can grow that no
intention is required in order to create
that kind of technology but what you do
set into play are a series of forces one
of them is variation some of the grass
produces more seed than other so that's
a variation across the population we are
iterating this process so we're taking
all the seed each year and we're
replanting a portion of it the next year
and we have a selection effect going on
so the grass that produces more becomes
more dominant
if you put these three forces together
you can create agriculture without
meaning to these are three of the forces
that create complexity and I'm going to
explore them in a little more detail
through the rest of this talk so
variation is just randomness in the
outcome of a process variation is
inevitable you actually can't prevent it
if you try to process engineers spend a
lot of time and effort trying to get the
drill to drill a hole in exactly the
right spot and there are entire books
written about how to correct for errors
when you find that the spot you've
drilled in isn't the spot you meant to
drill in we find variation at every
level from microscopic to galactic
mutations in DNA or of course one kind
of variation but we get other variation
just from vibrations affecting two
things that are near each other we can
see variation across a population where
we talk about a good is a which is the
characteristic that a variation across a
population mimics the variation that it
a single member would have over time so
hard drive manufacturers for instance
know that their drives fail at varying
times but they can't just test one drive
for the hundred thousand hours that
they're going to operate it so when they
sight a mean time between failure that's
like five years you know they didn't set
that drive spinning five years ago what
they've really done is gotten a thousand
drives set them all spinning for a month
and measured how many of them failed in
that month so they're assuming this
characteristic of ergodicity that I can
take the one month span of a thousand
and assume that's like you know running
one Drive for a thousand months we can
look at variation through time in which
case we talk about stochasticity a
process whose outcome is not certain and
this creates an asymmetry with respect
to time this is another one of those
things that's so fundamental it's sort
of invisible like you know we know the
past
it happened we don't know precisely
what's going to happen in the future we
only have some probability the next
force is selection so we have some set
of different samples or specimens and
we're picking out which ones we're going
to keep and we're discarding the others
so selection seems like it's you know
obvious and tautological but it happens
at many different scales and levels so
one kind of selection is natural
selection
you know competitive or survival all of
us here are the product of tens of
thousands of generations of successful
badasses who lived long enough to
reproduce so that's that's saying
something right selection operates at
higher levels as well or larger
structures so we have some deliberate
selection every kind of process
engineering loop is about selection we
can talk about the plan do check act or
Deming cycle and that's a selection you
are selecting which of the variations of
your process you want to keep and
enforce and other variations you're
going to stop doing if you're of the Six
Sigma type you've got the dimeric define
measure analyze implements control I
think I can never remember that one
where again we're trying a bunch of
different things and we're going to keep
some process changes in the hopes that
they're improvements and we're gonna
discard others I think we also have a
type of genotype phenotype selection
that operates on whole companies so the
genotype is like DNA the phenotype is
like the full grown organism within a
company the DNA is the ideas in the
heads of the people about how to create
a company and what it means to organize
a group of people to accomplish
something that organization the people
and their structure and the tools they
use is the the expression of those ideas
and so it's the
the phenotype and we can say that those
get selected for as well some succeed
some don't
hopefully the ones that succeed are the
ones that get selected and copied we've
all seen memes as the image macros
floating around the net the original
idea of the meme was just an idea that
was sort of self-contained used a human
as a host and really wanted to get
selected and copied and so the most
successful memes were those that you
were most likely to tell to someone else
and so those were the replicators in
fact I'm going to infect you all with a
mimetic virus right now if you don't
want to be infected plug your ears
there's this thing called the game some
of you just lost any time you think
about the game you have lost the game
this is really popular among middle
schoolers now this meme is in your head
some of you will feel compelled to
repeat it to someone else
thereby spreading the meme so that meme
is optimized for selection the next
force is iteration when we talk about
that that point between the past and the
future there's an event events usually
don't happen just once sorry
events happen just once but a process
typically continues and so when we talk
about a system anything that persists
long enough to be recognized as a system
happens more than once
it keeps consuming inputs it keeps
producing outputs and it keeps going
around this iteration typically a system
that iterates faster will tend to adapt
to its changing circumstances better
than one that iterates slower this is
the entire thesis behind agile software
development and the OOD a loop and
maneuver warfare so far these forces are
pretty easy to recognize
anyone who's a student of neo-darwinian
ism has probably already seen all of
these things we're now getting to the
difficult ones the ones that people
don't like to think about as much are
the ones that present larger challenges
if you're trying to design systems
coupling is one of these so the idea of
coupling is that the output of one event
or process is the input to another one
as coupling creeps in in a lot of
different ways we we talk about coupling
in our code but I'm talking about
coupling in the more general sense and
I'll give you a couple of examples where
we're coupling can be a real bear
there was an airliner crash that was
caused by coupling between the
hydraulics and the coffee pot you
probably wouldn't design an aircraft so
that its flight control system was
sensitive to the coffee pot in the
galley
but what happened was this particular
coffee pot had a arc in the brewer that
basically melted a hole in the coffee
pot and spilled coffee down the back of
the galley the back of the galley
happened to back up to the cockpit and
there were a whole bunch of wires
flowing through there the coffee
spilling into the bulkhead shorted out
the wires took out the hydraulics and
the plane crashed this is a form of
coupling these two systems that should
have been independent were coupled by
their shared use of that bulkhead
another slightly more uplifting example
of coupling
and and what a demonstration that
coupling is really Universal comes from
Saturn so there is a moon of Saturn way
way out past the most visible rings
called Phoebe and Phoebe is being
ablated by sunlight so the solar wind is
hitting Phoebe and knocking particles
off of the surface it's a small moon
these particles are forming Saturn's
largest and most tenuous ring it's
absolutely enormous we can't really see
it very well but Cassini has detected it
it's many times larger than the visible
rings the material from that moon being
eroded away gets more pressure from
sunlight and it gets tidal forces from
Saturn itself that causes it to slowly
spiral inward towards Saturn itself
before it gets there some of that
material is being swept up by another
moon called Iapetus Iapetus is tidally
locked so it's always facing the same
direction meaning it's always the same
side of Iapetus that's facing into this
dust as it's going through its orbit as
a result my appetize is dark on one side
and light on the other side it looks
sort of like a baseball if you took the
two pieces of leather and just colored
one in with a sharpie now think about
the the coupling that's happening here
we've got gravitational coupling we've
got radiation from the Sun we've got
tidal forces and we've got a pair of
moons that are millions of miles apart
but our transferring material between
them so I tell you that coupling is
everywhere in the universe we draw
boundaries around our systems and say
this is inside and this is outside those
boundaries are an abstraction it's a
model of the system and we know that all
models are wrong even though some are
useful your system is coupled to
everything else now it's really hard to
design a system that includes everything
else in the universe right it's a sort
of a Dirk Gently approach so we draw
these boundaries and we pretend the
the rest is uncoupled but I was part of
a company back in 1998 that had a model
of the way the financial system worked
that assumed certain things were not
coupled it assumed that the market was
an infinite sink for volatility and that
the things they were doing didn't affect
the market it turned out they were wrong
and they lost something like six billion
dollars over a couple of months I had to
get bailed out by the Federal Reserve
and they were kind of the biggest
headline grabbers until Enron took the
front page
thanks Enron so a coupling is everywhere
and whenever you think that you're
dealing with an environment that's an
infinite sink for energy for materials
for information it isn't the next kind
of force is constraint and this is the
one none of us like humans do not like
constraints but the truth is that
unlimited processes only exist in
mathematics even in our field in
software there's a limit to the size of
the number we can represent I know we're
using closure we get more digits than
everyone else but there's still a limit
right there's a finite amount of RAM in
that computer there's a finite amount of
RAM plus disk in that computer it's big
but it's finite we run into physical
limits all over the place
heat entropy bit density food supply the
amount of energy inputs you can get in
one of the constraints on how big we can
build skyscrapers is how large the
footprint of the skyscraper is and how
many pipes we can get up for water and
down for sewage like there's a limit to
how tall we can make a building based on
how much crap has to go in and out of
the building
it's often not the variable that you
expect to be a constraint that ends up
being your limiting constraint it's been
said that one of the reasons AT&amp;amp;T
invented the computer was to create
phone switches because they had these
models of of people and phone calls and
they were looking at how rapidly phone
calls were ramping up and projecting
that they would need basically 50% of
the population of earth to be telephone
operators well the other 50% was
ordering pizza and who's going to make
the pizza then we have a lot of
companies that project unlimited
compound exponential growth over time
I'm sorry but these companies are
deluding themselves you can't have
unlimited exponential growth over time
if you took a company like oh say a
large Minneapolis based electronics
retailer they're projecting eight
percent year-over-year growth in their
sales well if you take that and you
match it up against US GDP and the 2.4
percent that the Bureau of Economic
Analysis is predicting you find that in
the year 21 17 that company's revenue is
going to exceed the entire total of the
US GDP that's probably not going to
happen actually somewhere in the 22
hundreds their revenue would exceed the
entire GDP of planet earth also probably
not going to happen
we hit constraints we talked about
information density and Moore's law but
there's actually a limit to the
information density of space itself it
turns out if you have a cubic centimeter
about that big much more appealing than
a Mesa of chicken I think a cubic
centimeter can hold at most 10 to the
66th bits of information and that's
actually a law of physics as best we
know
you won't be able to reach that 10 to
the 66th because unfortunately whatever
medium you're using to store it will
cause that cubic centimeter to turn into
a little black hole before you can reach
that limit but the good news is the
surface of that black hole can store 10
to the 66 bits it will make your laptop
a little heavier though so we've got
these five forces I call them the neg
entropic dynamics which is a kind of a
fun name but basically these are the
things that allow us to persist far from
thermodynamic equilibrium I'm pretty
happy about living far from
thermodynamic equilibrium I intend to
keep doing it as long as possible but
these are the things that also allow us
to temporarily defeat the second law of
thermodynamics the one that says entropy
always increases right now we have an
extremely improbable configuration in
this room right the odds of this
configuration happening are ridiculously
small astronomically small but we know
entropy is increasing so something must
be happening that's causing us to have
this low entropy state right now and so
some people are saying we should regard
the Sun not as a source of energy but as
a source of low entropy arriving at
earth and the backside of the earth is
radiating away higher entropy out into
space that's kind of a nice view I like
that as you know the Sun is an entropy
sucker and the rest of space is where we
dump our entropy with these five forces
we can start combining them in different
ways and seeing what we get so we might
not always have all five of them as the
dominant factors so let's say we're
gonna look at iteration variation in
selection well this gives you biological
evolution or it gives you web businesses
where we're very rapidly trying a bunch
of different things and most of them die
out and the ones that don't die out get
Donegan actually this applies to any
business but it's particularly visible
in the web space because you know low
capital barrier low legal and technical
barriers and very very easy to copy good
ideas from elsewhere if we take coupling
and iteration we can get well coupling
more or less directly we can get a
population explosion that's not a dirty
joke people there's a book called the
logic of failure that talks about
experiments with trying to get people to
adjust complex systems and they set up a
simulation of an African village that
was raising some grain had some cows had
some disease being propagated by tsetse
flies sorry to whoever's on the
microphone there I promise not to say
tsetse flies too often and they tried
getting experts to adjust the parameters
of this model and apply interventions
experts like people who run Doctors
Without Borders and other
nongovernmental organizations so these
people would apply an intervention to
this village like mosquito netting to
prevent the spread of disease which was
always followed by a population
explosion almost everything they did
allowed more of the children to grow to
adulthood allow the adults to live
longer allowed them to reproduce more
right up until the constraint kicked in
at which point the population explosion
was always followed by disease famine
and collapse it turns out that people
are really awful at intervening and
complex systems we try to apply a single
variable intervention we want more grain
so we're gonna raise water from the
aquifer to irrigate the grain and so
that grain feeds more cows feeds more
people and then we run out of water and
everyone dies we want more cows so we
feed them more grain then we have
to feed ourselves and everyone dies we
give medicine so that the children
survived to adulthood they eat all the
cows and the grain and then everyone
dies the problem is that the constraint
always kicks in and the constraint makes
things go nonlinear so it's very common
to see a system that has some kind of
smooth exponential behavior up to a
point it goes very chaotic and nonlinear
and then typically either collapses
completely or snaps into a different
stable state for some period of time
this is known in the field as a
catastrophy manifold which is another
great name a catastrophy manifold just
means I'm measuring some variable that
has you know one of two possible
metastable states that it's going to be
in and I can't necessarily predict in
advance which one we're going to land in
if you were to look at the Dow Jones
Industrial Average since about 2008 it
strongly resembles a system that's hit a
constraint is in the metastable state
and is getting ready to either collapse
or to snap to some new metastable value
for a period of time by the way this
this type of system comes up very often
when you've got coupled nonlinear
partial differential equations so I'm
going to teach you how to solve coupled
nonlinear partial differential no I'm
not gonna do that I can't I can't
possibly do it justice and I don't have
any cloture code for it if we take
variation selection and coupling we get
something called the black Scholes
formula back when I worked for this
finance company I actually reported to
the shoals of black Scholes he was my
supervisor I saw him twice in a year
that I worked there he was busy off
receiving the Nobel Prize and things
like that so he did a lot of delegation
black Scholes is the option pricing
formula that says if I have a stock and
I know that stock is going to fluctuate
and if I know roughly how
much it's going to fluctuate then I can
take the number of days between now and
when some event has to happen with the
stock and I can just assume that on day
one it goes up by that amount or it goes
down by that amount and I take both of
those outcomes and on day two I say if
it went up on day one where does it go
up from here or where does it go down
from here
that's all it is you'll easily recognize
this as a tree laid on its side and they
won the Nobel Prize for this because
they were the first ones to write it
down and they did it all with
calculators instead of computers so you
know give him a little credit for that
this option pricing formula allowed this
whole range of financial derivatives
including the credit default swaps that
became infamous not too long ago so
black Scholes is a product of these
forces and occasionally they get
together and they produce black swans
Black Swan of course being a really
unexpected event when all of a sudden
things that you thought were not
correlated become correlated and all
start moving in the wrong direction okay
so we've got these forces and I've
talked a little bit about how we can
combine them and I think when I look at
the various methods and processes that
I've seen over the years I think all of
them are sort of trying different
combinations of responses to these five
forces and so a few of them that I'm
going to explore here just a show of
hands for each one how many people are
familiar with each of these methods so
we'll start with lean either in
manufacturing or lean software okay
pretty sizeable number maybe
three-quarters how about the Theory of
Constraints excellent it's one of my
personal favorites agile development and
come on everybody's at least familiar
with it some of you just don't like
raising hands I can see what about Six
Sigma okay some of you had that
inflicted sorry for that
and finally maneuver warfare just a few
excellent for business destroy your
enemies just completely annihilate them
so as I've learned each of these over
the years I found that each one has a
certain ring of truth to some aspects to
it and as is suggested by my diagram I
feel that they have something in common
there's something sitting in the middle
of these and I can I can put a name to
that I can label that as complexity
theory because I think each of these
deals with those five forces but they
deal with them differently they
emphasize different aspects so let's
look at these forces and think about how
each of these methods responds to them
my purpose in teaching you this is so
that you can synthesize your own methods
out of these and think about where each
of these methods is going to break down
in the things that it does not consider
so we'll look at Six Sigma Six Sigma
tries to take advantage of variation in
the sense of deliberate variation so
you're going to introduce some
variations in processes measure them
select the ones that work and then
iterate the process done well Six Sigma
should result in this cycle of
continuous improvement Six Sigma has
sometimes gotten a bad name because
people will report a lot of paper gains
that don't really show up in the bottom
line of the company and I believe the
reason for that is because it doesn't
have any way of incorporating constraint
and coupling and so you may report some
paper gains that this particular process
is now you know a hundred and eighty
percent more efficient but this process
is consuming an input that's not being
produced fast enough and so you can be a
lot more efficient but it doesn't matter
you don't have any inputs to work on or
conversely you can be ten times more
efficient at getting invoices out and
yet the people who pay you still take 90
days to pay and so you've optimized five
minutes down to one minute and then you
wait 90 days to collect the money
you haven't really helped so by ignoring
the coupling and constraint
I think Six Sigma is incomplete maneuver
warfare is particularly interesting not
to many of you are familiar with it so
I'll describe a little bit about
maneuver warfare this is an idea that
comes from of all places an Air Force
colonel and flight instructor who for a
time actually had a statue in the US
Marine Corps Academy now I don't know
some of you may be familiar with rivalry
between the services the idea of having
an Air Force colonel in the Marine Corps
kind of weird what he came up with was
this idea that you don't actually need
to destroy your enemy's forces in order
to win that in fact it's better to win
by dislocating your enemy's forces from
the so called centers of gravity so if
your enemy's forces are way away from
the capital and you can get in between
them and the capital of the country then
you're likely to be able to take over
the capital this is in opposition to the
older idea of warfare that basically
said warfare is about the battle and you
will win if in the battle you destroy
more of your enemy's forces than they
destroy of yours
well that battle approach was kind of
costly it gave us things like trench
warfare in World War one the idea with
maneuver warfare is to sow uncertainty
and confusion among your enemies to
cause them to unravel in fear but
creating ambiguous threatening or
uncertain situations you can probably
see how this is more applicable to
business than like going out with
snipers and shooting your competitors so
maneuver warfare takes this notion of
coupling and says I'm going to try and
create coupling to the environment both
vertically through my chain of command
and horizontally in the forces in each
unit so coupling to the environment
means this is the
observe orient decide act loop coupling
to the environment means observing
what's actually going on attempting to
reconstruct an accurate perception of
the situation deciding what you're going
to do and then enacting it maneuver
warfare explicitly aims for nonlinear
outcomes and so the idea of coupling and
constraint is really central to this
whole doctrine the speed of iteration
enters in the decision loop the OOD a
loop and so many people have said that
if you can execute your OD a loop faster
than your enemy you are inside their
decision loop and you are certain to win
it's not quite as simple as that
remember simple narratives of complex
situations means you're being
manipulated and then the notion of
selection applies in selecting your
actual objectives so you don't decide on
your initial objective until you've
started to contact the enemy and then
you flow like water through the weakest
points in his defenses okay leaving the
battlefield for awhile the Theory of
Constraints is much more about sort of a
manufacturing type of process so that's
where it comes from this is the notion
that in any process there is precisely
one step which is the constraint and if
that constraint could be increased you
could produce more of whatever it is
your process creates I actually think
all of agile development was an
application of the theory of constraints
under the assumption that software
development was the constraint in
producing software in many organizations
we've now removed that constraint by the
way I've seen development go fast enough
that the business actually didn't have
any new requirements
it does happen not all that common more
commonly the constraint moves downstream
so you produce software fast enough that
operations can't get it deployed so
you've moved the constraint to
operations or you produce software fast
enough that QA can't get it tested
fast enough you've moved the constraint
downstream at that point your best
option under the Theory of Constraints
is to slow down kind of counterintuitive
but it's more efficient for the
organization if you stop over producing
your output while someone else is slowed
down or well someone else is the
constraint some of you have heard me
talk about this book by Donald
Reinertsen called the principles of
product development flow second
generation lean something something one
of the reasons that I like this book so
much is that it actually takes account
of all five of these forces so it takes
some of the notions from lean
manufacturing lean software development
and so on
and it deliberately uses variation where
others try to eliminate variation Don
Reinertsen gives a talk there's a video
from go to Copenhagen that where he gave
a talk about asymmetric payoff curves
that in summary means if I vary the
process output in one direction I get an
increase in payoff if I vary it in the
other direction I get a decrease in path
when you've got that kind of a payoff
curve variation is your friend as long
as you're selecting things on the
right-hand side of that whole thing this
is as opposed to manufacturing type
organizations where lean came from that
said variation is always bad because
it's always a deviation away from the
desired output of the process
okay so extracting ourselves from those
processes for a few moments when we talk
about complexity we often talk about
complexity as a bad thing but like I
said I like existing far from
thermodynamic equilibrium and its
complexity that allows me to do that its
complexity that allows my seven-year-old
to get chicken fingers and french fries
which shall eat instead of enchiladas at
El Toro which she won't eat
so we dislike complexity in our code it
becomes suffocating it makes it
impossible for us to do things but I'm
pretty happy that my body is a complex
system we get resilience in complex
systems we also get really weird failure
modes sometimes I think the essence of
it is that complexity defeats our
ability to design systems there's been
some work looking at what it would take
to create ultra large-scale software
systems and their conclusions were all
biological in nature they essentially
said it's not possible for human minds
to design complex systems at ultra large
scale well
ultra large-scale when they wrote it
meant you know hundreds of millions of
machines connected to a globe spanning
network we're kind of there now
no one brain created it no one brain can
actually encompass it and so we have to
think about complex systems and how we
deal with and evolve and live within
them this is difficult because it's
complexity that makes our systems tend
to kick back and resist our attempts to
do things to them deliberately there's a
great book on this subject by John gall
called the system's Bible goal is the
person who said inside every complex
working system or sorry every complex
working system began as a small system
that worked I'm gonna look at one aspect
of how we can deal with complexity in
software development for just a couple
of minutes and that's the idea of queues
so queues come up between people when
we're
work and of course they come up between
machines when we're handing off work
there so queues have the effect of
slowing down feedback we're coupling
things together we're slowing down
feedback we are constraining the
throughput of a system so there's a
certain depth to a queue and for a piece
of work to get through the queue it's
got to get through the waiting time and
then through the processing time at the
end of it so it slows down the
throughput but it also has the effect of
damping variation so we sometimes think
we should eliminate queues and try and
get single piece flow through our system
anyone looking at Kanban for development
is looking at single piece flow but a
queue size of zero isn't always a good
idea a queue size of zero will tend to
amplify variation and create noise in
your system and this is known both in
the Theory of Constraints and and lean
manufacturing so I actually think you
want some cues in place but choose them
carefully and then you know watch their
their depth when we talk about
variability we've got that possibility
of an asymmetric payoff curve and this
is being explored by the folks who are
doing real options work different
processes that we've looked at have
different opinions on variation so the
Theory of Constraints says we don't like
variation we want to reduce it maneuver
warfare says we're deliberately trying
to create variation in our own side and
in the enemy side agile development
tries to deny variation we're going to
create a fixed iteration length we're
gonna estimate our cards and if they're
too big if they're varying too much
we're gonna chop them down into pieces
that are just small enough that we can
be confident in them Six Sigma is
definitely anti variation very clearly
lean generally is anti variation except
for Reinertsen Reinertsen interestingly
actually targets a 50 percent failure
rate on product development he says if
you have less failure rate than that
you're not creating the kind of
variations that could get a reinforcing
cycle going that would help you win in
the marketplace that reinforcing cycle
would look something like this we have
variation a variation in the the
processing sorry I'm just going to skip
this one this is the wrong diagram
ignore the visual if you have variation
in say motion of a particle say we've
got a particle in fluid and we give a
slight pressure to move in one direction
we're going to take the random movement
that the particle would normally have
the Brownian motion and we're going to
apply a bias to it when we do that we
can help move it in one direction and
we're effectively selecting which of
those variations we keep and which ones
we damp out so Reinertsen is view on
variation is we want to reinforce the
positive variations so I've covered a
lot of topics we've gone through time
and space we've gone out to the size of
a galaxy and we've looked at a coffee
pot in an airplane let's try and
synthesize some of this and see what we
can apply one of the key lessons of all
of this study and complex system is that
dynamic processes do not have goals
there is no objective in a system there
is no target point that it's trying to
get to we are the survivors of tens of
thousands of generations of badasses who
live to reproduce but we're not the
point of the process watch out for the
teleological explanations watch out for
someone who's trying to give you too
simplistic a narrative to explain a
complex system
we will see increase in complexity as
long as we've got that entropy gradient
to work on and anywhere we find an
entropy gradient we will find complexity
and of course survival of any individual
specimen in one of these samples is not
guaranteed some people will talk about
applying biological methods in software
development well what you have to watch
out for is that a lot of the variations
actually kill the host so it might not
be the right thing to try a hundred
different versions of your project and
then keep the one that works best we
have an option as as humans and
individuals to choose which specimen of
the organizations we participate in and
so we can move around and survive the
demise of one of the organizations but
the organizations are not all guaranteed
to survive we will see a kind of
evolutionary process among businesses
ones which are able to change and adapt
and take advantage of these forces
rather than being damaged by them will
continue and it's probably best for us
if we select which ones were part of and
so with that I hope you've enjoyed this
exploration I hope you've gotten some
interesting ideas and I thank you all
