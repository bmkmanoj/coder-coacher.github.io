games today thank you this is my first
conference I've ever been to so I'm
going to introduce myself here I am an
independent programmer in the Pittsburgh
area by my past life I did cryptography
steganography that kind of stuff so
inevitably after college I found myself
in Maryland working for the federal
government and two and a half years
working with them is enough to develop a
moral conscience and so I quit and that
is when I started using closure so these
are my projects Stuart was nice enough
to mention them that I don't actually
work on night web anymore you know it I
guess ironically is a tool to protect
you from government spying and well it
kind of flounder didn't really do much I
didn't get a whole lot of usage my fault
and I got really burnt out with crypto
stuff so I did something on a personal
level that I think a lot of startups do
when they fail does anybody know the
word I'm thinking of say it again
exactly I pivoted my life
so so I don't do crypto and I haven't
for like a year and a half now I don't
do that stuff anymore my new hobby is
teaching programming and the best part
about it is nothing to do with imparting
knowledge or any of that other stuff I
don't care about any of that what I care
about is that has nothing to do with
cryptography so so the three other
projects you see here are just stuff I
made for my students so I made knight
toad it's a IDE for beginners not a
whole lot to say about that it's you can
use it if you want whatever I date it
frequently from my users all four of
them or at least that's what the survey
and I don't actually think I have for
you I think I have more than four users
but the problem is that beginners do not
fill out closure surveys and so I am a
destined to be underrepresented in these
numbers I'm mostly mentioning this for
the sake of are because you
need to understand that Colin is not the
only one you should be worried about
it's a I'm the Dark Horse of closure IDs
the night course so to speak so yeah
anyway I use closure or sorry I use
night code to teach people closure in
Pittsburgh we call them Pittsburghers
and and some of them asked me to teach
them game development and there was no
closure library at the time for that so
I made one and then I made Knight mod
which is a tool that complements it
makes it easier for beginners all right
so you're caught up with the life of
Zack
so now let's talk about games I'm going
to start with more of a meta discussion
what I think game development can do for
closure for the closure community then
we'll get into the technical stuff game
development is a common way people get
into programming at least that's how I
got into it 12 years ago when I was 15 I
learned C++ and one of the very first
things I did was I made a game and I'm
curious how many people here started
programming by making a game one of the
first things not necessarily the first
thing but yeah that's a good number I
don't know how many it is but it's a
good number sorry to the people with the
motion the video you can't see so yeah I
think I think having a solid game
development story is just good for us it
gets a lot of newcomers into closure and
I think people from diverse backgrounds
to I think you know it's it's certainly
true that everybody plays games so
theoretically game development should be
able to attract the same you know broad
spectrum of humanity this summer I got
the chance to teach a closure game
development class at my local library
and so far the theory holds so we got a
good turnout got a variety of people
most of them had zero programming
experience at all except the little one
there I he was
really smart I don't know what's going
on there but everyone else was like was
completely new to programming and and
yeah my friends Chad and Felicia helped
me to organize it and we had a lot of
fun it's uh plays an Ambridge by the way
which is a small town north of
Pittsburgh
it's very blue-collar you know lots of
abandoned factories and a school system
is actually pretty good but they don't
have any dedicated programming classes
so also my neighbor has a mullet which
is something that still exists in
western Pennsylvania so so it's a great
town but the last place you'd expect a
close your game development class to be
held so if you can get people to show up
there you can pretty much do it anywhere
so that's what game development can do
for closure but let's talk about what
really matters here
what can closure do for game development
that's what the arrow means I'm not
trying to do any like cute high school
joke there and just saying so we I think
it's important to solve real problems I
think people too often do things purely
out of novelty you can find them all on
Hacker News but people who want to solve
real problems I think I'm in good
company here because a closure program
is tend to be very practical and to me
the biggest problem in games as a gamer
is triple-a games seem to be very stale
they seem to be rehash after rehash the
same old stuff the same plot lines
tropes and mechanics and of course with
slightly more polygons each year and
these are the sorts of games you want to
make there's not a whole bunch that I
can offer you I think that mainstream
game development tools are perfect for
solving the low-level problems that
these sorts of games have so of course
what I mentioned in our indie games I'm
interested in this this
relatively new category of games where
they have relatively simple graphics by
necessity due to you know their lack of
resources and as a result of that they
differentiate in other ways like
gameplay and artistic merit and that's
why I love them so much here you know
just obvious examples Bray and spelunky
you know the beautiful artistically but
what made them really unique was the
gameplay it was the time rewinding in
the case of braids and the randomized
level generation in spelunky so I mean
these are practically classics at this
point and you know more recent examples
you can see the pixels are actually
getting bigger now not smaller I mean
indie game developers are really
embracing their limitations they're
embracing just the limitations that they
have and the retro aesthetic and I
really like that and lastly I do want to
mention art games which are games that
are designed specifically to have a
deeper more artistic message the two on
the left are from Jason Rohr one of my
favorite indie game developers and he
made passage the one at the top and
gravitation below it you can see his
pixels are even bigger and yet if you
play as games you'll find they touch on
deeper themes than most other games that
are far more sophisticated so the one on
the top passage is felled the passage of
time growing old and dying with your
loved one gravitation is a game about
managing work-life balance and the
debilitating effects of depression so
very heavy topics for a game I would say
and yet he pulls it off really
brilliantly using spatial metaphor and
and he actually argues that 2d is better
than 3d for this because 2d is more
abstract papers please came out last
year it became quite popular I'm sure
part of it was because of the NSA stuff
I think people were in the mood for a
game about abusive authoritarian
governments and but but actually if you
play it
you play the role of someone checking
people's papers you play the border
guard so it in a way forces you to
empathize with them not necessarily the
system but empathize with them on an
individual level and I think that's one
of the points of art to change your
perception of the world and you know
people who play it actually often point
out that it's a boring game and that to
me is exciting that you know the
people's taste for games is becoming
more sophisticated not that there's
anything wrong with a fun game of course
we want that but imagine if movies were
only comedies I mean it's great that
we're finally branching out and that's
an example of it so what's my point I
can I'm kind of rambling here it is a
technical talk I'm talking about tools
of course but I'm talking about tools
for these kinds of games indie games
again I don't we don't want or at least
don't expect Madden 2016 to be written
in closure or Call of Duty 9 whatever
the hell they're at right now they're
not gonna be written in closure its
indie games really where where the
potential is and so there's sort of
things that I think would benefit them a
lot hosted language is that's one thing
that's already happening they're already
being written and hosted languages the
other two not quite so common but I'll
make the case for why they should so the
first one traditionally these have been
rejected by game developers of course
garbage collection is evil but things
have changed quite a bit it's not
uncommon at all to see indie games being
written stuff like C sharp and Java I go
on gamejolt all the time and I just
download random stuff and it's often
it's just something like a jar file
someone wrote and and you know there are
a lot of reasons for that but I think
one of the primary reasons is because of
frameworks like these these are just
amazing and you can't really see unity
but yeah these are amazing frameworks
that are both
sit on garbage-collected runtimes unity
is on the CLR the DDX is on a JVM and
they it's no surprise at all why these
are so popular with Indies I mean they
target everything that's kind of
important you know you need to get your
game in as many hands as possible
they have wide breadth and of course as
closure programmers we are spoiled we
can use both of these so Alex I think
mentioned Arcadia that's very impressive
project getting closure CLR to work with
unity and very very much recommend you
to check it out especially if you want
to do 3d stuff libgdx and and my stuff
supports 3d but it's like a lower-level
3d API I don't use it much I'm afraid of
the z-axis completely I stick to 2d so
and of course with libgdx you can use my
library play clj or you can just use
java interrupts directly some people
have told me that play clj is a little
too hand-holding just too much for you
and I totally accept that I made it for
my students like I mentioned so if you
want more flexibility just use Java
Interop so yeah that's my point it's
good to be hosted I think that the
argument has been turned completely
because of those frameworks they're so
useful there's such a big advantage to
to a developer and when you're using a
language that does not have access to
them you really feel their absence you
have to do all that plumbing yourself
I mean parsing tiled maps maybe even
physics who knows I mean depends on what
you can find libraries for so so that's
great I get so I'm going to briefly talk
about place yield a I need a rush
through this because I may not finish in
time and I also didn't start any timer
so not sure if I'll go over time now so
play clj if you want to start it you
have to pull down the template as you
can see with this line again command it
creates three separate line again
projects for you the the Android project
you can build with lime droid it uses
all of the stuff from Daniel Solano
Gomez and Alexandre yakushev so all of
that work they did I'm just piggybacking
on it here
to get play clj running on android and
iOS
uses blind fruit that's a plugin I wrote
partially because I just wanted to write
a plug-in with that name I just think
that's a good name for that all it does
is hook you into Robo VM which is a byte
code to machine code translator so it
can it can then get a closure game
running on iOS I actually don't know if
it works though it works in a simulator
but I have been told by people who
actually have iOS devices that it kind
of doesn't and I'm pretty sure I know
why so i bootstrap the game with a Java
file and then I just use reflection to
load your game and that works with Robo
VM but the problem is Robo VM because of
reflection it can't statically determine
what classes your game is using and so
the only way to get it to work is to
tell Robo VM to link everything and that
means like 7000 Java classes so it's
very creates a very large iOS executable
that apparently is too large to run on
modern devices so if someone can help me
with that that'd be great
and Android I mean that one works but
the frame rates are not great right now
so again I could always use help that's
why I call it experimental I get away
with that now the web back-end in libgdx
is not supported because it uses Google
web toolkit which is a source code
translator so we can't use it however
I'm hearing rumors that I don't know if
I'm allowed to say it but hearing rumors
that maybe they'll use T VM at some
point or something like that which is a
byte code to JavaScript translator that
would be that would be great then we
could get play clj games running in a
browser of you know without any code
changes so that would be really awesome
if anyone wants to do that any youngins
out there one a project for google
Summer of Code I'd be happy to pretend
- are you for that
so you go into the desktop project this
is the HelloWorld play clj game alright
that's the part that matters def screen
it's very blurry sorry
def screen is a macro that just lets you
hook into various libgdx events have you
ever done any closure Android
development is quite similar to the Deaf
activity macro it just you know lets you
pass in anonymous functions hook them up
to certain events and no wrong not a
whole lot of complication the only
difference is in this case you'll notice
these functions have the same two
arguments it's a really important screen
as a hashmap
entities is a vector so these are just
little bits of state you can just store
stuff inside of screen is for storing
things you only need one of like a
renderer and entities of course is going
to hold your entities and you can see
here you you update the entities vector
by just using the return value so ball
and player are just two entities I'm
creating I'm associating a position onto
them I'm returning it and then after on
show is run the screen and entities will
now contain those those values that it
that I'm putting in there right now and
so the next time a screen function runs
screen and entities will have those new
values so I hope that makes sense if it
doesn't then just think about it harder
so transforming entities is what you'll
probably end up doing for the most part
on render is the function I mentioned
before that's the one that runs
constantly okay that's your game loop so
if you just imagine that on show
function ran well now screen and
entities has those values in it and so
really all I'm doing here is I'm just
mapping over my entities will appear
function like that's that's my games
this part right here is my game and then
this is the rest of it is just you know
side effecting stuff you got to do like
play sounds render but the real heart of
the game is just a pure function that
I'm mapping over my entities with and
you'll see later why that's well you
already know why that's useful but
I'll try to explain that more later what
our entities here are a couple
distracting examples for you so the red
square is a shape closure logo is a
texture entity and the the fiery thing
is a particle effect and the particle
effect you can just create that in a
particle effect editor quite easily and
then just load it and although I didn't
make that one I stole it from the libgdx
test suite and all of these are just
records entities are records that
implement the same entity protocol so I
can use that really fast type based
dispatch sorry - to figure out how to
draw them because they all need to be
drawn differently of course alright and
so yeah and since there are records you
can Justice oh Sh whatever you want onto
them you can just store information into
your entities that way they all contain
a Java object at the end of the day they
have to libgdx is doing all the heavy
lifting here so there's a Java object
inside of the record and if all you want
to do is just change the position of an
entity you don't even need to worry
about it you just a social X&amp;amp;Y like I
did two slides ago and it'll change the
position for you but at some point you
do need to do more than that you do need
to actually grab the underlying Java
object and run methods on it and you can
very easily do that you just create in
this case a texture you you pull out the
object you can run methods on it so you
can do that but it's quite ugly I think
at least I think it is so what I did was
all of those entity constructors that I
showed you before they're actually
macros and after the required argument
you can pass in method invocations
inside the same s expression so the
thing at the top produces the thing at
the bottom they're the exact same it's
just a more terse syntax that's it I
mean just just meant to be a little bit
nicer in this case it's for when you're
creating it but for an existing entity
you can do the same thing with a macro
version that has a bang on the end so
that's how you would do it for an
existing entity the thing at the top
produces thing at the bottom so
one possible complaint is that well now
I have to look at the libgdx javadocs
find the method I want and then convert
it into your dumb little DSL with you
know by just changing the syntax and
that can be quite annoying so a couple
months after I released this was last
winter those of you from the Northeast
us remember the polar vortex that we
went through last winter and it was just
a small short period of time where we
just have wicked cold temperatures from
Canada I guess and and it was and I was
in Ambridge right so - a tout or
something like that
I don't want to go outside so I spend
like two days straight indoors working
on a custom documentation generator and
also wondering what happened in my life
and in the end what I came up with was a
tool okay that parses the place heal J
code and parses the libgdx Java code and
then does a lot of very terrifying
things I don't really remember and in
the end what it produces is this it's
kind of blurry but the point is it's a
it's a it's HTML documentation and has
everything you need inside of it all the
methods are in there you don't never
need a look at Java doc from libgdx
again so yeah I mentioned I taught a
class and
so yeah I did in fact I wasn't lying
and so one of the things I wanted to do
I like to do this with students is make
them modify an existing game you know
it's nice to start a game from scratch
but I think that you can really engage
them more if you make them modify an
existing game because you know they have
something that's already exists so the
first thing that I usually do is I'll
make them start with a platformer
template which is
built into night mod it's this thing
right here okay just this is a bird
apparently or the barista at my local
coffee shop said it's a penguin I don't
I don't know but so if you want to
actually modify the very first thing I
do with my students is I make them open
up the repple I'm sure you all are aware
of how great the repple is as a teaching
tool and in Knight mod it's this button
here it just brings up your rebel okay
and I walked them through a bunch of
basic stuff you know how do you add 1+1
how do you define a symbol how do you
run a function after after a while once
where they were fairly comfortable with
the language I wanted to actually modify
the game this particular namespace just
provides some convenience functions like
there's one called a bang you can use to
modify entities the first argument is a
filter function I'm just going to
identity identity because there's only
one entity here we don't really need to
filter the second thing is a screen
whatever screen the the entity is inside
of you need to specify that and after
that you just give it key value pairs
that you want to Sosh into the entity so
I think at first I just said hey let's
make the guy really big you know so this
makes a level really easy to complete
so let me restart that now so you do
stuff like that and after you do that
for enough you know times they get
really comfortable with the idea of you
know really modifying little bits and
pieces of the game like we did other
stuff you know how do we make him jump
higher stuff like that eventually I want
them to actually edit source code in
this case it's the grid button here I
have a lot of files in here because it
has my whole presentation but this is
the one I care about so we just went
through here and did the same thing we
just modify little bits of code until we
could we got bored so for example we
wanted to make the bird fly because it's
a bird and right now I can't fly and
there's this thing right here can jump
that prevents it from flying so you know
I just had the students replace the
expression with true because it always
can jump in the code so now of course
now he's a bird now he can fly so we did
stuff like that pretty much for two
hours straight and I could do more but I
really need to move on here so
functional programming and logic
programming were the second thing I
mentioned and again these are these are
paradigms aren't very common in game
development right now they should be I
don't need a you know belabor the point
of functional programming it's the same
benefits as any other kinds of software
parallelism matters of you know
simplifying state change things like
time rewinding becomes so much easier
and even though the languages themselves
aren't being used much the idioms
certainly are Carmack has been talking
about this for years entity component
systems are becoming popular so bits and
pieces of ideas are are entering into
the brains of game developers so we just
need to convince them to stop fighting
your language and use one where these
things are common logic programming I'm
very new to this I'll admit but it
deserves a slide I think that you know
this is something that's
very promising for game development
these are just two papers that I thought
you should read that involve this the
first one I found on David Nolan's
Twitter actually and I don't I don't use
Twitter but I search it sometimes and I
just search for closure and I came
across this link it's a paper it uses
core doubt logic to create more rich
game dialogues and it does that because
you know I've been playing RPGs my whole
life
Final Fantasy Luna or all that stuff and
dialogues in games have not become
really any different in in that span of
time it's it's all linear dialogues
dialogue trees etc so the idea here is
well maybe we shouldn't store these as
strings
maybe we should store dialogue as data
structures that we can run through logic
functions make much richer dialogues as
a result the other one is about
randomized dungeons that you can
generate doesn't use core doubt logic
but it's still cool I guess so speaking
of dungeons this is a game that is quite
dark on the screen sorry about that but
it's a it's an isometric style game I
wanted to make something that was like
the elbow to because I always played
that as a kid and you can see I'm
getting pretty bad frame rates on the
bottom left there that's because I'm
running this on a netbook with a 1.1
gigahertz Celeron processor and that's
the only like decently portable computer
I have so we're going to work with this
the good news is that there are two
cores so I can demo parallelism kind of
like like I can kind of do it but is not
going to get a huge benefit I'm not even
going to try to pretend because there's
overhead involved in parallelism as you
know but let's just just do it so
remember I said mapping over your
entities will appear a function so the
this thing right here that's the game
like that's majority of the game right
there so of course switching it to P map
is one way to do that in parallel you're
just using a thread pool now
it's now it has to restart and it takes
a while for the FPS to stabilize but you
should get a modest improvement on this
little machine which means a big
improvement on your machines so yeah
it's still stabilizing but you can see
it's starting to top into the 40s so you
get some benefit at least now the other
thing I mentioned in the previous slide
or two slides ago was time rewinding I
know that this is really cliche for game
demos at conferences but it's a good
demonstration of the value of immutable
data because it makes it so much easier
in this case in place elj time rewinding
is a built-in feature so if you want to
actually exploit it you just have to
create your timeline like this and your
you have to insert it into the screen
map which I mentioned earlier it's just
an empty vector and what place elj will
do is it'll start storing references to
your entities vector inside of there
after every frame so if you want to
rewind all you need to do that P map
thing we were talking about surround
that Linna statement and in this case
it's going to be if key pressed : R
that's that just means R is going to be
my rewind key and then rewind bang
screen one that's just a convenience
function that pulls out the entities
vector from one frame ago and returns it
and also removes it from the timeline
and the only other thing I would
probably do is change thread last to
some thread last because because when
you rewind all the way it'll return nil
and so you probably don't want it to
keep doing that and again this is a slow
computer so it takes a while to actually
restart the game I even have a spinning
hard drive some of you remember those so
did a restart I think it did so I'm
gonna go kill somebody
this is more like that little one maybe
I don't know
it's very ok and now I'm rewinding
alright so you see it's health going
back up and his health going back up
alright
so that's time rewinding and it's it's
not just rewinding the position you know
it's rewound the health any bit of state
that you store immutably will be rewound
so I don't know how you would do that
with mutable entities it doesn't make
sense to my brain so I'm going to try to
zoom out here okay this is what the game
looks like when I'm zooming out and the
only reason I want to do that is just to
show you how they're randomly placed I'm
using Cordell logic and a very naive way
I'll admit like I could probably just
use conditional statements but that
would not be as cool so I'm using Cortot
logic to determine which rooms are valid
to place a given bad guy all right so
this is this is it right here I mean
it's basically just saying they can't
start in the start room they and only
the werewolf can start in the end room
which is I don't really see the werewolf
where is he there he is he's that he's
like covered by the health borne out but
anyway so the point here is not to say
like this is really sophisticated
Cordell logic function is to say this is
how easy it is to embed a logic function
inside of the game this is a big
strength of closure because of course
it's just a library so we're using the
same language for logic programming and
for the game itself and so you know it's
a big advantage and that's so it's
extremely easy to use it for practical
things like that right so I need to move
on I actually don't know how much time I
have so if someone wants to just signal
me if like I'm running out soon because
this is the last part here interactivity
it was the third thing that I mentioned
and you know there's no way to demo this
this is what I've been doing the whole
time
but to me it's the most this is the
selling point this is the thing you need
to put in bold letters on the flyer that
you hand out to your neighbors when you
canvass your neighborhood preaching
about closure games and you can tell
them about this and it's not hot
swapping any you can hot-swap Java
like that's not interactivity it's the
repple if you don't have that then you
don't have interactivity in my opinion
so and and it's particularly important
for art it's important for things like
music or graphic art so I'm not an
artist but Pittsburgh has great art has
a great art scene you know it's got a
lot of hippies making music for free and
random murals along the side of the road
the story behind that is funny but I
probably don't have enough time to tell
it so he's going to move on so games I
feel that games are an art form as well
this is a contentious point people have
disagreed Roger Ebert
before his untimely death claimed that
games cannot be art and he made a really
good argument I think but I think it
only really applies to games today most
games today don't even attempt it but I
think as a medium they're capable of it
and and to the extent that they are art
it is even more important that you make
them interactively because this is how
art is always made that process of
playful experimentation of you know
improvising as you go along this is
something other artists can do and it's
inherent in their medium you know when
when you're a musician you didn't have
to work to make a guitar that plays the
sound as you play it you know but when
it comes to programming you actually do
need to work pretty hard to get tools
that lie to do that so I don't really
think I have time to talk about quest
quest you but it's special to me because
this is the first place elj game that I
ever came across in the wild it I don't
know is it's so it's made by Mike
patella
and Stephen Fick I think made the
artwork for it and so yeah it's it's not
done yet I'll say that but it's already
better than most Triple A games I've
played like you've had you've got random
red rectangles but that's not
necessarily a problem I mean I don't
think art has to make sense all the time
I think that if it did you know David
Lynch wouldn't be a famous movie
director that's and the only criticism I
have is there's too many steps that's
just but I I actually really love
unfinished games I think they're really
charming and just like begging for you
to mod them there's another red
rectangle I don't know what that would
and but it really is I don't know the
part that I like the best all right is
that normal games they always have this
really cliche way of doing things
unfinished games tend to avoid a lot of
common game tropes like having an ending
and and I just think endings are always
really lame it's always positive it's
always you killed the bad guy and
everyone loves you and you know you've
you've just arrow born as king you know
that kind of thing and unfinished games
always have this subtle nihilistic kind
of ending you know like just a cliff
that you just fall off and then you just
you know drift away listlessly into the
deep Beyond
I just find that really beautiful it's
just so artistic anyway is there review
here so that three points here don't
reinvent the wheel use new powerful
abstractions and interactive programming
is important because games are an art
form and so if you would like to see
these slides they're on my github and
you need to use Knight mod two to view
them and that's my email like I said I
don't really do social networking but
you can if anybody here still uses email
you can still contact me that way that's
all I got thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
