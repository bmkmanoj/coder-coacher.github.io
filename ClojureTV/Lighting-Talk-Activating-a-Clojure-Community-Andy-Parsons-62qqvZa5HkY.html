talk about something I know very little
about today and that's that's building
community so and a quick six minutes or
so I'm gonna run you through some of my
experience having taken over stewardship
of closure mm I see any members of
closure NYC here awesome
any community organizers out there
nobody want to be a community organizer
tell you everything you need to know
cool it's a little bit about me I'm the
founder and CTO of work frame in New
York also Tim's boss that's my greatest
claim to fame rich characterized me as
an old cranky person I think I'd
probably end that not a seasoned
community organizer everything I'm going
to tell you and everything I've learned
so far has been through trial and error
and we're learning as we go so the work
frame team sponsors and hosts the
closure NYC community and it's it's a
fun thing to do so this talk briefly is
for organizers there are a few of you
out there I hope more of you will kind
of step up and organize if that's
warranted in your local community
members of local meetups and if you're
not a member of a meet-up and don't
attend them frequently you're a part of
the problem and you should you should go
to your local meetup they urge you to do
that so closer NYC has a long history it
dates back to 2010 I think it started
out as the the first New York City
tri-state area even enclosure user group
has a rich history of organizers some
pretty amazing talk some of which I'm
sure you've seen at various venues from
Google to our tiny office in Soho there
been four or five changing changes of
the guard since inception and we're the
latest to kind of take it over it's at
1500 members but on my next slide I'm
going to talk about members in quotes
because as as you know members
membership and meetups and attendance
and engagement are two different things
so we took the helm about a year ago and
I said it's been oh it's been a learning
experience one things I'm going to call
for today is for community organizers
out there in the closure community to
get together and start sharing some meta
knowledge about how best to do this so
community is hard we're figuring out as
we go
we have 1500 members in quotes which
means you know member is a it's a loose
signal that somebody's interested in
closure in the large but out of 1500
anyone I guess how many people you
typically come to meetups it's less than
100 sometimes far less than 100
sometimes just me no just kidding but uh
you know there are many many challenges
one of them is that one of the greatest
things about closure is that it's truly
a general-purpose language and there's a
challenge there it's not rails or Python
there is no it's not Ruby or Python I
just a there's no rails magnet to bring
community together there's no Django
there are a lot of libraries and
fascinating things and myriad use cases
so it's hard to find a single kind of
magnetizing force to bring people
together after work on a Wednesday
evening but we as most of you would
prefer a very engaged small community
over a massive not very engaged passive
community it's our goal and yours as
organizers if you choose to be an
organizer is to get the word out keep
the group active and welcoming I don't
have time to talk about welcoming but
that's about diversity and and low
barrier to entry so I'm gonna share five
quick guiding principles in the
remaining time ending with the most
important one of all just add a little
suspense one is consistency and this
goes for any kind of Meetup
I think a monthly meeting is the right
cadence and people knowing that there's
something coming up roughly the first
Wednesday of every month is very helpful
there's a lot of meetups kind of fail
because they've scheduled a couple
months in advance and you never know
exactly what it is and if you can't make
it you feel guilty and and things don't
go well I recommend people plan way in
advance this is one of the hardest
things to do as organizers is to get you
know three or four speakers lined up if
you're doing lightning talks get those
things on the calendar well in advance I
put these slides together last night so
I'm not a good example of that but it's
a it's a basic organizing principle it's
it's harder than you think to do give
speakers plenty of advance notice you
know the better the talks the more
people you'll get to come closure folks
in my experience tend to be very open
and they tend to be great speakers so
it's usually not a problem to get people
to scramble but to week
is the right amount of notice I find it
helpful to shortlist just a couple
venues two or three at maximum for so
people kind of get into the routine they
know where to go we're in New York City
so that's that's pretty easy to do we
have lots of people volunteering the
host number to embrace variety but have
a focus I think it's nice to see the
same faces a month after month community
really is about interacting with people
that you see more than once a year and
closure used as diverse as I said before
so it is a challenge to find focus but
also embrace different kinds of talks in
different communities we have a beginner
community in New York City we have an
advanced community we have people doing
machine learning we have people like my
company work frame doing full stack
closure interested in day Tomic some
people curious about the atomic some
people afraid of day Tomic so we want to
embrace all those different kinds of
interests and encourage beginners last
bullet there
you know don't assume that the community
is necessarily interested in all the
same things you are
so you know if we were to have a closer
meetup in New York about companies that
are doing full-stack closure it would
probably be a meet-up of five people and
four of them would be working for me but
it's it's important to maintain that
kind of variety in terms of the things
that have been working well for us is
you know have a protocol again this is
sort of basic meeting etiquette but
announcements one thing I always leave
out is to tell people where the
bathrooms are critical when you start a
meeting to tell people about that stick
to a schedule be present as an organizer
that's one that I've learned over and
over again I've been to meetups in town
where people will pick something off and
then sort of walk away or take a phone
call or start coding on their machines
be present and be a good be good
moderator the most important things that
happen at our events are before the
event to leave plenty of time for that
socializing pizza whatever beer and
after the event you know go out to a
venue leave plenty of time for
socializing afterwards those are the
most important obviously parts of the
thing build a strong Network this is
something we've gotten better at have
enough venues have plenty of sponsors
sponsors will send people to meet up and
help
they'll pay for food and beer and things
like that and most importantly perhaps
reach out to other meet up so we have a
relationship now with the new york
hololens meetup which has only a passing
relationship to closure but given that
you can do interesting things in WebGL
and gaming there's a nice crossover and
we think the hololens community will
embrace the closure community and vice
versa but we're also trying to get
javascript errs kind of out of their
comfort zone and the many JavaScript
meetups and bring them into the closure
and I see meetup to learn about
JavaScript and and react and all the
interesting things going on there and
lastly we have a great opportunity to
closure community to get involved in
closure bridge which is a wonderful
thing it's available pretty much
wherever you are there's some kind of
closure bridge event that you can get
involved it with as a volunteer or a
sponsor and there's a nice dovetailing
that happens between our Meetup and
enclosure bridge I gave it away the last
one the most important food so when we
were getting this rolling I reached out
to the person who used to evangelize
tech meetups at gilt groupe which is
famous for its developer community and
fostering an amazing community around
scala and its various tools and she said
if you remember one thing it's to go
beyond beer and pizza so we haven't done
that yet but we have access to print
Street pizza and Soho which is you know
already beyond your normal pizza fare
but food is perhaps the most important
contribution you can make as an
organizer so hope you take those
principles go forth and build community
