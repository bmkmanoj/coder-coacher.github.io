problems declaratively donald knuth is
the author of the art of computer
programming and encyclopedia of
knowledge about computer science and
algorithms recently Knuth gave a talk at
Brown University and at the end of the
talk during the Q&amp;amp;A session a student
asked him why do you use puzzles so much
as examples in your book and explains
that he really likes puzzles because the
problem statements are simple and clear
but the problem solving process is
complex enough that it gives you a
feeling for how it applies to real world
techniques with that in mind I'd like to
introduce to you a puzzle that's going
to serve as a running example throughout
this talk it's called the why covering
problem and it's based around this piece
called the y pentomino it's called that
because if you stand it up on its side
and look at it in just the right way it
looks kind of like the letter Y and it's
a pentomino because it's made up of five
squares now a 10 by 10 grid has a
hundred squares so that raises the
question can we take 20 of these Y
pieces and flipping and rotating them
any way we want can we cover the 10 by
10 grid and as you can see from this
illustration yes it's possible and so
then the question is how do you write a
program to find this solution and to do
things like counting how many solutions
there are we can extend the problem make
it a little more computationally
difficult by asking if you can put 45y
shapes on a 15 by 15 grid and as you can
see that's possible as well if we're
going to try to write a program to solve
this we're going to need some kind of
data structure to represent a Y piece in
a given placement on the grid so I've
chosen to represent Y as a set of row
column coordinates 0 based from the
upper left corner of the grid so I've
defined here the basic Y shape the next
step is to define all the symmetries so
I've given a demonstration of what the
reflect across the main diagonal
function would look like using the same
technique we can put together all four
rotational symmetries and the four
reflection symmetries and then we apply
them all to the basic Y shape and now we
have all the eight forms of Y and then
we can write a function that's going to
scan across the grid left to right top
to bottom and find all the possible ways
that all these Y shapes can fit into
this 10 by 10 grid so I've demonstrated
at the bottom what happens when you call
this with the board size 10 for 10 by 10
grid and it starts spitting out a lazy
sequence of all the possible placements
of Y now we're ready to actually solve
the y cover problem the basic challenge
is to find some combination of those
placements that cover each space of the
grid exactly once so I'd like you to
start thinking about how you would go
about writing a program to solve that
but meanwhile I'm going to show you
another problem and then I'm going to
come back and show you how it connects
with this one
the next problem I'd like to talk about
is called the exact cover problem you're
given a matrix of zeros and ones and
your challenge is to find a subset of
rows where among those rows you have
exactly one one in every column so for
example given this matrix of zeros and
ones we can choose these three rows and
we get exactly one one in each column
from those chosen rows so this would be
called a covering of this matrix this
particular matrix only has one covering
but conceivably a matrix could have many
possible covers if you want to solve
that problem efficiently the natural
question asked is what operations need
to be really fast in order to solve that
problem efficiently
well Knuth was one of the first people
to write about this problem and he
observed that a couple of the things you
can do with a doubly-linked list
turn out to be highly relevant to this
problem one of the things you can do
with a doubly linked list looking at
node C is it's really easy to delete
that C from the list
simply by rerouting a couple of pointers
around it so
right now see is kind of invisible when
you're doing a left-to-right traversal
and it's invisible when you do a
right-to-left traversal but we leave
behind these pointers pointing out from
C that's actually very intentional
because that means C knows exactly where
it belongs in this doubly linked list
and it's really trivial to backtrack and
splice it right back into the list so
using that as a model news team up with
this really beautiful data structure in
an algorithm that he called the dancing
links algorithm what he does is he takes
this matrix and he turns it into this
data structure that has a node for every
one of the ones in that matrix every Row
is connected by a circular doubly linked
list every column is connected by a
circular doubly linked list and there's
a bunch of column headers at the top
which keep track of a count of how many
ones there are in the column and those
are also connected in these circular
doubly linked lists as well and then the
algorithm I'll show a couple steps here
basically involves rerouting these links
around the other nodes temporarily make
them invisible and that correct them
very quickly the I'm not going to go
into more detail than this the main
takeaway I want you to have from looking
at this picture is that this algorithm
to perform efficiently relies heavily on
doubly linked lists mutation pointer
manipulation these are not closures
strong suits which raises the question
how to implement something like this in
closure I wanted to implement this
algorithm in closure I had a problem
that would benefit from this and I
wanted to implement this and I sat down
and tried a bunch of different
techniques I tried using records I tried
using atoms as my pointers I tried a
bunch of things I was not getting the
performance I was looking for then I
discovered an amazing library that
potentially speeds up your closure code
tremendously making your programs way
way faster
and surprisingly enough this library
actually comes bundled with closure so I
began to embrace this idea that Java is
essentially closures assembly language
and I mean that in the sense that back
when I used to do C programming every
once in all I'd have some kind of highly
performant thing I would need to do and
I drop down to the assembly level and
kind of splice that into my code and
I've realized you can do the same kind
of thing with Java and closure so I took
the dancing links algorithm and I
implemented the core data structure and
pointer manipulation all that stuff at
the Java level and then I created an
open source library called tarantella
tarantella exposes a single function in
its API called dancing links and it can
take a matrix in a few different formats
and it handles the details of taking
that matrix depending on what format you
give it and turning it into a data
structure that is relevant to the
underlying Java library and then it
cranks through the the java dancing
links algorithm on it and then it takes
the result spits it back out in a
closure form that you can use today I'm
going to be using as examples these
first two kinds of inputs you can take a
matrix of ones and zeros and it can also
take a map of the form that it goes from
row labels to a set of all the column
labels that have a 1 in it for that row
so here's an example of the dancing
links function in action I've passed to
it a matrix of zeros and ones the same
one we saw in the previous example and
it spits out that there's only one
solution and it's the rows 3 0 and 4 now
I promised that I would connect this
back up to the first problem hopefully
you've been thinking about how you would
solve the why cover problem but now I'm
going to show you what I think is a much
cooler way to solve it than probably
what you're thinking we can actually use
this dancing links out rhythm to solve
why cover by turning it into an instance
of the
exact cover problem what we have to do
is we need to come up with a matrix of
ones and zeros that represents the why
cover prom so we can feed it to dancing
links and the result we get back is a
solution to the why cover prom the key
idea here is to make each row of the
matrix we label it with the placement
one of those Y placements the columns
are all the different cells of the grid
and then for every row for every
placement we're going to go through and
we're going to mark with a 1 all the
cells that it occupies so this first row
this placement is occupying 0 0 0 1 0 2
0 3 and 1 2 so I've marked with the 1 0
0 0 1 0 2 0 3 &amp;amp; 1 2 so we do that for
every row now when we pump this into the
dancing links algorithm we're going to
get back a combination of rows that have
exactly 1 1 in each of these columns
that's a combination of placements that
occupies every cell of the grid exactly
once which is exactly what we need
that's a why cover now I mentioned that
one of the input formats we can give to
the dancing links function is a mapping
from row labels two sets of column
labels well in this instance if you take
this row label and you map it to a set
of the column labels with ones in it
that's the same as the original set so
in this case building that particular
matrix representation is incredibly
convenient it's as simple as just doing
a zip map of all the placements with
itself we can pass it to the dancing
links function it takes optionally as a
keyword limit 1 if your limit any number
if you want to limit it to a certain
number of solutions so this will spit
out one solution and I wrote a little
visualization function that visualizes
this is a picture that's the picture I
showed you at the beginning of the top
we can also count how many solutions
there are and what if we gained by
solving the problem in this way well
first of all it makes it a little easier
to write the solution once you think of
that transformation because I didn't
have to specify how to solve it I'd
NIDA declaratively represent my problem
in some way and that makes the code a
lot shorter as a point of comparison I
sat down and wrote just kind of a
straightforward closure backtracking
algorithm to solve it using closures
built in immutable data structures and
it was about 40 lines of code which is
pretty impressive I mean that's that's a
testament to how can place you can get
with closure but the dancing lengths
implementation you saw is two lines once
you have the wide placements defined
it's just that matrix is just a zip map
then you call dancing links but we also
see a huge performance difference here
you can see it especially when you get
to the fifteen by fifteen grid when you
look at the find all of the solutions on
my computer the dancing links algorithm
took about ten minutes for the closure
backtracking strategy I let it run
overnight on my computer ran it for
about 24 hours it still wasn't done I
don't know how long it would have taken
I gave up at that point so that brings
us to the end of declarative model
number one of three that I'll be showing
you today called the exact cover problem
and it works on any problem whose
constraints can be expressed as exactly
one of and for such problems dancing
links is generally going to be the
fastest way to go another puzzle you
might think of when you think of exactly
one constraints would be pseudo cout
right sodoku is all about exactly one
constraints you can use a very similar
technique to this to turn us to Goku
grid into a matrix of ones and zeros
that maps to this kind of solver you
pump it through the solver you're
getting it one of the most blazingly
fast to go through solvers around okay
moving on to our next model which is the
boolean satisfiability problem now the
boolean satisfiability problem is an
np-complete problem and the idea is
you're given an arbitrary boolean
formula drop my out of there
you're given an arbitrary boolean
formula and you're trying to find a set
of truth values for the variables that
make this formula evaluate to true so
I've given here a sample formula using
keywords as my variables
I'm trying to find some kind of true
false values to associate with each of
these variables to make this expression
evaluates it true now because it's
np-complete worst-case-scenario
this is exponential time to solve the
problem like this but it turns out that
many real-world instances of the boolean
satisfiability problem have a lot of
structure to them that you can exploit
with clever heuristics to find a
solution much faster than the worst case
so this is something researchers have
been working hard at for many decades
coming up with clever and clever ways to
make solvers and their there many
state-of-the-art
amazing solvers out there I wanted to
build something like this enclosure but
I didn't want to have to duplicate all
that effort which gave me another big
insight if Java is closures assembly
language to me that means that there's
nine million developers out there who
want to write my assembly code for me
just to make my programs faster that
makes me very happy so I started to
think of Java programmers is this great
resource for me to use and of course
what I'm talking about here is that
closure has great interrupts with Java
we should be taking advantage of that so
I'd like to introduce another open
source library I created called rolling
stones rolling stones is a closure
library built on top of sat 4j which is
a Java Sat solver and it supports three
different problem input formats and
that's a really big deal because the
underlying solver sat for J only
supports this one very specific kind of
format called the integer conjunctive
normal form and that's not always the
most convenient way to work with a
logical formula in fact in this problem
this particular symbolic formula is
already in conjunctive normal form so
it's a pretty straightforward
transformation but rolling stones can
actually handle arbitrarily complex
formulas if it needs to it will create
temporary variables for each of the sub
expressions before it passes it into the
solver and then when it gets it back it
filters out all those temporary
variables so
comes back to you it's a completely
seamless process you didn't have to
worry about any of this stuff that's
going on behind the scenes how to fat
solvers like set 4j work well I'm not
going to go into that and this talk
because this was already discussed at
the last closure cons in the top a peek
inside sat solvers so check that out and
there's some other resources as well if
you want to learn more about how set
solvers work for now I'd like to focus
on how you actually use rolling stones
to solve problems effectively rolling
stones exposes a bunch of constructors
for building up formulas here I'm using
and/or not an exclamation point as an
alias for nought there's other things as
well like if and only if X or and those
are available and you can build up your
formula Roley stones actually lets you
use any data structure at all to be your
variable it doesn't have to be keywords
but in this example I've used keywords
and then it spits out a list of the
truth values of these things by giving
you the variables that are true and the
ones that need to be that are false to
make this thing true it has them wrapped
in the knot constructor there's also a
function called solution symbolic
formula which generates a lazy sequence
of all the possible solutions now if
we're going to try to apply this to
something like the Y covered problem we
already saw that that is mostly about
exactly one constraints so we need to
know how to transform something like
that into a logical formula well it
turns out there's always a way to do
that here's an example of how you can do
that with these four variables give me
you know I want to make the statement
exactly one of these four variables is
true so this formula accomplishes that
the first line is basically saying at
least one of these variables is true and
the next six together are saying at most
one of these variables is true and the
way it's accomplishing that is by saying
pick any two variables at least one of
those has to be false now this is such a
common thing that you want to do with
these sorts of Sat solvers that sat for
J actually has a much more efficient
implementation of these sorts of
chemistry
Reince then manually expanding it to
this kind of formula it sort of handles
it as a meta constraint that it's
watching while doing the regular solving
process so I've exposed that in the
Rolling Stones library with this kind of
API here once we've done that we have
everything we need to be able to solve
the why cover problem with the Rolling
Stones library I mentioned before that
any data structure can be our variable
so what I've done here is made a choice
that each one of these placements each
set is going to be a single variable
it's going to represent whether this
placement is actually in the grid or not
so if a variable if one of these sets
needs to be true that means it should be
in the grid if it's false that means
leave it out of the grid now we're going
to go through each cell and we're going
to build these exactly one constraints
so for the zero zero self just as an
example in the upper left hand corner
these are the only four Y placements
that can cover that zero zero cell and
we know that exactly one of those
placements must be in our grid in other
words exactly for these variables must
be true we can create a closure function
of course to generate all those
constraints for us and then we simply
pass it in to solve symbolic formula and
we'll get back the result another way of
solving the Y cover problem let's take a
look at the timing test to see how we've
done here you can actually see looking
at the fifteen by fifteen results that
going from if you're looking for just
one solution rolling stones actually
beat dancing links in this particular
case which is a testament to how good
these heuristics are built in the sat
solvers for quickly zoning in on the
combination of true variables but when
you try to find all of the solutions
it's a different story
dancing links clearly outperforms
rolling stones when you're when you're
making choices and then backtracking
over and over and over again it's really
hard to beat that
mutable circular doubly linked list data
structure that Knuth came up with but
most importantly why would we bother
with rolling stones the reason is
because it allows us to solve a wider
range of problems for this problem I
wanted to put wise on a 14 by 14 board
but a 14 by 14 board has 196 spaces
that's not a multiple of five so if I
want to do this I'm going to have to
relax the problem description and allow
some allow for overlapping so I set up
the code to allow these four specific
overlapping zatt 0 0 0 3 3 0 and 3 3 the
spaces marked in red here and I was able
to compute how many solutions there are
that satisfy this the way I did that is
very simple with rolling stones all I
had to do was change for the cells that
I want to allow to be my overlapping
cells I make those exactly two
constraints instead of exactly one
constraint that's not something you
could do with dancing links because
dancing links can only handle exactly
one another thing dancing links can't
really do well is it can't relate one
part of the board to the other I wanted
to find a rotationally symmetric
solution to the Y covering problem and
that was pretty straightforward to do
what I did is in addition to those exact
one constraints I added some logical
constraints that a place first I wrote
this rotate piece function which given a
placement it gives the 180 degree
rotation around the board of that piece
and then I created these extra
constraints that say a placement holds
if and only if it's rotated piece 180
degrees around the board also holds and
then I decided to go crazy I wanted to
see if I could generate a cover where
exactly 10 of the 20 pieces have
reflective symmetry across the vertical
axis so how do you do something like
that well I wrote the function that lets
you give in a piece generate the
placement a
reflected across the vertical axis and
then I created this extra constraint
that said exactly ten of these formulas
are true where the formulas are saying
that a placement and its reflection in
the vertical axis are both true so going
back and looking at this picture you can
see these two pieces are mirror images
these two are mirror images these two
these two and these twos that's ten
pieces total the others do not match up
across the vertical axis so it found a
covering with exactly ten of the twenty
mirroring across like this that brings
us to the end of declarative model
number two boolean satisfiability this
model is really great for working with
variables that can take on two values
true or false it's really great when you
have constraints that can be expressed
either as a logic formula or exactly n
of at least enough or at most n F and we
saw from the timing tests that the
heuristic approach really is good at
rapidly finding one solution but if you
want to find all solutions you should
use dancing links assuming your problem
can actually be solved with dancing
links at this point I'd like to take a
brief interlude and answer a question
that I sometimes get which is what do I
personally use these libraries for well
my main line of work is that I am a game
designer and a puzzle inventor and my
latest project is I've been developing a
line of three puzzle logic games for
kids all based on computer science
principles and the reason I bring this
up at this point in the talk is because
this third game robot repair is actually
the reason why I developed the rolling
stones library robot repair is modeled
directly on the boolean satisfiability
problem I literally took the boolean
satisfiability problems and turn them
into logic puzzles for kids so this is a
great opportunity for me to give a
little plug for it I guess so
give the gift of boolean satisfiability
to somebody you love to show them you
care coming in August 2017 to Target
stores everywhere created with closure
okay moving on to our next model our
third and final model is constraint
programming constraint programming is
another declarative problem-solving tool
that deals with variables that can take
on a finite number of integer values
constraint programming solvers usually
come with a wide assortment of different
kinds of constraints as part of the
library it can handle logical
constraints arithmetic constraints and
there's usually a whole bunch of
special-purpose global constraints put
in there too and these create a really
rich domain for expressing a wide
variety of problems declaratively
another interesting thing you could do
with constraint programming solvers is
you can do certain kinds of optimization
by maximizing or minimizing certain
variables Loko is a library enclosure
written by Alex Engelberg it sits on top
of Shoko a java constraint solver and it
has a very similar structure to the
other two libraries I showed you in the
sense that it uses the power of closure
to let you make these data structures
that represent your problem model and
then you pass it in the solver and does
a lot of work behind the scenes creating
temporary variables doing a lot of
things that you don't want to have to
worry about passes it into the solver
takes the results passes it back to you
in a way that is consumable for you in
closure these are some examples of the
constraints that are built into loco
you'll notice they all start with a
dollar sign it's not a jQuery thing it's
just a convention used in loco to make
the constraints really visually stand
out from the other kind of functions you
may be wondering how constraint
programming solvers work but that is
also outside the scope of this talk
because alex Engelberg explained that in
the talk we gave together at closure
cons 2015 called solving problems with
automata in the second half of the talk
he spoke a little bit about how
propagation strategies work and things
like that so check that out if you want
more about the underlying mechanisms I'm
going to talk specifically about how you
use something like loco to solve a
running example of the Y cover problem
the key thing is to realize that loco
can do anything that a Sat solver can do
anything that you were representing
before as a boolean just becomes an
integer variable in loco that takes on
the value of either 0 or 1 and a lot of
the constraints that we had about the
true how many true variables we have can
just be expressed as arithmetic
constraints so if we want to say that
exactly one of these variables are true
we're just saying that these four values
which are going to be either 0 or 1 need
to add up to exactly 1 in local
variables need to either be keywords or
vectors starting with a keyword they
don't like it doesn't let you use any
arbitrary data structure like I did in
rolling stones so we need to we want to
have a variable for every one of these
placements but we need to give it a name
that matches that either a keyword or a
vector starting with the keyword so the
easiest way to do that is to make every
variable a vector that starts with the
keyword shoes and then the second part
of the vector is the specific placement
conceptually you can kind of think about
it like in math we use sub scripted
variables so in math these would all be
even though they all have the word
choose these are all different variables
because they all have a different
subscript the subscript being the
specific Y placement under consideration
and the range we're declaring is we're
saying these have to all be values
between 0 &amp;amp; 1
inclusively meaning they're all
effectively boolean and here is the code
that would generate all those variable
declarations and then we do the same
kind of thing that we did with rolling
stones to build those exactly one
constraints and they become these sorts
of constraints that say these variables
have to add up to exactly 1 again this
is the example where of the 4 placements
that cover the 0 0 cell in the upper
left corner and this here is the code
that would generate all those
constraints
we put together the variable
declarations with all those exactly one
constraints and that's our model and
then we pass that declarative model to
locos solution function and it worked
the way it returns the results to you is
it gives you a mapping from all your
variables to either 0 or 1 0 being false
1 being true so since this is 0 that
means this placement is not in our grid
since this is 1 this placement will be
in our grid and so on let's take a look
at the timing tests you can see here
that loco is definitely slower than the
other options in fact when we get to the
15 by 15 grid it just struggles with
that it's really problematic on that
size so again why would we use it and
the answer is because it can handle a
wider range of problems than either the
other libraries we talked about we've
expanded the expressiveness and the set
of problems we can do declaratively
so this was one you may remember from
math class something called the for
color map theorem it says that any map
you can color it with four colors in
such a way that two regions that are
touching aren't the same color
well what if we wanted to see if there's
a Y cover that can be colored with
exactly three colors so here's how I set
up that model I created a new set of
variables that are the keyword color sub
scripted by the placement and these have
to range between 0 &amp;amp; 2 0 being red 1
being green 2 being blue then I built a
bunch of constraints I wrote this
predicate called touching that I haven't
actually shown here but it tests whether
two placements are touching each other
on the grid so for every combination of
placements that are touching I'm going
to create this constraint that says if
both placements are in our grid their
colors have to be not equal add this in
with the other constraints that define
the Y covering problem and pass this to
loco and you get back the three color
solution that I showed you
or I mentioned that with local you can
do certain kinds of optimization so this
is an example that shows that you can
maximize the number of upright why's
where I've defined up right why to view
this shape in the upper left hand corner
so I found this solution that has eight
upright wide pieces and that's the best
you can do and the way I did that was
with this code what this is basically
saying we use this maximize keyword when
we call solution what we're trying to
maximize is we're maximizing the sum of
all the placement variables that are
placement variables of the upright why
as you move it from left to right across
this grid and I'm not showing this
function here but it's dissolved in the
github code that brings us to the end of
declarative model number 3 constraint
programming constraint programming is
great for variables with finite number
of integer values and it has many kinds
of constraints available so you can
represent a lot of different kinds of
problems declaratively and use this kind
of solver it supports optimization but
we found that it's from the timing test
that is generally slower than these
other more specialized solvers if those
apply this brings us to the end of the
talk I've shown three different ways to
solve problems declaratively enclosure
first we looked at the library
tarantella which used the dancing links
algorithm to solve problems that can be
expressed in terms of exactly one
constraints Rolling Stones use the Sat
solver added the capabilities of working
with true/false variables and logical
constraints loco added constraint
programming which gave us multi valued
variables logical and arithmetic
constraints now there's a few main ideas
that I hope you come away from this talk
with first there's a common pattern
across these three libraries all three
of them are using the power of closure
to let you conveniently manipulate data
and describe your problem as a
declarative model
and then the library handles the
responsibility of handing that off to
the speedy Java solving engine and then
taking the results and interpreting
those results back for you and we saw
that a lot of those libraries the
declarative layer that closure provides
is definitely more expressive than what
is provided from the underlying Java
library so we've definitely got an added
value from our Interop these three
libraries actually can be used to solve
very important classes of problems Sat
solver the you know it's one of the
original np-complete problems so most
np-complete problems the way they're
proven and be complete these days is by
showing that a transformation exists two
statins so a lot of really hard
challenging problems it's already known
how to transform those into something a
Sat solver can do even if these three
libraries are not things that you
necessarily have a problem that this
fits with right away I hope you will be
inspired by these patterns and the
techniques that I've shown here to wrap
your own speedy Java engine or perhaps
harness someone else's thank you very
