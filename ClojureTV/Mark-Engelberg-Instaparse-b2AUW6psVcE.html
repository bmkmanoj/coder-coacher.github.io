to closure West it's exciting to be here
it's the first talk of the first morning
and I feel like I should be hijacking
this time slot to give a keynote and set
the future of closures something but
we're here to talk about insta parse
let's begin with a little warm-up it's
the morning get to get the brains going
so what's this any it's a map it's a map
its closure data right this is the Eden
format we all know and love and one of
the beautiful things about closer for
those of you who are here trying out
closure you know relatively recently one
of the things in my opinion that is the
most exciting thing about closure it
gives us these great lightweight ways to
express data to model our data and it
gives us a huge toolkit for manipulating
that data so once we can get things in
this form we're really really happy
now what's this yeah it's just a string
it's got the same information in there
but we can't really do anything with it
yet right the good news is that built
right into closure in the closure
edan namespace is the read string
function and if we apply the function to
this string we get back that map that we
can actually work with and that's also
another really wonderful thing about
closure is how easy it is to write out
and read back in this kind of data we
like working with okay how about this
anyone recognize this yeah this is a
JSON that's been read in as a string and
we can't really work with it just yet
but we have this function in the closure
data Jason's namespace read stir that
lets us read this in and get that
closure map we want to work with how
about this this one's a little trickier
yeah exactly this is what you get if you
slurp in a CSV file now we have a way to
read in CSV files but notice you don't
get a
exactly what you want because it reads
in that first row which was meant to be
header information sort of as its own
row so maybe this isn't exactly what you
want but it's at least a good start
right once we get this into our closure
format we have ways of working with it
massaging it into the map format we're
looking for and this everyone knows this
right so this is XML read in as a string
and again we have a way to bring it into
closure and work with it what we get
back is some sort of generic tree
structure that then we can work with and
further refine it into what we want now
the good news is that most of the time
we're working with one of these standard
formats we're working with Eden
hopefully or possibly JSON CSV XML you
know I mean what at least 90 percent of
the time but these are not the only
things you're gonna encounter
what if someone gives you a file that
looks like this I mean who would who on
earth would represent a map this way
that that's kind of a dig I guess but
the I mean this is this is how Scala
represents maps and and the point is
that different communities represent
their Maps differently or what if
someone hands you a bunch of cave data
in some kind of unusual exotic format
that you know kind of looks almost like
JSON if you look at it funny but it's
not quite JSON or what if you want to
work with you know like a Python config
file or what if you want to make your
own programming language or your own DSL
for something all of these are things
that you want to as quickly as possible
get them into your closure Eden format
so that you can work with them and do
things with them and those last three
examples by the way are all problems
that were solved by actual users in the
closure community with the insta parse
library so now is the opportunity to
kind of say
way and start talking about insta parse
but first I want to outline a couple key
concepts so for the purposes of this
talk I'm defining a parser to be a
function that takes a string as an input
and produces closure data as an output
so all those things we saw before the
you know the read XML Strunk ssin the
read CSV function those are all examples
of parsers and the idea is we want to be
able to create parsers for these other
kinds of formats well to understand how
to create a parser first we need to ask
the question how do we describe the
structure of data well we can take a cue
from automata theory in computer science
automata theory describes two very
important classes of data there's the
kind of data that can be represented
with regular expressions and those
happen to correspond to data that can be
processed with a state machine and then
we also have this wonderful this
wonderful language for expressing
context-free grammars which is another
class of which describes another class
of data that can be processed with
something called a pushdown automaton
now the good news is that we have great
support for regular expressions built in
just about every modern language however
there's many kinds of data that cannot
be expressed well with a regular
expression but can be expressed with a
context-free grammar and unfortunately
we don't have very good support in our
languages for context-free grammars at
least not that same kind of rich support
that we have for regular expressions and
I think that's kind of a shame because
when a context-free grammar describes
your data it automatically is also
describing a tree structure that is in
that data and that's called the
derivation tree I literally walked over
to my shelf for this slide and I pulled
off the automaton
book off the shelf flipped it open and
open it up to the first context-free
grammar I saw and copied it down and
then in the book there is a picture of
the derivation tree for that grammar for
that particular string a a VBA a so you
the how many of you have never seen a
context-free grammar before it's okay so
you know not not everybody's seen it but
the basic idea is it's a series of rules
and usually the implication is that the
first rule is kind of your starting
point so we have this label s and the
first thing is a rule saying you know s
is a and then the description on the
other side and the vertical bar means or
and the other things well I'll get into
that a little bit so we've got two rules
here and we see the tree structure of
how you can sort of prove that this
grammar fits that string now that
example was just this kind of arbitrary
you know a textbook example of a a B ba
now that's not the kind of data we
really work with right so I want to at
least convince you that grammars are
used in the real world to describe
actual data this is from a specification
for email addresses I mean who knew that
email addresses were that complicated
right but it took a couple people yes
really annoying to validate it email
addresses because it turns out that the
universe of allowed email addresses is
much broader than what you would think
and to capture all those nuances really
requires you know it's not something
that can be described adequately with
just regular expressions you need a
context-free grammar to describe that
okay so now we're ready to get into what
is insta parse specifically and I like
to think of insta parse as a really
lightweight tool for converting
context-free grammars into an executable
parser one of these functions that will
let you convert a string into a tree
structure that you can work with in
closure
so going back to that example that I
pulled from the automaton book on my
shelf on the upper right corner you can
see what I did is I actually just typed
the context-free grammar into insta
parse fed it to this function in the
insta parse neck core namespace which I
have aliased here is insta so there's a
function they're called parser that
takes grammars and returns a parser so I
wrote down the context-free grammar
passed it to the parser function and got
back a function which I named automata
book parser and you can see when I apply
automata book parser to that exact same
string that was in the example in the
book I get back some sort of closure
tree structure if you have trouble
visualizing it from there there's
actually a function built in insta parse
Club visualize and it produces the tree
that's in the lower left corner showing
you what the tree actually looks like
and it's got some extra information in
there but you can see that the tree
structure that it produces is exactly
the same as the one that was shown in
the textbook that's pretty nice to be
able to just put this in and get
something out that you can work with
like this is great now my first version
of this talk I have to admit was like
twice as long as it needed to be and I
was planning to spend a lot of time
giving sort of a tour of the features of
insta parse but I realized when I had to
sort of pare things down to a reasonable
length of time that there's already a
really detailed tutorial about insta
parse on github on the github site and
so I'm not gonna make this about you
know just showing you all the features
of insta parse this is talk is going to
be a little more about the
implementation events to parse but I do
feel like there's at least a few key
features you need to know about so these
are the three features that I think
really helped make instapass a
particularly nice lightweight tool for
working with context-free grammars so
first there are three ways to describe a
grammar in insta parse most libraries
especially in the closure ecosystem
allow you to create a grammar using kind
of a combination of functions and data
that's often called the Combinator
approach insta parse lets you do that
but on top of that you can also just
enter in these two syntaxes that are
very popular for describing context-free
grammars ebn f syntax and a B and F
syntax and I really think that's gone a
long way towards making insta parse feel
like I said kind of as lightweight as
regular expressions although I guess
some people would argue how lightweight
our regular expressions but it at least
is is like gives you that feel that you
can kind of enter in this notation
that's very familiar also insta parse
can produce the two most popular formats
for expressing trees enclosure and when
it produces these trees that
automatically labels the nodes of the
tree with the rules from your grammar
the rule names from the grammar finally
and I think this might be one of the
most important features of insta parse
is it lets you work with any
context-free grammar and that actually
turns out to be relatively unusual most
parser libraries can only handle a
certain subset of context-free grammars
and it requires a fair amount of
specialist knowledge to figure out how
to take your grammar and turn it into
something that this particular library
can process insta parse is relatively
rare in in that you can really put in
any context-free grammar and it just
works so
one of the things I really want to
address here in this talk is how does
that sort of magic happen what is it
that insta parse does that these other
libraries aren't doing that lets it
handle any grammar and I'm going to
focus specifically on something called a
left recursive grammar because that's
something that other languages don't
handle well
first I need to explain to you for those
of you who aren't quite as familiar with
grammars the two main concepts in
grammars is this notion of alternation
so when you see that vertical bar that's
telling you you know that's sort of
defining that's like the word or so I'm
looking for the letter A or the letter B
that's alternation concatenation when no
symbol appears is saying I'm looking for
the letter A followed by the letter B
and those two concepts are really the
main ingredients in grammars there's a
few other things but they can
technically be built out of those so the
grammar that I'm gonna focus on here to
sort of show you how insta parse does it
where other parser libraries would kind
of break down is this left recursive
grammar this is probably the simplest
possible one it's the rule S is the
letter A or the rule s followed by the
letter A
it's called left recursion because the S
occurs on the left side of its
concatenation just to give you an idea
of how it's supposed to work and how
insta parse handles it on the upper
right I have entered that grammar and
insta parse and we can see that if you
feed the string AAA to that parser it
successfully generates the proper tree
structure which I've shown both in the
closure code and the actual kind of
visualized tree of what you get out of
that
now most libraries use a technique
called recursive descent recursive
descent sort of used these parsing rules
as a bunch of mutually recursive
components that call each other as they
attempt to resolve the parse the problem
is a recursive descent does not handle
these left recursive grammars here's
kind of at a high level why it doesn't
work you can imagine stepping through
the process like tracing through what a
recursive descent parser would do with
the string AAA it says okay well first I
got to call this you know my overall
rule is the rule s and I want to start
from the very beginning of the string
index zero and I want to do this parse
well the rule s expands to a or s a so I
got to do that parse starting from the
beginning of the string well this is an
or so I have to try both possibilities
so first I'm gonna try the a parser
starting at index zero and that works it
succeeds there is an a at the beginning
of the string but that's not enough to
consume the whole string we need to keep
going explore the other scenario the
other scenario is s followed by a and
well if you have a concatenation like
that the first step is to try s starting
from the beginning of the string and now
we're caught in an infinite loop right
so what I want to do now is kind of talk
about how insta parse handles this and I
know some of you in the audience
probably you know have no interest in
knowing all the details of how a parser
library is implemented and that's fine
but I hope you'll bear with me because I
really think there's some big ideas here
in the implementation of insta parse
that could actually be applied to other
programming paradigms so stay with me
I'm going to sort of describe it at a
high level and I think you'll come out
of it with some interesting ideas so the
engine that drives insta parse is
something called the gll algorithm and
even though it's not described this way
in the literature I tend to think of
this algorithm
as well as a dataflow network really I
think of it as a bunch of nodes that
each represent a parser component trying
to parse the string from a certain point
and other components are listening for
those results and waiting for those
results to be transmitted to them and
that's how I think of it as a network
now as I mentioned there's these two big
concepts alternation and concatenation
so let's sort of look at how that would
work in this dataflow network sense so
if you have a parser a or B that's our
alternation pattern basically it's gonna
set up and say okay I want to start off
the parser a and I want to start off the
parser B and I'm gonna listen for the
results when you find some results come
report that back to me
so that's the alternation they're pretty
straightforward now the concatenation
patterns a little trickier and the idea
this isn't quite right but the idea is
that if you're looking for a followed by
B you start off a node that says okay I
want to do parser a starting from the
beginning of the string starting from
index 0 when you get a result hand that
off to the guy who follows that which is
parser B so I'm going to start looking
for parser B starting at the next index
index 1 and when he succeeds then notify
me back then you've successfully found
an a followed by a B now the reason why
this doesn't quite work is because in
this particular example we know that the
letter A is always one character long so
we know that this B parser is always
going to start looking one character
later but in general we don't
necessarily know how long the first
parse result will be so we have to use
something I call the cat listener
pattern so the cat listener pattern
basically says we need to create this
object that is going to listen for that
first thing to complete that a parser
needs to complete and I'm going to be
listening for that and when a is done I
look at how much he consumed and then
I'm gonna kick off the beat parser
starting from that index and reporting
back to the main guy the one who started
it all so just to understand my notation
here and the cat listener I used that
triangle just to kind of denote that the
cat listener knows that when he gets a
result that a is done but the beast
still needs to be processed you can
almost think of it kind of like a
continuation the the dotted line the
dashed line is something that no values
actually travel along that's just there
to show the cat listener knows who
initially created him and when he moves
on to do that second when he starts the
node to do the second parse he knows who
need that result needs to get
transmitted back to okay now these
individual nodes in the network how do
we program those what kind of model are
they're using and it's almost like the
publisher subscriber model but with a
slight twist so usually when we think of
the pub/sub model for data flow we
imagine it a lot like a magazine
subscription so if I subscribe to a
magazine I expect them to send me all
the issues from this point forward so
the kind of model we're gonna use though
is a little bit different the idea is
that when I subscribe to this magazine
I'm basically saying send me all your
back issues and then start sending me
the new stuff also and it turns out that
this is the kind of node we need for
this particular network and it's
something you might want to think about
using in your own programs when you see
how it's useful here programming that is
quite easy the each of these nodes
basically just tracks who is listening
who needs to know these results and what
results that's found so far for this
parser component at this particular
point in the string and when a new
result comes in well that's really
obvious we just forward that information
to all the listeners but we also have to
keep track of it so that if a new
listener comes in we can send to that
new listener all the old results okay so
now we're ready to actually get in and
do kind of this high-level you know
understanding how insta parse would
handle that particular
left recursive grammar with the input a
a so we start off with something that I
call the top listener it's job is to
start off the parsing process listen for
full results and when it hears full
results transmit that back to the user
so it start it says ok that top level
rule is s so I'm going to start off the
rule s starting from index zero and I'm
listening for results and that little
notation there as indicating right here
is indicating that only complete parses
need to be transmitted up to the top
listener now the s parser expands to a
or s a so it creates that parser and
it's going to listen to it now I talked
about how insta parse automatically
labels all the nodes in the tree with
the rule name so when values flow from
here to here they have to get labeled
with that s label now this is the
alternation pattern right we have an A
or s a so we spin off to other parse
nodes a and s a starting from the
beginning of the string and I'm
listening to both those results now this
is effectively happening asynchronously
and that's the key you know one of the
key differences here is usually in
recursive descent style strategy we're
calling one of the things in the
alternation and it's a blocking call we
wait for the result and we get that
result then we try the other possibility
but we're spinning both of these things
off asynchronously and just waiting and
listening for the results so we don't
know which order these things are going
to be processed for the moment I'm going
to explore the rightmost node that's the
concatenation pattern right s followed
by a so we have to do that cat listener
thing I talked about earlier so we
create this cat listener this
continuation node that's going to listen
for the S parse and it knows that it
needs to follow up when it gets
something by looking for the a parse now
one thing that's kind of interesting
here is there's already a node in our
work for the S parser starting at index
zero so there's no need to create a new
one here we just listen to the one that
already exists in our network okay now
we can go down to the lower left the
lower left is actually a node that can
do something not just add more stuff to
the network it's looking for the
character a at the beginning of the
string and it finds it so it produces
this result saying hey I found the
letter A and I've consumed one letter so
far that information gets transmitted up
to the alternation node which in turn
gets transmitted up to the S node and
gets labeled in the process that
information gets relayed to the cat
listener and now the cat listener has to
do that extra work that it does spinning
off a new node to do the remaining part
of the parse so this is a little tricky
so I want to make sure this is clear
this new node the way it's created this
a right here comes from the second part
of the cat listener the one it's going
to be looking for the a at index one
because that's how many letters were
consumed so it's looking at that number
to get that the result that was created
so far becomes this label along this
flow path this value that's going to
need to get prepended to any result
that's discovered by this parser and
this dashed line here was the thing that
sort of remembered who was the original
creator and that's going to be the
destination for this arrow so all the
things about this node are constructed
from information that is available to
this cat listener okay well again this
is a node that can do something right
away and it says yes there is a letter a
at index one so now I've consumed
another letter for a total of two
letters that information gets
transmitted along that path with that
value prepended and that gets reported
back to that alternation node
which in turn flows up to the original s
Snowden gets labeled in the process and
now we have a full parse the and we know
it's a full parse because we've consumed
two letters and the string is two
characters long so that flows up to the
top listener it also flows over to that
cat listener but it doesn't matter at
that point because it's exhausted the
string so the cat listener is not going
to try to do anything with it so the top
listener now has a result and this is
the piece that's going to be reported
back to the user so we have our parse
now I happen to demonstrate this in
terms of showing the right node before
the left node down here in the
alternation but think for a moment about
what would have happened if the left
node node result had gotten computed
first so this result would have flown
would have flowed up to the s parser but
that cat listener wouldn't have been
attached yet then this one comes through
and starts up that cat listener node
that's why remember I said earlier that
values need to old values need to be
relayed to new listeners that attach
that's why is because if we didn't do
that then if this result got here before
the listener was attached that listener
would never know about it
that's why that's important okay now I
promised for those of you who weren't
particularly interested in parser
implementation that there was a big idea
here worth knowing so let's kind of
reflect on what we've seen what I think
is the big idea here is that synchronous
function calls and recursion has this
potential to lead to infinite loops on
the other hand if you use asynchronous
calls and dataflow you have the
potential to get a more robust algorithm
and I actually found this to be a really
big surprise when I started working on
this I have always thought of dataflow
as more being about a way to organize my
program and a slightly more flexible or
clear way I never really thought about
it as something that might actually give
added
algorithmic capability I mean that
really never occurred to me before so
that's what I think is one of these big
ideas here I think I can safely predict
that over the next few days you're going
to be hearing a lot about asynchronous
channels data flow right all these
things are things that are going to come
up a lot here at the closure conference
that's really hot right now and I hope
that when you hear those sorts of talks
over the next couple of days you keep
this in mind as an example of how this
can actually give you new power so I
always think it's kind of interesting to
hear a little bit about how open-source
libraries came about so I want to just
take a moment to tell you about the
story behind insta parse you might
assume that I use parsing really heavily
and my job or you might assume that I'm
just really passionate about parsing and
it turns out that neither of those is
actually the case the true story behind
insta parse is it's actually a
father-son bonding story so some of you
may already know this but I actually
homeschool my kids and in part that's
because I am deeply passionate about
math and computer science education and
I really wanted to be intimately
involved in that aspect with my kids and
my son in particular really took an
interest of programming and I started
him very young on first scheme and then
a closure and from age 8
I was incorporating college-level
computer science material into his daily
lessons well as you can imagine by now
he's already a very very sophisticated
programmer but I kind of consider it my
responsibility to keep coming up with
new challenges for him new things that
will really stretch his capabilities so
last year when he was 14 I called him
over and I said Alex we need to have a
talk today is the day you become a man
today you're gonna learn about monads so
as part of teaching them about monads I
gave him an exercise in writing a
monadic parser Combinator library that's
actually a relatively standard exercise
to kind of get your head around monads
so he did this parser Combinator project
and I was playing around with it looking
at it and you know it was well done but
I was really struck by that inability to
do left recursion you know it was it was
irritating and I thought to myself
surely someone has solved this by now
someone must have solved this so I went
asking around people I knew people
online who had written parser libraries
trying to find out more about how to
tackle that eventually I found a pointer
to this paper about the GL algorithm so
I decided to do what all good teachers
do I handed it to my son and said go
figure out how to write this in closure
so he did that and he implemented in
closure and as I was playing around with
that I was really struck by how much
more freeing it was I really was
noticeably more enjoyable to work with a
library that could understand any
grammar so I thought this would be a
excellent opportunity to role model the
process of going that last mile to turn
something into a library that's usable
by the community so we talked about hey
you want to just make this alive really
should we make this a library and put it
out there yeah let's do it
so we decided to do that together I kind
of took over the codebase and worked
mostly on optimizing it a little bit
brighting the documentation we work
together on the front ends I wrote the
EB NF front end heroes a BNF front end
it was it was a collaboration and it was
a lot of fun and that's the true story
behind inste parses we really just did
it for the joy of it now I know some of
you probably did come here to learn a
little more about
how to use instep arse versus how to
implement insta purse
so we have a little bit of time here
what I want to do I again I'm not going
to just show every feature but I think
it's useful to understand the overall
sort of workflow the experience of what
it's like to work with insta parse and
hopefully that'll motivate you to go off
and read the full tutorial on github so
the basic process with insta parse and
I'll go into each of these steps in a
little more detail is first you just
write down your grammar and then you
play around with it see how it looks you
figure out what information you want to
hide and then you figure out how you
transform that tree into the actual
thing you want so going back at the very
beginning of the talk I showed that
Scala map format so that's I mean so far
we've been looking at all these grammars
that are AAA BBB AAA and I know that
gets a little mind-numbing so here's a
slightly more real-world example it's
it's still simple enough you could
tackle it with other techniques I
understand but it's at least a little
more real so what we do is we start by
writing down the grammar and by
convention usually the top the first
rule is kind of a top-level rule we're
defining a map what's the rule for a map
well it's got the string map a left
paren and a bunch of key value pairs
separated by commas that's basically
what the first line says what's a key
value well it's a string and then an
arrow and then another string what's a
string well we can define that with a
regular expression so you can actually
use regular expressions in insta parse
to define your tokens then we feed this
to the parser function and the insta
parse namespace and I have this little
flag here Auto whitespace standard it's
a relatively new feature in insta parse
for grammars where the whitespace really
doesn't matter if it did matter you
would specify the whitespace as part of
the strings in your grammar rules and we
plug it in and we see what we get and
this is great you know this is rep
lorina development we get to try our
grammar see how it all works out
keep refining it and we basically get
the structure that we want but there's
these extra things in there like there's
the word map and that left paren it's in
there because those were part of the
structure but once we've got the overall
structure we don't need those words
anymore we don't need that left paren as
part of our tree so we come to step two
and insta parse we just put angle
brackets in our grammar around anything
that we want to hide that we don't
really care about appearing in our tree
so I've put angle brackets down below on
around the word map and around the paren
and around the arrow and now when we
rerun it you can see those things are
missing from the tree this is pretty
good this is you know getting really
close to what we want but ideally we
want to get it to an actual closure map
right that's our end goal well insta
parse includes a function called
transform and I mean you can use
whatever tools are you know you have all
these rich closure functions and tools
to manipulate data you can do this
however you want but you can use the
built in transform function which lets
you put for each node type in the tree a
function to be applied to the children
and this is done in kind of a bottom-up
transformation to the tree and when you
plug in these particular functions
associated with these keywords then you
get back the actual map you're looking
for so that's the basic idea you want to
get from Scala maps to closure Maps
here's three easy steps step one was
create the grammar step two was hide the
things you don't care about with the
angle brackets and step three is either
use the built in transform function or
whatever closure functions you want to
get this into the final closure form
that you're looking for okay time to
wrap things up two main ideas here from
this talk first is just telling you a
little bit about insta parse insta parse
is a lightweight tool for converting
context-free grammars into an executable
parser
and those parsers can be used to convert
strings into data but the other big idea
from this talk is that under the hood
insta parse in my opinion is a really
great example of the extra algorithmic
power you get when you use asynchronous
calls and data flow I'd like to finish
off with something I saw on the IRC
channel I actually have absolutely no
idea who these two people are I hope
they don't mind my using this in the
talk I figure since this out there in
the public on the internet it's totally
a fair to use it the point I wanted to
make with this slide is that when when
Alex and I started out making insta
parse we were genuinely trying to make a
tool that people would find useful but
what I think has taken us by surprise
and really delighted us is that for many
people it seems to not just be a tool
but it's something that has suddenly
made for them made grammars and made
parsing more accessible and more fun I
mean who would have ever thought parsing
is fun you know whoa and honestly out of
all the things that has happened with
insta parse the fact that people are
using it to find parsing this fun I mean
that's honestly what we're most proud of
so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
