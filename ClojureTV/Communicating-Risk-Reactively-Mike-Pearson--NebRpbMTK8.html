communicating risk reactively this
morning my name is Mike Pearson
you'll find me on Twitter and GMP 26 on
github if you want to look up the sort
of thing I'm interested in I don't
produce libraries but you're welcome to
see what I do this is where I work
it's the Center for mother mother trial
of again it's the Center for
mathematical sciences in Cambridge
I'm a support engineer I support a
number of mathematics education projects
I have recently been doing a lot of work
in health risk communication and I
produce the web tools the data
visualizations any animations that are
needed and recently I've been using
closure and closure script mostly
closure script to do this
and then start with a story which gives
you an idea of the problems with we
faced with communicating risk so at the
end of September my my daughter needed
to move flat from Leipzig she'd been
living in Leipzig and she was moving
back to London
and this was the vehicle we were going
to use and just before leaving I noticed
that it had a chip in the windscreen so
called out the repairman and he came the
first thing he wanted me to do was to
sign a form to say that his repair might
actually crack the whole windscreen I'm
sure you've been here before so I said
well what's the chance of that happening
well fifty-fifty he said
well I thought that was a little bit
higher and and I made that plain to him
and he said well maybe 70/30 still
rather too high I'm sorry you know if
that's the risk go I'm going back
indoors we'll call it a day I'm sorry to
call you out and then as I was going in
back into the house he said okay I'll
put fifty pounds on it not crackin and
at that point I knew that he knew that
the risk was very low so we needed to
have that dialogue you know
communicating risk is hard trying to put
a number to risk is really hard but we
all love a gamble and that can sometimes
provide the language we need to
communicate this kind of concept but
today I'm not talking about wind screens
I'm going to talk about child heart
surgery and about a project to
communicate the risks of a child heart
surgery to journalists to
professionalism to health professionals
and to parents I'm going to talk about
some of the history of child heart
surgery because that sets the scene for
the project and explains the philosophy
that we adopted I'm going to talk about
some of the data visualizations and how
they evolved some of the video
animations I'll show you a few clips and
and then I'll talk a little bit at the
end about the technology about closure
script react run figure wheel and dev
cars the usual kind of thing knows no
surprises there really so congenital
heart disease is the condition
responsible for blue babies I remember
where this would be in the late 50s I
was coming out of primary school and my
mother was meeting me and she she
pointed out a child in a tram and said
oh it's a blue baby and I was really
puzzled I didn't know what a blue baby
was and she said
you know it's probably not going to
survive is it's very sad and the problem
is that the heart for whatever reason
has developed in a strange way sometimes
it's a hole in the heart it could be
half a heart but for whatever reason the
heart is not pumping not able to pump
blood around both lis the lungs and the
body efficiently and the oxygenated
blood appears blue that gives the baby a
bluish tinge these days you're very
unlikely to see a blue baby in the
streets because of improvements in child
heart surgery so CH D affects about 6
babies in every 1,000 live births that's
roughly what it looks like now not far
from here in in central bohemian in
communist-era czechoslovakia between the
years of 1952 and 1979 it was the law
that an autopsy had to be performed on
every child that died nothing could be
done for these children
there was no available heart surgery for
them at the time but that but the data
collection was was meticulous and so we
have a huge amount of detail of all
these conditions from this area which is
completely unrepeatable is it's what
happens if you do nothing obviously it's
a very detailed picture but in aggregate
it looks like this this is the survival
that we can expect so 14 percent of
those children are going to die in the
first week twenty five percent will be
dead by five months and only 67 percent
make it through to early adulthood
capable in her recent book open hearts
says making a blue child pink is one of
the great stunts of modern medicine and
she talks in the her book about the the
enormous lengths that parents those
early pioneer parents went to to to try
and give their children the chance and
this so the first heart surgery took
place in Baltimore in 1944 some early
shunt operations quite primitive and
those were taken up later in the UK by
Russell Brock he's melt or he became
late lord broch he was interviewed years
later and he talked about his first six
operations in 1952 and he said they went
died died died survived died died sorts
of seventeen percent survival rates in
1952 in modern terms I was born in 1952
but without a heart defect fortunately
at least not one that I know of so after
that there was rapid progress in the
post-war years
enormous stride was made strides were
made hot and long machines were
developed previously you had to fund two
people together to be able to do
open-heart surgery
now you could you could wire up a
husband one machine post-operative care
improved though was very intensive care
units oxygen tents incubation units all
that helped in diagnosis the early x-ray
fluoroscopy those green screens with
continuous x rays that was the early
diagnosis and of course it was
incredibly dangerous high high dose
rates and that that's given way to
digital ultrasound scan imaging and good
diet diagnosis is really important
because that allows surgeons to
anticipate what they're going to see
before they go in fewer surprises means
fewer deaths so by 1989 this was the
picture in the UK the 30 day
post-operative survival rates had now
risen to 81 percent but in Bristol the
rate was stuck around 63 percent maybe
70 percent in several years so the
question is was this low rate in Bristol
just used a chance or was there
something going on there that shouldn't
be well the press didn't think so and a
lot of parents in Bristol didn't think
so
and there was an anesthetist who was
working with the surgeons who was
seriously worried about the procedures
that were taking place so in the late
night 1980s early 1990s a public inquiry
was commissioned to look into what was
going on in Bristol you might start with
a data visualization to see whether this
was just by chance and this was one of
the data visualizations that were
produced it's a very simple plot of
percentage mortality at each hospital
against the volume of cases that that
hospital trees now you'd expect
decreasing variation with in percentage
mortality with the volume of cases and
in fact it's a binomial inand you can
plot in advance where the 1 and 2
standard deviation thresholds should be
so that gives you the 95 percent funnel
and the 99.8% funnel here you'd expect
95 percent of the hospitals to lie
inside that blue in a dark blue zone you
can see that rather more than 95% of
have escaped
and that's because there's no risk
adjustment here we're not adjusting for
the fact that some hospitals take on the
more difficult cases than others so
there this diagram will show some will
appear to show over dispersion of the
hospitals
you can also perhaps see that there's a
volume effect here as as the volume
increases so the mortality rate appears
to decrease which is probably due to the
fact that surgeons that do more cases
more operations get better as it lets
Bristol so way outside the 99.8% zone
and it's this is a good indication that
the inquiry was justified and and and
and of course then you need to go into a
much more detailed find out what's going
on okay so one of the recommendations of
that inquiry was that data collection
should be standardized that meant
looking at what was happening to all
these children before the operations
making sure that the survival data was
collected at 30 days and that it was all
standard across all hospitals so by 2010
there was now a bunch of really good
data available and the statistical model
could be developed and the clinical
operations Research Unit sat at UCL
obliged and they produced this model
it's it gives you the probability of
death after within 30 days after surgery
given certain measurable facts that you
can ascertain about a child before
before surgery age weight and a bunch of
boolean conditions 33 boolean conditions
you wouldn't use this to communicate the
risk to the parent this this model only
makes
at an aggregate level for the whole
Hospital and certainly it's not the sort
of thing that you talk to parents about
at all it doesn't make sense in that
context but given that data the the
Audit Commission then produced this this
graphic summary of the 13 hospitals that
were that we're actively doing
operations in in 2013 this is based on
the previous three years of data this
people found this quite opaque it was
pretty difficult to understand the
health professionals could understand it
I'm not sure we seem to be missing her
we seem to be missing your gray zone but
one of the hospital's the LGI has
dropped below the white area into what
should be a gray zone and that caused a
problem the leads General Infirmary was
picked up by some of the newspapers and
well I mean if you think about it this
the the central zone is the 95% area
we'd expect one in 20 hospitals to to be
outside that area and here we've got
about 13 hospitals so one in 20 about
one year in three you would expect
somebody to be dropping out of that zone
so it's not totes so totally unexpected
but the press picked up on that in a
rather unwarranted on unwarranted
version so that created a need for
communications better communications and
these the people that were involved in
the project Christina poggle at the top
there she needed to revise this is the
statistical model because new data was
being collected in the hospitals and and
so a second generation who was needed
and she put in for funding to the NIH
our and and tacked on at the end of the
project
proposal to communicate the risks using
a web tool and she tacked on a focus
group to make sure that we were
communicating to the right people using
the right methods and the NIH our said
great do it but make sure that you start
with the focus groups have focus goes
right from the beginning and make them
drive the project and that's what
happens so Christina put together this
team sense about science were
responsible for facilitating the focus
groups and they're fantastic they have
all that they had all the contacts that
were necessary with health professionals
with with the parents with charities and
anybody who is interested King's College
London were there to be the
psychologists and determine whether the
web tool that we generated was was doing
the job whether whether people were
really understanding better through use
of the web tool run through just reading
the paper reports so there are sort of
a/b tests going on there at the end
David and Christina were they started
stations and I had the job of building B
with the tools so I give you now a
little clip of the kind of explanation
that we ended up with if I can make it
work we would not expect all hospitals
to have the same survival rate so it
doesn't make sense to simply compare one
Hospital survival rate to another's
instead we use the statistical formula
to calculate the predicted range of
survival for the children that Hospital
is treated which depends only on the
complexity of the medical problems of
those children we then compare a
hospital survival rate to its predicted
range how do we interpret this if the
survival rate lies in the dark blue area
the predicted range then there is no
evidence that the chances of survival of
children at that Hospital were different
from what was predicted
if the survival rate turns out to lie in
the light blue area this means there is
some evidence that the chances of
survival at that hospital were different
from that predicted by the formula if
the survival rate lies outside either
blue area this means that there is
strong evidence that the chances of
survival at that hospital were different
from that predicted by the formula we
were going to go around a cycle an
iterative cycle four times each time
around the cycle we would have two focus
groups one with parents one with
professionals and our job really and my
job specifically was was to listen since
about science would be posing questions
at each phase based on the previous
iteration and and then we would listen
to see what the parents how the parents
reacted so to those that iteration I
think it's really important actually for
the the technologists the developers to
be involved in those focus groups you
don't have to do anything except listen
but it's amazing how that firsthand
communication of of the of what is not
understood helps you make proposals for
the next generation and I think it's
it's break it's good to be in there
right at the start rather than wait for
somebody else to write up their their
suggested solutions which may not be
technically informed and and you can
probably come up with something better
and provided that's agreed by everybody
else I think it's a really good thing to
do so each time now and we would drop a
copy of the next iteration on github
we'd drop a copy on the web and we'd go
round again so that the next few slides
what I want to do is to go back to that
rather opaque graphic that I showed
which wasn't really well understood
and I'm going to kind of distill what
the focus groups told us and and I'll
start again with the funnel plot and we
didn't use the funnel plot in in the
final graphic but this is a good place
to start so this is a slightly different
data set it's now a New York cardiac
surgery and you'll see that we've
colored in the main 95 percent region
with with the darker blue and then we've
phrased it out for the 99.8% region with
a lighter blue going to the white that
was a suggestion from the focus groups
that there should be this obvious
coloring we've also removed the median
and the mean line the average line
that's what's really important the
psychologists told us that people people
react to that middle line they fixate on
it if you are taking your child into a
hospital and it's above that middle line
you know it's an above-average hospital
don't you that's the one you want to go
to you don't want to go to a below
average hospital well actually all those
hospitals inside the blue area there are
totally equivalent this is just chance
where they lie in that blue area so um
that middle line is is to be avoided
really that median line Mike Michael
Gove if you remember said when he was
Secretary of State for Education that he
wanted all schools to be above average
which doesn't make sense but actually
that's how we think that's how many
people think okay there's plenty wrong
with this diagram still we need to we
need to label all the hospitals better
just dots that doesn't mean anything so
one thing we can do is rotate it that
just allows us to label the dots it's
now no longer a plot by case volume it's
just sorted by case volume so hospitals
with more cases are at the bottom the
funnels have become a bit Wiggly because
of that sort and there's still no risk
adjustment here so we have to do
something like this we have to move
hospitals to the right or to the left
and adjust their ranges according to the
caseloads according to the children that
they operate on well actually these are
these are adults but when we go to
children that's what's going to happen
so we end up with a diagram a little bit
more like that and you and you can see
that that now we don't get the over
dispersion there there are rather more
of the black dots inside the central
dark area then it's roughly behaving as
we would expect so that gets us to what
we ended up with in the web tool it's a
table where the graphic associated in
each row
what we found was was that in the focus
groups some people would use the numbers
some people preferred the numbers to the
graphic some people prefer the graphic
to the numbers some people use both so
it's really good to have them both there
you can see this
it's a sortable table we can sort by the
number of operations so that allows us
to make the but the fun will point up or
point down and we can also sort by the
alphabetical order of the hospital if
you can't find the hospital you'll
you're looking for what
can't do is sort by survival rate
because if you did that you would get a
leap table and a lead table is a really
really bad idea
the press will pick up on the league
table immediately and start looking at
those middle orders where it's
completely random and an elite table
just gives you spurious data that you
you just don't want to see out in the
press now listen this graph had a lot of
popups in it there was a lot of detailed
information you could get to by drilling
down but you can't guarantee that people
are going to go there so it all has to
be up front in a table that will start
the statisticians wanted us to make sure
that we could show the whole survival
range from naught to a hundred percent
because just concentrating on that top
ninety four percent to ninety nine
percent gives a rather incorrect view of
how of the differences between all these
hospitals so being able to adjust that
slider gives you a slightly more
balanced picture although it's
completely useless for if when you do
want to make a comparison between the
hospitals some of the parents in one of
the focus groups notice that we were
being very very careful to to avoid
comparisons that were inappropriate
between these hospitals and and they
suggested very sensibly that we should
look at individual hospitals and perhaps
make that the primary display rather
than the comparison table and that's
what we did in the end we we added a
marked Navigation this is co.design open
maps and I used the Java interrupts to
to get in there through the mix-ins it
was a bit cocky but it works so it's fun
this is Great Ormond Street Hospital you
can you can see that last this is 2015
you can see that last year they
did extremely well they're above the
99.8% so event 99.8% banned the two
standard deviation band showing a
ninety-nine percent survival rate
significantly better than you would
expect if the model was correct model
may be incorrect but it's quite likely
that this hospital is doing something
that others should pick up on so perhaps
an investigation is warranted here at
the other end we should be finding out
what are they doing that can be shared
with other hospitals so the final stages
of the project the cycles three and four
were all about levels of explanation we
had a lot of scientific details a lot of
text a lot of too much text really and
we needed to improve at least the layout
of that text so everywhere we we
extracted frequently asked questions
some immediate answers to those
questions it was headline yep headline
summary and detail is roughly how it
went all the way through we needed to
explain some terms like survival rate
whenever you introduce things like
percentages they're always difficult
because because people do not naturally
ask the question what is this a
percentage of and we notice quite often
this 80% survival rate was being
interpreted as an 80% survival rate for
one child not for the whole Hospital
which was not what it what we were
talking about at all so we had to be
very careful with the terminology rare
we needed key points and we extracted
these from the animations made a little
graphic display of four key points which
summarized exactly what what we were
trying to say and and that was taken up
by the press straightaway so these key
points were actually other things that
hit the headlines I'm going to show you
another clip now and then in this clip
you'll see that there's a mock-up of a
Monte Carlo simulation which is going
trying to go into more detail of how
that predicted range is calculated and
this mock-up was initially coded again
in as a closure script animation in ROM
and then we gave it to the after effect
after effects animators to improve on we
calculate the width of the predicted
range so that the overall survival rate
for the hospital lies within it 19 times
out of 20 given the chance is calculated
for these children using the formula
let's watch this in action
we can keep on considering possible
outcomes for these 100 children we
calculate the width of this wider
interval the extended predicted range so
that the overall survival rate for the
hospital lies within it 998 times out of
a thousand
again let's watch this in action the
white squares are children dying okay
and the metaphor we were using there was
possible futures so it's a little bit
like well it is a Monte Carlo simulation
where each in each simulation run you're
predicting a possible future and you use
that to work out the ranges that are
likely to happen the risk factors were
fixed for each that was a hundred fixed
children all the way through with a
certain risk profile we had to be very
careful with with vocabulary when we
were talking about these predicted
ranges in the fact that there was some
irreducible uncertainty in that range
we used the term chance factors to
explain why it was there why couldn't we
narrow it down and say precisely what
the survival rate was going to be this
didn't make sense to a lot of parents
and they thought it chance seems to
imply accidental something that could be
avoided which it can't be so that was no
good we ended up with the term
unforeseeable factors not a statistical
term but it worked it communicated what
we needed to say similarly the
statistical model we talked about that a
lot
ah what's a statistical model nobody has
any clue at all so that was no good but
what did work was to use the word
formula everybody meets formula in
school
just inputs in outputs out that's
exactly what was going on here and it
worked
it's not a term again that statisticians
will be comfortable with but it works
and that's what we ended up using so
take-home message if your data
scientists asked for funding for
communications as well as for funding
for the hard science you may get it take
a bit now the stock is is nothing
special leo the only thing that I
suspect you're not familiar with on and
probably on is is run which is another
one of the possible react rappers I like
it it's very simple it's it's functional
it seems to be very adaptable as well
you can adapt it in all kinds of ways
just by changing the mix ins which get
you into the react life cycle so if you
need to add in JavaScript libraries it's
not hard and he was really not pleasure
to use that I mean the great the great
benefit here is that you can code the
whole thing up in closure and your brain
only has to stay in one language and for
somebody of my age that's fantastic
okay the rappelled fantastic big wheel
fantastic dev cards I thought that was
really good as well just the ability to
throw up lots and lots of user
interfaces and test them out all at once
it's it's it's like a unit test for for
visual stuff that's fantastic I ended up
with IntelliJ and cursive rather than
Emacs I started with Emacs I tried a few
other things but my fingers these days
don't do Emacs so this was easier ok
another diagram that looks very similar
to the one that you saw before but this
time we're looking at the reactive data
flow within the application I don't know
whether there's any connection between
these two but it seems like the same
diagram describes two different levels
of the projects it's very strange
we have inputs coming in from the
browser from and and and there's a lot
of data associated with influence we
have to filter them we have to we have
to turn them into useable gestures and
and from those gestures recreate actions
and the actions then change the state of
the system and I'm going faster than
that in clicking and and then we can
drop different copies of the state very
efficiently use it using using closure
making logs making undo reduce tax we
actually use this to send those logs
over the wire so that the psychologist
could drop the logs drop the states into
your closures in into a Google
spreadsheet and playback sessions test
sessions with their subjects later in
another version of the application it's
quite a useful thing to be able to do as
the state changes you then use rum to to
watch those state changes and there are
various technologies various ways we can
do that we can we can look at parameters
changing we can look at atoms changing
we can look at state within atoms
changing we can make functions that are
derivatives of a number of atoms and
look at that changing there's a whole
bunch of options there and to be honest
I think that is all perfectly sufficient
to the well to the needs I have or
anyway talked a little bit about about
this it's perhaps a little bit
contentious to have not keep all your
state in the application state but I
think there are cases where it makes
sense to have some local transient state
things like event handlers if your
attachment in the event handler for a
JavaScript library that react should not
know about you done wasn't log lat
you're never going to want to undo it
because next time the thing gets lonely
it's going to come in through the act
anyway it makes sense to keep that state
locally and and Ron gives us
local variables mixing which makes that
reasonably straightforward def cards
this is a screen showing the margin
convention example of d3 I don't know
whether you're familiar with that but d3
is is an excellent JavaScript graphics
library the only problem is that it's
not written in closure speeds it's not
written in react so it has this
wonderful jQuery like mechanism for
binding data to the Dom which i think is
perhaps to be avoided but apart from
that it's a beautiful functional library
I into it very often to find out how to
do things it's this is an SVG example
and the margin convention example is
really concerned with making sure that
if you give a scatterplot a bunch of
data that then the axes are going to
automatically be be calculated and the
decimal places that you're going to use
to to indicate the numbers on along the
side are going to work so in Def cards
you can put up you know ten of these
different examples with ten different
data sets checking that it's behaving
perfectly also in Def cards you can
check that's you can just do unit tests
so that this is testing that that's the
Kwan's outcome calculations for
binomials are agreeing with the same
numbers that come out of our you can
patch in any missing things features of
react so as SVG is not totally not fully
supported by by react there are a few
little holes in there one of the things
that in that previous song I just showed
of the margin convention there are
arrows on the end of some of the paths
and they have to be on they have to be
aligned orientated with the path so you
need this oriented Auto attribute that's
missing in certainly in the copy of
react that I had and this is a little
run mixin
which fairly simply allows you to pass
that back in when we eventually
implements it we can just remove the
mixing and it will still work video
those clips that I showed you we wanted
closed caption videos this one closed
captioning as well across all browsers
and you need some sort of support for
that video jeaious does the job but it's
that's another little awkward library
when you're using it with react because
it's if you you have to give it a video
element and then you say go initialize
that video element but it immediately
wraps that video element in a parent
element of its own devising so I was
getting into all sorts of Thompson's
trying to understand why react was
complaining about this I had to
eventually package it up like this so
that VR knows about the video container
but it but the video element is
completely hidden from react for the
future I'd like to code the whole thing
in closure I'd like to go the whole way
with CSS as well especially for for CSS
which is which should be localized to
the component so I'm looking for a good
CSS modules story this is one that I've
picked on self on and and it seems to
work if you go to Matthew bootays github
and find his library there I added a
little a little tester which which is
just me coding up an example JavaScript
implementation just to see whether I
could do the same using his library and
he put it up on on his distribution as
well I did promise to talk a little bit
about our I'm not going to say very much
but our does have an API
it's available if you go to this site
open CPU org you can run our on a server
and provide a JSON API and that's of
course closure callable from closure
from dojo scripts wherever and you can
do the reverse if you're in our our
studio you have a browser inside your
development environments and you can run
animations in that so if you've got some
some research package and you want to
visualize it you're not limited to just
JavaScript or the things like ggplot
that our art provides we can code up
enclosure scripts using this HTML
widgets package that hardly wickham
wrote just drop-in replacements for
anything written in JavaScript nobody
does not as far as I can see but
certainly in my future visualizations
I'll be I'll be trying to do that so
what are the chances of closure scripts
still being in use in five years time I
don't know I put fifty pounds on it and
a final note slightly over time I'm
afraid capable capable as parents still
exist I mean the parents that came along
to our focus groups were were great they
were willing to put in a huge amount of
time it's really real privilege to work
with them this was a classic bad example
and bad idea of an icon to represent a
dead girl and they did point out that it
looked a little bit like a ghost not
appropriate at all but yeah it was good
to work with those those parents they
were at there they were super thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
