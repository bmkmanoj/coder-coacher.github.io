before at all hopefully more that just
raise their hands if that's the basement
oh that's good initially I saw the cool
topics here and I was like well there's
so many interesting things that are meta
level you know the future closure the
social ramifications of closure all
these amazing new libraries that you
book arming and presenting is like well
but I think it's actually really good to
talk about zippers because they are
there esta said they're a gem enclosure
they are something that is not only very
useful but incredibly elegant and simple
in fact that's you know pretty much what
I want to talk about zippers are cool
they're very very cool yeah a few of you
have seen that episode but they really
are what's uppers are for those of you
aren't too familiar with it they're the
generic tree walking and editing insofar
as closure as it edits things API there
a purely functional data structure which
is actually very very interesting very
cool you know all of closures data
structures are really functional
functional mutable the great thing about
zippers is that they they take that to
another level of complexity they're
built on top of closures they're built
on top of the vectors and maps and they
provide a lot of really interesting
abilities they're fast they're extremely
elegant as we're going to spend some
time looking at the zipper source code
because it's so simply you can actually
just talk about it in a few minutes and
see how it works and i really encourage
you
look through that library it's a very
good example of how much you can do with
how a little closure if you stop and
think about it and realize it's what you
can do so the API for zippers is a tree
and a location in the tree target a
specific node and then you have a zipper
that's all that zipper is when you think
of it is your you have a tree and you
have a focus node in the tree from an
API perspective will get in the
implementation a little bit later on so
when you create a zipper you call
function you get back your zipper and
then you have a location and then every
movement since the purely functional
structure actually hands you back a new
zipper very fast structure sharing with
the old one as all common structures do
so you've got some functions for
movement around the tree you can go left
left most previous right right remotes
next on these are just for navigating
through trees up root down previous and
next are interesting because they do a
depth first walk of the tree so it's
really easy to do tree walks can you do
that visit every node of the tree very
useful and for editing you have a wide
variety of ways to edit the tree again
these are not real edits they return a
copy of the zipper shared structure so
it's a very fast copy and an interesting
note about these is they all under the
hood really used to replace so it's a
great example in the closure API of how
they how you can still build
functionality upon other functionality
you start out with one editing function
then build all the others in terms of
that will take
function works so you want to start
using zippers how do you get one what
data structure can you turn into a
zipper what includes built-in
constructors for xml for nested vectors
and nested sequences enclosure you know
these are the built-in data structures
and obviously if you put them inside
each other they end up being trees
there's built-in functions that turn
these structures into zippers you can
also create zippers on an ad hoc basis
it's very easy you just passed it three
functions and we'll go over kind of how
this works we get a more than flotation
zippers you pass it branch how does it
know if I'm sitting on a branch children
how do I get the children of this node
and make note which is how do I actually
create the my basic representation of
this and we'll give it that exactly on
this page so you can look right up there
that first function or that first
expression rather is the is actually
from the closure source it's how to
create a is the function that creates a
zipper from the vector or a vector of
nested vectors you can see the first two
function that pass it so going back up
remember we have to pass it a branch
function just pass a vector is it a
vector if it's a vector than its branch
can have children if it's a not a vector
then that means it's a leaf node because
it doesn't have other children it so
great use of you know important thing
about closure and functional programming
is using first class functions pass
around past functionality zippers
leverage that heavily which i think is
why there's such a great functional gem
so the second thing you pass a sequence
how do you get the children you just
call sync on that vector and it gives
you a sequence of children that's all
you need to do then you pass it a
function is defined in line here which
is pretty simple the bulk of it is
actually just preserving metadata it
takes a node and children and it returns
a vector of the children and that's how
you build a node in a vector tree if you
have a bunch of children and you want to
export that to your vector vectors
format you just call effect around the
children all the rest of that whole
function is just carrying through
metadata so that's really the meat of it
and so it's something very similar goes
on with the the sequence constructor for
zippers is it a sequence you just passed
identity for the children because it all
you need is a sequence of children kind
of me the same thing with the to
construct childhoods and then XML one's
a little bit more complicated we'll go
into great detail here because it
depends on how XML is represented after
you call from the XML library if you
call XML parse it depends it creates a
structure with some vectors and maps
containing that structure and that's
what you use to construct it basically
just has a map with a keyword tag for
some content and so it builds it on that
the cool thing is that I don't talk
about this little bit more cool thing is
that zippers are built on top of
existing structures I actually realize
they do have a slide for that later on
so what does this mean what's why what's
so interesting about that it's a tree a
1080p I doesn't every language have a
tree adding an API of some sort what
makes closure is special and the reason
is again it's purely functional it's um
it's just really elegant to look at it's
a great data structure to read to learn
from as well as to use so it comes from
a paper by cuit the zipper in 1997 was
published in the journal functional
programming and a the quote theory
explains it explains a simple solution
we're tree editing is completely local
the handle on the day to not be in the
original root of the tree but rather the
current position in the tree and then
ends up being really important if you
have a normal tree in an immutable data
structure and you want to modify
something pretty far down in the tree so
the example over there on the right I
want to modify the note on the section
of the last level I have to create say
it's a vector tree I have to create
three new vectors just to modify that
one node so the cost ends up being
proportional to the depth of the tree I
have to do at least that many operations
Hewitt in his paper says it's log of n
where n is the number of nodes in the
tree that's assuming a balanced street
but actually trees can be pretty
unbalanced sometimes so you may even end
up a lot worse than that as far as
performance editing the lower nodes in
the tree the zipper it looks like what
we see on the right the node you're
editing because remember you have the
target know that your cursors on bigger
as you go through your treaty is always
the current node you don't have to
modify anything else all the rest of the
tree above the node you're editing is
tucked away into that little path black
box and we'll unpack
later and see how that looks but
whenever I edit a zipper it always
happens at the top level of the data
structure and that's why it's a zipper
cuit talks on paper it's like turning a
glove inside out so you can always the
point at which you're interested is
always local to you and you have a easy
handle on it which is important for me
the immutable structure because then we
get into that you're you're always
updating the top level another benefit
is it's less work enclosure so if you
say you're had a bunch of vectors for
your restore nutrient and you want to
edit one of them but maintain the rest
of the structure you have to do a bunch
of nested associations and actually
spent a lot of time this is the cleanest
I could get it maybe when you can come
that way you can use the threading
operator that that actually tends to
obfuscate it what's really going on with
the with the multiple associations so if
I have a tree and I want to edit the
third level down you need to basically
sail off each level and then associate
back as I update each level indexing in
indexing into the structures for the
nodes that you want to update in each
vector whereas zippers and this is
actually one of the cases where the
threading macro is can lead to code
obfuscation I believe that it's really
useful here which is where you just pass
it the zipper down right dumb down right
right right and then you edit it now by
the way edits that tree that we looked
at over here you can see so down right
down right right right and then that
brings us to the node we want
and they call root and you have your
tree and is done so it's much easier
from a closure syntactic respective API
is very nice it's even better to than
just what's described in his paper in
that it's implemented as a thin
functional wrapper around the existing
structures if I created a tree from a
vector if I create a zipper from the
vector tree it doesn't you know take a
long time and process the whole tree to
reformat it into a zipper structure it
actually takes those functions that I
pass it and adds them as some metadata
their uses so it doesn't do any work
until it needs to it just wraps the
existing structures you're not
completely when you pass it you know one
of the many formats in XML tree a vector
tree a sequence tree it doesn't
deconstruct that and rebuild it as a
zipper it just applies the zipper
functions on top of that it is a really
beautiful you so first class functions
in functional programming highly
encourage you to read the code for that
also the code itself is great if you are
a learning closure and you want to see
what good idiomatic closure looks like
it uses metadata to get effect I always
kind of wondered you know metadata
sounds really cool but what can you
actually use it for they wouldn't use
data for great example here because the
structure of how to edit a zipper is
kind of metadata when contrasted with
the actual contents of the zipper treat
these destruction destructuring the
great effect to make the co concise
we'll take a look at or later higher or
programming I mentioned using
first-class functions passing minute and
as I mentioned reusing building a few
primitives the replace primitive
building the rest of the editing
functions off that so dignity that
actually how the data structure works
the fundamental unit of a zipper is a
location a location has two components
the node itself which if I mean the
vector tree is just a vector that is my
note is the current part of the tree i'm
at or if it's the leaf than it's
actually the value or if i'm going to
sequence treats the node is a sequence
or one of the actual leaf values and the
path is everything else about the tree
the siblings and the parents of the note
i'm at it's stored as a vector so a
location is just the vector of node and
path to element vector and then metadata
on that two element vector stores the
functions we talked about how to define
a zipper you passing a function that
specifies how you find children if I'm
specifies how I know if I'm a branch
functional specifies how do I build
build a node when i'm doing the zipper
that that's all metadata on the location
so what's in a path path is pretty
simple it's just the map so the map
contains the L key word there contains
the vectors notes to my left the are key
word there contains a vector of notes to
my right p-notes contains all apparent
nodes in the tree so I can get back to
them when I want to travel back up the
tree we're not lost half contains all
the previous paths so as I step down the
tree when I'm on the route no there is
no path it's actually nil starting out
as you go down the tree then I add a
path and then when I go down another
time I add another path to the end that
was the previous one so that makes it
very efficient to travel up and down the
tree and then you have a flag which may
be absent if it hasn't been changed
which indicates that location has been
edited which gets important because
going to go back up the tree and it
actually calls that create note function
and allows the
and creates whatever data structure your
tree is based on an associate it with
the core of the tree structure so this
is the actual function to move down the
tree and I thought about you know making
a complex slide and saying you know all
the things it does but it turns out that
the code is actually really easy to read
so I thought would be beneficial I think
reading code is a great exercise so I'll
just run through here and done show you
guess what this function does so I have
a tree then I want to go down so start
out with a win if I'm not a branch
return nail because that means that I'm
retreated no children which doesn't make
any sense and branch is just a utility
function actually goes looks up the
metadata and calls the function from
ranging so if it's a vector it calls is
it a vector if it's a sequence tree just
calls it a sequence and then we just
pull you'll see on the let node path set
set that to log the location that's just
pulling out using D structuring the node
in the path from the location path is a
two element vector that's just grabbing
my note and grabbing my path next line C
and seen sscs for the children of
location again uses a metadata function
to pull out the children at the location
which in most cases which defined
sequence on the if this were a vector
treat and I get the first children child
and all the following children so when
there are additional children because
there has to be you know multiple
children move down we don't have things
with just one in them then
then we associate with metadata so we
can keep remember her new location has
to still have all the metadata so we
just with meta and then met at the end
there is just preserving the metadata
then we construct a new vector C becomes
our new node the child becomes the new
node because when you go down and always
batum to the rightmost node our notes to
our left our empty vector there are no
notes who are left currently the parent
notes it just gets the the existing
parent nodes if there are any and adds
adds the note that we just came from to
it the know that we let up there when we
pull out of our original zipper
structure pull that out add it to the
Pinot's vector and then path front path
just add in the path because they
actually get nested as you go so it's
always you call just the parent the path
the parent path is always just the path
as you're going down tree and then that
children to the right is just the list
of notes the other children we have and
then so we go back up we can see how
this comes back we
this is pretty much the same it's got a
nice destructuring statement there you
pull out the node then you pull out all
the individual elements of the path map
that will use the parent path apparent
nodes whether it's changed or not so if
if there are parent notes they're not
paranoid obviously we can't go up if
there are parent notes and we just
grabbed the first one of the paranoids
peak parent node peak p nodes and assign
that is our parent node then again we
preserve the metadata wrap it in a with
meta and if it's changed then we call
our make note function and can cap the
children on the left and the children on
the right and you and you and that will
give us a new element of our tree if
we're in a vector tree that will give us
a new vector it becomes the new level of
that tree and if it's not changed then
it's even simpler you just the parent
node in the parent path go right back up
so very efficient it's all pretty much
constant time operations for what's
involved in here moving sideways in the
tree pretty simple so going all the way
through the shot yeah this kid but I
want to actually go into a ripple and
show you how some of this stuff works it
is very much the same concept just
basically pulling from the left to the
right as you traverse the tree
updating entry basically you just
associate a new note for you construct a
new location with the new node and you
set the flag change to true on the path
so that when you start rolling back up
you know to call to make note function
and recreate it and associated so tell
me skip from there and show you the
record room
open to my Linux
BMX running
apparently it changes the screen size
just miss Fellowes
right so I'm instructing you
Muse ever just to show you how easy it
is to have data structure
there's some nice and nested vectors
their communities since the the other
examples they use in the closure of
these operators that those end up being
functions so it's easier to read over
you see numbers are BEC retreat then
because it for one
yep
Oh
just
oh sorry sorry
ranter but the hope gotcha gotcha gotcha
sorry like so
yeah I got okay sorry about that so then
you can look at just look at our zipper
there and there you have it it's just a
vector the first part is the node the
second part is the path the path is nil
because we're at the root of our tree
but let's just try i'm just going to
definite so we can come back to it easy
if we want go down
now you see we have more interesting
past what's so the note on now is the
vector of the numerous 12 and then we
have a path so let's take a closer look
at the path
doesn't pretty great but because either
we have left is empty the parent node is
our original note the parent path is no
because there's no path to the root and
Ferb are siblings to the right we have
three and then the vector 45 so you can
see our basically the reason of Newton's
just to show you it's very simple to
interact with these trees and they're
not some are clinging arcane black box
data structure you don't have to know
all the structure to use them but
there's nothing intimidating here you
should feel very free to use DC and to
just explore how they work so what can
you use trees for well pretty much
anything you know where you need a tree
I think a zipper is the logical place to
use a logical thing to do with that
enclosure and
like one example of what I'm doing is
I'm ready in a word processor that
stores the whole state as a tree and one
interesting thing about the goal of this
is that you can scroll backwards and
forwards in time as you get it so like
when you're editing a movie you can move
to any point the movie so shouldn't you
be able to just simply have a another
dimension of scroll to scroll backwards
important time so it knows it's good
idea or not or if it'd be useful to
people but I implemented that using
zippers and it actually worked very well
because it's a purely functional data
structure they did all the heavy lifting
for me I store my document as a zipper
you save each state there's no overhead
of memory because it's shared structure
all the way wherever it can and then you
just have multiple zippers one that
represents you state of the document and
then you can edit the document at any
point in that by manipulating and zipper
that's actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
