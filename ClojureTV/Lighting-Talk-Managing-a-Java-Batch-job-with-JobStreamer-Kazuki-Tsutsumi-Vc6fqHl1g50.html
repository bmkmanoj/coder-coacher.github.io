Japan and this is my first quarter kanji
first I'd like to briefly introduce the
Japanese committees Japanese Crozier
communities recently I seem Crozier is
one of the hottest language in Japan
there are a lot of communities and study
groups and even companies that adapt
Crozier so we have a chance to go to
Japan please contact me or Adam
today I'd like to introduce job streamer
ioss we have developed in corrosion
service Rima is a distributed job
execution environment for job watch by
using it you can easily create and
execute java jobs why we develop two
jobs taurima has anybody here use java
but okay juwatch is a specification for
batch applications for the java platform
it is defined in GSR 3-5-2 in order to
use Java you have to you have to
implement two components first you have
to define a bad structure as an XML file
and second you have to implement budget
and writing processes that were just
Java crosses so you can easily implement
budgets and writing processes all you
have to implement is just override
methods but virtue of diffusion by XML
is not so easy you have to write an
complicated XML file first of all there
are also the other problems with virtual
management it's difficult to deploy
temporary and convey about your bad jobs
and it's difficult to execute it it in
this rigid environment those are why we
decided to develop jobs rima this is a
system configuration figure of Java
streamer
there are three main components in Java
streamer management console control bus
and agents management console is
management - UI for job swimmer and
control bus is a PS Saba
to me and agent Shabbos where the but
jobs is cute it when agency been chance
to launch in the network control bus
automatically detects them and connect
to them and distributes but shows to it
to them and yeah let's look at how the
job how job swimmer change but your
management first you have to do two in
order to use your swim jobs Rima is that
the implementing budget site processes
in Java and deployed them to jobs Rima
it's a it's the same process as before
but you can do it by maybe improving and
and if we want you can also deploy and
use cruiser but and second you can
create a bunch of definition graphically
in console and next you can schedule but
jobs on console directory our directory
am man you re is cute I am on console
you can do all configurations of a batch
jobs from console and finally bad jobs
executed from agent and that is I think
that is the best advantage of Java Summa
that you don't need any deployment
deployment to agents and system
architecture first why quite its able to
use closure patch sorry since that we
have a patreon budget judge is named
Cheryl million budget such is the
budgets that execute directory Java
million cross so we can use crucial main
function via this budget and second why
it's unnecessary to deploy to agent the
reason is that we uses WebSocket cross
through that that it's library we are we
also developed that is cross road that
remotely
limitary remote reconnect to the
crossover by a WebSocket that is a
really sophisticated library so if we if
you want please also check it out and we
have developed two jobs Rhema furry
enclosure
we used wrapper and component dr.
roberta for server side and cross the
script and on for pretend we took for
advantage of closures be done constant
consistency to develop joe streamer and
this is a risk of how to stream a change
the world
we want to change the budget of
management by Joe szema
and Crozier summary Jerusalemite is a
distributed job execution environment
for job but if you have if you are your
current have some programs with virtual
management pretty check it out and
contributors also very welcome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
