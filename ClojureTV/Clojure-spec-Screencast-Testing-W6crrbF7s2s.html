screencast I'm going to talk about using
speck tests to help write correct
programs
with speck there are two primary entry
points for testing for correctness tests
check takes us back and generates
conforming inputs to functions and then
verifies that the return value of those
functions is correct by spec and also
that the semantic spectral inspect is
correct test instrument on the other
hand checks that functions are called
with conforming inputs so broadly
speaking test check make sure the
implementation of functions is correct
and test instrument make sure that
functions are called correctly give this
talk we explore tests check and test
instrument on a couple of small example
functions will begin by expanding our
spec vocabulary to deal with some common
idioms and closure functions alternative
interpretations of arguments with alt
optional arguments with the
quantification operator question mark
and nillable values with nillable will
also look at spiking out different
branches that a function can take with
or will conclude by using test
instrument to help us track down a
problem in a function not the current
function under development so let's get
started
in the top window I will show closure
forms and in the bottom window the
results of evaluating those forms first
we'll load the spec namespaces closure
on spec aliased as s and closure dot
spec test aliased as test
next we'll look at a function that we
want to test this is the my index of
function that we use as an example in
the leverage screencast extend it to be
a little bit more flexible my index L
takes a source which is a string and a
search and possibly some options and
returns the position of that search item
within the source string
define that
now we'll define a spec for my index of
using the F def form we will spec that
my index of has an argument list which
is a regular expression to the
catenation of the source which is a
string and search which currently we'll
say is a string return which is a
natural int and a functional spec that
says that whatever that return is if you
go back and look at the arcs at the
source within the arts then the count of
that has to be larger than the return
value which makes sense so you cannot
find something beyond the end of the
source string
having defined a function spec you can
then use exercise fun to see example in
vacations of the fun with generated data
so here you'll see that if you call my
index of with the empty string and
passing the empty string it will return
that it found it at position zero if you
call it with one F and G five it didn't
find anything
it returns nil and so forth we'd like to
have a way to specify that the search
argument could be either a string or a
character and the spec all form allows
this alt is the alternative regular
expression form so it says that inside
of sequential thing one or another of an
asset of alternatives might appear so
this alt spec says that this is going to
be either a string or a care and this
will match a sequential thing that it
has a string in it and notice that the
conformed value tells you which branch
of the alt you took so it's a tough bold
it says on the string branch of the alt
the value foo matches likewise we're
going to now allow characters and so if
we conform against the character F we
will see that on the care branch of the
all the character F matches and if you
explain a non match you're going to get
back a thorough explanation that
enumerates all of the different
alternatives have failed so the vector
42 for the value 42 is not a string or a
care and so you're going to have one
explanation per alternative so 42 is not
a string on the string branch nor is it
a care on the care branch
now we can plug this alt back into the
argument lists for my index of
so inside the argument list again we
have a regular expression operation
catenation
of a source which is a string or a
search and now we have a sub regex
within the regex saying this is an
alternative either a string or care and
the rest of the respect is as before if
we exercise the fun under this spec
we'll see that sometimes the second
argument will be generated as a string
and other times the second argument will
be generated as a care
we also would like my indexof to support
an optional third argument which is the
position to start the search
the quantification operator or question
mark will help us do this so if you look
at the question mark it will take a spec
and then it returns a regular expression
that matches 0 or 1 occurrences of that
spec so if we conform question mark net
int on an empty collection that will
conform if we can form that end on the
collection with 1 in it that will also
conform if we try to conform something
where the item inside the regular
expression doesn't match we'll get back
a good error message saying that the
keyword a at position 0 and the regex
was not a natural int and if we have a
collection that the entire Reigate regex
can't match we will get back an error
message telling about that telling us
that at position 1
we now have extra input we've gone off
the end of the regular expression
now we have the ability to do a complete
specification for the arguments for my
index of
the arguments include the source which
is a string the search which is an
alternative between stringer care and a
from position which is an optional
natural mint and again the return and
fun specs are unchanged we can generate
calls to the function to see that the
various options are appearing and indeed
we see indications of the function with
three arguments here's a strain care
start position and we see indications of
the function with two arguments so here
is string and another straight
now that we have our function specified
at least in the arguments let's test it
a traditional example based testing
approach would involve picking some
example values for arguments calculating
in our head what the correct return
value would be and then asserting that
those things match so here the position
of the string W is 1 0 1 2 6 7 8 and we
can execute that form and see that it
returns 8 we can see that equals 8
returns true and the entire assertion as
a whole passes this form of testing is
repetitive error-prone tedious and
precious
instead let's try letting the SPECT
write the test for us so we can call
tests check and test check we'll take a
function pass to it and generate correct
inputs to the function using the art
spec invoke the function and then
validate the return against the return
spec and the functional semantics
against the fun spec we can pipe these
results to test summarize results to see
something easy to view at the row
lo and behold we have an error when you
get an error
we'll get the spec that caused the error
and the name of the function being
tested in this case we're only testing
one and then a very precise message
telling us what went wrong so here it's
the return path of the spec we expected
to get a natural int but in fact we got
the value nil and we can see an input
that caused it so here you have the
empty string a single character that
we're searching for and starting at
position zero and that produced a result
of nil another thing to mention here is
that these arguments that produce a
failing value are automatically shrunk
by tests up check which is the support
library that spec test uses to do this
job so they will typically be fairly
small inputs needed to cause the error
to occur here the problem that we have
is fairly straightforward we haven't
taken into account the fact that in case
the search is not present in the source
string the function needs to signal back
with some value and here the
implementation has chosen in the amount
of closure way to do it which is with
nil
nil occurs frequently in closure
programs as a sentinel value and so
there's first-class support for dealing
with nil inspect the nillable spec takes
a spec and returns a new spec that
allows anything that the original spec
allowed but also nil so here we can see
that foo is in fact an a-level string
that nil is in fact a nillable string
and that 42 it's not a billable string
so we'll get back to the distinguished
value in closure spec invalid from
conform indicating that this is not a
valid value and then we could find out
more by calling explain or explain data
we can use nillable to correct the
return spec of F dev so here we have my
index of SPECT again with all the same
spec as before except the return is now
a millivolt natural int so let's
evaluate that spec and then run our test
again oops we still have a problem this
time check through so somewhere in the
execution of our check somebody threw an
exception we go back and look at the
cause we'll see that we have a null
pointer exception and this is not
surprising because just as ret needs to
deal with nil the fun spec also needs to
deal with nil so this functional
specification says that the return value
is complicit Li a number which is less
than the size or less than or equal to
the size of the source passed in as an
argument in fact the function spec has
sort of two logical branches the case
where the string is found and the case
where a string is not found and you can
deal directly with this inspect using
another spec form called or
or allows you to name one or more cases
that might happen each of which is then
defined by a spec so here the fun spec
now has an or form the named form not
found is the return value was nil and
the named formed found is suspect that
we had before so the number the numeric
value of return has to be less than or
equal to the size of the source argument
passed it and with the spec we will see
that given the sample data that we're
able to produce right now this program
appears to be correct now let's define a
higher-level function that uses my index
of in its implementation this function
which came first returns chicken or egg
depending on whether the string chicken
or the string egg appears first in
string s starting in the string s at
position from so this is fairly
straightforward we calculate the chicken
index which uses our existing function
looking up chicken in s starting from a
particular position in s we calculate
the egg index
looking up egg likewise and then if the
chicken index is less than the egg index
we return chicken if the egg index is
less than the chicken index we return
the egg
so let's call this function and a call
which came first the chicken or the egg
starting at position zero and I'm
optimistic that the word chicken appears
first and so the function will return
the keyword chicken oh well we have a
problem we have an era t exception
somebody passed the wrong number of
arguments to string index up
well string index of is actually part of
a library that I used to implement Maya
Nixon so that's not even in my library
so we can do stacktrace assisted
debugging here so with print stack trace
we can see that string index of was
called by my index of which was called
by which came first which is the
function that I'm working on so now we
have to do some thinking because maybe
there's a bug in which came first
maybe there's a bug in my index of maybe
there's a bug in the closure core apply
not very likely or maybe there's a bug
in string index of and while this stack
trace is fairly clean in general this
could be quite a pain and it would be
nice if we had some way to say let's
turn on instrumentation for all the
functions in the system or all the ones
that we care about and make sure that
they're being called correctly according
to their specs
well instrument does exactly that I can
call test instrument passing in a
function that I want to instrument or a
collection of functions that I want to
instrument I'm going to instrument my
index of in this particular case because
it's a canned example I already know
where the problem is
but generally I might be instrumenting a
larger set of functions and I'm now
going to call which came first the
chicken or the egg zero and get back a
truly terrific error message so here we
get back an error telling us that
somebody made an incorrect call to user
my index of and in particular they
passed in at position two something that
failed the from predicate by not being a
natural int well let's look at the
arguments that were passed the chicken
or the egg
followed by chicken followed by from so
that's in position two that's supposed
to be a natural int oops
so it looked like I intended to call
this with a keyword or tinium where I
named this from position but in fact my
index up doesn't expect that it expects
the position art to just be passed right
here so this should be 0 this call
should look like this and the test
failure tells me the test failure tells
me that this happened in instruments so
while I was calling an instrumented
function that's happened and the test
caller tells me exactly the scope that
produced this problem in this case I'm
working at the repple so I get a no
source file but in the general case this
would tell me the exact file line number
and var under which the problem occurred
and of course you can combine
instrumentation with testing so here I
happen to have bubbled into the problem
by calling which came first myself but I
might have a spec 4 which came first and
here we have a minimal spec 4 which came
first
so it's args are a source string and a
natural int from and it's return value
is always chicken or egg you can use
sets directly as specs so the return
value is always chicken or egg and when
we call this generative test now I'm
using test check but I also have
instrumentation turned on in the
background and again we're going to get
a test time failure that points us
exactly at the problem so here we have a
failure that the from arts were supposed
to be a natural int they were not the
args that were passed in were empty
string chicken from zero and here we can
see that position two is wrong so in
conjunction test check and test
instrument are an extraordinarily
powerful way to help establish that your
programs are correct and they're limited
only by your imagination in using the
full power of the closure language
so where are we closer spec provides
powerful structural and predicate of
ability to describe arguments to
functions return values to functions and
even the semantics of functions having
done so you can let spec write your
tests for you and at development or
repple time use check to verify that
functions are correct and use instrument
to verify that functions are calling
other functions correctly perhaps the
most interesting part of this to me is
that throughout all of this you're able
to bring your own work flow so it's an
entirely dynamic environment no aspect
of this requires any other aspect so you
could choose to write your specs first
and then your code and then test it or
you could do that in any of the other
possible orders and you can leave out
any of the pieces with the exception of
leaving out writing the code we thought
about automating that part too but then
we'd all be out of jobs
if you're interested in learning more

closure or about spec my name is Don
haloway and I'd like to thank the
hundreds of contributors around the
world and help to make closure better
