from the very declarative world of logic
programming to the very steep full world
of debuggers answer as Stuart said oh my
I have a lot of open source projects I
work full-time on on palette and do
consulting around palette so it keeps me
busy and lets me spend all my time in
the closure world so I'm going to be
talking about Ritz which is an open
source library to add debuggers so for
closure at the moment it works with
emacs and very c-max clients but the
first part of my talk should be
applicable to other clients as well so
whether you're using eclipse or or emacs
hopefully you'll find something of
interest here so a bit of history
Georgia had really started the ball
rolling with debugging enclosure and he
wrote a library called debug repple
which was based on the realization that
you could put a form into your code at a
macro into your code and use the closure
in internal closure environment to set
up an evaluation environment where you
could end arbitrary expressions in the
evaluator an expression with the local
context and that led to the end end
pseudo an argument to macro is being
introduced to the closure and I came to
I came to closure after Common Lisp so I
was very used to using slime and Common
Lisp and I really like the the debugger
SLV be in common land in slime that
works with Common Lisp and I really
missed that when i came to closure so i
thought i'd try and do something about
that so i ended up talking to Phil he
was looking after swank closure and he
said suggested that I
put debug rekal into swine closure
signed up doing that and that gave us
the swank break form that many of you
still use and that's all works very well
has some limitations only lets you in
look at locals in a single frame and it
also means that you have to modify your
source code to put in a swank break form
and recompile to be able to use to debug
anything so luckily the the JVM platform
itself provides a debugger and it's
called the jbj PDA is the name of the
overall environment and the JD I is the
Java debug interface was the Java
interface to that so after that George
and I in parallel unknown to each other
kind of work to started working on
hooking up the the java at the JVM debug
environment to closure and george raja
library called CDT closure debug tool
kit and i started work on what was
become ritz which started life as a fork
of swank closure so so the ritz i got
working within the slime environment so
it's been working for over a year I use
it every day essentially it's my go-to
environment in the meantime in the last
year and ripple has come to be Chaz's
project that really as the m the vision
behind that is that you can have a
closure process is your user process
that runs an end ripple server so that's
a little little server inside it and
then you talk to that server over a wire
protocol over the network and you can
attach clients to to you're sitting you
know your closure process is much like
the swank and slime you know if you know
those
the vision was to have a way of doing
this that was open to other client other
clients that weren't necessarily coded
in Lisp so the default transport in n
ripple is based on socket and being code
for as a format for messages so n revel
works by passing messages backwards and
forwards between the client and the
server and the other the other big
component of Van ripple is the the
middle west stack which I'm going to be
explaining in a little bit more detail
so this is a little example of what I
mean by middleware should be fairly
familiar if you've ever done in your
ring work work with ring this is an
example where we got the client on the
right on the left and that your user
process on the right you got the clients
you want to load a file so it's just
going to send a little message to to the
server and this message got an OP filled
in it just says load file and then on
the server there's a handler that
receives the message and essentially
looks goes through the different
middleware that has loaded in the server
process until it finds the middle way
that handles the the load file operation
and then it's going to actually that
middle way is going to load the file and
asynchronously send back a reply to the
client to say that the father's been
loaded or not and the client can handle
a notification now the couple of
interesting aspects to this the first is
that you can have a client that can
support multiple languages of closure on
the on the on the user process site so
whether you're running closure or
closure script your client can just say
low file and the actual code that gets
executed can be different in the two
cases so it allows you to work with with
different variants of clothes
the same client without having to modify
the client the other interesting thing
is the you can use if you have say a
middleware to do code completion there
are various different ways you can do
code completion so say you have a simple
code completion just takes a prefix that
you've typed in and tries to find a
symbol that matches that prefix you can
also have what emacs calls fuzzy
completion where you type in some
symbols and it tries to type in some
characters and it tries to might find a
symbol that matches that has those
characters in those orders but not
necessarily contiguously so and which
version you which which type of
completion you want to use is really a
personal preference so it's kind of nice
to be able to just say okay I want to
have fuzzy completion in all my all my
rifles independently of which particular
client you're attaching to that rep
using for your rifle so it gives you a
way of customizing that your ref early
environment independently of the client
which i think is great so I'm just going
to explain how you can do that line
again to has this concept of profiles to
customize different environments within
within Leiningen so in in your home
directory under the dot line directory
you can set up a profile for closure
file and in there you can set up your
user profile and the the user profile is
a special profile in lining and gets to
apply to all all your all your apples so
independently of whichever project it's
always there so you can specify
middleware in your in your profiles lock
closure file and it just appears in that
middle will then be used in every ripple
you start and all your projects the
other way you can do it is in the dev
profile in your in your project lock
closure file so and then you can set up
something that's project specific
and you can do more than that you can
actually get set up arbitrary profiles
and say line with profile XXX and all
start up with those options so a very
flexible system the great feature of
line two so there are various clients
already 4n ripple rep Lee Colin Jones's
project is the raffle you get if you
just type line rapel lauren petty has a
counterclockwise which is the Eclipse
environment for closure and then I know
Michael Brandmeier is working on support
for apple and implosion I don't think
it's quite there yet getting there so
there's a huge community involvement in
n ripple it's great to see everyone
getting involved and the final client I
haven't mentioned yet is an rippled VL n
rifle dl is being driven by Tim king
it's an emacs client for foreign rebel
and the idea is to be able to replace
slime with a closure specific client but
can do closure specific things and not
necessarily be encumbered by supporting
common lisp or scheme or any of these
other things so um it's going to go
through quickly how to install that so n
riffled VL is an emacs package so to
install it you have to tell Emacs wait
wait to get it from there's a package
archive called marmalade and basically
just add marmalade to your to your
package archive list and and then you
can install it and there's this second
package archive called melba which is a
little different if you want to live
really on the bleeding edge of n rippled
VL Mel Burke contains a package that's
built automatically from from the git
repo so but for most uses usage just
concentrate on using my
milady okay so to actually install and
rippled VL a all decks package in school
and ripple that's very simple and once
you've got that installed then you
actually have to start repli session and
connect to it one way to do that is to
do all in one this is a command n rep
called Jack in if you if you run this
from within a closure file within your
project it will start to go and find the
relevant project files start a server
for you and connect to it you can also
do it separately if you run a line
recalled headless that will start a
ripple server that doesn't have a client
attached to it and then you can all take
10 ripple and point that to to the rebel
and there were various other ways of
starting your rebel over the line rebel
sir see ya sorry Oh which brings us back
to ritz so ritz started off as a forÃ§a
swank closure I never meant it to re be
a fork I was minted to reintegrate into
some closure but just diverged so far in
the end that wasn't possible and I spent
the latter during the last year I've
refactored it to include n rebel support
as well as slime support so in our
support the two and and split it into
many different components so at the
bottom we have a ripple utils layer
which contains all the the
implementation details of what was in
swank closure so all the code completion
a proposed support so all the features
of Swan closure now in this ripple utils
library which is a zero dependency
library that you could use include it in
any of your user processes without any
conflicts and can be used to support
them rebel type functions in in any
rapid environment so it's not linked to
Emacs it's not linked
and robe all it's just an independent
library and then on top of this raffle
utils we now have n rep or middleware
middleware which is a separate library
that just wraps and ripple you to the
base level repple utils in middleware
that you can use from any n ripple
client so we can use the ritz completion
or the ritz apropos and any client that
supports the the middleware operations
for those features i also split out the
ritz debugger into a separate library
which is independent of Emacs or n
rapport or anything else and on top of
that we now have rich swank and ritz n
rifle which are the two libraries that
too rapel servers that we actually use
for debugging i'm going to go quickly
through some of the middleware that are
in in n ripple middleware I got Java
code completion so all the all the basic
functions for a rapper and there are two
more its components there's a n ripple
codec which is a rebel that runs over
hornet q which is a message server so
you can run a mess run your rebel over a
message queue and there's an ripple
codec which is a middleware that allows
you to pull up the history of a function
so you can just get a key chord on a
symbol and it will go and look up in a
code in codec all the history of that
function and put it into a separate
buffer for you so you can see the the
whole history of the function um so part
of the rewrite other refactoring of
iboga i had the fortune of having just
read out of the topic a little late
maybe I always assume that Richard
already
taken all the good bits of out of the
top wit and putting them into closure so
I'd never actually gone through and read
the paper but there's there's a whole
wealth of any ideas in the paper and
some of the ones that help me with this
was really the concept of isolating
mutable state and providing a simple
interface to it and having no preferred
access path to the elements within your
within your mutable state and the paper
suggests using relations to do that
obviously that doesn't really work for
what we were doing but it mapped using
maps so I use a map / connection and
that gives her you can implement the
same ideas on top of maps instead of on
top of relations and I think that works
really well and it's quite it's quite
similar to what in some ways to the
atomic as well maybe rich did think of
everything from out of the toffee okay
so how does it work essentially to run
the debugger you actually need to to JVM
processes so your client connects to a
debugger process and the debugger
process connects to your user process so
it's a little bit more complicated than
the average the average rebel session
the repair the client talks to the debug
server over tcp/ip connection so it so
that the standard end ripple connection
there so it's tcp/ip a tcp/ip n and Ben
code and then your debug server talks to
your user process using the Java debug
interface so can execute various code
using the Java debug interface the
servers themselves are completely
independent of the front end so you can
attach to this using you could have
attached to this using the enclosure you
could use the server hopefully within
the mutants with in session
and hopefully this can become a default
implementation for debuggers outside of
JVM based clients also the rich debugger
comes with some extensions to an rippled
dl which also provide in a little
package so I'm just going to give you a
quick idea of how a debugger can work
using middleware I hope that's visible
at the back and so the basic idea we
have the the end rifle client on the
left and we have the debugger process on
the right and I've dropped the user
process which is behind that and when we
start the client we send an operation
not a message to the debugger saying
okay break on exception so it's saying
okay from now on whenever you hit an
exception I want the user process to be
frozen and I want the exception
information sent back to the client so
there's no immediate reply to that
message it's just sending it is
providing a message ID that can
effectively be used by the debugger to
return information kind of like a form
of long polling if you like it sends
that message then the client evaluate
some code which is sent as an eval up to
the eval middleware in n ripple that
gets evaluated and some somewhere in
that that evaluation that an exception
is for a throne the debug debug freezes
the the use of a machine the user
process and then sends back the
exception pro exception information back
to the client the client can then
display that in some form maybe the the
user then decides he wants to see the
the source code for the first frame so
he sends a message to send a message
back to the debugger saying find me the
location of the the first frame and that
sends a message back saying it's okay
it's in this file at line eggs and then
the client can display that file at that
point in the file
you can then evaluate some code within
the context of that frame there's a
message there's free me Val passes the
frame number and the code goes back to
the debugger process debugger process
sets up an environment to mirror the
environment in that frame within the
user process if I Lee's the code and
then sends back the result back to the
client it can be displayed so that's
completely that interface is then
completely independent of the specific
client that that's on the that's running
in the client Katie to use the debugger
you have to package install and repair
its okays from from now I'm going to be
talking about n ripple dl and how to use
ritz within and rippled VL so you need
to install a little package that's in
rebel ritz which is provide some
extensions to n ripple dl and you have
to add line ritz to your your plugins so
in in line in line one you had the line
plug in command in line to this is now
handle plugins are now handled through
the same profile system so it's a major
improvement so the easiest way to make
it available to all your projects is
just add it to your user profile so once
you've done that you can start a ripple
server with line ritz n ripple so
instead of line rapidly line Ritson
ripple that will spit out a port number
and you can then connect to that using
the the ordinary and ripple connection
so I'm not going to show you it so i've
got i just started the little ripple
earlier so i'm going to this is the the
port number the rifle is listening on so
i'm going to connect to that with all
techs and ripple it's going to ask for a
host so you're not limited to running in
the client and the and the
and the user process on the same team
machine and the port and it's going to
connect so we have a standard report so
as I said break on exception is off by
default because a couple of issues and
some if you're using a lot of Java
libraries that use exceptions heavily
for flow control it can get annoying so
x is off by default so we're going to
sell tell it to break an exception and
in ripple r it's okay somehow it hasn't
unloaded the inner up or its package
and report roots break my exception okay
so now if i enter some code that's going
to cause an exception will see a stack
trace that's good my examples okay so
here i have a divided by 0 so it pulls
up the stack trace and you gotta at the
top you've got a description of what the
exception is so you got the exception
type and the the message for the
exception and this is the the bit that i
really liked about the Common Lisp
experience in slime you have restarts so
now you can control what happens at this
point in time the machine is frozen the
stack hasn't been unwound yet and you
can control what happens this is the
idea of between behind restarts is based
on the common lisp condition system
we're not actually using conditions here
kind of just simulating them using the
Java debug interface so I can decide
what to do here so if I if I select
continue it's going to throw the
exception and it's going to actually go
get caught in the next handler so it's
going to come back up with the next
catch point it's going to be thrown I
can abort and abort means okay ignore
all the exceptions from now on till they
get back to the top level so it just
takes me back to their and this is the
at the bottom we see the standard and
ripple dl printing over the exception
okay just going to throw that again
one difference to debugger such as you
find in Eclipse is that the you control
which exceptions are you see in line in
part as part of your working flow so
here I can see okay I've seen this
arithmetic exception I don't want to see
it again so you can just ignore it and
the program will will not give you a it
will just continue over at in the next
next time it sees a an arithmetic
expression and you can ignore exceptions
on different criteria so you can ignore
the specific type of exception you can
ignore a specific message you can ignore
a catch location or a throw location so
you have many different ways of
filtering the exceptions that you
actually have to worry about a actually
see in your debugger in this the the
swank version of ritz there's actually a
is actually a screen on the slime
selector slime selector f which will
actually let you then manage those which
exceptions you actually filter which
exceptions are which filters are active
etcetera etcetera it doesn't come up too
well on here because the screen is so so
narrow and there's one one problem with
catching exceptions in on the JVM and
that's there's no real easy way of
deciding which exceptions are caught and
which are uncaught so in Java you can
filter them court and uncaught
exceptions which is quite useful in
closure it's less useful because any try
finally block effectively catches
exceptions so any binding form any with
open forum effectively catches all the
exceptions underneath that and those are
pretty prevalent in pretty much any any
closure program so it's pretty much
useless filtering on on court
which makes the whole handling of which
filters you which exceptions you want to
see a bit more complex okay so I'm just
going to go down now into the there's
the stack trace itself you can a hit
enter on the on a stack trace and it
will show you the local variables within
that not just at the first frame
different frames thank you you can
evaluate expressions within a particular
frame context so in frame one hit e and
you can paper type 2 X and it's going to
put put that up at the bottom so you can
evaluate arbitrary expressions with D
you can pretty print the results of that
in a separate buffer so that's handy if
you've got some some long expression
that's your unity evaluating a long
result if you hit V I'll actually jump
to the source code for that frame so
here we're actually jumping to a java
source file so you can see it's in the
divide operation if we picked their eval
eval didn't work I'm just going to
continue this now so for the source
jumped a source to work you have to add
the source file to your classpath so for
non aot closure code it's automatically
there but if you've got a ot closure
code or Java code you need to make sure
that the sauce jars get onto the
classpath there's an easy way of doing
that so line palm will give you a maven
pom pom file and maven dependency
sources will go and download all the
sauce jars for the dependencies you're
using in your project and put them into
your local repository and once they're
in your local repository every time you
run a ritz line session automatically
adds them to the classpath so it's just
the one off operation you have to do so
going to get out of that what go back to
my example code so i am now have a
function / 0 i'm going to evaluate you
call it here's my function so you jump
to the closure source for that it gets a
little more bit more complex where you
have locals clearing so closure has this
this thing whereby if you have locals
within a function and they're assigned
that they have a value that is a lazy
sequence they're actually milled out
after the last last use and this
prevents the the head of lazy sequences
from being held and the whole of your
sequence being realized in memory so if
i if i look at this function and
evaluate it as it is we've gotta we
gotta just gotta assigning seater to be
a be the result of a range call if i
evaluate that
sorry yeah you get compounded exceptions
as well
so I should be defined now yep so we
look at this we were expecting to see
see being 029 a sequence of 0 to 9 we've
actually got CC is Neil and that's the
result of locals clearing so since
closure 1.4 we can actually control this
a feature that's gone in so if I just
continue it bought that I can I can
compile this with a prefix now so if i
say control you control CC it will
compile this with locals clearing
disabled can re-evaluate that and we now
have our our local variables which is
really useful because when it's it'll
work when everything's Neil you're not
sure if it's nil or not ok so there are
also some sometimes you get some cryptic
error messages from from closure
occasionally if you make a nice syntax
error like defining def multi with some
some incorrect syntax you get a
exception that is none too helpful in
terms of line numbers but using this you
can actually see which form is is
causing you your problem this is a this
is one I make all the time defining a
namespace with use only and then
forgetting the the vector around the
symbol
got to continue the
I forgot to continue I've got a frozen
vm now okay I'm gonna have to kill that
yeah there are still a few issues in the
end ripple version of this the you
lesson that the slime version I've been
using for the last year so it's a bit
more tested and all right so we kill
you
just restart that it takes a takes a few
seconds to start there actually three
JVM processes when you're starting
there's the line process as the debugger
process and there's your user process so
it just takes a takes a few seconds to
start up
so
there we go
so there are some some other features
apart from just the debugging I can run
line commands in the user process so
without having to start up a different
GBM process to run line so n rifle ritz
line they asked for the line command so
we're going to do depths tree it prints
up the dependency tree for your project
it's quite useful I can edit the the
project file no I already had the
dependency in the sync up with another
one we can put in anyone have a
dependency class losier class leisure is
a wonderful library does the plus per
class loader manipulation so I've edited
my project the closure i can say n
ripple ritz reload project and it's
going to repass the project resolve all
the dependencies again and a wreath add
the add the new dependency in a child
class loader and give it back to you so
once it's there we can require class
losier core
hopefully
on
okay it doesn't seem to have worked so
then we're effect so you can you can
reload play project files and can
actually switch projects as well as an
old xn ripple lobe project if you run
that in a closure to file associated
with a different project then pull that
up ok so I'm hopefully actually most
things was clearing breakpoints not even
show you disassembly if you hit capital
D on the frame you actually end up with
the java bytecode you can inspect which
is quite useful I'm running out of time
so i won't go through that you can pull
up I don't suppose you can read that but
you can pull up a nice display of all
the threads in your in your vm old xn
ripple ritz threads will give you a
table of all the threads as the project
support technomage he has a new version
of debug repple that is working on that
should help you run debug repple without
having to actually modify your you often
your forms ok so where are we going with
RIT swank parity with their sorry Britt
10 rifle parity with RIT swank is the
first thing so adding breakpoints rid
swank actually does break points so you
can hit control C control x be in a Java
file or a closure file and you get a
break point on that that file helmet on
that line and that they see you then
step through code it's not in any
written ripple yet and then there's some
ideas around actually making you're
actually making the debugger scriptable
as a nice paper you can you can see in
the presentation and in the slides that
uses data flow and and makes a debugger
completely scriptable and income so in
conclusion I think has two aspects that
I want to three force home there's the N
ripple middleware
it is really nice it gives you
flexibility of using different clients
gives you customize it customize your
apples easily and using them from
weather and I'm really trying to make
Ritz the place for closure debuggers so
if you feel like contributing in this in
there in this area please please please
do okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
