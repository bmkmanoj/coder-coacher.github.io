scientific computing enclosure is that a
baton switch you'll see there's there
will be some fun stuff this will be a
little less about showing closure code
and more about walking you through some
problems so what is scientific computing
here's a very nice wonderfully broad
definition of it's just using
computational methods algorithms to
solve some scientific problems so it's
covers a lot and things we run into on a
daily basis and so just using reusing a
saying from my algorithms professor
actually algorithms are just a bag of
tricks scientific computing is just
another bag of tricks in many ways oh
thank you so so so the scientific
computing is just another bag of tricks
where we get into for focusing on
scientific problems let it all right so
why use closure for scientific computing
and data science you hear about the wars
between Python and are no one ever
mentions closure it always upsets me so
that is kind of true in scientific
computing scientific computing tends to
lag a bit behind things it's a fairly
heavy on simulation so you'll run into
very frequently I've spent a somewhere
dealing with fortran code but you know
C++ is actually still owns a lot of the
business of scientific computing but
closure you know it's concise I don't
have to sell closure here but if the
interop does matter a lot and the
ability to get to C++ code matters a lot
because sometimes we're connecting
directly to microscopes etc and my code
is almost always messier than anyone
here anywhere in here would ever approve
of but it cleans up nice because its
closure all right so I'm going to tell
this as four stories so first we'll go
through artificial life it's a little
bit of a well no that's actually pretty
strong connection a physical chemical
computer that we've just recently fin
ished connecting patterns perception a
visual system that is starting to
connect to closure now in computational
vascular biology I'm not going to be
presenting closure code for all of these
but closure was used fairly heavily in
all of these except the
physical-chemical computer what which I
just think people here would be
interested in all right so artificial
life and this does get a bit at the
heart of scientific computing so
artificial life what is the point of it
the point of it is to use computer to
replace your pipettes your microscope
etc you just consolidate everything from
a biological lab into it into a computer
and then you go run off into artificial
life you simulate cells etc and I just
have to put up this the digesting duck
because I think that's a wonderful
example of early artificial life you
know it consumes grain it defecates and
that's life okay so I got start an
artificial life because of lease Specter
actually who is giving a talk tomorrow
you'll see him on that but he introduced
me to artificial life because I was
studying artificial intelligence and
artificial intelligence you know they
made a bunch of promises never delivered
and why well because the brain and the
body are connected so maybe you should
study both the same time so you get into
artificial life and then you have a
whole bunch of other problems that come
up like molecules how they actually
contribute to intelligence etc but here
briefly so we played a lot with these
evolving virtual creatures and this is a
simulation in breve which was at the
time in a scripting language Steve but
it's in Python and C++ engine anyway
I'll get to the closure version in a bit
but so you of all these creatures you
let them walk they have very simple
controllers you measure which ones can
go further and you select for those in a
population and repeat you eventually get
these nice walkers so then I joined a
robotics lab and we started making them
and it's still in the same breve
simulator and this is just a simple
study to compare two different
morphologies it turns out in this case
the radial one was able
walk further but the lesson learned from
this if anyone's interest in going the
singles robotics takes a lot of time
you're spending a lot of time assembling
these things when you know you could be
coding them up and you could spam a
whole bunch to a cluster and as opposed
to spending you know a whole weekend
just designing one of these so that's my
take on robots but clearly they have
practical implications swarms okay so
many of you have probably seen this
video you know flocking starlings you
know they're very simple well the
argument is they're using very simple
rules in order to follow very form these
cohesive behaviors where everyone moves
collectively the rest of the videos and
as interesting as the demo so I'll just
keep doing that so i ported this in this
over the breve simulator and to closure
brevets if you want to play with it this
is I should have a video here but
apologies so but we can do some flocking
simulations here howdy swarms work well
I'm going to go through this part pretty
quickly but so swarms they have these
very simple behaviors you have these
coefficients where you wait which
direction you go based on what's your
nearest neighbor what's the kind of
centroid of mass of your neighbors
around you and you can add some like
well alignment is an important one to
get the whole flock to move in the same
direction and this comes from craig
reynolds as work on Boyd's so you can
play with all of this in enclosure with
that brevis simulator if you'd like I
was tasked this past summer with
teaching students Python I know this
isn't closure I know I'm sorry but
everything the aside from this was
closure so I know inside these little
agents I put little Jai phone
interpreters because the the point of
this class was it was being given by
someone who didn't know closure but they
knew but new Python one to teach people
Python so what I did was they fine you
can write Python but you're using
closure for everything else so they just
did this little thing where you know you
color your agents based on where they
are and it's kind of small but you have
these red green or red and blue stripes
that come out with this little Python
function that's getting called every
iteration based
these birds fly around so this is all
pumped up to that brevis simulator I'm
going this is a little bit of a history
at the lead to where we are now so in
this breve simulator we were studying
the evolution of signaling so this this
very clever student at Brandeis is
working on well if you have this world
where you have energy particles some of
them might actually deplete your energy
some may provide you energy these agents
can fly around classically about genetic
programming tomorrow but they're using
genetic programming here and they have
the ability to send signals their
neighbors in order to alert them oh I've
just eaten a poisonous food so we did
this we did a whole bunch of simulations
and we saw wow the we've found some
particular cases where we got what
seemed like signaling to emerge so we
would start well in order to know that
signaling was a was a reasonable thing
we start charging costs to communication
because why would you not communicate if
it didn't cost you anything you might as
well just babble as much as you'd like
so here we start charging costs you know
so they're sacrificing their life to
communicate so we were able to find in
evolutionary trajectories who ran these
for fairly long amounts of time we found
this like these bursts of signaling
emerging in the population but then how
can make a causal statement about what
the signaling what is leading to the
signaling so then we ended up just doing
a whole bunch of game theory and that
turned out to be matlab in matlab is
awful if you've had to use it it's it's
basically c++ well it's basically see
kind of some stuff for matrices so we'd
certain so after that the brevis
simulator was made another cute thing
that we did that was interesting do you
care yes maybe because this type of
controller you could imagine scaling it
to a type of distributed system which
many people are dealing with here so
here you have a world I'll I have a
manual simulation manual animation of
this in a second so you have this world
you have these tiles they're still
following a similar like flocking type
of algorithm
and these tiles have the ability to
apply forces to the birds the point is
you have these energy particles
scattered in the world and you want to
do some load balancing between them you
don't want too many agents consuming an
energy source if there are too many
agents there because that energy source
will become over depleted etc so we just
do a simple PID controller comes from
the Navy for driving ships so you see so
green it doesn't come out great but is
attracting a bunch of birds blue is
repelling birds so you can see that in
areas where you have more birds starting
to repel them it's attracting birds
these areas where you have lower
densities ok so that was in brevis now
completely jumping to the next story
physical-chemical computer so this is a
fun one that we just finished up very
recently and so some simulations were
done in brevis for this as well but the
story here is more much more about the
actual physical system that we're
talking about so there's this reaction
called the bellow job jabotinsky
reaction it was discovered in the Soviet
Union when this guy was trying to model
the citric acid cycle you know trying to
model one of the most fundamental
reactions to cells so he was tossing in
coming up with a bunch of different
concoctions mixing them up tossing them
under microscope you didn't get it to
work one day he wanders off he comes
back he sees this faint yellow
luminescence it's not luminescence but a
faint yellow color in the dish and so
that's basically what you're seeing here
in the in the corner is that this this
reaction is auto catalytic it will
spontaneously start to oscillate and
it's not defying thermodynamics actually
consumes acid as an energy source but
you can see that this is it these are
two different time points this is at the
very top you know I took a silver wire
and in my petri dish I drew the demo
because I was in the lab I was in was
called demo and you wait a little bit
and these spirals start to form out and
so this is just a natural part of this
chemical reaction so I was working with
the physics lab and they designed a
custom microscope and also there are
micro fluidics lab so they were very
good at
that the entire reaction the petri dish
and putting into individual droplets
where you don't actually the droplets
are small enough the tenth of a
millimeter sometimes less and such that
you don't actually get these waves
propagating through the the drops will
just turn bright or turn off turn
brighter turn off and so we start we
actually use those as our computational
elements so we have this fancy
microscope where you can observe what's
happening in your collection of drops
and you can control it put light onto it
and so we had this idea of well maybe
you can actually make an or gate out of
it nor gate you know you're used to NAND
gates in your computer's but nor gate is
almost as good for implementing other
gates Nora will always take one extra
get one extra version of itself but it
is still a Turing Universal gate so this
is kind of what the system looks like
naturally you have a bunch of these
perfectly perfect drops that come out
the little triangles in between your
drops are oil and there's a little
phenomena about which chemical species
move through there but basically these
you get these droplets and they couple
together so I think I started those
videos now so you have these videos
running on the side where we take a
collection of three droplets the two
outer droplets are our inputs to our
gate the center drop is our is our
output and we can control the lights on
it and we just pulse light in order to
send an input and mind you we're talking
about minutes here generally so you're
not going to be writing your closure
interpreter on this yeah so but it's
still kind of cute because you know if
we are struck by an EMP then our closure
interpreters would go down and now you
can start to port it over here okay so
so we do this and so we basically read
within a particular frame whether you
get a spike and that's how you get your
output out of your of your chemical
logic gate and so but a kicker of this
is because the acid is there is there
fuel source they eventually will burn
through all their fuel and these gates
decrease in quality over time it's not
particularly surprising from a4a wet
system and just a demo of just kind of
what happened you can see there's some
spun moderate spontaneous activity
outside of the field of view but here
you're looking at eight different logic
gates being run at the same time with
different combinations of inputs it's I
thought it was a cute system I thought
people would be interested it was clued
chemical Computing's been floating
around in the closure world recently
okay patterns the perception so it turns
out that so some of you might know that
the last thing Turing did before he
passed was to study the study
embryogenesis morphogenesis so he
developed a mathematical model to
describe how you could form patterns in
in embryo and this bz reaction has
actually been one of the physical
systems they use as a model to actually
represent this turn system has recently
shown that you could replicate all of
Turing's math in this in this specific
system but turns I mean do yeah so turns
model has actually comes under some
criticism I know how Matthew people are
here but basically he he linear a lot he
linearized as his solution so he
excludes some nonlinear possibilities so
we went through and kind of reiterated
some of his work and using this idea of
well what if you instead of having
chemical reactions just use logic gates
because we've started studying how to
make them so if you just use logic gates
in a diffusion system what type of
patterns can you produce and so we were
able to kind of recapitulated olive
Turing's patterns why does this get
interesting it gets interesting because
of these next two steps so at one point
I was working on visual systems and so
it was on this embryogenesis problem of
how you can start with a single cell and
grow it out into a full organism so this
was kind of pioneered by this very
clever work by this guy fabian roth in
switzerland where he grows out this
neural system i don't know if anyone
here
Brighton bird vehicles maybe there are
these kind of cool vehicles where you
have two wheels two sensors and you and
these are light sensors and so you can
move to so you directly couple the the
sensory input to the motor and you can
then kind of imagine how if if you
depending on how you wire your sensors
to your motors you will have different
light sensing properties so let's see if
you have if you cross your connections
then as this sensor gets closer to the
light you'll speed up and turn more
towards it so if you cross your sensors
you'll move towards light if you if you
have your sensors wired in parallel the
move away from it so this very clever
system he actually made a motor system
in blue over there you'll see and and in
red on the right in this fourth panel so
these are sensory motor systems and then
he did some true genetic algorithms in
order to evolve the axonal connections
and he made this kind of wiring and so
this little organism would kind of move
like a little fungi around in this world
so I one point I was handed this
manuscript gripped in a draft and told
to replicate it I got partway there i
didn't start making axons but i started
working on a vision system okay where
does that vision system go it grows out
and there's some neat properties of that
you can like blast some of the cells and
they'll recover because the reaction
diffusion system and they'll only grow
if there are a certain there's a certain
level of chemicals and their environment
so if you kill off some of the cells the
chemistry depletes because none of
themselves are producing it and then the
system will regrow its regrowing right
now okay so oh I didn't know that would
start immediately okay so this brings to
brings me to another thing so this is
again MATLAB I apologize for bringing up
MATLAB things but basically I'm trying
to pour it all my matlab to closure I
don't say that's nightly I mean it's not
pleasant to work in so this here's a
co-evolving camouflage and vision system
so these predators they have actually
the the Predators have it
she modeled after a human vision system
because I was you know I'm an academic i
was submitting this as a paper and i
knew the reviewers were people so i
figured if my predators were people and
they were involved in good camouflage
then the camouflage would match the
things the reviewers couldn't seem they
would be impressed that was my strategy
I think it worked so this in the center
this is just kind of feature map you
look at different orientations of
objects and yet well not objects a pixel
these are these are pixel based
operations being performed you look at
different orientations different color
combinations etc and so use an
evolutionary algorithm to evolve the
weights of this vision system and on the
other hand if these prey which have
these genetic programs inside that are
actually producing these patterns like
you saw happening over there on the
right okay so this kind of this and and
so we made these cool this is what
happens after the end of evolution you
know we we get some very I I think
they're well matching because we
randomly move the prey around so they
will they will never perfectly memorize
the environment nearby them and actually
how could they if they were occluding it
may be a little bit but you know we were
able to get the blue blue pray were able
to kind of absorb kind of weight well to
kind of emerged the patterns of waves
would emerge in the prey in in the water
for example funky things happened on
this kind of very artificial lights type
of background but they always found
circles of the right size which I
thought was cute okay so what I've done
then is so there's this program maybe
some of you know it image J it has a
long-standing history comes out of NIH
but it's in Java so yeah a closure i can
i can touch touch get to closure from
that so i've been working on this
library fun image where you can use
closure did you do a lot of image j
things and there are a lot of other
libraries behind it this albert Cardona
did some some of the initial work that's
helped this come together and I've
coupled it into the simulator so you can
actually have simulations where your
your your flock can you know proof can
be projected onto an image and you can
use this image to look at how your
moved over time okay I don't have a
timer I should have kept that oh yes and
so I was giving a talk down in
Maryland's recently and so this was kind
of my cute example was last month so it
was Halloween I should have updated it
to turkey's butt so I the this was to a
bunch of image processor so you know
they're used to writing long code for
things they're used to writing Java for
things you know so I want to show them
concise code that could do a lot so what
I did was you know wrote this little
thing you iterate you you map your
function over a bunch of images you
concatenate them they're just basically
a MapReduce type of call and you put
hats on cats and you know this is my
Halloween celebration okay so this is a
fun one and this one you can use the
library's up and everything so here I'll
get to my main story because this is
kind of some of the coolest videos okay
so hopefully the the model will be
somewhat inspirational anyway so
angiogenesis the formation of blood
vessels that study in a lot of different
places we're generally talking about
mice when they're studied but you know
we care about humans too of course so
here you're looking at you know a young
a young retina sprouting and you have
these blood vessels that grow clearly we
have lots of neurons there we have to
feed them with glucose so these three
different primary phases of vascular
development you have the sprouting level
where they kind of go random and kind of
just get into the environment they make
too many connections generally you know
this is similar for anything where
you're making some sort of tree
structure you spam out a bunch of
connections then you do some pruning
process and then eventually you know
things things are mature enough you
don't have to prune anymore and so
that's how your that's how the blood
vessels in your retina reformed Oh mind
you uh so there's actually a growth
factor in towards the periphery of your
eye that's that veg f the growth factor
and I'll get to that in a little bit as
well and in the black just because you
might
shows up but those are astrocytes so
they're kind of neurons that help help
guide these blood vessels in their
growth so this is it's tough for this
crowd because you're probably used to
fancier images but this is actually from
from a mouse I we actually went and we
scanned the I we did 3d reconstructions
of the blood vessels at this pretty high
resolution you know and the point of
this is to be able to get to the point
of well we can start to model flow model
blood flow what happens when you when
you include blood vessels figure out
where pressure builds up where shear
stress builds in the vascular networks
and so this is what this fancy
microscopy technique light sheet
microscopy you might run into it's been
getting a lot of a lot of popular
comments lately but the point of all
this is so a lot of these people in in
this biology world they'll analyze their
images manually and then you have
computational biologists who generally
will go up the look up into a paper well
how fast it sells move in this
simulation the they'll basically be
extracting not they'll extract
quantitative observations from from
other people's work but it doesn't
connect directly to the data it's you
know a biologist has gone through and
measured a bunch of things by hand and
now the bio the computational person
then goes and recapitulates these by
taking those hand observations and
making another image and yet and they
still tend not to match so this notion
of image driven driven simulation is one
things we've been working on recently so
can you just take a nice can it and do a
forward simulation predict what would
happen after after a few days of
development okay so that I mean you're
probably all comfortable that in this
world oh so the simulation let me talk
about that a little bit so we simulate
cells the nice thing about these
vascular cells endothelial cells is that
blood vessels are actually the walls of
them are fairly thin compared to the
actual vessel themselves generally when
you're when you're at the capillaries
that's not exactly true but further back
so you can make an assumption and
you know sign the scientific computing
is riddled with these of you know well
what is what can I assume is a very very
small thing so I can start to factor out
that dimension in my data so we assume
these cells are flat and they're
connected by Springs and so the cells
are modeled by a bunch of this is an
agent-based simulation so it's a
collection of these they're tethered by
Springs they have the yeah so I'll show
you the the growth of these into new
media but they also have these things
called Philip odia where they they form
these actin bundles and they kind of
stick out and start to kind of feel
their way around the environment is
there more growth factor here know
they'll stick out another one is a more
growth factor here yes and they'll keep
moving over here until I get yelled at
for moving away from the mic so here you
know so we use closure for all this
stuff now actually the simulation it's
c++ i have to admit but is there there's
some utility to have that speed but i do
link back to it through J&amp;amp;I so it still
is all closure i can claim okay so here
this is a mouse hindbrain a blood vessel
and so what you're seeing on the you see
this kind of long red strand and so this
is these Phillip odia from these two
different two different kind of primary
vessels they're starting to seek out
each other and they're kind of
discovering that oh we can make a
connection here and that will I don't
know I you know this is that you can't
actually grow this tissue afterwards
this has been fully fixed in paraffin
and wax etcetera so we don't know what
would have happened but you know it
might have actually led to the formation
of a thicker blood vessel along this
line so we do this to extract in order
to actually count the Phillip podium or
tuning our simulation then in order to
we want our simulations to produce the
same Phillip OD at the same length same
rates etc so we do that that's all
enclosure so there's a little a little
bit more biology but I don't go too much
more into it so you have this growth
factor this veg F in the environment and
you grow towards that and then cells
talk to each other through this Delta
notch signaling pathway and that's
that's the only signaling pathway I'll
talk about but this is this is a deep
one this is really fundamental it's how
your spine is formed it's how it's how
your organs are compartmentalized early
in embryogenesis
it's a very very fundamental pathway to
you can even find it in flies but you
it's certainly in fish mammals etc it's
at their analogs and flies so this type
of study that we've been working on and
I'll get to it scaling it up is so we
look at how timing patterns out and how
different cell types pattern out in
these situations when you tune Philip
odia you tune coupling between
neighboring cells etc so this was pure
C++ but here let me get to the the fancy
closure II kind of stuff so yes the
retina is one model of angiogenesis but
another one that we tend to think about
that we focus on a lot of zebrafish
zebrafish are you know the kind of
staple landmark of of Experimental
Biology why because they're transparent
so when you're doing developmental
biology you don't have to do anything to
the animal you just start growing it you
put under microscope and you can just
record it live and just watch things
grow generally they're fluorescently
tagged so you can actually see things
more precisely so but in when you're
talking about vascular biology you care
about this these ISVs these
intersegmental vessels they're forming
along the back there just connecting two
primary vessels in dorsal aorta and a
vein at the top so here's what we do and
this is the simulation that's now now
working with closure so this is kind of
the form the initial formation of a is V
so we make a corresponding simulation
with our little cell simulator and we
have this type of migration simulation
so we've gotten our biologists to you
know since easier zebrafish you can
record these over time we they take a
whole bunch of image frames now we make
our simulations these are remind you I
have to admit this is not image driven
simulation here I've that that's a
little more complicated to do for this
this is tuned based on the biologically
measured cell movement rates but let me
play it it starts off a little slow
because I have to kind of warm it up and
kind of let it let it you know overwrite
its kind of initial values because
there's a lot happening in the gene
regulatory networks
so it's putting out these Philip podia
kind of estar ting to explore its
environment there's this growth factor
gradient that's going from top to bottom
or higher it's much higher at the top
but basically as you move in the Y
direction though you know that's that's
the direction you want to go so you get
this kind of cool cool interesting cells
they start to expand their membrane and
then move in this upward direction and
we've tuned them to the match the rates
and we I'm actually only allowed to show
wild type scenarios of this situation
but the biologists clearly one of the
things they do is they apply treatments
to these that will modify the cell
growth rates etc and so so I can't
really get into those but you know we
can because it's simulation we can we
can adapt geometries and modify how
thing how cells talk to each other etc
so so we control that with entirely
closure at this point but it's but it's
C++ engine ok so my conclusions i hope i
didn't go too fast but so we have this
brevis simulator we've done some some
robotic simulations with it but this
this code broke no because the I don't
like maintaining the rigid body library
the rigid body physics library but if
anyone wants to pick that up I'd love
that so we have this chemical computer
we do some simulations in that in order
to actually see what happens when you
connect larger circuits together but
that's incredibly complicated to deal
with when you start talking about actual
physical simulations it took five years
for us to make that computer and you saw
it's only performing on single nor
operation across five minutes and so in
these patterns perception so now we're
using closure entirely to do our image
analysis on on biological samples I just
came back from medical meeting where I
was doing that I start I now actually
work with biopsies so we can take a
biopsy from a human we scan it and use

computational biology where we do these
forward predictions about what happens
under different developmental scenarios
