what it's like to be new i'm here to
tell my story about how I came to code
from Anansi s backgrounds and how
closure in particular help me bridge
that gap between self study and an
actual job in the tech industry so I'm
going to start with a little help from
randall Munroe i don't know if any of
you are familiar with this slide but
this was the very first time that i had
heard about list and i had fallen for
Randall's comics long before i started
to code there's a way in which he
blended math and logic and romance and
the existential questions that that
puzzle us all in this way that just
fascinated me and so I found myself
googling the parts of his comics that I
didn't understand which was my
introduction to a skill that we have all
come to know and love which was Google
the answer but anyway he he had me
asking questions like what is a list who
is cory doctorow what is the ballmer
peak and how can i spend more time in it
I'm still working on that one I mean you
know for science um so as a little girl
I dreamed of becoming an astronaut a
detective a mechanic or a ninja I think
I'd archaeologists on there as well but
I couldn't find a whip icon in time
that's look I'm in handy when you're you
know sneaking through old code but I had
never I never actually seen the creative
or expressive potential of code my dad
is well he was a cobol programmer he
still is and so i would spend hours into
the night coding qbasic programs with
him while he did cobol but to me I saw a
lot of go two lines right this was this
was code for me and I didn't quite see
the arch in it and no offense to Kobol
actually looking for COBOL mode and
emacs and I didn't have it and I had to
go with four train mode so
that's another issue if somebody wants
to help me with that later so instead of
going into computer science I instead
studied literature languages my degree
actually had an emphasis in German
expressionist film so after college and
armed with a very esoteric sounding
bachelor's degree I was you know afraid
of the state of the world you know this
is like two thousand and five six ish
you know it was afraid of the lack of
interesting meaningful work
opportunities and so I took my my
bachelor's degree and I ran away from
cell phone reception and I chose to live
in the middle of the woods with 50 other
hippies yes it's a it's called an
intentional community it was an eco
village where all of our heat was
generated from the geothermal Springs
and all of our electricity was was
generated by the river they used to call
those communes but now we call them
intentional communities so here we had
solved a really big problem right like
how do we how do we create a world for
ourselves in the woods and we had we had
solved that but truth be told we spent
most of our time in meetings arguing
about who had cleaned the bathroom last
or untangling these miscommunications
that were the natural result of coming
together and living in the woods and
interacting as humans to build things
and to solve problem and so after four
years of this it's very easy to stay in
the woods for four years believed me
anyway my little brother who is a
successful self-taught coder he he came
to me he said you know you you really
like arts and languages and I think you
could be good at code and so oops here's
the pop-up wireless mariette thing I was
funny
okay you don't see it though um anyway
so I had come I have spent more than 20
years of my life as a classical musician
I've traveled with orchestras and
chamber groups and things like that so
when my brother came to me and said I
think you can code I had already been
introduced to concepts like abstraction
and data structure manipulation I just
didn't know it yet so here's one of my
absolute favorite pieces in the whole
wide world it's the Bach partita for
solo violin and he takes three notes
right Dix addy and an F at an A and then
he strings it out into this gorgeous
20-minute piece that I will spend the
rest of my life playing and he never
loses track of those three notes he
takes it and he takes those three notes
and he maps over them you know we've got
these polyphonic expressions and we've
got these chords that go over four
strings and I'm using my fingers right
now but it's the same feeling I had when
I first came to Emacs you know those
chords this key findings like in here in
your muscle it's in your soul you know
so this is my introduction of functional
programming um and lo and behold last
year's keynote speaker was the wonderful
Melanie Mitchell who here saw that
anyone okay sweet yeah she beautifully
intersected her work in artificial
intelligence and language and she
actually studied under Douglas F
hofstetter who wrote a good elestren in
Bach who hears as played around with
this book or seen it or read parts of it
right it's oh it's so good but I you
know I I haven't made it through your
the ends you know I'm just the point
where i can get through the introduction
but the thing about this book is that it
was an invitation to digging into
systems and to exploring things right
and i think that sometimes we have this
hard and fast line of what it means to
be technical or what it means to not be
technical and this blurs that line and
that line was blurred for me and it was
actually one of those things but that
piqued my curiosity so I started to to
code with my brother's help I did like
Zed Shaw's learn
Python and Ruby the hard way and you
know tore through all these tutorials
and like Codecademy online was really
great mit course where there are all
these wonderful resources and so I Bart
ended at night and i coded during the
day and I finally got to the point where
i found an internship with this tiny
like 12 person startup in portland's
called little bird and what little bird
did was it it took Twitter data and
grabbed those communities so we would
use graph theory calculations to to take
data and take communities and then tell
stories with them but my first year at
little bird was really really really
hard and as an intern I was put on to
these projects where I was debugging
this Ruby code with these method
missings and i think one programmer had
kind of jokingly written some of the
code to obscure it away from the other
programmer as like a joke and Here I am
as an intern just going like I needed
adults please so then I met this guy and
this is ryan Spangler he's a contributor
to a lot of closure projects but he's
also a musician and so we immediately
connected on that level because what he
did is he he was able to listen to me
and so I think one of the biggest
problems as early coders is that we
don't have the vocabulary to articulate
our problems right we're basically going
to somebody and saying you know why do
these strawberries wear pajamas you know
like we're basically saying the
technical equivalent of nonsense and so
then you know a well-meaning senior
developer will just look at that person
and say I don't I don't know how to help
you and so what Ryan did is he he slowed
down and he was able to listen to me and
he was able to help me ask for the
context that I needed and form better
and better questions and so this was a
huge breakthrough to me as a developer
because it's so easy to want to go into
especially these first jobs and you want
to prove yourself and you want to do
your best and you you tense and you
speed up and
it takes a lot to soften and what it
does is it takes a good team and good
mentors to really cultivate that skill
and say hey you're new at this and you
want to do a really good job but you
have to slow down and you have to ask
the right questions when you have to
give yourself time to practice this art
and so with Ryan he did something very
clever our caching layer was already
built in closure at the time and he came
on board and it's a very small company
right but he was able to convince the
startup to rewrite our entire
application enclosure and closure script
is fantastic it was it was a dream
experience and so what he would do is he
would hold these workshops for the
entire development team and we would
come up with a puzzle like let's graph
all of the hex colors you know and
create closure data structures of these
sorts of artistic and fanciful things so
we all learned this together and it was
really really inspiring you can see here
one of the things that I really
appreciated about Ryan is that he uses
descriptive and colorful language and
his functions he's very very smart but
he tries to use map and reduce as much
as possible right he want he is really
skilled at taking complex things and
breaking them down into the simplest
parts and this is a lesson that was
really profound to me because when you
build a code base you're not always
going to be there with your code right
you're you're creating this living
organism that lives on after you and so
you have a responsibility as a developer
to write something that's going to be
easily understood by those coming after
you regardless of experience level and
so this is actually a lovely circle
packing algorithm that he wrote and he
you know when he wrote this this code
he'd pulled us into the workshop and his
dad was a math teacher and so he's you
know he's drawing things out he's
bringing us and he
he's really excited to share this
adventure that he went on to write this
algorithm and optimize this very
difficult problem so after Ryan we got
to have mr. Justin Smith come on board I
did not watch this slide by the way this
is how he chooses to present his avatar
and Twitter so I wanted to respect his
choices who here has been helped out by
Justin Smith on IRC okay I see a couple
of people I think the fact of the matter
is that everybody has been because that
guy has been all over those channels
I've gone and looked at I've searched
for problems and had his name show up
you know he's sitting right behind me
and you know the top 10 results are him
it makes it really easy for me to figure
out what's going on but what Justin did
in particular is he really helped me
understand the closure documentation I
came to him at first and I said you know
as a newcomer like I'm really jazzed
about closure like elegance the
simplicity of the syntax the rainbow /
ends oh my god I love those but the
documentation is is tricky for me I feel
like there's a barrier there i feel like
i have a hard time understanding what
i'm doing and so justin said something
and I don't remember the exact words we
were getting mexican food one day and he
said something to the lines of once you
understand some of the building blocks
of the documentation then you'll see
that they're actually simpler you know
they're written in a style that that
builds on itself so you know kind of
hammered that point home that read the
 manual is useless if you don't
understand the context and so what
Justin did for me is he helped me
understand the manual and understand how
to get the answers that I needed and
that is something really special about
closure I had so much fun making me
slides by the way that the wand because
on those good days I feel like I'm a
wizard you know and the bad days not the
case but um so anyway he taught me the
skill of staying within the repple
really trying to go to the source code
or the documentation that i needed
within my workflow so he started to
develop these these wonderful practices
and he really taught me how to break
down things that I didn't understand
into smaller pathways toward
understanding and he's here today and I
just I he's so great I just I just love
what he does for this community and for
me personally so this is the repple I I
just recently started a new job where we
are a Java and a JavaScript shop and the
first day I came in and I said where's
my rebel where is my rebel and
apparently Java does not have one um and
so but it's powerful it's become this
metaphor for me of how do we how do we
build something complicated from the
ground up I know when we were rebuilding
our application at little bird we hooked
straight to the database right we would
have we'd use we had to use monger at
the time which is a wrapper around
MongoDB but in other words yes you use
postgres which is I preferred that but
um so so we would go straight to the
repple and we would build up these data
models these collections like one line
at a time and so we were able to
experiment with the architecture of our
application it was really powerful for a
newcomer to be able to build a
server-side handler from the ground up
like I you know I'd go to the repple and
we'd figure out what the data structure
looked like and then from there we would
figure out the logic around that and it
was powerful and that you know was
thanks to this routing system that
Justin had made we had this application
over web sockets and it was it was great
i still don't i'm not sure if i will
ever understand it but Justin maybe you
can help me anyway so so the repple so
and also Bruce how men built this great
tool called fig wheel on
was anyone use fig wheel big wheel fan
yes it's so great it is so great like to
be able to to compile your JavaScript on
the fly like that and to have your web
browser open your Emacs you know you've
got your IDE you got your site or cued
up or whatever and and your terminal and
you could build you build a whole world
out of that elegant simplicity and you
know now that I'm at a larger company
I'm really really appreciating the tools
that closure has developed for this sort
of interactive design and simplicity so
like I said I left a little bird and now
i'm working at a slightly bigger company
and so I was crying about not having a
repple but the fact of the matter is I'm
so grateful to be able to learn about
the languages that closure is built on
there's no way that I can go in there
and just wave my hands and say closure
so much better and closure script is so
much better if I don't understand why
and so what closure has really given me
is this kind of sense of like I can dig
deeper into the source code I can dig
deeper into these problems and now that
I'm working with different languages I
feel like it's really helped me overcome
that fear and it's sort of this alchemy
of taking fear and turning it into
curiosity and it's something that this
community is really really good at and I
was able to go to closure West last year
on an opportunity grant I remember there
were six percent women there which
everyone was like really proud about I
was like wait six percent everyone's
clapping like wait what's going on and
my key performance indicator for for
that situation is how long the line is
for the women's bathroom and I still
have yet to wait in line and so that day
that I have that day that I have to wait
in line to use the ones bathroom at a
tech conference are we really happy but
anyway I just want to take this
opportunity to thank catherine fellows
and anna they just spoke just a little
while ago about closure bridge there are
people out here in this community who
want to help newcomers and it's so much
easier
when you had experience to be able to
slow down and be patient not only with
yourself and others but when you're a
newcomer and especially when you're a
newcomer from an underrepresented group
you really want to prove yourself you
know I went into JAMA and you know I'm
all about the teamwork I'm all about the
communication but man I I was had my
shoulders bunched up to my ears when I
started that job because I didn't want
to let them down I wanted to prove to
them that I was technical and that
attitude actually kind of gotten my way
you know it was harder for me to connect
with my teammates and I really had to
soften and trust in that practice of
being in the beginner's mind and having
respect for that because the very best
developers are the ones who never let go
of that sense of curiosity and that
sense of humility in that sense of that
beginner's mind and so it takes a lot of
reflection and a lot of patient
listening to onboard newcomers it's a
lot it's a lot of energy it's it's a
it's a big deal but but if we do that we
can really come together to open our
arms up to a more interesting more
diverse broader community of people from
all sorts of backgrounds and as
developers we love to solve problems
right there's joy in that and so the the
more colorful that community becomes the
the more joy we're all going to get out
of this process because the the hard
problems are not going to go away so
oops
it's love the problem of the PowerPoint
presentation but anyway so there's no
there's no developer fairies going to
arrive in the night to sever your junior
prefix from your engineering title and
the longer I code and the longer I'm in
this adventure the more I realized that
that is a pretty okay thing especially
when I am doing that journey with people
like you and so I just really thank you
guys for the opportunity to code and
solve problems and be here again at this
conference yeah and I'm looking forward
to you too mark any questions any
experiences that you want to share about
either being a newcomer or onboarding
newcomers yes I wondering
to team which is using Java JavaScript
have you been able to bring some of your
closure ways of thinking
how is the team as a team embraced
yes that's a really good question he
said coming from a team that using that
used closure and now working on a team
that uses java and javascript what what
have I brought from my closure
background and the answer is that it can
be frustrating at times you know when
you're not working in your mother code
tongue as a newcomer but my teammates
have a huge respect for my functional
background out one of the reasons why i
went to Jamaa is because they're wanting
to break off more and more of their
microservices more of their application
into micro services and the team I'm
working on right now uses react which
embraces a lot of those those functional
those functional perspectives and so
right now I'm trying to navigate the
whole flex implementation thing well in
the back of my mind I'm going like why
don't we just pass in a map of data I
don't understand and so I'm trying to
navigate how things get that down to
your props which is great because then
I'm able to ask questions and show
teammates how I would solve a problem
from my sort of functional perspective
and there's libraries like lodash for
example that help people do that with
JavaScript and so it's actually been a
really mutually beneficial situation
because I you know I used reagent which
can achieve a lot in sort of at this
terse syntax and so there was a lot
going on in the background in terms of
how we had to happen Howie Howie what we
had to do in order to make that happen
in the browser that I'm kind of just now
getting to and just now understanding
working with vanilla JavaScript so I
think both of us are really early
benefiting and and now I can kind of
laugh at myself one you know I get
frustrated I'm like oh we could we just
did it this way and I don't understand
why yet it isn't um so I think humor
humor is very important but how else am
I going to convince my company to
rewrite everything enclosure enclosure
script that's my secret by the way now
they know Catherine
works like now that you have oh that's
really a question so she asked maybe the
reverse of David's question which was
that what am I going to bring back to
closure now that I've been studying Java
and JavaScript and I think I don't know
but I'm excited to do that and I think
one of the nice things is that now that
I'm not coding closure during the day i
miss it and so I feel like I want to be
more involved with for example closure
bridge or the closure me tips that we
have in Portland so it's actually kind
of renewed my interest in it now that
I'm not doing it during my day job it
can kind of go back to being a passion
on the side so I'm hoping to be more
involved in that way
there weren't any I'm just kidding I get
that actually might be my answer you
know I think it wasn't difficult to get
that initial sort of this is polish
notation and one plus one is now
actually plus 11 and I think that for my
brain that was really comforting you
know to have that sort of function in an
argument argument argument and being
able to nest ideas and being able to
pass functions in that way so okay okay
you just want a cider configuration that
was a that was a pain point but once I
got it up once I got the home in rebel
situation figured out then it was then
it wasn't smoother smoother sales sorry
oh yes thank you that's a really good
question his question was you have any
tips on asking better questions um yes
so I think it boils down to vocabulary
right and when we're talking about the
closure documentation my biggest barrier
with that was not understanding the the
definitions right so I think we can take
that and move it outward so if somebody
asks if somebody comes to you and says
the equivalent of like why are my
strawberries wearing pajamas you know
that doesn't make any sense to you and
so I think one of the the best things
you can do as somebody who's being asked
that question is to back up and ask
questions about the context around it I
remember there was a really frustrating
experience where I was asking a question
about a variable assignment and I kept
asking the same question over and over
again because I got frustrated and I was
already the point of frustration such
that i couldn't find another way to
describe that and so the person helping
me couldn't really help me but my team
has really had really helped me step
back and tell you know where where how
where had I come from like how did I get
to that part of the problem I think what
I'm trying to say is
asking questions that aren't initially
understood requires some sort of backing
up and filling in more context yep
sounds like you may have met a
conceptual bridge besides al for one
Sophie of you was you know Bob yeah if I
some kind of anchor by which you can
make analogies to this domain I'm
wondering if you have any kind of
general advice for other new programmers
what they can use to bridge how to lose
travel those other understandings are
outside that traditional yes background
so the that's a really good question and
I think that the answer to that is that
we need more of those things like we
need more programs that reach out to
people who are interested in music and
and somehow create curriculums around
you know exploring functional
programming through through music or
through language I know I have played
around with with functions using English
expressions like I was trying to figure
out the difference between recursion and
recursive looping and I was talking
about a stack of questions and needing
to pop one off the top and then ask
again you know and and so you can
actually create code and instead of
using examples like the Fibonacci
sequence you can use more descriptive
more language base analogy for some of
these for some of these concepts and so
i would i would like to throw that out
there and say you know we were already
seeing that there's a need for
curriculums to get people into coding
and I think multidisciplinary ones are
going to be really effective at at
targeting people who would really love
to grow up and make their living doing
this stuff okay
developers in terms of giving them
feedback like one thing I problems with
code reviews i'm always correcting them
and i don't sound like yeah that's a
really great question and his question
was basically how can i give feedback in
a way that doesn't come off as being
critical of a couple things to say about
that one is that I work with teammates
you who don't give me any critical
feedback at all and that actually ups my
anxiety level because then I'm thinking
like what am i doing wrong you know I go
home at night and I'm you know racking
over all these things that I could have
messed up but i think that establishing
respect for your junior developers is
key and one of the best things that you
can do is when you mess up or when you
make a mistake or when you find
something that you want to improve upon
bring that junior developer over and say
hey I messed up you know I messed up big
time you know and have some humility
about that and that's going to really
inspire respect and and allow them to to
open up and be in this vulnerable space
that's going to allow them to go to the
really hard places a really good
question
which some documentation main bronchus
allergen exposure to some other stuff ah
so soon your question is was there
anything JDM specific that was a blogger
something that makes sense i'm just like
you have to do whatever
yeah you know I i I'm still trying to
understand you and my understanding of
how the JVM works I know that when we
were working on an application where we
had our front and our back-end required
separate James and then we actually
started using Kafka and so a third JVM
was implemented and so I just I'm where
I have more of like a working
relationship with the JVM in the sense
that wow it's you gotta take into
account how long it takes to restart all
of those and if something breaks on one
you got to restart the others and so I
think that's that's my experience with
the JVM and it's one of those things I
want to learn more about because it is a
really powerful aspect of the language
that I've only kind of encountered in my
own use of it in back
oh that's a really good question um I
wouldn't change my humanities education
I might not necessarily get a bachelor's
from an accredited institution if I
could do it all over again but I would
never ever trade my my study of art and
music and film ever and language I mean
I will be studying that for the rest of
my life yep
well the truth was that I did feel
overwhelmed and it was an application
stack that wasn't working for me and I'm
not actually sure what where I would be
now if I didn't have Ryan and Justin to
come on board to be my mentors so yeah I
mean that's a good question but I think
that's where we lose a lot of people as
they come into these internships or
these entry-level jobs and they're in an
environment where it's a stressful agile
thing and we got to ship that code we
got to do that feature and I think
that's the majority honestly so i think
all i have to say to that is as i have
so much appreciation for this community
and for this language because it really
kind of connected with me at a place
where I was I was I was really
frustrated yep
yes
yeah yes absolutely and and a thank you
for mentor hey engineer developer and B
that's a really great skill that is also
valuable for the company right I've had
developers especially my new company
where they'll be walking through an
explanation of something and is anyone
familiar with the term rubber duck
debugging yeah it's great and so in the
course of explaining something to
somebody else there's that that
self-reflection that's happening and so
I've I've been the junior developer with
whom a senior developer said hey wait
this is actually really really confusing
like I think we're actually doing
something wrong that happens a lot and
so when companies are looking to bring
on junior developers or interns please
consider this as a benefit to that like
you are actually creating an environment
where your senior debs are going to be
forced to be more mindful about the
implementation and the like the
implementation of features and also the
the building up of technical debt I mean
you've got somebody who's new saying
what are you doing why are you doing on
the back
um me personally well yeah that's a good
question i mean when i got my new job it
just said software developer and i
bought myself some bourbon and some
really good headphones but i think you
know like i was saying earlier i don't
know that's a really good question and
it's a really hard one and I just don't
know ok.thank out yeah that's a great
question so he said does he think that
my background and music helped me
understand these things yes but also my
background in bartending okay I don't
know if you've ever been to a bar on
it's magic it's phenomenal I mean the
stuff that you have to keep track of and
then also be nice to the person while
you're keeping track of all of these
things go to the bartenders I'm serious
and you know there are a lot of people
in that industry in the service industry
who are wanting to do interesting
creative things and solve the hard
problems and they're working their asses
off you know and some of them are not
able to support themselves and so if
you're a company that can give someone
like that a working you know a living
wage apprenticeship and teach them these
skills I mean let me imagine what we
could do if we tapped into that talent
pool right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
