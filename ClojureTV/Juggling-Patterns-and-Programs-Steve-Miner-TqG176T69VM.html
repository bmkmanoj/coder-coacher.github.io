thank the organizers for putting on
another great conference well at least
so far but it's been good and today I'm
going to try to have some fun with
juggling patterns and programs the first
i'd like to tell a little story about a
young boy who loved juggling his father
taught him a few tricks and after lots
of practice he was ready to perform in
front of the crowd so here's some old
video this is a little bit fuzzy from
1983 let's take a look very good
alright
so if your juggler you'd be pretty
impressed as a nine-year-old boy I think
you already guessed who it is because I
slid my slide but that's not me although
I do have those shorts but this is
anthony gato who even at nine years old
was a world-class juggler he traveled
the world for next 30 years worked for
Cirque de Soleil in Las Vegas and
Orlando a few years ago he retired from
juggling performing he's now running a
concrete business in Orlando but he was
a world-class athlete I mean just
tremendous skill set a bunch of World
Records so that's just a warm-up for
what people can do in juggling maybe you
may be wondering okay juggling that's
cool everyone likes that but how does
that connect to closure why are we had a
closure conference talking about
juggling well I wasn't the first one to
make the connection you remember this
guy ritchie key back a few years ago had
a great talk simple made easy and part
of that talk there was just one slide
but you mentioned juggling and he said
you know this is a problem for us when
we talk about mutable state complected
time and value intertwining things makes
it hard to understand and that
complexity makes hard for us to reason
about our programs and he used juggling
as an example of complexity so I want to
give you a metaphor alert so rich was
talking about juggling in terms of
incidental complexity I'm going to
change it I put my own spin on juggling
I want to talk about juggling as
essential complexity sometimes we want
to do difficult things complex things we
want to approach something maybe it's
just a challenge maybe it's a business
reason but things are hard sometimes we
want to look I want to look at juggling
as an example of something is hard to do
but if we look at it deeply maybe we can
get some insight into finding some inner
simplicity with in that complex task so
for me juggling is going to be our main
task and see what we can learn from
juggling now to help us get started I'm
turning to one of the great men from
computer science electro engineering
background Claude Shannon you may have
heard of him he's known as the father of
information theory he contributed a lot
to digital circuits way back in the 30s
in the 40s he worked with Alan Turing
for a while in cryptography just made
tremendous contributions all across the
fields and anticipating digital
computers and communications later he
spent most of his career with bell labs
but later in life use a professor at MIT
and he was also a member of their
juggling club so as just a really smart
guy who enjoyed juggling he decided to
write a paper about the called the
scientific aspects of juggling you can
find it on the web it's I'm not sure
when it was published is supposedly
written in the 1980s it's in his
collected works published in 1993 it may
have been out there sooner weird i take
a look at some of Shannon's ideas about
juggling to try to get some insight into
that so Shannon starts with the history
of juggling and of course it turns out
every talk on juggling that mentions
history at all is going to show this
graphic from the additional Egyptian
wall painting showing people juggling so
we know juggling was popular 4,000 years
ago and probably it goes back a lot
farther than that Shannon didn't mention
this but the New Yorker did some
research and found that cavemen were
juggling so that's that's even farther
back so what Claude Shannon was trying
to come up with some insights into
juggling and he started with a simple
form of juggling he called uniform
juggling so that's a one throw at a time
alternating hands and a constant rhythm
so now we can do a little demo suit
alright it's a live demo so the basic
idea is were just juggling this is a
simple three ball cascade you can kind
of feel the beat frequency just every
every beat for a one ball catch another
Bowl and it's alternating hands the
height doesn't really matter all right
we can go a little bit faster here
but it's basically the same idea okay so
well thank you thank you so anybody can
learn to juggle like that we talked
about the constant rhythm you can see
some tricks kind of change the rhythm
you can see a sink pay to beat as I'm
throwing one ball over a little higher
we're trying to keep the other one's
going okay so that's that's a little bit
beyond what he is talking about or if
you're like crossing hands that changes
the rhythm so so real jugglers go past
this uniform juggling but you always
come back to that simple pattern so if
we do an analysis at the simple level
that gives us a good insight will see
how how to connect that to all the other
juggling tricks okay so i just talked
about the three ball cascade that i was
demoing there is a simple simple thing
is a crossing pattern so odd odd numbers
of balls you do in a crossing pattern
even number of balls we do half of them
in one hand happen in other hand so
we're still alternating the throws but
the balls kind of live in what we call a
fountain pattern and they just stay on
their side in the simplest this is kind
of the simplest low energy way of
juggling this is what you should
normally learn so Shannon looked at
juggling and came up with Shannon's
juggling theorem and in this the the
interesting elements or the flight time
plus the time the balls in the air the
dwell time is how long the ball is
actually in your hand bacon time on your
hands after you made to throw the hands
empty for a fraction of a second and of
course the number of balls is what we
care about mostly keep that up and H
stands for number hands okay so this so
this is a this is Shannon's theorem and
it really is a nice I don't know simple
equation that gives you the essence of
juggling okay but it also points to why
juggling is hard okay so I'm calling
this complex made hard so what we're on
do see how many balls can we juggle and
it turns out you can't do that much
about the dwell time in the vacant time
really good juggler can have can have a
pretty quick Doyle time but but the main
thing if you want to juggle more bowls
you have to throw them higher get a a
longer flight time which means throwing
higher now the flight time actually
though because of physics we're dealing
with gravity the flight times
proportional to the square of the height
so as you get more balls in your pattern
you're throwing higher and higher so to
double your flight time you have to
quadruple your the height you're
throwing and the problem in juggling of
course small errors and compensations
it's a coupled system things compound
and it gets hard fast so there's a lot
of us almost all of us can learn how to
juggle three balls five bowls is a
pretty good juggler okay so people some
confident three ball jugglers might take
you know six months of hard practice to
get up to five balls when you start
getting to seven you're you're really a
dedicated ready to be a professional
juggler and the world record for
sustained juggle is nine although people
have done up to 13 balls for a short
period so anyway it gets hard fast and
that's I mean that I can see why some
people think that's a good metaphor for
for compania complicated software but
there are ways to think about the
juggling problem that might bring back a
little simplicity so we'll get to that
one other little curiosity when I when I
first saw Shannon's theorem I was
thinking h you know I'm most jugglers
have two hands that's that's the usual
thing right but of course you know
Shannon was thinking beyond me and he
said think our juggling troupe the
flying Karamazov brothers a lot of fun i
don't know if you've ever seen them that
lots of there's some videos on the web
and i've seen them a couple of times in
person they're a great group so of
course when you get a group of four
jugglers sharing clubs we're scaling
each so it's possible you just have to
think about your problem there's there
are ways to make things work okay so
back to the theorem Shannon also gives a
good proof of the theorem I don't have
time to go through the whole proof
but you can you can kind of think about
it a little bit think about the
experience of bowls right so a ball is
either in the hand or it's flying in the
air and it does that kind of her hand
basis and think of the experience of
your hands a hand either has a ball or
it's vacant and that's you think about
the whole pattern that's a / / ball
basis so Shannon just multiplies those
out and finds the equivalence because it
all happens at the same time and you
know he proves it a little more
rigorously than I just explained it but
still it's a nice simple equation and I
think that's very valuable when we're
thinking about our software to try to
find the ascent essential simplicity
that we can look in there and one other
thing you might notice that Shannon
doesn't talk about physics directly here
I mean he has a discussion about why you
know flight times are the way they are
due to gravity but that doesn't appear
in the equation doesn't talk about the
weight of the ball it doesn't take into
account a wind velocity there's lots of
extraneous details that aren't covered
here that would matter if you're in
those situations but he's coming at it
from the experience of a juggler in a
kind of a normal juggling context okay
and so that's another maybe something
valuable you think about when you're
designing your software yeah start with
the what's essential what's important
and don't let your don't be distracted
by all these old crazy possibilities I
mean we do have to think about edge
cases but try to try to get the basics
right first so let's let's review of
some lessons from Shannon so in his
paper he did a historical analysis he
thought about what jugglers have done
before you talked about some great
jugglers in the past I think that's also
a valuable lesson for us when we're
doing our software we're facing problems
a lot of these problems have been faced
or similar problems have been faced in
the past it really it makes sense to
review the literature a bit just get a
feel for how other people have solved
these problems maybe they didn't have
the same technology but yeah you'll
maybe get an insight by just looking
through history okay so that's kind of
informal but a worthwhile endeavor
the second point domain understanding
okay so Shannon is a brilliant
mathematician he could probably walk up
to any system and just say okay here's
what's important here's all the numbers
work but it helps to actually be in the
domain know something have some
experience of the thing you're trying to
model and Shannon was a juggler he you
know he had a long history of juggling
and and tinkering he even built juggling
machines way back when and that's fun
you could find those on the web too so
he had a domain understanding before he
decided to do is his you know deep
analysis or you know for us in software
it makes sense to understand how the
practitioner of remodeling some kind of
financial system or or simulating
something the real world try to you know
get out there experience that directly
before you start writing code that might
help help you meet the needs of your
users or do something that's more
realistic now the third item here
choosing the right abstraction that's a
really hard problem I say I don't have
that much to help you choose right
abstraction but if you're here yesterday
for Eric Norman's talk you know one way
to approach that is by starting with a
physical metaphor and juggling is a
great physical metaphor okay so that's
that's part of the reason I'm I like
this connection doing something physical
you're engaging different parts of your
brain okay you kind of you kind of know
how things are going to work just by
feel and juggling will develop if you
practice a little bit of juggling you'll
get that feel for where the ball is
going you don't actually watch the ball
you can just know from your throat you
maybe look at the tops of the ball but
but the idea of a physical metaphor i
think is a really great starting point
for approaching software and i'm really
curious see how far that goes with
eric's work then the final thing is once
you come up with this analysis Claude
Shannon's theorem really exposes some of
the trade-offs when you're when you're
juggling from the experience of a
juggler all right so we said he chose
the right abstraction he found
simplicity
and he exposed the trade-offs and I
think that's a valuable approach for
doing our software sometimes we get too
caught up in like oh I can get an answer
on this path I'm just going to pursue
one path I'm just going to make
everything work along that path and
sometimes we have 200 off to just fill
that in and just do this and and we can
be to focus on kind of get tunnel vision
it's good to explore trade-offs design a
system where you can you know turn some
knobs later but keep it within the
experience of the common user or or the
practitioner in the field if you're
modeling something that has has like a
physical reality try to think about
trade-offs within their experience and
model that in your software okay I won't
turn to another paper this paper a
scientific american paper that came out
in 95 beacon lubell and they knew
Shannon they refer to Shannon but for me
this is the earliest reference i could
find that had a description of site swap
notation and this is a way to describe
describing juggling patterns a lot of
jugglers you know don't need any of this
they don't they have figured this stuff
out naturally Anthony gato saw at the
beginning he was he just did his own
thing he described his tricks he said
well let's see over and under thing to
high-low thing but he was he was a very
top expert and had an intuitive feel a
fantastic athlete so he didn't need a
lot of formalism to approach juggling
but for the rest of us kind of mere
mortals it helps sometimes just have
some I don't know somebody else who has
thought through things and gives us a
little recipe description of different
tricks and turns out site swap notation
is a really nice way to describe
juggling patterns so the first part it's
just a sequence of whole numbers
integers so enclosure for us that would
be a vector and these are just simple
numbers in juggling notation we use
just write all the digits squash
together like a string but we know
implicitly those are separate throws and
the other aspect juggling we start a
pattern we just keep the pattern going
so enclosure that would be a cycle
implicit cycle so we have a finite
vector but implicitly we're just going
to start over the beginning again and
keep juggling so as I mentioned before
the three a throwing a 3 is just a
simple cross in a three ball pattern
similarly like a 5 would just be a
higher throw because you want to fit
five bowls in the pattern so it's a
continuous juggling so every ball froze
and then lands five beats later you're
caught five beats later then you throw
it again so five bowls fit in that seven
balls is hard to do but it's the same
idea of crossing on the even patterns
like a fourth row is coming back to the
same hand that throwing high enough so
we can alternate hands two balls living
flying any champ and then higher numbers
go up you know some good good jugglers
can do you know six bowls some even more
special notation the zero in siteswap
stands for an empty hand okay so
sometimes just the way the pattern works
this hand doesn't do anything on a beat
the one pattern is just a quick switch
so you know if you you could throw it
quickly there and then then we're throw
right away so that's a one coming across
a 2 is a throw to the same hand it's a
short pro and it's so short that most
jugglers we'll just do hold and
sometimes though they'll do something
fancy and fly the ball around just to
distract and that's part of showmanship
but a to just stays in the same hand and
then the next time this hands in a
throwie send it over that ball okay so
here's this is a graphic board from the
Scientific American article and we're
showing a timeline to give you another
feel for how those throws work so the
first throw was a 5 so at time 0 we're
throwing the ball high enough so that
lands five beats later at time one we're
throwing the three
e that that will land since it started
at time 1 we had three beats lands at
time for the third ball throwing it time
to one beat it just lands at time three
and then at time three that same ball
because we threw one now we're going to
throw that that same ball goes again
okay so looking across the timeline you
can see the first ball has the
experience throwing five then throw one
throws five and then won the second ball
though is just going in a three it feels
us through every time it's thrown it's a
three so it's kind of in its own sub
pattern third ball goes 15 which is very
similar okay so you can see how you can
mix patterns here together if they fit
in just right yeah we can juggle the
whole thing now not not every
combination of integers is going to be a
good juggling pattern and we want to
talk a little bit about that this is
this important point let me come back to
that first I want to give credit to the
inventors of site swap notation this
goes back to 81 I think the first one
Paul Klimek but there were a lot of
other juggling notations at the time in
the 80s jugglers were trying to figure
out how can I describe my tricks other
people can share it we didn't have
YouTube so they didn't have you know an
easy way to share videos and see each
other's tricks but yeah they would talk
about it and these long-winded
descriptions about you know fancy tricks
where I'm throwing it over this way and
then throwing that way we look quick it
turns out that's not so precise and the
jugglers were doing their tricks okay
individual jugglers knew exactly what
they were doing but they were trying to
communicate to other people and there's
a little bit of bragging rights on some
of these things like I invented that
trick first okay well I've been doing
about for 10 years so they get together
at conventions like this is like you
know people you know I say say I
invented you know kanj way back when
before we check even knew about the list
so they're arguing about their tricks
this is a way to succinctly describe
your tricks with a pattern and we kind
of merged all these different ideas
together where several of these
inventors have their own notations and
their own reasons for doing a notation a
certain way
but when they got together and after
some discussion and argument they
settled oh there's some nice
mathematical properties to the way
siteswap that we we know today so let's
get back to the siteswap one nice
property is that the number of balls in
your pattern is just the average of all
the elements in the pattern so we can
see the 531 add that up / 3 and you get
three okay the 71 okay it's only a two
element pattern but the average is is
four so that means there's four balls
you start juggling 71 you can think
about you through that seven up kind of
high and now there's a place for another
ball to go so that's a natural the
natural number of balls is then before
then the last pattern is a really
complicated one but we'll come back to
that that's a five ball pattern that
takes a really excellent juggler to do
that but okay so this is a necessary
condition that the average has to be a
whole integer but it's not sufficient
okay there's a little there's another
thing to think about there are some
averages that will still produce
collisions and so we're trying to do a
uniform juggling pattern we don't want
two balls landing at the same time so
what does how do we scheduled landing we
talked about this a little bit before
but the last line in this this is a well
this I think that the biggest code part
i'm going to show you today so we'll
take a minute to look at it but the last
line there we're using map indexed plus
on the pattern so you think about the
time sequence is the the first argument
the order in the vector is going to be
our time sequence so the landing pattern
for a ball is the height of the bowl or
the you know the number you're throwing
because that's in a land that many beats
later plus whatever time you're
launching from ok so that's pretty
simple if you think about it collisions
happen if we have you know two results
that that are the same number so we
apply reply distinct to the result now
there's a mod on the count or the period
of our juggling pattern that's just the
handle the kind of oddball cases or
someone throws one really high it's not
then come down right away but it will
you know it just works out
mathematically it will re-enter the
pattern
you know mod the number of throws you
have so if you do that and we have a
distinct result right unique numbers in
each place then that's a juggling
pattern that's valid insight swamp now
there's one other special case that I
had to consider and this is just my
opinion but if your pattern what about
the empty vector is that a valid
juggling pattern so I thought about that
long and hard okay there's nothing to
juggle nothing too I decided meditation
is the simplest form of juggling so I
will accept that okay I'm not sure all
jugglers agree but I think it works for
us programmers so of course once we have
a predicate it's natural you have to do
a speck in work closure so everyone has
to show a spec slide at the conscious
okay but it works out and my spec here
I'm limiting my throws 29 great jugglers
can do a little bit higher but it just
it's convenient for me okay so I want to
come back to another thing that I
alluded to earlier about orbits and this
is a way to decompose some patterns into
sub patterns and we the mathematicians
have called those orbits so with that 53
pattern that we saw before and we saw
the timeline you can think of that as a
501 pattern composed kind of by
superposition with the 030 pattern okay
and then these sub patterns are valid
juggling patterns you can juggle that
and you can think about like how many
bowls would be in the well we already
said that there are three balls in the
531 pattern that's the average 531
what's the average of 501 okay so that's
you know everyone thinks about that and
says it's okay add that 6/3 it's too
okay there's two balls that are
following this 501 pattern and the 03 oh
yeah that's that's one ball in that
pattern and this is really a nice
property and I know it's just kind of
one of those beautiful mathematical
things and part of the reason siteswap
notation is interesting I think is that
people you know we're exploring okay i
have these different notations they all
work they describe juggling but look at
this nice nice property we have from
from this kind of representation
and it's a simple representation it's a
little bit of code to pull out these
orbits but it's only a page code it's
not a lot and and it just it's very
pleasing I think for me at least I think
mathematicians like this kind of thing
so we can extract another pattern i show
here is 4 for 13 that's not even like we
if you're not a juggler that's not
obvious well what is that pattern but
you can think about basically there's a
four in each hand going up and down and
then there's one one ball just going
back going a three-one three-one doing a
little circle here now i'm not actually
good enough to do that juggling
especially kind of the night after the
party but but that's it that's a nice
little pattern and kind of regular
jugglers that really are dedicated can
do that so you can see there's first of
all the 4 for 13 is a three ball pattern
okay just take the average and you can
see there's one ball in each of those
orbits and the last one is more
complicated we'll look at that again
separately the other advantage for
jugglers to doing this kind of orbital
decomposition is that they can practice
the orbit separately okay so there's an
advantage we see there's a software all
time you want to decompose pull things
apart because then you can understand
them as individual things and you can in
this case for jugglers you can practice
you can get good at doing the 501 you
get good at the three that's that's
pretty simple then you can put those
together okay so you you know thing you
know things about these sub patterns and
you kind of get a feel for how that fits
together in a larger pattern and I think
we experienced that in our software too
so even though juggling complex there's
a hidden simplicity in there or
something you can you can pull out and I
hope we try to do that with our software
so I want to turn this down to doing a
little bit of programming so after
thinking about these patterns well
that's pretty cool not a good enough
juggler to do all these patterns but
maybe I computer can figure this out I
have closure I found you know the quilt
library's been spoken about its several
of these conferences is the convenient
graphics and animation package runs on
closure and closure script so I grabbed
this is my first quilt program
so I made a little package called
rastelli named for a famous old juggler
and then I made some animations and just
for this talk I made a little movie and
and put them on the slide so I'm not
doing live coding right now but it would
work and i'll let you have my software
later this is a 453 pattern which is
another beautiful pattern four ball
pattern and let me run that and you can
see the balls running and one nice thing
i like about rastelli is showing these
orbits it really helps you think about
where the balls are going and gives you
a better feel if you just see them
flying around in space real time it's
sometimes hard to pick out the orbits so
I just draw a little trace for you okay
and then one more example just because I
really think this is a beautiful pattern
we have three different orbits here the
balls are flying around and it just to
me that's just kind of almost art yeah I
could I can enjoy just watching that I'm
glad I don't have that for a screensaver
I'd never get anything done excuse me
okay and then this is a really
interesting pattern too because you know
you can see two bowls in this 901 okay
that's that's some basically really high
arching pattern okay so you can see the
high arches and then you can see the low
the ones this coming right across okay
so they're alternating and going across
like that but that knew I could do that
okay I can do that orbit so i could
imagine working my way up it's not easy
this is this would take years to for a
good juggler to learn but i could start
on it I'd get a feel for it so I can I
could pull out pieces and do some of
these individual pieces okay let's let's
get back to some more ideas about our
patterns and what we can do with
patterns so first of all there's
isomorphic patterns and this is like
just kind of obvious but you can repeat
a pattern and that's natural and
juggling so the three ball cascade if
you just keep doing it you can call it
3333 that's all the same pattern right
same shape if you rotate instead of
doing just 531 you do 315 that's still a
valid pattern it's just kind of the
mirror
because it's an we shifted one so we're
starting on different hand but it's the
same shape a pattern okay so we call
those isomorphic and we know those are
valid patterns we've already established
that one patterns valid and any of these
changes are still valid now how would
you make new patterns ok so the
mathematicians did some research here
and the first way a simple way is add
the period to any one element and that
creates a new but valid pat ok you know
you don't have to think about this has
been proven to work so from if you have
33 you can add two to that first because
there's two numbers in it so it's a
period of two you can add to the first
element a 53 is also a valid pack it's a
different shape of course but it's valid
and it's something you could transition
to from the first pattern you can get to
the second pattern ok the juggler can
add a trick or do something a little
different while he's juggling the more
general case is what we call swapping
sites and that's why the name siteswap
comes from the idea I can make a new
juggling pattern by taking any two
elements I'm going to swap places and do
a little bit of math and that math ok so
we're swapping two spaces there are
certain distance apart the one that I'm
bringing forward in time I have to add
the distance so if I if I had a three at
time two and bring it to time 1 i'm
going to add to write because I go from
tree move two spaces I'm sorry I'm
adding 2 to the 3 and getting five ok so
at the bottom we have an example there
the first three started at time zero I'm
moving that the time too so i'm going to
subtract two from that so i go from the
333 pattern to the 531 pattern I know
that's valid ok and we already know the
degenerate patterns the single number
patterns are all valid those are the
base juggling patterns just 23 just 24
just five that kind of thing so then
we're creating new patterns from those
base patterns we already knew and we can
keep doing this swapping different
elements adding the period you can
generate a lot of interesting patterns
just from that and we know we can
transition
from one pattern to other it's kind of
like lining up your parameters and just
knowing that all these things fit
together when we're programming software
jugglers have been doing this for a long
time okay and the reason this works is
because we're guaranteeing the same
landing pattern okay so you can see how
the math works on that this it's simple
math but it's it's kind of one of those
insights once you see it you say oh yeah
that's easy but it wasn't obvious at
first everyone and people had their
different notations so they finally said
that is mathematically elegant so I want
to come back to this slide hey thinking
about the 531 so now you have a little
bit of coaching you can see the periods
in their right to different periods you
can see what happens say if you swap the
three in the one right so like we're
throwing a one at time 2 and we dinner
pull that we're going to pull that
forward in time so now we have to throw
from time one right the ones moving
forward would have to throw it to the
3-wood boo back in time we'd have to
subtract from that and make it well
that's a little different example sorry
that anyway we have to switch switch the
values there as you rearrange these may
be a better example i guess the
switching the five in the end the three
we showed you can pull the five of the
three just change their order subtract
one from the five you get a four so now
we're throw it from time one we throwing
the four but it's still landing at the
same time at time five okay you can also
see how if you just rearrange the
numbers you could have problems you can
have collisions so if you throw the five
at time zero at lands at time five it's
at the second place or the say the third
place at time two if you through the
three at time two okay that would also
land at time five so that would be a
collision so that's why 513 is not a
valid juggling pattern okay it still
averages out right but we have the
collision at the landing site ok so the
mathematicians thought a lot about the
idea of
mapping your landing sites and that
leads the idea of doing a state
transition diagram for juggling the
states now are when you expect a ball to
land and so it's a vector of bits we're
using one for something we expect
something to land at you know the first
element is x 0 we've been juggling we're
in a steady state we expect a bald land
at x 0 we expect a bald land at time one
at time two that's the standard three
ball juggling pattern if you throw a
three right the first ball comes out of
the pattern you slide everything forward
and now you drop a one in the old say
you end up getting in the same state so
throwing the three is just a steady you
stay in the same state if you throw five
that that Bulls not going to come down
at time three anymore it's coming down
at time five so now we leave a hole in
the landing pattern so you can see in
the diagram if you start from kind of
the upper right side on your screen 1100
the three keeps you in the same state
you throw down to the five you get to
the new state and that's 1 1001 okay and
then once you're in any state we can
work out all the transitions that are
legal and to keep in a juggling pattern
and these are all the tricks that you
can do from a three ball pattern
limiting yourself I only want to throw
up to a five so i'll throw 20 25 and now
we've considered all this so get a nice
state transition diagram here and i want
to put this into lou i haven't quite
gotten to this but I'm gonna put this in
tulum or do a little graph analysis
enclosure and then use a state diagram
state machine like this to power my
juggling simulation so now my my my
little rastelli juggler can do is
standard pattern that you gave it but
then you can say ok show me put on a
show here and it knows the valid
transitions it can make other throws and
you can get really interesting complex
patterns just from these very simple
rules ok and so I mean I want to just
review the site flop features and try to
connect that to some of our our software
efforts so the first thing is we're
starting with a simple data
representation then closure programmers
all love that and
Stu how I mentioned systemic generality
well you know jugglers have been doing
that for a long time we're using this
simple integer notation and it's you
know easy to grasp easy to communicate
we'll get that also allows for a
flexible interpretation so when we're
talking about a 3 my free pattern might
be a little higher than like a super
experience juggler who can do a really
quick low 3 but there's still the same
basic shape and a 5 for me is relative
to my three so it's higher but it's not
we're not giving a precise number like
how high you're throwing at how fast you
throwing it you just want to you know
let the the interpreter the juggler do
his own thing that also means our
programs I can represent juggling the
way I want to show juggling and when you
saw my little diagrams yeah I was not
physically correct on everything i had a
little compression in my height so make
it fit better on the screen but the
timing felt right and it gives you a
good sense of how that juggling pattern
would work and i think any experience
juggler would recognize those patterns
and be able to try to recreate them so
flexible interpretations another good
element to have in our software we
talked about you we might be
communicating with other systems we're
not always in the closure world but you
know a simple data reference ation and
the flexible interpretation just a
little bit of common knowledge just to
know like we're in a juggling context
here is enough to let somebody else do
something with our clever tricks that
maybe they had never thought of as i
said before sharing jugglers originally
started this notation so they could
conveniently share talk about what they
were doing i think that that works well
in our in our programming world to we
want to share data sometimes want to
share code too but sharing data is
really important composition all the
closure programmers care about being
able to compose their programs we saw in
the juggling world we have composition
of sub patterns to make one pattern we
have these transitions that let us
extend juggling routines so we can put
things together in different ways and we
know they're valid so compositions
another kind of
motivation you can get from examining
juggling we saw the beginning
verification that's important idea give
me you can give me any pretty much
random set of integers I can verify
whether that's a juggling pattern I
didn't get into it but there's also
another theorem that says give me any
random sequence of integers I can search
through that and find a valid juggling
pattern that's that's the more advanced
proof but you can imagine just brute
force we can go find that that's really
interesting result then the last item
here is generation so you know we're all
really excited about test tech and now
spec with being able to generate you
know new data from from old data or
descriptions of the data and the same
thing help jugglers it was I think
really exciting when the jugglers said
I'm not only describing my current
patterns I found a way to describe all
the possible patterns you know given
three balls now we know how that works
and you can expand that to more and that
you know that's that's something they
discovered after they came up with their
notation okay this is not like oh I
wonder how could I describe all jumping
back it wasn't like that they were
juggling they wanted to share and then a
few mathematician said we'll wait a
second now that we have this pretty much
to examine our whole space of juggling
in the in the simple uniform juggling of
course there's advanced notation for
doing multiplex juggling and and other
like tricks beyond the uniform pattern
but still I mean I get a really good
feeling from having the generation
capability just at the simple pattern
and I think that's a lesson you know
we've I think internalized in the
closure community but generation really
is a valuable property and we want to
work hard to examine what happens when
we generate new patterns and we use it
for testing but we saw the the talk
yesterday about music and he says well
what if we just let the computer
generate some music and that that was
really fascinating so there's a whole
world to explore here with generation
and you know jugglers have been doing
this for about 35 years so so we have we
have some catching up to do
okay i want to give you a few more
resources if you're now interested in
juggling i don't know maybe you've been
juggling you probably already know this
but if you want to pursue juggling
juggling gorgs a great website the wjf
if you're more into the sport of
juggling they have what they call combat
juggling they where people try to knock
each other's clubs down yes competition
it's kind of fun to watch I never would
have thought of that myself they have
joggling which is running and juggling
at the same time and they have their own
events there where guys these guys are
good and it's another it's a sporting
activity but it's just a fun kind of
hobby Wikipedia is a great source for
lots of juggling information all the
jugglers and mathematicians contribute
to Wikipedia then there's a couple of
other sites for people have been doing
juggling programs for a long time so I'm
really late to this game but I'm going
to do my own spin on it and do some
closure alright that I want to give you
some other math resource if you want to
get into the mathematics of juggling
somebody wrote a whole book about the
mathematics is juggling you can get into
group theory and topology lots of sigmas
and subscripts I mean you can go to town
and math and go look up this book by a
record pollster he's at Monash
University in Australia he also
published a survey article which is a
great article i recommend you read that
you can read that one for free you don't
have to buy the book and the same
burkert pollsters done some videos on
juggling on the web and he has a great
quote here the way I feel when I look at
a nice equation the same way I feel when
I look at nice juggling pattern okay so
that's the mathematician enjoying
juggling and I I kind of enjoy his
spirit he's a lot of fun if you watch
some of his videos another great juggler
a math professor at Cornell Alan knutson
i hope i pronounced that right he wrote
the frequent asked questions summary for
sites notation that is on wrecked out
juggling been there for a long time over
a decade and he has a fantastic video
where he goes through all the siteswap
possibilities he's an excellent juggler
so he can illustrate everything I can't
I had to use my software to illustrate
some of those patterns but he can do it
and so look him up on the web that's
still another great video now I like to
change gear i think i have a few minutes
so i want to just mention neuroscience
this is kind of beyond my area of
expertise but i just happen to come
across this that the neuro scientists
are really excited about juggling it
turns out i'm stealing some slides here
for mark hot who's talking about recent
develops in neuroscience and especially
about blame brain plasticity so it turns
out they've done some experiments where
they train people in juggling they had a
control group didn't learn a juggling
and then another group who didn't know
juggling before they learned juggling
after a few months they did brain scans
before and after and they notice
increase in their gray matter in their
brains so they could see brains changing
due to learning and juggling it turns
out is just a good kind of task I mean
they fear in theory you would you would
see you know changing your brain from
learning a foreign language or learning
your clay musical instrument but those
tasks take longer you can you could
teach people juggling at least three
ball patterns pretty quickly and they're
excited because now they can see changes
in the brain and that that kind of study
was repeated they got similar results
this was even after a week they could
see the changes in the brain of people
had learned to juggle and they want to
explore that this is a great technique
now with it with better scanning
technology this kind of task to learn
and to see the changes in people's
brains really exciting for the neuro
scientists they also did another
follow-up study beyond this with older
adults and they see similar results so
even yeah we used to think that you know
as you got older basically you're just
losing brain cells and kind of a slow
downhill slide for older folks well the
good news is no you can you can learn
things you will acquire more gray matter
and white matter more get more brain
power just by learning new tasks so so
old dogs should learn new tricks it's a
worthwhile and in in this kind of
similar vein just
the benefits of juggling for real people
there i came across this talk from
jennifer slaw she has a series called
juggling life where she teaches people
to juggle and and reports just
anecdotally but you know I kind of
believe her because I like juggling but
people have improvements in their memory
and concentration flexibility patience
you know takes a while to learn how the
juggle balance and most these are good
properties for programmers too so I say
you know why not try a little juggling
she has a heartwarming story about
teaching a homeless girl who was in a
shelter how to juggle him you think well
that's not really important for you know
somebody in a shelter to learn how to
juggle but she reports that you know
this girl thought juggling was
impossible she could never do it and
just with a little bit of coaching and
mentoring and maybe it helps that
somebody you know took time to be with
her but yeah the subject was juggling
she learned how to juggle and she got a
tremendous sense of accomplishment just
from learning how to juggle and we hope
that might carry over to other parts of
someone's life yo if you get a coach and
you learn how to do something that seems
impossible and then you accomplish that
you get a sense that you can go do a lot
of other things so anyway I really
recommend this video she's a good
speaker and kind of fun story so finally
I want to just mention Michael motion
who's a fantastic juggler and a true
artist he uses excellent juggling skills
to explore rhythm and dance and music
and just he has a great artistic sense
so if you lean more towards the art side
of things and less towards a math you
might like to look him up on the web
just some really inspirational videos
and he was talking about juggling he
said what you learn is how to feel with
your eyes and see with your hands and so
to me that kind of express is a Zen of
juggling and you know if you're a
juggler you know that might make sense
to you if you haven't juggled you try it
you might like to learn something or
have a new experience there so to recap
juggling has inspired mathematicians
like Claude Shannon over the years
and I think we can learn a lot from how
they approach you know a complex subject
like juggling we reviewed the siteswap
notation which is which I call a
juggling dsl and I tried to make some
connections to our experiences software
developers from how the jugglers
approached their problem of
communicating their juggling patterns
and then we found some interesting
mathematical properties that derived
from just having a simple representation
then the third thing is I've written a
little closure library and that
simulates juggling called rastelli so
you know closures really useful for a
bunch of things so if you still doubt
that juggling is relevant to programmers
I just want to point out this painting
recently appeared on classic programmer
paintings I have no idea how it got
there but it's just a good timing for my
talk so yeah juggling juggling does
apply to programmers and I want to thank
my beagle he reviewed an earlier version
of this talk and finally I just want to
say you know juggling is fun and anybody
can learn to juggle so let's take a look
at my friend here
okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
