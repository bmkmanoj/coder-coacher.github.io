this screencast I will demonstrate some
of the leverage you can get from closure
spec
close respects are structural and
predicative descriptions of data and
because they describe data they also
describe functions which take data and
return data and macros likewise
writing a spec is a one-time investment
that repays you many times over given a
spec you can perform simple boolean
validation making sure that data conform
suspect or you can perform a conform
operation which picks apart the syntax
of the spec D structuring it and showing
you exactly how the data conforms to the
spec when data does not match a spec you
can get a detailed and precise error
message showing you where the problem or
problems are specs are composable which
means that you can make larger specs out
of smaller specs without compromising on
the precision of conformance and error
report give it a spec you can generate
random example data that conforms to the
spec and you can also use assertions
that assert that data conforms to spec
and then turn these assertions off in
production when you spec a function you
get enhanced documentation for that
function and the spec library writes
your tests for you so that you can
having written a spec for a function get
hundreds or thousands or millions of
generated tests finally spec allows you
to instrument functions to verify their
being called correctly in your program
let's take a look at all these things
working from a closure rebel
in the top panel I'll be showing you
closure forms and in the bottom panel
the result of evaluating those forms
first we'll load necessary libraries
closure not spec itself aliased as s and
closure to expect test for test time
tools alias as test
next we'll introduce an example function
that we will revisit beginning again
this function is called my index of and
it takes two arguments a source and a
search both strings and it returns the
index at which the search string appears
in the source
so I'll show an example invocation of
this looking for the string be inside
the string fubar that returns three and
then I'll show using closures apply
closures apply takes a function and then
takes its arguments as a sequential
collection and applies the function to
that collection of arguments this is
important because when you think about
it any function invocation can be
described this way regardless of the
number of arguments it has or whether
the function supports different
charities considering it this way you
can then write a spec for an argument
list using a regular expression not a
regular expression of characters as you
might be familiar with but a regular
expression of arguments so here's what
that might look like in spec so the
death form in spec defines a name spec
here I'm going to call it index of Arts
qualified in the current namespace and
this is a regular expression that
describes the art list as it might be
passed to a closure function via apply
so khat is a catenation so this gives us
one or more things the first thing here
is a source this is a name that I've
created which has to match the string
specification and then a second element
which is I'm women a name search and has
to also be a string
so I've evaluated that and created the
user index of arts spec now having
created the spec we can check the
validity of some possible argument lists
that might be passed to my index of so
two strings are required here I'm going
to do a valid check which takes a spec
and a valid argument list with flu and
the string F and we'll get back true and
then I will do a validity check of an
invalid argument list that has foo a
string followed by the number three and
it back false validation is nice when
you want the most inexpensive form of
test and don't need to get more
information about the structure of the
data or the location of a problem when
you want more information about how data
matches a spec you can call conform
conform takes a spec and data and
returns the possibly D structured value
of that data so here we're going to
conform index of Arts on the string foo
and the string F which is valid and
conform will return data that is labeled
that per the names used in spec so here
the idea that foo is the source term and
F as a search term is implicit in the
ordered syntax whereas in the conformed
value you'll see that those things are
named as we named them in the spec so
the source is foo and the search is F
unformed reverses can form it takes a
spec and a value and returns a value
that conforms to that value
when data fails to conform to spec
explained can tell you precisely why
explain take suspect and data and prints
to standard out an English error message
telling you where the problems are so
here we tried foo and the number three
which is not a string and explained
tells us that at position one remember
zero based position 1 the value 3 fails
the user index of Arts spec at its
search component because the predicate
string without returned false explain
stir is similar to explain except it is
functional so instead of writing 2
standard out that just returned as a
string value and you can start with
explained data which returns a data
structure and English if I it as you see
fit so there we see explain data
actually gives you data structure with
the path in the spec the predicate the
failed the value that failed the spec
that failed and the path into the data
itself
specs are composable you can make larger
specs out of smaller specs here every
form from speck takes a spec and makes a
collection spec that mandates every
member of the collection must conform to
index of arts notice also that I'm no
longer assigning a name to the spec with
SDF I'm just using it anonymously specs
are fully first-class so here we'll call
explain on our new spec and the
collection which might or might not be
valid it turns out not valid and the
precision of this error message is
terrific as we've composed this we don't
have to do any work to get precise error
messages reaching down into data so here
at position 2 0 1 2 at position 1 0 1
the value 42 is the problem if fails the
user index of our expect because it is
supposed to be a search whose predicate
is string and again 42 it's not the
string
specs can be used to generate example
data the exercise form takes a spec and
returns a collection of randomly
generated values where each value is
represented as a tupple the first
element of the tupple being the value
and the second element being the
conformed value so here we can see a
couple first element is a randomly
generated argument list for my index of
a very simple one empty string empty
string and then the second element of
the tupple is the conformed values
showing that source and search and then
several more generated values exercise
is useful for testing it's useful when
you're developing your own specs to
verify for yourself that your specs
cover the appropriate domain it's also
useful when you're trying to understand
specs written by others spec includes an
assertion mechanism which I'll turn on
now with check assert is true the assert
form takes a spec and data and always
returns the data in addition when check
asserts is on it validates the data
against the spec though an exception if
the data fails to validate so an F or a
valid index of args foo and the number
of 42 in a vector or not a valid index
of cards and we'll see in that second
case that when assertions are on you get
a detailed error just as what we've seen
before with spec assertions have no
runtime footprint when they are disabled
now let's look at something much more
substantial specking an entire function
the FDF form takes the name of a
function and allows you to specify three
things the arguments to the function the
return of the function and the semantics
of invoking the function let's take each
in turn the args we've already seen it's
a regular expression specifying the
catenation of a source string and a
search string the return is simply a
closure predicate which can be a spec a
natural int which says that this has to
be an integer zero or larger the fun
spec is by far the most interesting of
the three as it allows you to specify
the semantics of a function that is the
relationship between its return value in
its arts here we have an anonymous
function that says that the return value
must be less than or equal to the args
source elements size count so in other
words the return value of the function
can't be any larger than the size of the
source collection passed in
even in this very simple spec you can
already see five examples of ways that
specification is more expressive than
Java's type system first these arguments
because they are strings have to be non
nil second this natural integer has to
be positive or zero it can't be a
negative number
third this argument spec allows the
ability to specify different narratives
or different positional overloads all in
one place rather than having to spread
that information out across a variety of
different type signatures forth the
function spec is categorically more
powerful than anything you can do in
Javas type system because this allows
you to express predicates about the
semantics of the function that is the
relationship between the arguments and
the return value fifth and finally all
three of these and in fact anything
inspect can be written in arbitrary
closure so wild spec provides a lot of
built-in tools like regular expressions
like cat and predicates like natural int
it also provides the closure language so
unlike a type system like Javas that's
closed for extension you can extend this
in arbitrary ways by writing your own
closure programs as we have here with
this tiny closure program that verifies
that the return is sized to match the
collection past in
once we evaluate is f def there are
three things that we can get back from
speck the first thing is enhanced
documentation so we'll take a look at
the doc string for my index up and see
that you get closures normal
documentation plus aspect addendum that
shows collars of the function what
arguments they would need to pass in and
what they can expect this function to
return and do
you
second you can automatically test the
function tests check takes in this case
the name of a function and generates
using the generation capabilities of
spec valid arguments to the function it
then calls the function multiple times
with different valid arguments checking
that the return value is in fact natural
int and checking the function spec to
verify the semantics of the function
we'll pass this to summarize results
which produces suitable output to
consume here at the repple and we'll see
that even in the simple example that the
automatic testing have already found a
corner case that we fail to consider so
the failure result hasn't at the spec of
the failure the name of the function
that failed and then a precise path to
what went wrong so here you have the
return value did not conform it was
supposed to be a natural int but
actually the value was nil and if we
think about this for a moment we'll
realize that when we expect out this
function and implemented it we never
considered what happens in a non mention
case so what should be returned when the
search term is not present in the source
string and so we would need to go back
and either enhance this spec or enhance
this program
the third thing you get is
instrumentation so instrumentation
allows you to verify that functions are
being called correctly contrast this
with check which verifies that functions
are implemented correctly here we're
going to instrument a function this
replaces the function with a shim that
first checks the arguments against spec
and then calls the original function
having instrumented my index of we can
make an invalid call and get back a
precise error message telling us what
went wrong again the string if I'd error
message that spec can produce and the
data also Keeney telling us that the
failure was in instrumented function and
another key telling us the exact file
line number in variable scope in which
this happened this is particularly
valuable in larger scenarios where
you've chosen to instrument multitude of
functions across an entire project this
will take you precisely to the point at
which an invalid call is being made
rather than potentially hunting through
stack traces across a bunch of code with
which you are unfamiliar
so where are we spec allows you to make
a minimal effort to specify functions
and macros and get back a ton of
leverage from that effort you can
validate data you can destructure data
to interpret syntax you can get back
error messages telling you precisely
where data goes wrong you can compose
arbitrarily complex specs without losing
the benefits of conformance in
destructuring you can generate example
data you can add assertions sprinkle
liberally through your program with no
runtime cost you get documentation for
free spec write to your tests for you
and you can instrument your program to
make sure that your use of other
functions is correct if this kind of
power seems interesting to you you can
