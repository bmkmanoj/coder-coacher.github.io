talk to me I'm friendly
since the Kahn's last year I've been
learning about these things called Sat
solvers so if you don't know what they
are
you're just where I was a year ago we
don't do this for work or anything like
that not an expert I'm actually just
really interested in declarative
programming don't read all that this is
where I found the term declarative
programming I didn't know that was like
a thing you could like Google you know
but there's a lot of talk of you know
like core logic clear rules or the rule
engines that stuff are all in this space
but I don't recall a talk on constraint
solvers or those things in recent
history I didn't do the the check to
make sure I'm not talking about crazy
stuff but declarative programming in one
sentence is just separating the what and
the how of your programming so the sort
of promise is that you can describe your
problem or disorder and let the the
solver the engine get the answer that
you want and if you sort of do this
survey of this space you find us a lot
of stuff that has the same kind of shape
so it's a really narrow interface a
simple interface that could be called
solve or run and all the leverage comes
from these things the constraint
language and I had a whole bunch of
slides that I had cut for time that ha
awesome constraints were and it was sad
but they are really awesome I mean
they're general they apply to tons of
domains they're very very composable and
they remove at least the spirit of the
constraints is that you remove a lot of
the ordering complexity that comes from
just day-to-day programming so sort of
running your program backwards just kind
of falls out from this lack of ordering
but this is not a talk on constraint
languages and the subtleties there this
is a talk that's going to try and fill
in this magic comment on this slide so
here's our outline we're going to talk
about the boolean satisfiability problem
usually just abbreviated sat for short
then we're going to peek under the hood
a little bit and look at some of the
algorithms involved in statin solving
this case study and then we're gonna
open the junk drawer of you know rants
and random bits and stuff I just shoved
into I think I call discussion so sat
SAS
my ability I think we're all familiar
with this problem where we have some
piece of hardware or circuit diagram
that we need to wear Ivan look I'm
getting some blank okay I don't actually
have this problem usually I'm trying to
get my like CSS selectors to just work
but you know people have this problem
somewhere and usually you just try to
figure out okay can my Hardware get into
some you know known bad state that I
don't want it to get it or see an
example where it does go into that state
or maybe I just want to replace my
hardware design with a simpler hardware
design that uses less transistors or
something and I want to provably know
that these two things are 100%
equivalent how we would how would we
tackle something like this well the most
natural thing is just to take that
circuit diagram and translate it into
some boolean expression so this is
something a little bit more familiar
I've also written in closures that
that's a winner right and hand this this
boolean expression off to a solver and
have it see if this is satisfiable or
not and so if it is satisfied what we
call that Sat and we'd also like some
kind of satisfying assignment some kind
of assignment of the variables in our
expression that make the whole thing
true now if it's unset if it can't be
satisfied we'd also like it to produce
some kind of proof and I think this is
like a list of clauses it's not
something I understand so it's emitted
from the talk but you do want some kind
of proof back to say why this is
unsatisfiable usually hand that off to
another tool to double-check its work
and and so just to be totally clear here
we're not we're not just trying a
million guesses and saying you know I
timed out this is really a proof this is
really you know and so these are these
are tiny examples but for a large
problem this is not so much fun now you
can't just hand any a boolean expression
to one of these solvers you do have to
put it in there those kind of massage it
into the CNF or conjunctive normal form
and we'll go through some terminology
here quickly these things you might call
these variables but the literature calls
these literals so there's a sort of
subtle difference here X 2 and not X 2
are referring to this
variable we would think of that as the
same variable but x2 not x2 are two
different literals so you can put those
in the same clause which brings us to
clauses clauses are just or expressions
of literals and so to satisfy Clause you
just make any of the literals inside
that true and then this one down here at
the bottom it gets a sort of special
name we like those those are called unit
clauses and those are like guineas you
know so you look for those this whole
thing gets wrapped up in an end because
we want to satisfy all the clauses
simultaneously that's the goal and this
whole thing just is referred to as a sat
in so if I say the word instance I'm
just talking about the whole problem now
at this point in the talk I legally have
to tell you that this is an np-complete
problem which usually sends us running
you know this is not something we like
to hear but I'm gonna make the case
because you know exponential time
problems are not really you know awesome
but I'm gonna make the case that this is
actually a good thing because there's a
ton of other and p-complete problems
that we can just sort of map back to sat
and sat sort of becomes a target for
those things Sat solvers get you know
sort of highly engineered very well
tuned and if we can just get our problem
over to the set I think we're in a good
shape so we've already seen the circuit
satisfiability there's also a ton of
graph stuff that you can sort of map
back to sat but there's actually
important problems too
like bejeweled and candy crush I guess
anyway they do have a sack competition
that's sort of co-hosted with the sack
conference every year and you can sort
of get an idea excuse me of some of the
other applications it's usually like
again formal verification kind of stuff
software verification a ID planning
stuff like that and the you know sort of
it becomes like the target for that
stuff like I said just to give you an
idea so they have benchmarks so you can
download so two gigabyte giant file of
these things usually the the benchmarks
are in the range of like three thousand
variables ten thousand clauses and they
usually do them about an hour time out
but they solve most of them and some of
the quicker ones I usually solved in a
few minutes so they're really getting
pretty good
in industry I've heard rumors that these
things get up to like millions of
variables and millions of clauses I was
not able to bear by that but I did look
at the the conference website and there
was this there was a solver that
produced an unsaturated stuff so these
things get big and we would like some
help with our problems so this is sort
of the declarative workflow right we
want to work in our problem at a very
high level we want to describe our
problem in a language in a constraint
language that's close to our problem and
then we want to go through some kind of
encoding process so usually that's like
a polynomial time and maybe not x
squared or N squared but it's a very
fast encoding process and then we hand
that thing over in this case in CNF to a
Sat solver and that thing can be highly
engineered reuse across lots of domains
and can help us with the exponential
time of our problem so what is this
encoding process look like we're just
going to encode something that's a
little familiar to us hopefully Sudoku
and we're just going to encode a single
cell this I think once we see how to
encode a single cell into this hat it's
basically trivial to encode the rest of
the problem so we're gonna do that now
if we had CoreLogic how would we do this
well you can just write it almost in
English in core logic you fresh up a new
logic variable we'll call it cell and
then we just say that the value of cell
is exactly it has exactly one value and
it's in the range or domain of the
numbers 1 through 9 so this is really
easy in core logic but we're in set we
only have boolean x'
how can we do this you've probably
jumped to the answer in your head let's
use 9 boolean variables or literals and
you might take a first crack at it
writing something like this now this
gets us partway to the solution but of
course this also allows for something
like this and a cell can't have 1 &amp;amp; 2 it
has to have exactly one well we can
prevent the eye by adding another Clause
for that exact situation but now we have
sort of a whack-a-mole problem right and
we can keep adding clauses and keep
adding clauses until we get to this sort
of cross-product of all our literals and
that does actually get the job done
it's not pretty I think there are more
clever ways to do this but I don't care
you just wrap all that stuff into
another function call it one hot and now
we know that if we give this a bunch of
literals exactly one of them have to be
true and with that one hot function we
encode the fact that you know there can
only be one one in any column or row or
box and then we have the code the encode
the subsist specifics of our Sudoku
problem the fact that this cell holds
five and we can just add a bunch of unit
clauses to the end of our stat problem
or instance and that gets us the whole
way there so now let's take a sort of
peek under the hood and look at some of
the algorithms that have made this sort
of tractable and our mental model for
this is gonna be depth-first search and
then we're gonna you know once we go
through an example to feel what depth
first search feels like we're gonna
layer on tweaks and algorithmic changes
until we're basically not doing a
depth-first search anymore so let's get
an idea of what this feels like for a
problem with three variables we have to
take a guess here so we'll choose that
x1 is true and we're going to call these
decisions in the literature we're gonna
choose that x2 is true and choose at
choose x3 to be true and once we've made
all those decisions we can plug that
into our expression and try it out and
see if it's set if it's not then we
backtrack undo that x3 assignment set
that to false and try it again if this
if this does satisfy our boolean
expression that we just returned we're
done we'd like to go here very quickly
if we can but if that doesn't work out
we have to backtrack twice this time go
back up a level change X to try x3 is
true again and we sort of just do this
and this is just brute force right until
we hit all the leaves of our search
space backtrack all the way and if we
ever get back to this sort of sort of
route known we know that our problem is
unset and we could just tell people that
before we start changing this well it's
just a admire the flexibility we have in
the search space we don't have to try to
first we can try false first we have
that flexibility we don't have to try x1
just because I call it x1 first we
didn't try x3 first and try these
in any order and you'll definitely want
to do this use clever heuristics here
but what's the first thing that we can
do to get away from this sort of brute
force depth-first search arena because
this is not going to scale to n equals a
million well if we think back to the
Sudoku there's stuff like this right we
don't have to guess what's in this cell
what's in it cell 7 I don't know why I
did that there's that analog here we can
just deduce stuff about our SAP problem
if we know the x2 x1 and x2 are false we
can just sort of infer that x3 is false
so this feels like you know we're
getting information for free we don't
have to guess this is called unit
propagation because that causes the same
as this one one two of them are set and
here we can just infer that X bar is
true we get that for free and it's
called propagation because we're going
to do this recursively we're going to
keep doing it so here we've learned that
x4 is true plug that into the second one
and deduce that x5 is true now in the
course of this unit propagation if we
ever encounter a situation like this
this is clearly not satisfied so this is
the same as an or expression like this
and so it's referred to as the empty
clause and then of course that's a
conflict so we need a backtrack so what
does unit propagation get us it means we
don't have to go all the way to the
leaves of our search space before we
find out that we've had a conflict and
we can just backtrack much earlier so if
we sort of have this ying yang between
decision making and unit propagation we
get D PLL after the four authors this is
like sort of you'll see things akin to
this in other areas but in sap this is
called d PLL and we'll solve a real
problem just to make sure we fully get
it and we'll solve this again later on
the proper our instance is on the right
and our root node is on the left so
first we're going to do u2 propagation I
don't see any unit clauses so we have to
make a guess so we decide that x7 is
false and now you see this clause and
that gives us X 8 is false
with that information there's no other
propagation as we can make
so we have to make another guess here so
x9 is true and we see this clause here
at the bottom we can use information
from both decision levels to find out
that X 10 is also true and again we
can't do anything else so we have to
make one more decision here X 1 is false
and here we're going to get a sort of
chain reaction
we'll see this chain reaction again
later we got these two clauses that
prove X 2 and X 3 are true not proved
but then we get this closet with X 2 and
X 3 we can solve for X 4 then we get X 5
and now we get to an interesting
situation where X 6 is both false and
true well that's no good I could have
put one of these X sixes in the other
one and gotten the empty clause but I'm
going to show show it this way and of
course if we hit a contradiction like
this we have to backtrack so well
backtrack change x1 to true and through
a bunch of other decisions that I'm not
going to show you eventually we get to a
satisfying assignment so that's the PLL
it's fairly straightforward you probably
would just write that you know after
working on this for a little bit
especially if you familiar with some
other areas and like I said there's sort
of a gang yang between making decisions
and unit propagation so we'd like to
actually improve both of those and
there's a solver around
I think 99 2000 called chaffeur and it
was changed to Z chaff SATA solver that
did this so so V SIDS is it as a
heuristic that you can use to make
better decisions and I'm not gonna go
into the details of this but it's
actually relatively simple it's just
ranking the literals by the number of
occurrences and hopefully assigning
those first gives you to a solution
faster the other thing it did was an
improved unit propagation using a clever
sort of invariant that they called to
watch literals and we'll go through this
in some detail because I think it's
pretty interesting so here let's let's
imagine we have a large set instance on
the on the right and that's there what
happens in unit propagation well when we
get an assignment like X 3 is false we
have to sort of scan all the clauses in
our set instance sometimes these because
these things are large our statins then
sometimes we'll call us a clause
database and once I say that word
database you probably know where I'm
going we would like to add an index so
that when we set this 2x3 to false we
can jump right to the clauses that are
involved but we can actually do a little
bit better than this using some clever
thing about unit propagation when does
unit propagation happen when n minus 1
of the literals is set there's only one
left on the side so we would like to be
notified so to speak exactly when that
happens and we'll get close so just to
be totally clear if we only have x1 set
here we can't do anything
so rather than indexing all through this
clause by all three of these let's just
index by two of them at a time and
always be watching two unassigned
literals and if we always have two
unassigned literals we know that this
thing cannot be involved in unit
propagation this is a huge space savings
if we have a very large clause because
we're still it doesn't matter if there's
a million literals in this thing we're
just still only watching two and if we
ever assign one of the literals that
we're not watching well we know that
there's at least two I don't sign
literals in this thing and it's not
going to be involved in unit propagation
so I don't care if we do set one of the
variables that we're watching one of the
literals that we're watching well we
have to keep we have to maintain this
invariant and so we're gonna change our
index to point to one of the other
unassigned literals and if we ever do in
fact assign an - one of these things we
will be notified and we can propagate as
usual so what does this get us it it
goes from something like this this is
something like this and so we're
watching a lot less of the clauses it's
a huge space and time savings uh I think
the Z chaff paper says something like
90% of their time or something was spent
in unit propagation which sort of led
them to this technique so I thought that
was kinda clever but now kind of for the
main algorithmic event CD CL solvers
conflict driven Clause learning this was
introduced by a solver called grasp also
around the same time I think around 2000
or something this is so important that
we'll hear some solvers called CDC LSAT
solvers it's like a whole genre of these
things so there's a very this is very
important and the the main insight here
is that when we run into a conflict like
this we can actually do some analysis on
this to learn some new information
that's going to help us solve our
problem faster and to do that we use
something in the literature called
an implication graph so let's walk
through this if you remember from
decision level one we had X 7 was false
and we learned that X 8 was also false
and then on decision level three I'm
omitting some stuff here
we decided that X 1 was also was going
to be false and that led to our chain
reaction right so let's watch that chain
reaction in the implication graph that
implies that X 2 was true X 3 was true
now we have X 2 and X 3 we can imply X 4
is also true we get X 5 and this is
where we hit our conflict we have X 6 is
false and true now if I isolate the
conflict you can sort of see this is
like a dependency graph right the stuff
on the left eventually sort of not
forced but leads to the stuff on the
right the conflict and we like that not
to happen but this whole solver state is
not involved in this and if I remove
some of the nodes that becomes very
clear it doesn't matter how we got to
this assignment of these three literals
it's always once we arrive at that
assignment we're always going to hit the
same conflict this little dotted white
line is called a cut and we have some
flexibility in where we make that cut as
long as we isolate the conflict from the
literals that led to it so if I move it
you can get to a different set of
literals and this particular particular
cut is called the first unique
implication point
not particularly important but just know
that I strategically picked it and you
know for this thing that I just said
stuff on the left is the reason side and
stuff on the right is the conflict side
so the reason side our solver state led
to the conflict and what's true about
our solver state so there's a you know
this is this is true it this expression
is true when our so when we're in this
so x4 is true and X 7 and 8 are false
and we'd like to learn something from
this and the name implies that we're
gonna learn a clause so we're gonna turn
this into a new clause and I'll show you
how I do that so you know go back to
sixth grade where you have to show your
work this solver you know this
expression was true and it led to this
conflict what we would like to not have
a conflict and there's a thing in
propositional logic called the country
contrapositive comes positive says if X
implies Y and you ever discover that Y
is not true then he knew X was not true
if it's raining outside and I always
carry an umbrella when it's raining have
you ever seen me without an umbrella
then you know it's not raining so you
know if we negate the conflict side we
can also negate our solver state but
this doesn't get us to a clause quite
yet we also have to use the Morgan laws
and you might know this just kind of ad
hoc and maybe not the name but all that
says is that if we ever negate an an
Clause or an or clause we just flip the
operator and negate all the other
literals in the expression and so that
now finally we've sort of proven that if
we don't want to conflict this thing has
to be true what did that really buy us
well if the original problem is
satisfiable this thing is also
satisfiable so we can just add it to our
instance and we can use this in our unit
propagation as we continue to solve the
problem this is pretty nice there's
another benefit to this let's just
imagine what would have happened if we
had had this clause the whole time you
know what's particularly let's look at
decision level one where we had x7 and
x8 already we had had that and we knew
those were false
we could have inferred that x4 was false
but it took us to decision level three
to figure out that exports had to try
that x4 was true and that's what led to
the conflict so we can actually back
jump all the way the decision level one
we don't have to do a single level back
backtracking so this is sometimes called
not a chronological backtracking or a
back jumping and it just means that we
can just back back jump all the way up
there and take a different path and this
cuts off huge swathes of the search
space and this is a you know a very
clever algorithm now when you do this
technique
there are a few concerns that you have
to think about you can't just add
clauses forever you would get to like a
space issue and so you have a sort of
garbage collection problem and usually
the answer is just keep some bounded
number of these clauses around removing
redundant ones or or keeping important
ones or something you can also minimize
clauses before you admit them to the
closet a base so you may have something
you know you may have learned a clause
that's like a thousand literals or
something but there may be some
redundancy in there and using a trick
called resolution and your other clauses
you can minimize some of that stuff
before you admit it so there's a space
savings the last concern if you're doing
this you probably want to do something
called phase saving and you can sort of
imagine that you know the conflict that
you ran into is in a completely
different part of your problem that you
already have solved but because you've
sort of probably all doing your problem
all simultaneously and you back jump in
one area you're undoing the assignments
in this other area so we would like that
not to happen if we can and the trick
here is just to remember the last
assignment that you had for everything
and then if you ever have to make a
decision in that area again well you
just try the last thing you tried before
this is a very nice technique and it
makes the things a lot faster it doesn't
undo as much work so here how how
important is this graph sort of
numerically this graph is a really
interesting graph so this is a this line
right here is a fully-loaded relatively
modern Sat solver with all the features
out here the stuff that's been
engineered quite well and what they did
for this study was this is number of
instances solved over time that wasn't
that's not readable there what they did
was they removed single features to see
how important are those features or they
really just made redundant because this
is a long period of research that led to
this a ghulam or you know accumulation
of all these interacting features well
if you removed clause learning it puts
you all the way back here so that's no
good so this is a very important
technique and that's I think that's why
these are generally called CDCl solvers
this really is that important but I sort
of promise to you that we would not be
in
at first and we're still in depth first
so we've tried backtracking
we tried back jumping what if we just go
all the way back to the root that's kind
of insane why would we do that well I
put it this way you know we are setting
our decision level to zero we are
clearing out all our assignments but
we're not clearing out that they'll
learn two clauses so we're not losing
progress
it just gives us a way to sort of get
unstuck if we're in a difficult part of
the search space we keep all our clauses
we reset everything else and then our
heuristics can kick in again and make
some better decisions you know again if
we had had these causes all that all
along we would have been much happier so
that's the last line on this chart
recess resets seem to you add sort of
robustness you know you solved the same
instance several times in a row and you
know sometimes you get this like weird
outlier where it times out or something
and this sort of gets you out of that
space you want to do this fairly
frequently it sounds like and there's
some subtlety and restarting you know
scheduling and stuff like that so that's
all the algorithms we have now onto the
rants and you know whatever else I have
but first I want to sort of take a
slight detour here to go back to the
np-complete thing the first one was
legally binding this one's just kind of
for me i watch that talk by thomas bell
on automated theorem proving and I saw
this slide this is an adapted version of
the slide it's the first time I really
got on the sort of visceral level what's
happening when you're moving to these
declarative approaches and these are the
complexity classes that I think we care
about in this conference what's in the
undecidable space right closure any
tearing complete thing is it you know at
the worst case gonna be undecidable
what's in the semi decidable space core
logic and SMT solvers are the first
order logic stuff I know we'll come back
to SMT solvers and of course this thing
at the bottom here is set so they're
sort of really is a trade-off here at
least that's the way I interpret this
you know when we sort of lower our
problem and confine ourselves to these
constraints these declarative things we
really are forcing ourselves
use simpler stuff and we can make you
know maybe different guarantees about
the tooling and stuff around that thing
it still doesn't completely explain why
we were able to solve these problems at
all if N equals a million exponential
you know two to the million is not so
good well it turns out you think these
things aren't random so on the right
here we have a random satin instance you
can see it's just like a hairball that's
going to be your worst case exponential
time nonsense
but on the left is actually a real
problem from industry and it has all
this structure you can immediately see
the structure in that thing well we're
humans and we have human problems we
know we're not solving random things so
the to the extent that we can take
advantage of the structure in our
problems these you know solvers can see
symmetries and do clever heuristic --all
they're gonna solve these things that
are supposed to be like you know 2 to
the N or whatever much faster feels like
all right what's the actual current
research well I do encourage you to go
out and read some of these papers I find
them actually fairly readable I'm and
I'm new to this but if you do you're
gonna encounter some notation that you
might not be familiar with so I sort of
brush this aside for this talk I call
this my alien language slide because I'm
explaining one alien language with
another so the you know the sort of
carrot thing and the upside-down carrot
thing that's and and or the right angle
thing that's not the area we've already
seen implication I did make a cheat
sheet is sometimes when I'm reading this
I get a little cross-eyed and I forget
which one is which real talk
so I made a cheat sheet I like to think
of these things as arms so and is
picking up both of its arguments you
know it both need to be true this is
stupid I know it's stupid all right this
one's even more stupid so or does not
care right either one can be true so yes
I actually do this when I okay areas of
research basically everything that you
could think of around this topic is a
current area of research I'll pull out a
few of these here so pre-processing we
haven't talked about you know after
you've encoded your problem there's
still some rewrites you can do before
you hand it to the Stata solver to make
things a little
easier to solve so those techniques are
like symmetry breaking block clause
elimination is another one to Google the
decision-making heuristics for that
there's a whole other class of solvers
called look-ahead solvers that use more
global heuristics and they're you know
more expensive because they're going
over a large part of your problem to
make those decisions but they are going
to make better decisions and parallelism
I'll point out because it's sort of
counterintuitive why that's difficult
this sort of seems like something that
should be sort of embarrassingly
parallel but as I think I think what's
happening is you're pruning out more and
more of the search space so it's hard to
keep all your cores and all your
machines going on something like this
so parallelism is kind of tricky there's
a really good paper on a technique
called cuban conquer and it blends
look-ahead solving and CDCl solving so
uses look Ahead's to make smarter
decisions earlier and then CDCl
followers on what's left and hammering
out all the all the rest of the stuff
the other place you'll see sad solvers
in is inside SMT solvers
so SMT stands for satisfiability module
of theories which sort of Lee get to
like a sort of a Zen in place before you
get that name but the satisfiability
part is the same it really does use a
Sat solver inside but the nice thing
about SMT solvers is that they have a
much more expressive constraint language
so you can use integers in sets and
lists and bit vectors you know unbounded
integers which you can't do a set and
how does this work it what I really
tried very hard to figure out like where
does that fit into this equation well
turn you know this is my current
understanding of this you pull out all
the integer stuff in your expression
hand that over to an integer solver and
in its place you sort of leave a hole
like the result of that clause and so
the Sat solver is sort of grinding on
the whole problem deciding which
combination of clauses they need to be
simultaneously true and then informing
the other solver so it sort of sits in
between all these other solvers and they
call them theories I'm gonna hand away
of that because I don't understand as
much about that but that's the sort of
relation at least conceptually to SAP so
it enables these things and where do
these things really get used the most
that
right now is in other tools because I I
do think you know declarative
programming in general changes the way
you write systems and and and tools and
things but specifically I think like SMT
solvers and stuff are just changing the
architecture of these things you know
and I'll give you one example to show
you what that means there's a there's an
awesome talk called super optimizing
LLVM by genre gear he's also at
university of utah will world Berta's
and he's a really good teacher I really
like this talk and I'll just give you
kind of the crux of the other thing if
we look at a piece of code like this
when does food get called there's not a
trick question
it's so when the you know the less than
condition is met you know foo gets
called when does it get called now well
you can we can all look at that it seems
like never this is not like a JavaScript
lat moment or something
you know that's dead code we would like
our compiler to eliminate that and
figure that out so if you were writing
this compiler path I want to just take a
moment think about how you might try to
find that sort of pattern and eliminate
that what if I change it to this this is
still the same thing this is still dead
code you still like it behind it and I
can put more code and make it more and
more complicated and it gets hard and
harder think about how you might write a
pattern to sort of find this thing and
eliminate it and that's just one
instance of dead code so there's sort of
this a compiler economics of like taking
your source code and handing it to a
compiler and it goes through a number of
compiler passes that all sort of look
like this and there's some kind of hand
coded pattern matching things is very
general obviously and then there's some
hand coded analysis that sort of safety
check to make sure that this
optimization can kind of sort of fire
and then if it all works
oops if it all works then we rewrite
your code and make it better hopefully
so super is his tool and he's trying to
get out of that that bad economics game
and all super you know the the main
thing that super does is it takes your
code and translates it into a bunch of
constraints that you can then hand over
to an SMT solver and ask questions so
you know is this dead code
can this be replaced by a fixed integer
you know is this always the same result
things like that you can ask the SMT
solver and maybe maybe it times out and
it doesn't do anything with your code so
it does hand those constraints over to
SMT solver like z3 and the beauty of
constraints and working you know in in
that sort of world is that these are
referentially transparent they're always
going to return the same answer you can
just put a cache in so even if you spend
a day solving one of these little
problems you can just stick it in the
cache build up your cache and then next
time you compile pull it from the cache
and hopefully it doesn't slow down your
compile time at all
so as these things get more and more
expressive and more and more powerful I
think we start to feel like we have one
of these right and everything looks like
a nail I certainly get into this mode
where I get all excited I watch down a
gear and it's like oh cool
but I have to like sort of temper myself
so I invoked the sage wisdom a Tim Ewald
couple a few years ago at cons and he's
got this a really beautiful whole talk
about woodworking and stuff close your
hand tools he has this slide that jumped
out at me when I saw this a few weeks
ago about automation chaining a
perception you know when we when we do
these things that make it easier it's
good to have powerful tools like this
but it doesn't mean that we can like
turn off our brain right so I think
there's a certain amount of like taste
and stuff in using these things and I
think there's a lot of opportunity here
anyway with that I will leave it on
Tim's note and just say thanks I hope
you learned stuff I hope they didn't say
anything to wrong somebody can correct
me I have more references and links to
other talks us up there
come find me like I said I like talking
about the clarity of stuff core logic we
declare rules in production and stuff
like that or if you just want to learn
how I made a hammer out of keynote
shapes anyway have fun I'll talk to you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
