present a little bit of our experience
pitfalls things we've learned things
that we loved with closure running it in
production we use closure script in the
web browser we have a full closure
back-end we interface with all sorts of
other cloud systems so maybe we can help
prevent some of the missteps that we
made with other people and also show you
unexpected good things that we found in
also just you know general clothes your
love so let's go alright so first before
I get into the design of our system I
think that you sorta have to know what
our system does and to get to what our
system does we have to sort of go with
the why because frankly almost
everything people build is for a reason
why and the what just sort of flows from
that so let's begin with an experiment
if you have kids know kids have seen
kids imagine you put a child down the
two-year-olds in front of Dora the
Explorer and now we're going to add
something we're going to add this if you
have kids you know what you know what's
coming on this next slide this is what's
coming on the next slide and this is
actually my my daughter was two at the
time this is a real picture of what
happened when dora the explorer' froze
up at our house and so a company was
born this is the why she actually tells
her friends that her daddy is fixing
YouTube because how else do you explain
it to her she's now five though and you
know it's been three years of sort of
solving this but but honestly this is
sort of how we all feel inside when
video on the internet fails we're all
wanting to kind of scream and cry we've
just sort of build on these layers of I
guess maturity we'll call it where we
don't do that anymore and so our system
is designed to make video no longer
buffer no longer fail no longer
show sort of the grainy bit rates and
basically we can never make the current
situation worse
so always better never worse and so
everything is designed with that in mind
we can't have an outage because of some
system on our end being down we can't
have an outage because our code doesn't
work in the browser and screws up the
video playback so so let's talk about
why closure well a couple of reasons I
actually learned list when I was in high
school did the whole Eliza sort of
psychologists programming thing if
you've ever seen that it was kind of
like a bot just way worse if you didn't
understand what you said it would just
pluck something from the history and say
oh you said you like talk to earlier so
tell me more about hockey or something
you know but I learned that in high
school and then it was sort of a unique
thing in that it was one of those
languages that sort of stuck with me
you'd always seem to have this place
around academia and early AI and so then
when Clojure sort of came out and
brought Lisp and meshed it with all of
the libraries from Java and then there
was clojurescript as well so that we
could kind of program in one language
both client-server side we just figured
we'd give it a shot and so this was in
like late 2013 so this was the early on
the closure script side we've had lots
of sort of bumps in the road that we've
solved and I think they're solved now in
better ways but what we have works so we
just sort of lived with them
the second thing that was important with
closure is the repple and that's so that
you get that sort of instant feedback
you can kind of play around with it you
can try and solve the problems
interactively and that's been very
helpful and you know of course we all
know this because we're here for closure
but when I get to the team piece these
are the types of things that are
important to explain to a person why
they have to learn this weird new syntax
what our syntax with lots of parentheses
so it's important to remember these
years the kinds of things besides just
you know something about the language
that was nice the functional thing helps
sort of reduce bugs you can keep
all of your state in one area which is
very helpful for debugging and testing
in our system in particular we have a
large scale of clients so everyone
watching video at all of our customer
websites all connected to us
simultaneously sending lots of data and
there's some other pieces that we've
created where the clients can
interconnect with each other and so the
the STM was very important for that
because it sort of abstracted away a lot
of the kind of race conditions that are
sort of very common in that
multi-threaded programming now we found
new more complicated and better race
conditions that we created ourselves and
but at least some of them were taken
care of
also our system is very much written
like a client application but in
JavaScript so being able to avoid
JavaScript slack of threading with core
async I mean it still is it real
threading but at least all your logic is
in the same place avoiding that callback
sort of situation was also very helpful
I've always liked v-max so why not
and maybe it's fun so we'll see so next
I'll talk about sort of how the system
works so we have all the clients that
are watching video and various advices
and our solution initially targeted web
browsers so you can imagine these people
mobile browser desktop browser
you know iPad browser etc and those are
all running closer Script we basically
keep a WebSocket connection open and it
sends edn messages to the cloud on the
right side and we sort of designed the
whole system to use this sort of
messaging architecture so that if you
just dine for messages you're already
inherently expecting that you might not
get a response to where the response
might take a long time and that helps
sort of build a scenario where you're
not like making an API call and if it
doesn't come back video doesn't play
back again we can ever make the
situation worse or
customers will not be happy with us
because we're supposed to be making the
situation better last year I came to
closure West and I saw a particularly
interesting talk that I think if this
type of thing interests you would be
good for people to watch and it was the
web development is distributed systems
programming by Michaela patella
hopefully I said that right in terrible
pronunciation names and she talked about
how if you just real able yourself even
as a web developer on the client side or
on the server side that the distributed
systems programmer not only does that
help you from a salary and higher
ability standpoint but it helps you
rethink what you're actually doing and I
think that's a very valuable sort of
thought to keep in mind is that each
piece in our system is connected through
messaging and they just have different
limitations so in the browser there's
certain limitations on the server
there's certain limitations but
essentially distributed systems that
talk to each other so what is in the
cloud let's see well it's Turtles all
the way down to actually our Turtles
it's all messages we use agents Alif
core async and lots of messaging and
basically internally on the server I'll
get into some of the use cases with why
we're using different sort of message
systems but it's all sort of messaging
it's all sort of asynchronous all
throughout and then we also talk with
some various cloud systems through
messaging we use like Google's data flow
which does our big data processing for
us for a lot of these messaging use
cases all right so on the development
side let's talk about what not only me
but our development team now loved about
closure and they really liked that
reprobates development they liked that
instant feedback early on with closure
script that was very difficult and so
there was this sort of shock when they
went from the server side to the client
side my understanding is that's much
better now we've unfortunately done some
things that we would have to go fix a
bunch of old code to actually
that work the way we want it so we we
still we do use the repple base
foreclosure script a little bit mostly
we have it sort of compiling and then
rating refresh so it's not all
instantaneous like we would like it to
be they also love the access to the Java
library so basically if there's ever a
library that is not in closure you can
find a Java library for it to work worst
case you can always kind of default to
that so you're not in a scenario where
whatever you want to interface with or
whatever you want to do like no one's
ever done that before the Java ecosystem
is is giant I mean there's pretty much
solutions for everything I saw some talk
sir yesterday and earlier today where
people are constantly talking about new
libraries that I had never heard of that
have been around a long time so a lot of
stuff is solved for you new database
comes out that's probably going to be a
Java library for it if you hear some
technique for you know solving
differential equations it's probably a
Java library for it which is really
really useful in terms of productivity
so that we can just focus on what we're
doing and not creating you know sort of
custom libraries for things that are
already solved somewhere else they also
they really like continuous integration
although that's not specific to closure
that was a piece that we built in very
early on with this process where we
actually use the Great Circle CI
continuous integration so every every
commit every build is being run through
continuous integration it notifies them
of the you know any sort of issues of
course now there were some challenges
with continuous integration again
especially on the closure script side
it's gotten tremendously better but even
on the closure side one of the things
that has been somewhat challenging is
that the libraries for testing and what
has been sort of I don't know in vogue
at the time has changed and so we have
stuff in the default closure testing
library we have some migi testing we
have karma testing
the JavaScript side experiment was
unfortunate things in that very early on
enclosure the testing itself was still
being figured out what's the best way to
do it was what made sense what didn't
and so one of the things that we've done
recently is that if colder core has the
solution that is what we use because the
core has been very good at being stable
kind of follows our philosophy of only
better new updates only make it better
they don't really change a bunch of
surface area to where things break the
developers also like that basically
there's kind of two things in closure I
know this is a simplification but things
are either a hash or a sequence and you
know so data types etc it's either it's
either a hash or a sequence or hash or
sequences or sequence of hashes but you
don't have to keep learning all the kind
of bizarre data types you can just sort
of print out the data type and you'll
see what's in it you know you don't
there's not really any surprises there I
know that's you know the super core of
language but it also sort of enters into
your thinking when you're building
enclosure everything starts working like
a hash or sequence so you know this one
things where I'm only people that
doesn't like to decide what clothes I
wear each day so I have a sequence of
clothing and you know fresh clothes go
go on the back end and then I just keep
pulling them off the stack on the other
side you know that's maybe too much
information but that's what I'm here for
and then they really like the threading
for JavaScript so the the sort of being
able to use the go loops to help kind of
once they cover over but not make you
have so much cognitive load on the
JavaScript side with all the callbacks
because essentially all the logic kind
of flows in order with the go loops you
can you're sort of you know you're
seeing is pulling things out of a queue
essentially versus the callback scenario
I know JavaScript has made lots of
advances in that space but we didn't
have to learn them so that's good but we
did have to learn how to figure out the
core async stack traces
javascript which were pretty rough
pretty rough for a while and then Emacs
I loved Emacs we'll find out about the
rest of the team they learned that the
parentheses that initially sort of cause
people problems after you just like
accept them that it's actually nice
because it's very clear where things
start and stop and you don't have
confusion you know it's all the sort of
notation around the code is the same and
that they learn to really like that we
also learned that pretty much all the
bugs are in the stateful part which is
which is one of those things that you
know I think it's important to recognize
so then closer mostly you're trying to
keep all the functional stuff in one
place if you can test very well and the
stateful stuff sort of at the edges in a
separate area that you know commend you
can sort of test the state P separate
from the functional piece and be certain
that the functional piece is working and
then you know the bugs are in the
stateful part and that's that's been
pretty much our experience is that
they're almost almost a full part also
they like to do the repple if you're
testing the functional part and you are
trying to figure out whether your
function does what it's supposed to do
you know you can run it there at the
repple and if it now does what you want
it to do or if it failed to do what you
wanted to do and you had to recompile it
now you can just copy and paste that
testing you're doing is a repple into
your unit test it's actually a really
great way to at least ensure you don't
have regressions sort of document the
sort of ways it could have gone wrong in
the past it just makes that very simple
because you're essentially writing tests
as part of your coding and then the last
one which soon lots of people on Emacs
here again I love you max for developers
who don't know Emacs coming in making
them learn Emacs is probably not the
right way to go we found that having
them use cursive is actually a much
simpler kinder way to get them into
Clojure and fortunately or unfortunately
they usually stay in cursive it's one of
the things where I think those of us
that use Emacs are kind of like it just
feels very magical when you're using
Emacs it's just your brain is in tune
with it
but I think it looks very confusing to
people who don't know Emacs and that's
not to force that on them because if
you're going to try and teach them
closer you know it's better not to try
and make them learn too many things so
that at least they're not hating Emacs
and thinking that close your zmax you
know so here's some of the things we
love we've been in closure for a long
time so we have a whole litany of
basically abandoned libraries the good
part about abandoned libraries is that
if they were working in production
they're still working in production but
but there has been sort of this trail of
frameworks in recommended ways of doing
things that have all sort of died off I
mean we still have some sort of some
internal admin tools that run on the
first pedestal so not whichever one
they're talking about now and I'm going
to go see it not because I don't think
it's great but because our whole team
learned the first pedestal which we
thought was awesome and it went away and
so you know that's that's a struggle a
bit is that there's not the libraries
that sort of get left behind also choice
can be bad in the sense of one example I
was talking with some people here about
is that if you want to do blogging like
he's gonna log stuff in closure and
there's like four or five libraries if
you pick the wrong one and then it later
gets abandoned like you made the drum
choice so you don't always want choice
around things that like everybody's
going to be doing I don't I'm not saying
any one's better than the other I'm just
saying that you know sort of from a
longer-term standpoint having all the
choice allows you to more easily follow
the pitfalls of the abandoned libraries
debugging it's getting a lot better it
can be difficult to wrap your head
around initially from the developer
standpoint of the stack traces you know
they're complicated I know we've had
many instances where
you know when you have macros it can
kind of confuse the stack trace if
someone's not taking real good care and
they write those macros to try and you
know do something to help make those
those errors more sort of presentable
the evolving too fast is kind of like
with the abandoned libraries I mean and
it's not bad because you want things to
evolve fast but it does leave people
behind in again production that gets
hard I have on here a different bird
with parens makes you sad because a lot
of times when you're checking in new
code if you have the parens and they're
you know it'll like to add an extra one
to the bottom you can if you ignore
whitespace then it'll maybe do you know
sort of two different lines it's adding
and it just it makes it very easy to
have these sort of git commits it look
very strange it's not just like the line
of code you wrote there's like extra
parens that get pushed into other places
and that doesn't make it as clear when
you're kind of doing a get deep bug
against the code and universally
everyone who didn't know Emacs on our
team hey team X so they don't they don't
share my sort of love of it I mean they
they like watching people use Emacs they
just don't want to use it themselves and
advance compile for codes or script if
you've ever used close your script
advance compile is just like it is it's
just a sort of field full of minds we've
gotten to a place now where we've made
all these these sort of changes to make
it not so thorny I watched you talk
yesterday about how to generate the X
turns we've just used line X turns if
anyone's familiar with it basically
generates an external file it's not
optimized X terms it's just you won't
shoot yourself in the foot with that
those X terms in that file and we've
just gone with that because we'd rather
not break stuff then and overly worried
about the optimization at this point I'm
going to the operational standpoint you
know from actually operating these
things so some of the things we love
stability basically the stuff runs and
we don't really have problems part of
that's our configuration but closure
itself is very stable once you've worked
out the issues there isn't there aren't
as many race conditions although they do
pop up
but you kind of you tend to find those
fairly quickly there's not a lot of bugs
that sort of just hide out for a long
amount of time although I will cover one
a little bit here that was particularly
vexing and so that part's really great
even those old libraries like I was
saying they continue to run work
perfectly fine it's just that if you now
need a new feature for example who is if
it was interfacing with a cloud service
and they added some new features to the
cloud service and now the library that
you were using is abandoned you know
it's like switch libraries completely
the one that now supports those extra
features and that's that's kind of you
know a pain but if you don't ever need
that the old code works perfectly fine a
little bit later on I'll show a lot of
libraries we use and I I want to I'll
mention them for two reasons one its
kind of like thank the community for
providing all those libraries because
it's really a system that depends on a
lot of work from everybody on all sides
but also a lot of those libraries if
you're newer to closure you probably
never have heard of and never will and
then also in operations they really like
the performance I mean the
multi-threading the STM the software
transactional memory works really really
really well as long as you know what the
contracts are on those types of things
with atoms and agents it all works
really great if that's part of your use
case and then we really like alec we've
used it for a long time
I don't know Zac Colman's in here but
he's probably knows all this stuff alex
is really great because it allows you to
sort of control it's like a core async
with more controls over threading and
you can have the way we used is we have
a fixed number of worker threads based
on the computers that the code is
running on and our system is built the
way that messages can kind of disappear
and not be handled and we don't want
that to happen but it doesn't actually
break anything on the video playback
side and so it supports lots of those
things so that if you had some crazy
client which can happen in the web world
they won't take down your whole system
so it has lots of nice controls over
throttling fixed worker threads and Zac
fixes things really quick I came last
year with a problem I went to his
unsession where we were all drinking
beer as I mentioned it to him he said
put in a pull request when I got back to
the room that night I put in the pull
request so I wouldn't forget and then
like an hour later it was fixed he had
released a new version so he cares about
these things so if you see him give him
a high-five for me he's awesome
some things that we learned and repple
is your friend sometimes when stuff goes
wrong in production we actually have a
rebel that is available on localhost on
the boxes so we can kind of connect in
remotely and connect up to a repple of a
live production box and that is super
useful when you're trying to debug
things because sometimes what is
breaking only occurs in production and
being able to sort of dump out certain
variables see what's going in you know
count you know things that you expect to
have a low number of items and see
whether they have a high number of items
those types of things are really great
and they help work around some of the
other debugging challenges that exist in
closure
we also learned don't upgrade don't
upgrade the libraries for no reason the
semantic versioning not everyone follows
that and so sometimes you upgrade what
is supposed to be a minor release and it
will break things so we don't upgrade
them unless things are broken which is
also I mean it's something we learn but
then it's also not good because you
would like to keep up on security things
so there's a sort of weird mix where you
have to approach upgrades with a lot of
caution on the libraries and they're
upgrading very rapidly sometimes we're
two in three and four minor versions
behind we also learned that the best way
to sort of handle these processes in
production is to reuse Monat to kind of
like monitor the process it'll check
whether the server is still alive it can
check things like is it using too much
memory is using too much CPU for too
long of a period of time and will auto
restart the process that works really
well to avoid scenarios where like the
garbage collection is not kind of doing
what you would expect and it starts
eating up too much memory you can sort
of put hard limits and set it to restart
the other thing we learned is that to
have it crash on out of memory
exceptions instead of just like throwing
an exception in the code because pretty
much if the process runs out of memory
we'd rather just die in
the heart thing to just throw an
exception internally and that when you
do that to not have the heap dump go to
disk because sometimes it will fill the
entire disk and then things will not
restart these are just little things
we've learned from having them happen
I know Florentino memory usage is fairly
high and that's kind of a common thing
with Java it's just a thing that we know
and we deal with all right so some of
the stuff that we did not have fun with
where the memory leaks which were
generally race conditions this is not
particular to closure itself it's
actually our code that was bad that did
these things but it gets really hard to
track these down you know essentially we
would end up kind of remoting in and
hooking up J visual VM and then trying
to watch whatever native objects you
know that all this codes are stuff
translates to and figuring out what's
going on in where these memory leaks are
and that it ends up being kind of
difficult the other thing there are
sometimes obscure bugs which I'm
covering on the next slide dependency
conflict someone actually said it was
talking to earlier said oh oh did you
not come from Java this is like I think
we know about in Java and yeah I mean I
did job a long time ago but the
dependency conflicts are very insidious
even to where it'll work on one
developer's machine not another another
person's because of the sort of ordering
of what versions each person is using
and then the discontinued libraries so
I'm going to talk about an obscure bug
and if you hit this this flag will make
sense and if you have not hopefully this
will explain it this was a bug in court
a sink where if you used a try-catch
block inside of a core agent or I'll or
a sink go loop and it hit that exception
it would then generate an infinite loop
it would just keep putting the data back
in and reprocessing it and it was very
unableto
this is very rare but you can see how
long it was in the code for I mean
almost a year it's a sometimes when
those bugs exist
I don't know if it just wasn't I don't
know
what did hitting everyone else as bad as
it was hitting us but it was a very uh
novice bug - this is like Lundell swings
where you would think try-catch works
perfectly fine and in fact the
workaround is to like catch a like a run
I can remember Oh instead of an
exception you catch like a runtime error
or something like that some other thing
there was a workaround but you have to
realize that was your problem and not
something in your own code so when you
get used to where everything's so stable
then when bugs happen you look at your
own code and you stop looking at things
like the core closure library and you
know it's still sort of maturing in that
sense I actually found out yesterday
that Kevin downy fix this bug so thank
you for Kevin hi sorry much appreciated
I was it was a big deal all right and so
this is a team this is about our
staffing what we loved what we didn't we
found that people have Clojure
experience sort of means they're a self
learner which is something that is key
to who we hire it's not just closure
though it's a lot of like other
languages that wouldn't be mainstream
it's just one of those indicators to us
that there's someone who is self learned
the most a previous job made them learn
closure which some of our team will be
those people but they're also great and
they also we've also found that they're
amazingly productive on a fewer number
of people whether that's because of
close ourself or that they're these self
learner types you know we can do a lot
more on a much smaller dev team than
I've seen in a lot of places because of
that I think that closure and all the
JVM libraries etc kind of give you this
much bigger lever to work with so that
you can focus on just your problems and
get much more done and then it also
forces this much higher level of
conceptualization around you know sort
of functional programming things that
are I guess you're not so overwhelmed in
the intricate details because there's
only sequences and you know hashes or
maps which everyone want to call it and
so it allows you to sort of think more
generally more broadly around these
concepts I mean it's almost like a sort
of mathematical type thing where you're
trying to come up with equations that
would work at this sort of very high
level and that just allows you to come
was really nice
elegant solutions we learn teaching
closure can be hard which you know it's
just the things that we've learned don't
learn Emacs enclosure at the same time
that sort of path from people who didn't
know closure is it first they're like oh
that looks kind of cool you know they
watch the rich Hickey talks and they're
like that just all makes sense to me
then they absolutely hate it then
they're a little bit confused by it and
then they sort of love it so expect that
if you're bringing new people on your
team and we've also learned it's not for
everyone we've actually had software
consultants that ended up not charging
us they were just like yeah we're not
going to be able to do this after
putting substantial time and it just
didn't jive with how they they're sort
of mental models worked and so that's
also a thing to sort of be aware of and
what I guess I kind of hate is that it's
hard to find experienced people and
experienced people are expensive so
that's either bad news or good news for
you just depends you know which side of
the equation you're on you know but
that's just the thing that we have to
deal with until the community gets
larger all right so sort of a summary
for it is that it's been an overall win
though I mean we're not unhappy with our
choice I think that even our approach to
the problem space that we're solving was
definitely influenced by some of these
higher level closure concepts that you
are sort of forced to learn in order to
really grasp closure so it's been a
great experience for us and growing our
team will be tough both because people
hard to find and expensive so this is
some of the libraries that we're using
so I don't know people ever thanks to
these libraries I just kind of went
through got a bunch of these things out
of our source code so that I made sure
that we were thanking sort of the base
of things that were built on I mean the
the community is really amazing there
are lots of things in here that we use
in big ways small waves etc and we
couldn't build what we did if you guys
or these people didn't build what they
did so they they all rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
