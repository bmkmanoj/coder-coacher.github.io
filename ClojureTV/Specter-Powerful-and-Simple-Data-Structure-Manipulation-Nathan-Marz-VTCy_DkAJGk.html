Spectre and I've given a few talks on
Spectre and the approach I've taken
before is to just give like a grand tour
of all the features of Spectre and show
lots of examples of the kinds of things
you can do with it and show the
performance and all of that and I found
that actually people find it to be a
very intuitive abstraction and and
people don't have trouble grasping the
examples but something I've begun to
realize is it's hard for people to grasp
like the broader significance of Spectre
and how it can affect how you approach
everyday programming and and change how
you think about everyday programming I
mean it's kind of like when you first
learn recursion like I started
programming when I was 10 years old and
I don't think I learned recursion until
I got to college and it you know it
never got in my way I was I mean for me
programming back then was just a hobby
and I would make games and stuff like
that and I was always able to make the
things I wanted to make and then you
learn recursion that you see it the
first time and okay a functions calling
itself and then there's this like
lightbulb moment you need to have before
you are able to really understand that
and make it part of your lexicon for how
you approach programming and then like
now for me you know many years
afterwards it's just inconceivable to
think of programming without the
corrosion and so Spectre is kind of like
that where you need that light bulb
moment except the difference is is that
with recursion you know recursion is
something that you use once in a while
like I certainly don't use it in every
function I write and you know oftentimes
I'll go days or weeks without using
recursion
Spectre is about supercharging your
ability to use data structures and
structure your data and query and
manipulate it that's an everyday every
our programming tasks
so even shifting your perspective a
little bit on that and having more ways
to approach these problems has a huge
huge effect and that has certainly been
my experience with Spectre as I've built
it and also learned from it so where I
want to start off with is with
um what kind of a mundane Clojure
example because I think this really
illustrates a lot of that mental shift
that you need to have to really benefit
from something like Spectre and so the
example is you have a map so here's just
a map with keys to numbers and you want
to increment all the values in the map
so one good way to do this just writing
closure
straight up as you take your map and
then you do the map operation on it and
so that will that will map over every
key value pair in the map and then for
every key value pair you return a new
key value pair with the same key
but the incremented value but of course
the output of the map operation is going
to be a lazy sequence of these new key
value pairs so then you pipe it into
this call right here to create a new map
with the updated results okay so this
works and and then you might find
yourself doing variations on this many
times where you want to run some
function on every value of a map and of
course we're good programmers so we we
extract new functions when we're using
common functionality so then you write
something like this map Val's function
which is kind of like a normal map
except it will run on these nested
values in the hash map and this is just
the exact same code except now we
include the function parameter here so
you can see if when I run both of these
these both give the same results all
right I have it set up here so in my
examples it'll print the input and also
the output so you can see how things
change okay so you know I've been
programming closure very heavily for
more than five years
like done a lot of projects that have
started with it and in every project
I've ever done I have needed this map
Valis function in my project comes up
all the time it's common use case and
when I look at other people's code I
actually see people with the exact same
function in there
and I was actually actually was curious
so I went on github and I did a search
for defin map valise and I got 28 pages
of results I know this is only people
who happen to have named it exactly the
same way I happen to name it and for the
most part I mean people implement
different ways but sometimes the code is
like literally identical to what I wrote
so I thought that was kind of
interesting now the thing about the map
Val's function is it it is not a good
function I would actually say it's a
terrible function because it purports to
do something than that Val's function if
you actually look at what it's doing you
want to like the only thing you care
about when you use the map Valis
function is running that function on
individual values everything else the
map Valis function does is about
reconstructing the data structure
because it's an immutable transformation
so that it's the same as the original
data structure but only with those
values change it changed right so
examples of that are like making sure
you have the exact same key used here
doing this in to call so that we get a
map as the results so it's so really the
map Val's function is about that
reconstruction process and making sure
your chain is only affect what you
intended to change and the problem at
Val's is not composable it only works
for this specific use case where you
have a map as your top level data
structure and you want to change only
the values in that map now if you nest
the data structure more then you're back
back to square one back to where you
were with having this burden of having
to reconstruct what you didn't change so
let me show some examples of that let's
say you have a list of maps and you want
to increment all the values and those
nested Maps so do that in closure
directly you run the map function and
then you need a nested function which
calls map Val's on those nested Maps
right and you can see that that that
works yeah so this doesn't seem so bad
but let's look at a vector of map
so in this case the code is almost the
same except in order to make sure we get
a vector back and not a not a list back
you need to make sure to do the math we
call the burden is always on you when
you do this nested transformations to
make sure that you don't change anything
besides what you intended to change and
that requires a lot of care and
precision and like man in my five years
of programming closure without Spector
I've made had to debug so many bugs
cause because I made some little mistake
in something like this and it just gets
so much worse the more complicated your
data structures get so here we have a
map of vectors of mass and we want to
increment all the values in those nested
mass and like this code is basically
unreadable you know you have matte
vowels to anonymous function to matte v2
and Nonna's function to emit not Val's
again like there's no way to look at
that function and understand what it's
doing and that's a really big problem
when you're working on a big project and
you need to be able to go back and
understand what the hell you wrote
before okay that code does work though
hmm
so I kind of just lived with this I
think pretty much all of us kind of just
live with this burden and it's this
constant annoyance with programming
closure and you know I love this with
this for a long time and then I got to
what I've been working on for the past
few years and what I've been doing is
just like so hard and the product is so
like crazy large in scope that early on
like I realized that this just was not
gonna cut it anymore like when you work
on a really big project like you need to
be flexible I need to be able to change
and adapt and go back and understand the
code you wrote and like I do a lot of
stuff with like directed acyclic graphs
and I have stuff or have a directed
acyclic graph and then a node in my
graph has embedded within it another
directed acyclic graph and have this
recursive structure and the nodes are
like different record types and the
different record types have all sorts of
structures sometimes with nested records
and so if I want to
change one value deeply nested within
these graphs and I can't just do the
logic to change the value but need to
figure out how to reconstruct this
really complicated structure that's
crazy like it's just not doable so I
actually considered just because of this
problem using mutable data structures
now because with immutable data
structure you don't have to worry about
the unchanged parts cuz you only change
what you want right but fortunately like
you know had rich Hickey in my ear like
easy doesn't mean simple easy doesn't
mean simple and so that lasted like I
was like lasted for five minutes and
then I you know got my sanity back but
it shows you like how big of a problem
this is so basically I just said like I
just said like this is
and I probably drop like a couple
f-bombs too and and that's that's how
much house I saw Spectre was born out of
total necessity by the way I'm pretty
sure that like 99% of the like really
useful things made in the world started
off with someone saying this is
and there's there's probably like this
like linear graph you can make between
how useful the thing is and how many f
bombs were dropped when the thing was
created I can't even imagine like like
when rich Hickey was inspired to make
closure
he was puck he's probably working on
some like Java like debugging some issue
with mutability I bet you he dropped
like a thousand f-bombs written for you
ain't close alright anyways let's get
back to the specter okay so alright so
let's see let's go back to Matt Valles
and let's see how to do the equivalent
like functionality this idea of
transforming the values in a map using
the Spector approach okay so here this
code here will increment all the values
in the map just like we were doing
before in a way it works as we say
transform and then we give it what was
called a path which literally just says
how do we navigate to the values that we
want to manipulate so here we say
navigate first all so that navigates to
all the key value pairs and the map and
then we navigate to the last value in
the key value pairs which will be the
value all right so that gets us where we
want to be
then we say we want to run the ink
function on every value and then we give
it our input map and you can see when I
run this you know it works just like
before so there's like you know a big
difference here like we tell it how to
navigate to where we want to go and then
it handles all the work of
reconstructing the rest of the data
structure the parts that we didn't
change that's all internalized in that
navigation path now if you find yourself
doing this a lot you know just going on
the values of a map you can factor out
all last into something reusable so here
I say to find map valves as the
composition of all and last so comp path
is a spectral function and now if we
wanna do the exact same thing but with
our new higher-level navigator we just
say transform map valves and this does
the exact same thing as before so this
map valves object here is the rough
equivalent of the map bells function we
had before but unlike that function this
is a great abstraction because it's
composable and you can use this within
nested data structures just as easily as
you can use it on a top-level data
structure so let me show some examples
of that so let's say you want to
transform a list of maps like we had
before so here you would say transform
all so navigate to every map in the
sequence and then transform the map
valves and we do that on the list and
you can see list in list out with the
transformations okay so now let's do it
on a vector of maps and the code is
identical because all recognizes the
type that it's going over and makes sure
to maintain that type okay so vector in
vector out okay now let's say you have a
map of Maps so nested Maps so in this
case the navigation is navigate to map
valves and enter the values of those
nested Maps and so here we have these
doubly nested Maps and I run the
transformation you can see that all the
values got incremented
appropriately so now let's do that one
that was actually disgusting with manual
closure code which was a map of vector
of maps inspector super-easy transform
map vowels so that gets us to the
vectors then for every map in the
vectors doom at Val's again and no
problem easy ok so what's happening here
is actually really profound and what's
happened here is that we've
disassociated how we want to get to what
we want to manipulate from the effect we
want to have to what we want to
manipulate we've turned navigation into
its own independent abstraction
something that's not tied into the
particulars of a specific function like
how map Val's works and with this
enables is now that navigation is its
own abstraction that can be manipulated
and composed just like any other
abstraction and that's what enables this
what I think is pretty beautiful code
you probably heard the saying like I'm
sure everyone's heard the saying like
because this like part of the philosophy
of closure like better a hundred
functions operate on one data structure
than ten functions each on ten data
structures right I think we're all on
board with that so I would counter and
say much better than that is a handful
of navigators that compose to your
specific transformations much better
because navigators each new navigator
you add you have this like combinatorial
explosion of things you can do and
instead of just having functions that
only operate on that data structure if
you have it right there at that point
which means if you have to work on that
data structure nested you need some
anonymous functions to to do it with
navigators you can just it's easy if so
it doesn't matter where it is you just
navigate to it and you can do your work
ok so I want to show one more also
seemingly mundane example again just to
shift your perspective on how you think
about certain kinds of
tasks so in this example we'll work with
a map of sets and the operation we want
to do is just to add a value to one of
the nested sets so here's the closure
code for doing it so let's say we want
to add the value 1 to the set for the a
key so you'd say update data update the
a key and then for the nested set if
there's a value there then cange
the value into the set if there isn't
then just create a new set with the
value in it so you have to specially
handle the the nil case and so I run
this and yeah it works okay so let's see
you a variety of ways to do this with
Specter and so the first approach is to
just navigate to the set and then run a
transformation function on the set so
transform a and then here's our function
which takes in the set as input and this
actually is exactly the same as what we
did before so those there's no
improvement here by just navigating to
the set and then transforming it but you
can see we get the we get the same
results okay so let's let's let's let's
let's take a different approach and
let's try to take some of that logic in
this update function and express it as
navigation ok so here's one way to do it
so we'll say transform and we'll
navigate to the value for a and then
Specter has this nil to set navigation
actually this is built on top of some
something called nil to value which you
can parameterize with the value to
replace if it's nil but in this case
this is saying if we navigate to nil
instead navigate to the empty set
otherwise just a navigator where you
were
so it's reframing what to do when the
value is not in the map in terms of a
navigation and like we're not navigating
to like a nested data structure but this
can still be expressed in terms of
navigation navigation is not just about
literally nested like a list inside of a
map and now in our function this is
guaranteed to be
proper set so to do the operation you
just Cange the element into the set okay
but this I actually think is not the
best approach
okay look here's another approach so the
idea here okay so it might take a second
to wrap your head around this what we'll
do is we'll again navigate to the to the
value for a and now what we'll navigate
to okay so here okay so a set you take a
set a set of values and it's a set right
it doesn't seem like I mean this is
values there's no nested data structures
within it right it's like what do you
navigate to within it well I would say
actually a a set naturally contains tons
of nested data structures because a set
can be expressed as the union of any of
the subsets within it including the
empty set right so here what we do here
is we navigate to the empty subset of
the set we're looking at and now
whatever we do to that empty subset will
replace that empty subset within the
larger set and basically does Union
those values back into the original set
so we can express adding to a set as
replacing now being to the empty subset
within it and replacing it okay I hope
that that makes sense and so here what
we do is we navigate to the empty subset
and then our function doesn't care about
the input cause it's gonna be the empty
subset and we just return the set of one
to replace the empty subset with right
and you can actually make this a little
bit more concise this is a fairly common
pattern where the how you replace the
values you navigate to doesn't actually
depend on the value there where you're
just ignoring the argument so there's
this set Val function inspector which
just wraps transform so here we just say
set Val the empty subset at a to the set
of one on data okay and we get the same
thing that we've been getting now is
this like unequivocally better to what
we were doing before I think you can
debate it but my point here is that it's
a different way
of thinking about like something you've
done a million times before and I
personally think this is better that's
my opinion but it just enables you to
approach things at different ways and
increases your your toolbox okay so this
idea of navigating to a to a like the
inherent substructure within a data
structure so you can do that with sets I
think it's even more apparent with
sequences because there's so many ways
to define a sub structure of a sequence
so I just want to like go through a
bunch of examples here so here what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna
navigate to the sub sequence from
indices four through nine and replace
that sub sequence with the sequence
hello world so we're replacing a
sequence of length five with a sequence
of length two and here's what we operate
on and you can see when I run that okay
so that big chunk in the middle of the
sequence got replaced with this sub
sequence okay so here's an example same
thing but instead of just replacing it
we're gonna run a function in the sub
sequence to reverse it and so this
reverses all the values in the middle of
the sequence okay super easy right not
fun to do this manually I'm just like
I'm you know keep harping on this point
the why navigators are so awesome is
because they're composable so everything
I'm showing you composes with everything
else so here let's compose S range with
some other navigators so this right here
navigates to the sub sequence between
four and nine then looks at every value
in that sub sequence and then when you
use a function in a navigator just like
a regular closure function it acts as a
filter so it only stays navigated if
that function returns true so this has
the effect of multiplying by a hundred
every even number in that subsequence
okay and you can see that that works so
another way to look at navigating to the
sub structure of a sequence is to
navigate to a filtered view of that
sequence so what I do here is I say
transform filter even
so this actually navigates to a new
sequence which only contains the even
values of the original sequence and the
key thing is there is that you're
navigating to the sequence not to the
individual even elements so this is
going to reverse the positions of all
the even numbers within that larger
sequence okay and you can see all the
odd numbers stay in the same place all
the even numbers flip positions and so
this gets cool when you take advantage
of composability so here this next one
does reverses the positions of the even
numbers but only within the sub sequence
from indices 4 to 13 okay
and there there you have it right there
okay so so far I've only been showing
transformations because that's like the
hard really hard use case but this idea
of navigating works just as well for
querying so just a couple quick examples
of it this next example selects all the
even numbers for the a key out of a
sequence of maps so all a even so from
that sequence it extracts the values 2 &amp;amp;
4 okay and this next one here selects
all the even numbers in this sub
sequence from A to C is 4 through 9 so
similar path to what we use before but
now we're retrieving the results as a
sequence instead of manipulating them
okay so mm-hmm
okay so all right so now for my next
example I feel like I'm a magician like
for my next trick all right this next
example I want to show like once you
have navigation as its own abstraction
you can do some really interesting
things when you do higher-order things
on top of like pads as objects and so
this this will demonstrate that so here
we're gonna use this or do manipulations
of this world data structure where it
has two keys so people and Bank people
is just a list of maps which has the
name of the person and the amount
they have and then the bank has a
certain amount of funds and we're going
to do is write a function to transfer
money from a user to the bank okay so
here's how you do it enclosure manually
yeah all right so first you have to
actually retrieve the amount of funds
that that person has so you're going to
the people field do a scan and filter to
find that person grabbed the money field
if the amount of funds they have is less
than the transfer amount if they're an
exception if not then you can actually
do the update so you need to update both
the person and the bank then you do the
exact same thing you did before which is
navigate to the person but you know you
have to do the reconstruction logic as
you go and then once you get there like
deeply nested in here you finally
actually take away their money there's
lots of reconstruction logic happening
and then to actually take it from the
bank
well closure thankfully has one
operation for doing nested one function
for doing nested operations but it only
works on nested associative structures
so update in makes it far easier to
actually add that amount to the bank
okay so you have this like mess of a
function to do this alright so let's do
this with Specter and respect her I'm
not gonna do it directly maybe something
a little bit different and what I'm
gonna do is implement this function
called transfer transfer which is a far
more general function and then we'll use
transfer to do our specific operation
and cognitively this is way easier than
like this mess up here so this transfer
function takes in as input the world
data structure and it takes in as input
two paths a path to everyone to take
money from and then a path for everyone
to give money to and then it takes then
an amount so what this does is a fixed
many-to-many transfer between any sets
of entities the idea is if you have if
you select three people to give $50.00
to two people each of those two people
will receive $150 and each of the givers
will give $100 okay all right so the way
this works is first let's actually
figure out how much money the givers and
receivers
currently have so we just call Spectre
select from path world so that gives us
a sequence of their monetary amounts and
for the receivers select two paths world
so now we know how much each of the
receivers has and then we calculate the
total amount every receiver will receive
is the amount multiplied by the number
of givers and a similar thing for total
give alright so if every giver
has at least that amount of money then
we do our transformations so we
transform the front path which is the
givers and we subtract out total give
and then we transform the two paths and
give them total receive that's it
there's not really any nested stuff
happening like this is really easy to
read there's another really cool
property this function besides just how
generic it is and how elegant it is it's
also completely agnostic to what the
world data structure is it's not
specific to the example I showed it can
work on any anyway you structure the
world data structure because all the
details of where the money amounts are
stored are completely encapsulated in
the paths that you give as input so this
is like the super general you can use
this on anything this is just a generic
fixed may demand a transfer for anything
and now to do our specific operation
will first define a function which
returns a path to a specific user and so
to do that we navigate to the people
field and then we do express the scan
and filter via navigation so navigate to
every person and only keep the users
where the name is equal to the name
we're looking for and then user to bank
is this gonna be transfer on the world
and the path is navigate to the user and
then navigate to their money field and
then transfer to the bank's funds that's
it so now if we actually run this you
can see that here I transferred ten
dollars from John Smith to the bank and
you can see John Smith has ten less
dollars and the bank has ten more
dollars now what makes this powerful is
now we can use this transfer function
to do all sorts of operations like very
very easily so here's a function that
transfers one dollar from every person
and gives it to the bank it's a transfer
from everyone's money to the bank one
dollar we run that and you can see that
it works if you want to do the opposite
or have the bank give a dollar to
everyone then you just reverse the order
of the paths and so that works if you
want the bank to give $5,000 to the
first three members in the users list so
you transfer from the bank's funds and
then you select the subsequence of the
first three people and then you select
all of their money fields and you
transfer $5,000 and you can see that
that works perfectly okay now one really
important thing for Spector is that it's
data structure agnostic Specter at its
core it's like really simple it's just a
protocol which is the interface for how
to implement a navigator and then it
provides efficient means to compose
those together so that they can execute
quickly and then specular kind of has
like a batteries included set of
navigators built on top of those core
abstractions to do all the common things
that you want to do with like maps and
lists and vectors and sets and all the
common things but the important thing is
it's completely extensible and there's
nothing in the chorus method that's
specific to any of these data structures
and this is a really important because
you were gonna use your own data
structures like I mentioned I use a lot
do a lot of stuff with graphs so I have
a whole set of navigators that I made
for graphs you know if I have time I'll
show some of it towards the end it is
really important like if you want to
have this abstraction to supercharge
your ability to do the things you do
with data it needs to be able to work
with any data that you want to use now
the interface for a navigator it's
really simple really generic so you have
a separate
case four when are you in querying in a
separate case we're doing transforming
and the way these work is that the
implementation of selects select the
query case is parameterised
with how to do the rest of the selection
from the sub value from this point and
then the transform is likewise
parametrized with how to finish the
transform from whatever sub values are
at this point so I want to show a couple
implementations of this so the first is
key path so key path is a navigator
which is parametrized with a key to
navigate by so basically this can
navigate by any key and not just by key
words like I've been showing so the
implementation is for the Select case is
we navigate to the sub value which is
gonna be the value for the key inside
the data structure and then you call
next fun on that because next fun
completes the selection from the sub
values okay for the transform case well
we do something similar except in this
case next fun does the transformation
for the sub values and then this
function is responsible for
reconstructing that back into the
original data structure and in this case
is very simple you just Assoc value for
the same key into the data structure
okay so sub set which I showed before is
a little bit slightly more complicated
so here we need to navigate to the
subset and then complete the selection
or the transformation from that point so
navigating to the subset so you give it
some subset to subset to navigate to but
of course you can only navigate to the
values of the set actually has so the
navigation in this case for selection is
complete the selection from the
intersection of the parametrized set and
then the set that we're actually looking
at and for the transform case again we
navigate to that sub value which will be
the intersection then you transform that
sub value and then to have the effect of
replacing whatever the sub set was in
the original set you have to remove the
subset we navigated to and then add in
the transformed subset that the user did
it might not be like the easiest thing
to grasp this but like I recommend just
like studying it and thinking about it
okay all right so all right so Spectre
is extensible so you can use it for any
data you have for any of your navigation
needs now another really important thing
you need from Spectre is it needs to be
really fast because like when you
manipulate data and do stuff with data
structures like you do that also in
performance sensitive code and for
Spectre to be a useful abstraction it
needs to be usable everywhere because
you don't want to have to say oh like oh
I can use this awesome abstraction like
under these conditions where I don't
need performance and then for all the
stuff which is in like performance
sensitive code you have this giant mess
of nested functions and all that so
that's been like a really core focus of
the project and I just want to
demonstrate some of us a little bit of
that so what the little micro benchmarks
I'm gonna do are all gonna operate on
this data structure so it's just a
nested map and the reason I'm showing
you this this particular use case is
because this is like the hardest case
for Spectre to make fast because the
actual navigation part is super fast
you're just like getting the values in a
map and associating the values in a map
there's like nothing to it and so what
you've seen the numbers will be the
overhead the specter adds to actually do
in the navigation and this will really
emphasize that okay
all right I'm also going to compare
Spector against different ways of doing
it in closure so the first one I'll do
is using closures get in operation which
is one of the few operations closure
actually has for doing stuff with nested
data structures and I'm gonna run this
function here a million million times
and see how long it takes okay so you
can see it takes about 80 milliseconds
so now I'm going to do it with Specter
so in Specter case it's select the path
ABC from the data okay so it took four
and a half seconds so it's 600 times
slower than the regular cloture code
obviously that's not the end of the
story
now the way Spectre works is when it
composes your path together it actually
does like just like really intense
optimization which clearly it takes a
while to do and so that's why it takes
for now that's how long it takes to just
compose that together a million times
and the way specters perform it is that
whenever you needed to be fast like
really fast you can precompile the path
and then just use the compiled path so
up here I define compiled path as the
composition of the navigators a B and C
and now if I do the benchmark with the
compiled path instead of the just the
path like it is up there okay so you can
see it takes about 60 milliseconds which
is faster it significantly faster than
get in now Specter has a function called
compiled select and compiled transform
which if you know you're gonna receive a
compiled path you can use that and that
strips awaits some of the additional
overhead and now it takes you know 50
milliseconds so like a lot faster than
get in and this is a point of reference
let's actually just do this with like
completely inline code where we just
take the data and go to a go to B go to
C and then at the end here I wrap in a
vector because select returns a sequence
and I want to do a fair comparison and
so you see this takes like a little
under 40 milliseconds so spectres like
you know it's in the ballpark of totally
inline code and it's faster than what
closure already has all right story
that's a lot better for updates so here
let's increment the nested value and
here we'll use closures update in
function okay so this takes a little
over a second okay so let's do it with
transform without precompilation then
you're gonna see this will take about
about over four seconds so again it's
about the same amount of time because
all the work is in compiling the paths
but now if we use the compiled path now
it takes about a 180 milliseconds so
five to six times faster than update in
and if we used compiled transform it's
even faster so like just like
dramatically faster than updated and
just as a point of comparison here I
have this manual transform function
which just does the transformation via
series nested updates so that would be
like the in-line way of doing it and
that takes 150 milliseconds so Specter
is really really fast all right let me
show one more example try to get through
it quickly so this is actually a
relatively new feature of Specter which
is recursive navigation and so basically
this is like a real use case that I had
to build for what I've been working on
basically I have like I was saying this
these DAGs and some nodes can have DAGs
within them and the operation to do is I
need to take nodes of a certain type I
call them marker nodes and remove them
from the graph and take the children of
those nodes and attach it to what the
parent of those nodes were so the
transformation looks like this it's a
recursive transformation so let me show
you what the code looks like this
Specter okay so first we're going to
find a path that navigates to all the
reachable graphs and sub graphs and so
we do is we first declare that we're
gonna make a path called reachable graph
and we declare it separately from the
implementation because it needs to refer
to itself for the recursion as always
say it's continue then stay so navigate
to this path that we provide and then
after navigate in there navigate to
yourself so this is basically postorder
traversal and so this is gonna say how
do we get to the sub graphs from this
graph so first we navigate over all the
nodes in topological order and the way
this works is it navigates to these
pairs of the graph and then the ID for
that node and we just navigate to them
all in order and then node will actually
navigate to the value for that node at
that point if it's an instance of a sub
graph nodes or something that contains a
sub graph then we navigate to the nested
graph field and then call reachable
graph on that
so this reachable graph navigates to
every graph reachable from that starting
graph
then to do that squashing operation that
I showed you say transform so first
navigate to every reachable graph and
then we do that top sort again if the
node is an instance of the marker node
then we have a function that takes in
the pair of graph and node ID and then
they have this squash operation which
actually does removing the node and
reattaching the edges why do that kind
of fast but I just kind of want to
demonstrate like something really
sophisticated that you can do is Specter
and honestly this this is like doesn't
come close to somebody else I'm doing
but recursive navigation and all sorts
of cool stuff you can do with it so this
is where you get to when you kind of
level up in your Specter ability I think
I'm out of time but if you want to see
like more like interesting like graphic
examples or service gate stuff like feel
free to stop me and hope you guys make
good use of Specter thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
