work a cognate x and i'm here to talk to
you today about day tomic so i'm going
to be going over some basics for those
of you who have no experience with the
atomic just enough context to provide
context for some of the things I'll talk
about later so I'm going to talk about
the information model a very high level
talk about the architecture again very
high level and then I'm going to get
into the query and entity and pull api's
and well you'll see why so the
information model de Tomic's information
model is very simple it has very small
building blocks we have a fact I'm going
to explain what all these things are for
those of you who haven't seen it before
an attribute and entity and then the
idea of an immutable database and so a
fact is a combination of entity ID
attribute and a value for that attribute
and then the transaction when that fact
was asserted into the database so we
have this idea of effects being asserted
or retracted and what that allows us to
do is if the value changes in time we
can change it in the database without
actually deleting that data we just add
a new fact and we retract the old fact
but that old fact still lives in the
database and its associated with the
transaction ID when it was asserted so
we can go back in time and find the old
values I'm not going to be talking much
about the time model but that's a very
important aspect of day Tomic so the way
these are stored in the database is in
something called a datum and the datum
has the entity ID it has the ID of the
attribute and then the value and then
the transaction so here in this first
example the entity ID is this really
long number with 774 at the end and the
attribute is artist name this all these
examples by the way are from
the musicbrainz database which is a
database of information about music that
was recorded we have a small example
subset of that that we use for day Tomic
examples a lot from nineteen sixty eight
to nineteen seventy three so all of
these examples are going to be musicians
that maybe you've never heard of but
that's not that important to understand
the concepts so an entity an entity is a
collection of facts that have the same
entity ID now if you look at this
collection of fact you can see that all
of the attributes except for the first
one they're all named spaced keywords
with artist at the beginning now this is
purely for readability there is no
programmatic binding between these
things there's no table with columns
that says there's a name column and a
type column and a gender column and we
just assemble them together in an entity
and you can have other entities that
represent artists that have a different
set of attributes and that's perfectly
fine and you'll still be able to query
for things for example this a this
entity Wes Montgomery is a person and so
this person has a gender attribute you
can also have a group and the gender
attribute may or may not make sense in
that context so you don't have to have
all of the attributes for the entity to
be complete also if you had different
kinds of people in the data model
instead of artist name it might be
person name and that would fit perfectly
fine within this entity here's another
view of the same entity this one looks a
little more familiar its Eden a regular
Eden map closure map and so another
important building block is the fact
that attributes themselves are entities
and they're represented in the database
in the same way as any other entity is
this is the artist name attribute it's
got a value type of string there are
obviously different value types that we
can have it has cardinality of one
we can have cardinality one or many and
if we have cardinality many and we have
a many-to-many situation we don't have
to do the kind of thing we have to do in
a relational database where you have
like a joint able we just declare that
it's cardinality many and daytime it
will take care of that relationship for
us here's a fun attribute this is the DV
ident attribute and that's actually what
it looks like in the database and you
can see that the DB ident attribute of
the DVI attribute is DB ident so this
whole idea goes way down to the bottom
it's Turtles all the way down so and
then the thing I didn't really talk
about it is just the idea of a database
so when you're querying your query
against a database and a database and
atomic is an immutable view of the data
at a particular point in time so if you
ask for a database right now it's going
to give you the latest view of that data
and as novelty comes into the database
your database that you have in hand
right now is not going to change at all
so you can query you can run long
analytics processes on it and you don't
have to try to coordinate with the data
that's flowing in at the same time all
right so very high level again the
architecture de Tomic's architecture is
a little different from traditional
architectures what we're accustomed to
seeing is that all of the activities
that are managed by a database
transaction and indexing query stored
procedures those things all happen in
one process and over time as database is
growing larger we've come up with ways
to have redundant processes and kind of
split the responsibilities across and
then we end up with concepts like
eventual consistency and whatnot de
Tomic breaks this mold by splitting
those activities into separate processes
so we've got one process that manages
transaction putting data into the
database indexing storage is not part of
day Tomic the transactor puts data into
any of various storage systems that you
will
you may want to use and then query
happens in your applications process and
we're able to do that day tommix able to
do that because it maintains a local
cache of the data so as you as you query
when you have a cold cash there's going
to be a request that goes out to storage
to pull back data segments and data
segments or big collections of datums
and once there there there there in
memory and then you can continue to
query against those same datums and you
never have to go back to storage for
those and so if you live in a world
where where your application your
database is actually small enough to fit
in memory the cash heats up gets the
whole database in there and you actually
there's zero network communication after
that in cases which are common as well
where the whole database won't fit in
memory day Tomic has a least recently
used algorithm for invalidating the cash
and bringing in new data but the the
overriding point here is that when you
do queries you're doing queries
experientially like as a developer as
you're writing and and what actually
happens a large portion of the time is
that your query against data that's
already in memory you don't have to go
across the network to get it and that
changes the kinds of things that we can
do so moving on to query the atomic uses
data log as its query language and data
log is a data oriented query language
we're not dealing with strings like we
do with sequel so that gives us a lot of
advantages first of all this is just a
normal closure data structure it's got
symbols it's got keywords it's got
vectors and if we want to compose these
things we don't need to do string
concatenation to compose these things so
and it's very evident what it is we're
trying to do here I'll look I'll explain
this for those of you haven't seen it
this is a very simple example we're
saying we want to find out anything any
symbol with a question mark at the
beginning
variable so we want to find all of the
values for the variable e that fit into
this pattern and the pattern is the
vector at the bottom of e artist country
and artist Spain so we're saying let's
find all of the Spanish artists that are
in the database here and just get their
entity ideas and so remember for before
when I showed you the facts they go in
the order entity attribute value and
then transaction and then whether they
were added or retracted so in this case
we've only got three of those parts
we've got the entity d ATRA attribute in
the value the attribute and value our
values that we've put there with
constants we know what they are so the
only thing we're trying to solve for is
what is the what are the potential
values of e you could put variables in
any of those positions in this example
that we're just looking for the values
of e and so the query engine is going to
look through the through the datums it's
going to find datums that have artist
country and country spain and the
attribute and value positions it's going
to grab their entity IDs and that's what
it's going to return to you and you
could see the way these are returned
it's a collection of tuples one tuples
in this case because we only asked for
one variable to be filled in so in a
case where you're just looking for one
you might not want to have to unpack the
tuples and so you can ask for just a
collection of these values so what we're
saying here with the with the vector of
e and ellipses is find me a collection
of values return me the collection of
values that of e that fit into this
pattern so now we just got a nice list
of those so asking about one data
pattern is nice but we probably want to
refine the query a little bit more so
here's an example where we could say
specifically we want the Spanish groups
that are
the Spanish artists that are groups and
so what happens here is the query engine
processes the first data pattern first
right so first it's going to look for
all the values of e that fit into the
pattern with artist country and country
spain and then it's going to narrow that
down further to all the values of e that
also fit into the pattern of variable e
artist type and artist type group this
is an important thing the order matters
so what you want is for each of your
data patterns to be you want the most
restrictive ones at the top because
that's going to get processed first and
so in this particular dataset there are
58 Spanish artists but there are over
2,000 groups and so it makes much more
sense to narrow the space of possible
values down to 58 first and then work
within those for the second part of the
query then the other way around so so
far we've only talked about looking at
different attributes of the same entity
this is how you express a join in in
data log we're going to join against
different entities across different
entities so we're binding values to the
e variable in the first expression that
that satisfy that narrowing those those
values down further in the second
expression and then on the third line
you could see that the variable is in
the third position in the value position
and that's how we do a join we don't
have to have any special syntax for this
because all we're doing is we're filling
in those values with the combination
filling in the variables rather with the
combination of values that satisfy all
of the data patterns in the query so
this would give us all the groups from
Spain with releases in 1970 we can bind
the releases two different variables in
order to have in order to be able to say
something like give me all the groups
with releases in 1970 and 71 and you can
see we've got r1 and r2 and you can see
how those get narrowed down
to 1970 in 1971 and as we as we
constrained note the the possible very
values for those variables we're also
constraining the possible values for e
at the same time even though we're only
asking for the ease in this case all
right a recent addition is an explicit
or so for those of you who've worked
with a time for a while you know that
you can do you can do an implicit or
using rules I'm not going to be talking
about rules today but just briefly rules
our ways of composing data patterns into
a named rule that you can then plug into
a query so that you can reuse them and
they also provide the benefit of an
implicit or well now we have an explicit
or so here we can say it's you know I
want the releases in nineteen seventy or
1971 there are other ways to express the
same thing but we now have this at our
disposal there's also or join which lets
us do something a little more
complicated so Paco de Lucia who is a
guitar player who's well known outside
of Spain or at least they used to be I
don't know how well-known he is today
but he he played on some records where
he just played on a track but he wasn't
listed as the as the artist on the
record potentially and he also played on
some records where he's listed as the
artist on the record and so this query
allows us to find any any any release
that has pocket Lucia listed as the as
an artist on the release or as an artist
on any of the tracks and we use or join
for that because we want to scope the we
want to join explicitly on the are
variable and the a variable and we don't
want to care outside of the join
expression about the M&amp;amp;T variables we've
got now negation so this is new it came
in in January so it used to be that if
you wanted to find
the Spanish artists that aren't in
groups you'd have to get all of the
Spanish artists and then you'd have to
filter out the ones that that were of
different types and now we have an
explicit not expression so that you can
do this very declaratively and similar
to the or join we've also got not join
which lets us have effectively a
sub-query that says we want to exclude
all of the the values for for let's see
we're joining on e right the values for
e where we didn't have releases in both
1970 and 1971 but we had one or one of
the other so there's a lot of more
features that I'm not going to cover you
I mentioned composable rules you can
also have expression clauses predicates
so you could say you can actually use
what looks like a closure function and
say give me all the the values of the
year that are less than a certain year
this sort of thing we have aggregates so
you can get counts of different
variables and mats etc but what I want
to move on to now is entity all of the
examples that I showed you we were just
pulling the entity ideas now you can
also pull other variables and I'll show
you some of examples of that as we go on
but for right now I'm just going to move
on to entity so entity is a function it
takes a database and remember a database
means an immutable snapshot an immutable
view of the data at a particular point
in time and you give it an entity
identifier and an entity ID can be any
of the numeric IDs that we've been
looking at there's a concept of a lookup
ref and a lookup ref is a vector of an
attribute and a value and that attribute
has to be declared unique when you when
you create that attribute when you
assert it into the database as an entity
and then you can use that unique value
to look up an entity as well also the DB
idents which
are also unique without throughout the
system so you can use any of those three
and when you when you call this function
you get back something that looks like a
map and in this case it's presenting
itself as just it's got the one key DB
ID and and the value that we passed in
now what that actually is it's not a
regular closure map it's a day Tomic
anthony mac and so an entity map is
associative like a map you can ask it
about its keys it's lazy so it doesn't
have all its information right away but
as you ask for information it loads it
and this is where day tommix
architecture having all the data here in
memory support something like this where
we can ask for the entity ID and then we
can go back and ask for more information
and there's a really really good chance
that when we got the entity ID and the
data segments that we pulled back have
that entity identity in it they also
have all of the other attributes of that
same entity so we're not having to go
over the network the way we would if we
were using a client-server model with
any other kind of database the other
thing about entity maps is that their
navigational and I'll explain what I
mean by that in a minute so they're
associative so you can you can say give
me the artist name and it loads that up
and an interesting thing about this well
I skipped ahead there first thing so you
can ask it for all of its keys the way
you would a map so now if we were to def
that entity to a bar named Booker T and
then we looked at the value of that far
we'd see it's just got DB ID that's all
that it's got loaded right now now if
we're then ask it for the artist name
we'd get that value back from that
function but also if we look back at the
entity it now has artist name loaded
into it so it loads these things in and
they're available they're avail you can
ask for them any time but they're
actually not loaded into the object
until you ask for them there's a touch
function which says get me all of the
attributes
and their values all in one go this is
something you may or may not want to do
because if you do it with a an entity
that sits at the top of a deep graph
you're going to be pulling back a lot of
data all at once that you may or may not
care about so one of the things you can
do with attributes as you can say you
can declare that this attribute is a
component of its entity so for example
here is a release samba de madrugada and
this release has various media it was
released possibly on tape on vinyl this
is all before the days of digital so and
then each medium has tracks and so you
can see that when we touch the entity
and ask for all of its information it
automatically pulls back anything that's
a component of it so the the release
contains all its media each medium
contains all its tracks that all comes
back at once in terms of navigation
remember we don't have a closure map in
hand we have this entity map and so we
can we can def it to a bar in this
example and ask for its name we can also
ask it for other entities that are
associated with it so in this case we're
asking for all of its releases and when
we get those back you can see that the
releases are similar representations to
what we saw before it's it looks like a
map with a dvi-d in it but if you were
to map over that with the artist name
key key word we'd get back the artist
names for all of those so we're
navigating from one entity to the other
entity in that way and we don't have to
pull all of that data back at once so
let's say that we def the first of those
artists two of our Pauline and W all
and so he's got a DB ID and the artist
name shows up because in the previous
example I asked for its artist name and
so it loaded up into that entity and
that's why we see it here when we when
we do this def then we can we can
navigate and notice now the underscore
and release underscore artists so we're
actually doing is we're navigating from
the artist to all the releases that that
have that artist as an attribute for
release artists and so you could see
that that returns us a bunch of releases
maybe you can't see that well you can
because then we go through it iterate
through their names and map over their
names and we have all the names of the
different releases so you can navigate
in either direction and this is actually
a really interesting thing about de
Tomic's design because to do that sort
of bi-directional navigation you have to
do some tricky things in other databases
so the entity API it's associative it's
lazy bi-directionally navigational and
the fact that the data here the data is
in memory means that it's okay to get
the entity IDs go get an entity and
start asking questions about it and you
don't have anywhere near the chatter and
maybe no chatter at all that you do in a
traditional client-server model okay so
the next thing I want to talk about is
the pull API poll was introduced late
last year and poll has some similarities
with with entity we can use it given an
entity ID and a data pattern in a
database we can get information about
that entity the entity ID just like the
entity function the entity ID you can be
numeric or look up ref for the ident so
if we were to use the wild-card
specification which is just a star we're
going to get back all of the values
associated with that entity but this is
different from
the entity object i realized i'm using
the word entity in two different ways so
there's the conceptual entity which is
the collection of facts with the same
entity ID and there's the entity map
that we got from the entity function
that's fun so the thing is that this
entity is just a plain old closure map
and so for example the artist type which
is which whose value is a map of ddb ID
and then a number we can't take that and
then navigate using it we can't ask it
for any of the other attributes of the
of the artist type it's just a map and
we can use that ID to go back and ask
for that entity if we want it but that's
a fundamental difference between this
and and the entity as with entity if we
were to use the wild card it would pull
back all of the data for the entire
graph if it has any component entities
so here again we've got a release which
owns media and each medium owns tracks
and we get all of that data again though
we're still getting these maps of dvi-d
to a numeric value that aren't going to
help us right now very much so I'll talk
about that more in a minute well I'll
talk about it now so what we can do is
we can specify the attributes that we
want and we can do this at any level so
at the top level we can say you know all
I want is the artist name and so here
the vector of artists name that is our
data pattern that's our poll pattern and
we're saying this is the structure that
I'm looking for and that gives us back a
map with the key artist name and the
value associated with it we can all we
can ask for more than one thing we can
say give me the artist name in the
artist country so in this case we've got
a map of artist name pointing to the
value and we've got artist country
pointing to this map and again the map
dvi-d with it with a value isn't that
helpful so what we can do is we can
specify how we want artist country to be
returned and we
that with a map specification so here in
the second example we've replaced the
key word artist country with a map
that's got a key artist country and then
that key points to the specification for
how we want to render artist country and
we say we want the country name in that
case and in this example you can start
to see the beauty of this API because
the the specification artist name and
then the map of artists country pointing
the country name the results look
exactly like that so if you're looking
at some code and trying to understand
what it's going to get back to you this
is exactly what you're going to get
which is very different from when you're
pulling back values using query and then
hobbling them together into some data
structure that that you're looking for
you can combine wild cards and these
maps specifications so in this example
we're saying I want all of the
attributes but I want to I want to
specifically for artist type artist
gender and artist country here are the
specifications for how I want those
rendered so this gives us something a
little more useful for the artist type
we're getting back to DB ident for the
artist country we have we happen in the
data model we happen to have string
names country names so we're pulling
those back because that's even more
readable and then these can nest
arbitrarily so in the case of a release
which has media each of each of which
has tracks we can use this specification
to say okay I want the names of the
media I want the names of the tracks and
I don't want any other information and
then like entity you can navigate in
Reverse so by putting an underscore in
front of the
the second half of the attribute name we
can say we can find the other attribute
the other entities that own this one or
that have this one as an attribute so
here we're saying give me all of the
tracks that have at least aegina listed
as an artist on that track but the
structure that we presented in is at
least aegina pointing to all of the
tracks that she was on so pull has a
bunch of other features that I'm not
going to have time to go into today but
you can do limit expressions so
sometimes you have an attribute that's
cardinality many that has more than you
want right now and so you can there's a
way to say I only want five ten whatever
of those default expressions so you can
say well if it doesn't have this
attribute give me back this default
value so I can put that it you'll put it
in the map for me so the map that I'm
getting back has all the data in it that
I want you can have like if you have
friends of friends of friends kind of
scenario you can stop the recursion of
that at a certain point so that you
don't gobble up the entire graph in one
go and there's more that I won't go into
right now but what I want to move on to
is combining pole and query so so far
what I showed before was you know you
could query for just the entity IDs and
then you could use the entity API or the
pole API to then flush them out well it
turns out that you could do the same
thing in one function call and so this
is not an example of that this is just
to set that up so before if we wanted to
get all the names of the artists that
are groups from Spain we would do
something like this and notice the third
pattern in this query it's only there to
give us back values of the variable n
it's not really the entities that we're
searching for are these groups right so
if you can think of the of the where
clause as search what I'm searching for
a nice way than to express the details
is using the pole using a pull
expression right in query which is
supported so here the query is much more
definitive about the kinds of entities
that I'm looking for and separate in the
pole is the specific information that I
want and so what's really nice about
that is that you can compose these
things so you can have a bunch of
different queries that narrow down the
space of entities that you're interested
in separate from the way you want to
render the data in those queries so you
can have different contexts where you'd
need different data and it makes the
whole thing much more composable and
similar to what we were seeing before
the pull the pull expression is a very
strong indicator of the data what the
data is going to look back look like
that you get back and just for
comparison here we're pulling back the
artist name and then the release names
of all the releases that each artist was
in to do that to get this data structure
if we were just using query we would do
something like this i'm not going to go
into the detail about it but you can see
that it's not-it's nowhere near as
obvious what's going on here because
there's a bunch of post-processing that
we have to do to the query results and
similarly if we were to start navigating
through through the entity API we can
have a smaller query here but still it's
a lot less obvious the data that we're
actually going to get back and compare
both of those to this example we're
looking at the pole expression it's
completely evident completely clear so
in summary data here data here in the
same process enables us to separate
query from either entity or the pole
api's and so you know you can certainly
do that what I showed you you can
certainly get everything that you want
in query but separating these things out
do coupling them is a very nice way to
organize your programs so you can use
query just to get the entities you can
use entity to get lazy navigational
access to the detail or you can use pull
for context specific eager access to the
detail and then you can also use poll
right inside your query which is
something you can't do with the entity
API and it gives you all the
expressiveness and power of all of those
things combined in a single API call and
that is all I've got so I don't know how
I'm doing on time it looks like i have
10 minutes so I've got some we don't
have it we've got lunch coming up so we
