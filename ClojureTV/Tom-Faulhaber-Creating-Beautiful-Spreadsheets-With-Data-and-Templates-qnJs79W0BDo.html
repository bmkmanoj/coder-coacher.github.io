library wrote that as the title promises
lets you create beautiful spreadsheets
with pure data which is I think of
something a lot of us want to do before
I start I want to ask everybody how many
people here have had to create data for
people who want to consume it in Excel
or another spreadsheet for that's what I
figured Oh a lot of you ok so just shout
out how have you created that data
I heard C I heard comma separated values
is there any other answer XML
okay directly boy okay cool cool cool so
we'll talk about all of those except
direct creation for creation for XML
which is such an ill-conceived thing to
do it's exactly it's exactly what I did
or part of what I did okay so let me
start by describing everyone's first
reaction when they find out that they
have to generate excel why do I have to
do this who's making me do this why
can't I do something more modern than
Excel and I want to start by resetting
that expectation a little bit right so
here we are we're in the girding theater
we're with all our colleagues and
friends we're communicating very easily
and clearly we speak English to each
other it's easy we talk about the same
subjects we know about the same subjects
we're making deep connections this is
great but let's do a thought experiment
for a sec say we got on an airplane and
went across to Madrid Spain that would
be cool we end up in a cafe in Madrid
Spain and now we can speak to Spanish
people and learn and make connections in
Spain except that we're still speaking
English now we'll be able to speak
English successfully to some people in
Madrid because there are lots of English
speakers there but our connections will
never be as deep as if we switch into
Spanish and learn Spanish so the lesson
there is well there's the old phrase
when in the when in Rome do as the
Romans hear when in Madrid
the mantra Janos is that we should talk
to people in the language that works if
we want to make deep connections right
this may seem like an aside from excel
give me a sec so in our corporate life
in our programming life we often live in
environments where we have to give
quantitative information to people I saw
a lot of hands go up when I talked about
who had to give people Excel and when in
business land we want to talk the
language of the business people our goal
is to communicate with them and create a
connection around the data that we have
and we know that the language they speak
is Excel so what I want to propose is
that if we're going to have to give them
Excel we want to do it as well as we can
the best communication comes when we
deeply embrace a language right and
Excel here is the language that we're
talking about ok so hopefully I've given
you some motivation there let's talk
about what it would mean to embrace
Excel and what makes Excel awesome
so there are a set of things that we can
think about when we think about Excel
and I'm not going to be exhaustive but
there's certainly formatting right Excel
gives us all sorts of formatting it
gives us all the sort of usual bolding
and fonts it gives us number format it
gives us conditional formats that allow
us to create 4matic based on value we
have this idea of transparency on
transparency is really important to me
what I mean by transparency here is when
data in an Excel spreadsheet is derived
from other data we have quantitative
data that's derived from other data we
can actually see that in an Excel
spreadsheet because we can directly
inspect the formulas and the
dependencies that data has this turns
out to be really powerful in real
corporate settings where you're trying
to communicate with people around data
because all parties to the communication
can look at the way the data has been
derived you still have original data but
I can't tell you how much confusion we
were using this at Staples we were able
to get around a lot of confusion and
communication when we could use
formulas and share them in spreadsheets
that we were working on sorting and
filtering are sort of obvious one of the
real things about sorting and filtering
that you might not think about if you
don't use Excel is Excel is often used
to push around fairly large chunks of
data at Staples again we pushed around
weekly product lists there were twenty
to thirty thousand products long in
Excel and that was how we would
communicate and that turned out to be
effective because we could use sorting
and filtering to look at the things that
the listener cared about the reader
cared about aggregation of course is
related to that we can reduce data by
aggregating it and see here I'm joking
baseball data which is not that
important but here I'm and so we can see
hits by team and then of course what we
all know about Excel is we can do
charting okay so charting is pretty cool
because then we can we can let see all
the charts so as we look at all of these
things we see that we have a lot of
tools in Excel that give us the ability
to create very rich reports and we can
embrace these tools and create these
rich reports but we still haven't gotten
to what's really powerful about using
Excel as a communication mechanism and
what that is is that Excel document
spreadsheets are living documents when
someone gets one they can operate on the
data directly they can operate on the
document directly they can bring data
from other sources they can do all sorts
of things like that and so they've
received something much more powerful
than looking at a table on a webpage for
instance right now there are other tools
that you can do this with but Excel is
super powerful at doing this okay so now
we have some data that looks like this
this is a sequence of maps of something
right and we want something that looks
like that an Excel spreadsheet with all
sorts of formatting and charts and
everything else how do I do this people
have mentioned a bunch of these things
I'm gonna run through them real quick
and not talk about any of them into much
detail until we get to the one I wrote
of course but I'm going to try and show
you why the one I
what motivated me to do it yet a
different way so how do I make a
spreadsheet first method is comma
separated values comma separated values
give us a couple of things right they're
super easy to do they can be read by all
sorts of systems besides Excel but
they're not beautiful and so we don't
like that so much
I know a lot of people did it and and
that's that turns out to be problem we
will talk about that much the second
method is Visual Basic for applications
this is awesome because it's
self-service right people can create
their own VBA applications lots of
analysts know VBA they can do anything
you want to do in Excel but it's kind of
a disaster from a control point of view
you get business logic built into
spreadsheets they wander around
organizations no one knows what the
organization is actually doing and
there's a whole bunch written about this
that I'm not gonna go into here but we
can talk about later if people are
interested in someone mentioned poi
employee is a great Apache library for
talking to Excel from Java you can do
almost anything you can do in roxelle
through poi and so we we we can keep all
the logic that we've created in the same
types of systems that we keep our
regular programs in we can keep it in
get we can inspect it for all sorts of
compliance reasons we can run unit tests
against it everything else
so using poi is great but if we're going
to use the JVM we'd rather use closure I
think and so when we use when we use
closure we get something much nicer
there are two libraries that do this
they're called dock sure and clj excel
and they're nice but oh one and they can
yeah and you can use POI in them right
directly so it's actually they can do
everything poke and ooh but they're
still pretty complex right I'm still you
saw all this excel stuff I did before
and that was all point-and-click it was
easy to do you could do it super fast
but here now I'm wearing code to do all
of it but I want to call them to be a
certain width I have to like type in in
my program the amount of width of that
column so let's take a different
approach and let's mix the best of
closure in Excel and I'm going to switch
and we're gonna actually write code now
because it's more fun so okay so the
example I'm going to use today is I'm
going to talk about a mythical stock
portfolio that I have and let me show
you what that stock portfolio looks like
so here's my portfolio the way I choose
my stocks is I choose only companies to
do at least some closure because I'm
pretty convinced they're going to help
perform in the market and so so so
here's the list of companies I pick now
what I'm first going to do is I'm going
to get a list of holdings with their
history and I'm not going to talk much
about how this works I've got a function
to do this but I'm reaching out to Yahoo
Finance and getting the portfolio
history for each of the stocks on my
portfolio so let's do that and let's see
what that looks like
oops
it looks like the Internet's not working
up here hang on a sec it's okay we got
save data if that doesn't work let's
let's see if close your West will come
back to us I see it tried to save switch
networks okay we'll try that again that
looks like it's working better it's
works a lot faster when I'm not at a
conference there we go so this is all
the history just pulled back from Yahoo
right now and unfortunately Yahoo
doesn't have today's data I was hoping
we get today's data by the time we had
this but you see here we have a data
structure to sequence and each for each
stock we have a map
we've got Apple and name number shares
this was all from the portfolio data and
then the history going back from
yesterday to the beginning of the year
so we've got a lot of information about
all these shares of stock and now I want
to present that in a spreadsheet so how
would I do that well the way I'm going
to suggest we want to start doing that
is to do it directly in Excel so let's
go talk to except let's go talk to Excel
and we'll open a template file I've got
a template file waiting for us okay and
this is this is our template and it's
pretty simple we have a let's see if I
can reduce this a little bit actually I
think that's good so let's so we have a
title and then we've got two days there
the strain yesterday in this case
because we don't have today's data and
for each stock we got the name of the
the ticker of the stock and the number
of shares we own some facts about the
stock that came from that history for
the previous day and then we've got a
formula right here right this is our
holdings which is just the clothes times
the number of shares we have we have the
sum of the holdings which is also a
formula it's the sum of all those rows
now note that Microsoft is not one of
these closure using companies at least
not as far as I know but I just put it's
just a template right it just goes in
there's a sub row and then we go across
here and we have the same four
yesterday and then the same source of
formulas and then we have some change
formulas out here that show the change
in share price which is just yesterday's
price - the day befores price and the
change in total value which is similar
and the percentage okay and in summers
of that so what we want to do is we want
to put the data into this template and
we want to render it as a spreadsheet so
let's come on over here and we've got to
reach a potato so it fits the template
and I've got a function to do that I'm
not gonna go into that right now we'll
go into that a little bit but I want you
to see what the data ends up looking
like so we're gonna cut we're gonna call
it row data and we're just gonna make it
right out of our holdings
okay so this is pretty simple this is a
map and the map has an entry for each
worksheet we want to replace the well I
have one worksheet in the spreadsheets
called portfolio so we have a key for
that and then we have a map of the rows
we want to replace rows we don't replace
will simply be passed through from the
template into the output so for this is
zero-based indexing which is a little
confusing for excel but the first row
we're only replacing it with a single
row and that single row only has a
single cell portfolio status as of
yesterday the first row the second row
we leave alone the third row we're just
putting in these two dates notice I have
a lot of Nils across here that just also
says pass through what was ever in the
spreadsheet and then the fifth row we're
replacing it with more than one row
because we have actually more than one
Sherriff's one type of stock in our
portfolio we have a row for Apple we
have a row for Akamai we've got a row
for Amazon etc and each of these rows
rows ticker number of shares right these
were the columns we were looking at
before
that's a spacer column so we just leave
it open low high close
now this nil here once you get out out
right here is the is where the formula
is it does the amount of holdings and
etc out to the rest the liner we do this
for all the lines so now let's look at
how we apply that so this library only
has two functions render to file and
render to stream and they're both
actually this exactly the same they take
an argument which is a template in this
case we're gonna use portfolio template
and it's just a completely reg it's that
completely regulars excel spreadsheet
that we saw before this comes from my
resources directory but could come from
anywhere we have an output file I'm just
going to put it in temp
okay and then we need some data and we
just made the data it's that raw data so
that's how we make an Excel spreadsheet
okay so let's see if that worked this is
always the exciting part looks like it
makes something made something 3:57
that's right now okay so here's our
here's our portfolio expand it out oh I
didn't show you we are in the template
we also had some graphing you'll see
that in a sec but Friday's data
yesterday's data correct for each thing
changes yesterday was actually a good
day in the market and the only company
that went down was Netflix and that's
just a correction because it went crazy
up last week but and here's our
allocation for all our stock we can see
how much of each stock we own this is
our holdings allocation so I built all
of this off the template and so that's
pretty cool now we have now we're able
to build a spreadsheet right out of some
simple data and I think you all know
what happens next right we give this to
our user and they say oh that's pretty
good but you know what I wanted I wanted
the history of all my stocks on their
own sheet could you give me that and so
we file some JIRA tickets and we get
back to work
and I and this is one of the key aspects
of using templates not only here but
everywhere we kind of use templates is
the ability to turn things around
rapidly so let's turn this around
rapidly we're gonna make a new sheet and
again we start in Excel right unlike a
traditional programming thing we're this
is like if you're using in live you
start by writing HTML and then write the
in live to inject data into the HTML
here we start by writing the template
and then we format the data to fit the
template so let me create a new sheet
and let me make it so you guys in the
audience can actually see the sheet
while I'm creating it okay and we're
gonna call this sheet stock now we're
gonna have one of these sheets for every
share so there's a little funny we can't
bind it to one of the shares of stock
and we can't do
for each type of stock because we don't
know a priori when our portfolio might
be bigger or smaller a different user
might have a different portfolio so
we're just going to make one generic
sheet and let Excel templates blow it
out into multiple sheets so we'll call
this sheet year today performance for
and we don't know what the stock is
gonna be yet so what it's called stock
and here we're just gonna put the ticker
in because I'm gonna want that later we
want to know how many shares we have of
this stock because that will help us
determine holdings let's put a random
number in here that's a good number
leave a blank line for space and then
what do we want for the history so we'll
just do the headings day we want the day
for each day of the history we want the
open and the close and then we the
change from yesterday would be nice
where people want history year today
they'd probably want to know that change
year to date as well so let's put that
in and they and year to date percentage
would be nice because percentage is is
you know normalized and then we want to
know the holdings value oh that's kind
of ugly we our columns not wide enough
luckily I don't around trip this through
a program too many times I can just
widen that column with my mouse okay
now what's in each column I mean it's
some sort of date we said I'm just
visited template I'm just filling it
with random numbers right so I can look
at what they look like so we have
open/closed change change doesn't make
sense here right we only have one row
this is the first row so we'll leave
that for the moment your two date change
kind of does because we can start from
the opening of the year so let's say
it's the close oops
formula Excel says equals four formula
and then we say that - the open for the
year those of you who know Excel which
is I suspect most of you will know I
need dollar signs here to keep this from
rolling down the page there we go so
that gives us here today change which is
five year today percent change looks
similar
it's
clothes over the open again we want that
for the year and not to stay local and
we'll make that minus one so it's
actually comes out as a percent and then
Holdings it's just the number of shares
we own times the clothes today and again
we want to walk that in constant numbers
there we go okay so that's great of
course one of the advantages we talked
about in Excel is formatting so let's
make this a little prettier
we'll make that nice and big
we'll make this number have commas in it
because those who know me know I like
commas in my numbers a little
obsessively and then this headings are
nice when they're bold dates these I I
hate this Excel default kind of date to
know thing right so let's change this
around and put the day after the month
and give ourselves a couple days and
then these these we all want to be like
dollars and things right so they had a
couple decimal points and commas where
we want them this is the there we go
much nicer okay and now this actually
shouldn't be that this should be
percentage and one decimal point is
probably plenty very nice okay so now we
got to deal with this fact we never
dealt we never did anything about change
we need two rows in order to express the
idea of change from day to day so we'll
make two rows there and then this is
that - that cool so now we have
something that should give us a history
chart but we got to get data into it and
we got to get this page to reproduce all
right so reproduces for each of our our
things so let me walk through here and
build us a structure now the first thing
we want is to have one of those maps
remember way to map
that describe how to replace the rose we
don't one of those for each of our
shares of stock so let's start with that
and the way to get a sequin a sequence
of things and those of you who were here
for the last doc will I've heard about D
structuring its pattern matching let's
do that here but we'll use the for macro
and DS and Dukey D structuring and what
we want to do is get the data out for
each share of stock and that is a symbol
a name a number of shares and the
history that we got based on our
holdings that we already had so this is
the same data we already had again we're
reshaping it now but just in a different
way okay and now you remember that when
we got that information what we got was
hmm let's reform at this what's easier
for yesterday sorry huh
well we what we did is we had a map for
each thing to replace the rows so let's
start again that same thing so the first
row again we're going to replace it with
one thing which is a string and there's
no string template in that goes on here
so if we have to replace a string we
have to replace the whole thing and
we'll use the full name of the stock oh
I forgot one thing here so since we're
replacing one sheet with multiple sheets
what Excel templates would do left to
its own devices let's call it stock and
stock one and stock two in stock three
but we want better tab names on that so
let's put the symbol on the on the name
of this sheet and we have a special key
for that
okay now the second line that we have
was just that three that we had had two
things we wanted to put on there we
wanted to put the ticker on and the
middle thing was that shares label but
then we want to put the number of shares
okay so that gives us row now the
interesting part we actually want to
write the history and remember we had
two rows that we used to describe the
history because we had to describe that
change right so we have rows rows four
and five or five and six depending which
pace you are using and so we use this
little vector to say replace both these
rows with this data and this data is
just the history and again we'll use
exactly the same pattern we used above
now what do we need from the history we
need the date the open and the close
everything else was computed from that
okay and remember the history was
backwards from today back to history I
wanted to go the other way so I'll
reverse it so it starts at the beginning
of the year and goes until now okay and
then always it's a four so we have to
give some outputs just eight open close
okay so that's our stock history let's
see what it looks like okay so here we
see Walmart at the bottom um we see here
we have the sheet name as the ticker the
first line is here today performance for
Walmart perfect we replace the first
thing with the ticker for the stock and
then there's that label and then nine
hundred shares and then we replace those
other two lines with this long list of
everything from the first market day of
the year until now so how do we put that
into the spreadsheet let's just take our
previous invocation
now you remember row data was just a map
of a page name to the data for that page
the page name is portfolio for the first
page I'm just going to massage on
another page name here
it's called stock we remember we called
that page stock and we'll put this stock
history on right so we're just combining
the two things into a single map okay so
let's see what we got there again the
moment of truth see if it worked
gave it the same output 408 excellent
uh-huh that's a good sign and here we go
here's the history for and if I don't
know how how many how many of you can
see the bottom tabs but we have tabs for
all the different shares as well as our
original portfolio tab and we can see we
have all the fields filled in this first
row has no change but then all the rest
the ones to wave here today change this
is for Apple and by now apples up about
$16 on the year or 14% right similarly
if we look at Amazon we can look at
Amazon's up about 24% so so we get all
this historic data we get all these
worksheets built for us off that simple
template but of course you know what
happens next though the user comes back
and the user says I love that history
but I can't tell relatively how well my
stock is doing right so what I really
want is one chart that shows everything
to me on my on my whole portfolio and
lets me compare which shares are doing
best so you're like okay Excel supposed
to be good at charting let's get a chart
in here and a chart that combines all
that data so then really what we want to
do is we want to track here to date
percent change over the year to see that
the performance and this is pretty easy
with point-and-click I'm back in the
template now by the way if you weren't
following that we go to the charts tab
and we make a line chart of this data
and this is a really exciting line chart
right now but that's not that's how
things go and the templates the
templates usually aren't very exciting
you want the output to be more exciting
so let's pick the data for it
I'm going to give each series the name
of the stock remember this cell I'm
picking now gets replaced by the ticker
symbol in the final result and then I
want to actually have it know that it
should use the dates as the Y labels
because that's a lot nicer okay so
that's a nice chart let's give it a
generic title rather than title based on
the given stock we'll call it why today
year today performance okay so that's
pretty easy we need to put it on its own
worksheet so it doesn't actually get
cloned along with these worksheets
that's easy and Excel you just move
chart and we'll call this okay so now
this is a completely derivative thing
I've just done I haven't used any new
data from the backing data that closure
has so I actually don't need to be nice
about correcting my own spelling here we
go much better
so we don't have to do anything to the
closure data to make this work except
save the spreadsheet so we just rerun
the render to file I'll have to write a
bhoot task to make this automatically
reload and when you see the template but
so here we see okay let's see what
happened to that that should have
rebuilt it and voila we have our
year-to-date his stock history
performance
so it past performances any guarantee of
future success you usually should have
brought Netflix which is that top orange
languages - huge - huge run ups this
year but we can now compare directly
that the shares that we have and this
was built automatically and all this
series were cloned and everything else
so that's so that's that ok so let's
talk a little bit about how this works
this idea of data is API and if any of
you were in Janine's talk earlier she
was talking about data driven
architectures and language design here
we only have two functions and all of
the logic lives and these two functions
are identical except for their output
styles so all the logic that drives them
that makes them any more complex than
yesterday's up case example that Alain
and Misha gave is in the data structure
that is built into the template and in
the data structure that's built into the
replacement structure right so we've
created a language here and I think this
is a common idiom which is why I'm
emphasizing it that we want to use in a
lot of places we're only using data
structures but it really is a language
to describe what we want out the other
side and we can build an in fact we have
because we have to keep ourselves
organized when we work on this and
almost formal grammar to describe how
the language works and and how to parse
it to decide what the users the users
desires are so that's pretty much what I
got I got I want to I want to review
some of the big ideas I was talking
about today the first idea is software
is communication ok so when we build
software we need to think about our user
again this channel some of Janine's
earlier talk I think we need to think
about what our user is needs from that
software and how to best embrace what
they're doing I think especially when we
go to excel but in lots of other cases
we sometimes Ridge
that and try and do what's easy for us
by jumping the boundary and finding ways
to communicate we can be much more
successful one of the interesting
examples here is we were able to find a
way where life is not that much harder
for us now than it was before and yet
we're able to communicate much much
better right we're able to use these
rich spreadsheets but still able to live
in our world of closure data so that's a
pretty nice win use the right tool for
the right job now the important thing is
the right tool is not always a single
tool right we saw in the examples of
Excel earlier that we had things that
were only in Excel things that were not
really in either CSV is right and things
that were only in Java or closure right
and none of those were kind of the right
tool what we really want to do is use
closure for the data parts the closure
is really good at and use Excel for the
parts where Excel I'm going to resist
the paw at some of that someone else
went for it I couldn't so but use Excel
where it's good right because Excel is
really great at a lot of things in
quantitative information presentation
and management and then finally we want
to think about this idea of data is API
I think that's a very powerful idea
you've seen that in a lot of talks here
I think you'll see it in a lot of places
in closure and it's another thing to
embrace and work with okay I want to
make some acknowledgments this work was
largely supported by staples parks when
I was consulting they're a great group
of folks you guys should check them out
if you're looking for closure work and
stuff and then to Jeb who's back there
someplace I saw him who's my
collaborator on this and has contributed
for example the multiple worksheets
stuff that you guys saw so that's that
it's all on github it's released through
closures and you can just link to it
some of the stuff I showed today isn't
yet in the release version but it will
be in the next week or so and this
sample code that I was showing is also
up there on github so you can play with
that there's a long blog post on my blog
too about an earlier
of this lots of credits for photos and
stuff and that's it and we actually have
a few minutes for questions if people
want questions
yeah so we haven't completely tested it
with LibreOffice in its in a sense of
exhaustively but Jeb in particular uses
LibreOffice and during his development
it works fine no and there has been some
interest in that it's not actually
particularly a goal of mine but I think
there could be some related work where
that made a lot of sense one of those
other libraries I showed has a mode
where it can read and I can't remember
its doctor or clj Excel but it has a
mode where it can read in Excel
spreadsheets and just turn them into
maps which is kind of nice
using poi it is actually pretty easy to
do
so it's so one use mode could be create
something with a template read back
modifications using poi and so on so
there a lot of there's a lot of
interesting stuff you could do there one
of the really interesting things here to
me actually in in that model is allowing
users to write their own templates right
where you create data users can format
it they can request additions you saw
how we can replace ranges for instance
right I do that for pragmatic reasons
because I need to be able to express
certain concepts that are interesting
concepts but the same thing could go
where someone reformatted something you
just wanted to replace their treat their
thing as the template and replace it and
and that's a powerful way to get you
Gibby
Excel power users who might be your
users who might want more derived data
inside the report to control the report
yeah
I don't I don't know that library he's
mentioned a library called Jay XLS that
is a groovy or it's it's a Java library
that you've used from groovy yeah yeah
that sounds cool yeah it sounds a
similar idea anything else oh I worry
about that so you don't have to you do a
little bit but but but largely if you do
what you think is right and writing the
formulas in the template my code will
correctly expand it right at some point
I'll write a longer explanation of the
rules for how that happens up in the
back now this is just a regular Excel
spreadsheet yeah whatever you whatever
you want is there another one but it's
kind of is lousy yeah
you know I've thought a little bit about
that and I basically so for those of you
don't know inside excel files are a zip
file of a directory of XML files all
right and it's actually pretty nice
format for what it's doing when you get
inside and get used to it but it's big
and messy and everything else it's hard
for me to believe that someone hasn't
thought about source code controlling
Excel the XLS the X LSX format that's a
tongue twister by expanding the zip and
then and then source code controlling
the parts which is a pretty reasonable
thing to do but I don't know of that
work right and and that would be kind of
the way you'd want to go some more
general excel problem anything else okay
I think we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
