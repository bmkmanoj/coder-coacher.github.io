I guess I should so there's a URL there
if you have a laptop and a ruffle go
there there's a couple steps of
instructions as long as you already have
maven you'll be able to bring this right
out with the latest version that was
checked infidel this morning and try it
out we should be able to that the code
snippets on the slide they should be
able to just try so I'd love it if you
guys to do that and that way you can
find my bugs before the end of the talk
okay right so I'll be talking about an
implementation of finger trees for
closure finger trees were invented by
Ralph Hines II I believe it's how the
name is pronounced and frost Patterson
hang on a second here I'm going to start
out to favor
not by me I all I did was a best attempt
at converting they're very detailed
paper with all of its Haskell examples
into you know a language with readable
syntax ok so finger trees are another
persistent collection title I think
besides we know what we mean by
persistent here it's not about this it's
about being immutable and have all the
versions of particular structure all
performing the way you would expect not
degrading a performance as you go along
finger trees compliment closures
existing collections which is a
diplomatic way of saying that there are
reasonable things that a closer program
might want to do that cannot be done
well with closures existing persistent
data structures and finger trees can
help fill in some of those gaps of
course the flip side of that is that
when you can use closures existing
collection types they're generally
preferable to finger views
and finger trees are customizable one
way to think about this is that the
sortedset and math collections are a
little bit customizable because you can
provide a pair of finger trees take that
to a whole new level
we'll see how that works in fact they're
still customizable I'm not even going to
start talking about the general finger
tree we're going to talk about the
specific implementation that comes with
the library called a double List you
create a double Lissa's using the same
syntax you would to create a regular
closure list right you pass in some
elements that you want to be in there
we're gonna store it in the DL bar and
that print has a seat right 4 5 6 7
because it is a seat it actually gives
us a like persistent list itself
implements C and like a list you can
call first and rest on it to example
things from the left hand side but you
can also call he can pop on to access
things from the right hand side so
that's why I call it a double list it's
double head if you can get to either out
alright one thing of note here is that
unlike a vector a vector you can also
peek and pop on one side and you can
call first and rest on the other but
here rest and pop are symmetric on a
vector if you call rest you'll get a
sequence right not a vector here both of
those are real double lists the type is
maintained as you as you pull things off
either end okay so that's how you access
the left on the right side but we'd also
like to add things to the left on the
right side the problem there a little
hiccup is that the function we would
want to use for that
or perhaps cons and cons but conch has
the unique feature of adding to one side
or the other depending on
the actual collection underneath so you
can't assume that it's always going to
add on one side and cons as it is in
closer right now it doesn't allow you to
extend it in a way that would allow us
to keep the time so at least for now the
library provides a couple of new
contractions which I called cantar and
cons l trying to give as many hints as
possible as to which side you're gonna
add things to so cons are is like conch
same parameters but I promise I'll
always add things to the right when you
call cons l always as the left but it
keeps the collection type you can see
there also the argument ordering is
consistent with cons rather than cons
for what it's worth so that's how you
can add to get it a lot or the right
size a double list
okay yeah and so far all the operations
we've looked at here are called amortize
it constant time
that is you can peek pop first dressed
ad on either end all those are
essentially constant time operations the
word amortized there means something
very specific that I would not be able
to explain but it has to do with
sometimes the operation is slower and
sometimes it's faster depending upon the
shape of the treat you're dealing with
and but in the paper for anyone to could
understand it it apparently proves that
any of these slower operations are paid
for by doing faster operations
interleaved in such a way that it comes
out being constant time in general so
what kind of data structure what movie
the shape of a data structure that can
actually let you do constant time
operations on both ends I mean if you
think about a regular binary tree the
ends are way down right you have to
descend several times through a binary
tree to get to either so what does a
finger tree look like okay this is what
I think it looks like so there are
several things to note here this is what
happens when you build a double list of
a bunch of symbols right so the first
thing to know is what I was just talking
about the left and right most items are
always one step down here okay
so you can always get to the rightmost
and leftmost items in a single step
constant time they're always right there
another thing to note is that every one
of these notes both the leaves and the
intermediate nodes in this example
they're all three or smaller the code
promises that they will never be more
than four items in any given note that's
important when we start talking about
complexity we know it's a fixed size
they are smaller when they when you
don't have the need to store more things
enough the depth of these left and right
notes is interesting because like I said
for the top level they're one level down
but this middle node is special when you
go down a level there you have a subtree
where now the left and right items are
pointing to trees that are one level
deeper so in this case two steps right
one two to get tier leaf-nosed same
thing over here
one two this here is a symbol I'm using
for an empty list but if we had to put
more items in there this would get to be
at another level of tree and the leaves
off that would be three steps away so as
the tree gets deeper the leaves off to
the side get deeper as well the reason
that's important is because we can see
that adding if we were to add another
item on the right here we can see that
we would be able to do that easily in
constant time
because we would have a new element here
holding four things and we just need a
new rope a new route to point to that
new collection on the side right so that
would be fast the problem is if we added
another item now we would have to have
five and that's not allowed so what we
would have to do is split this node and
push a couple of these elements like Bo
and P down the tree of it into a some
empty spot in the next level
most of the time there would be room
there because this is a deeper tree
there's more room in it if that tree is
also full then you would have to push
down even further in a sort of a
logarithmic process the less and less
frequently you have to push deeper and
deeper into the tree that combined with
some clever use of delay to sort of
build a closure over the sub trees is
how you can get your amarak highest
constant time the fast operations of
adding things on that top level of the
tree helps you pay for the more costly
operations of pushing things down as you
go along okay so having done this we
have many of the features of a
persistent list right you can walk
through it you can get to either end but
one thing persistent list has this does
not is you can ask a persistent list for
its size and get the answer back right
away right with this if this is all the
data we have the only way to get the
size of the tree would be to walk all
the way along the edge walk the entire
tree that would be a linear operation
right so not too fast at all so one
thing we could do to fix that would be
to add a little bit of information on
each node here we are going to as we're
building the tree measure each of the
nodes and put the result of that
measurement sort of on the node itself
so how many what's the count of one node
what is one a so we have a single item
there
okay down here we have three and so the
measure of that the count of that is
three same thing for all these and then
as we work our way up the tree as these
nodes are combined and the tree is built
we song them so that we know this entire
branch down here contains a total of
nine items the nine the three here get
added to twelve all those get batted to
know that we have sixteen so now when we
want to know the size if we use to count
a double list we can simply ask the root
node for its size it knows how big the
list is and it can give any answer right
away which is handy and so now we do
have a features of a persistent list but
persistent list in vector both provide
count without decorating interior nodes
like that we did a lot of work you to
put these counts throughout the tree
rather than just counting up or down at
the root note as we go along this is
because we want to do
okay now hang with me this is the
hardest slide for me to explain anyway
can you even see those numbers okay they
didn't help that much anyway okay so
alright what we're trying to do is we're
trying to find the fifth item in the
tree and the way we're going to do that
is we're going to have an accumulator
keeping track of how many things are on
the left of our navigation as we go down
we're going to keep a running total how
much is on the left side of our path
okay so and the question in each point
of the log of the tree is which node do
we want to descend it so we're going to
start through the node here and try to
decide which of these three notes to
descend into well we can look at the
count of the one on the left and see
that at most we're only going to find
one item now we're looking for item
number five one is never going to be
enough so we do not descend to the left
to go to the middle we can add one and
twelve together to get 13 and we know
that you will get thirteen items at most
thirteen items if we descend down it and
so we've crossed from below five to more
than five so we know that note we're
looking for is in between there so we
descend and do it again we now have a
running total of one we're only going to
take the one that we know we are going
to keep on the left put that in our
accumulator plus one and scan the nodes
under that threes here so we're going to
have one and three we get four that's
still not enough if we were to go down
that branch the most we could possibly
find our four items we're looking for
the fifth but it's not good enough so we
add the one on the three and the zero
still not enough one three and nine
gives us plenty of rank what is that 13
13 is more than five and so we know the
item we're looking for is in there so we
descend now we're here do it again we're
going to look on the left try to add
three to our one
and three here so four plus three is
where we at now okay that's plenty right
we know that's enough that's more than
five and so at this end and now we're
doing one at a time until we find the
one plus the three plus this first one
it's four that's not more than five they
say they're right I did that wrong four
five five is not more than five so we do
the next one 6 is more than 5 that's the
item we want you think believe me I did
this wrong lots of times first 0 1 2 3 4
5 50 okay so I was gonna say something
else about that oh great this is a login
operation right we went down the tree we
had a fixed number of maximum possible
steps at each node maximum before as we
walked down and we only went through the
path once let's login look up by index
so now we have a thing that is even more
like effective right we can not only add
to the left side which you can't do in
the vector you can add to the right and
you can find us count and you can look
things up by index so we're doing great
if you need a little bit more detail on
how exactly these numbers are added up I
nevermind that comes later okay I'm
sorry right so one thing you can do with
a vector that we haven't shown yet is
you can replace an item inside the
vector right you can do a a sock is that
how we say it to replace in an item in
the middle well it so happens that
finger trees implement a couple of
operations that help us to do that and
the really magical one is called split
split allows you to follow that same
path through the tree but as you go it
tears it apart picks apart into two
separate trees along that path that you
follow leaving a correct finger tree on
the left of everything before the split
a correct finger Tran there at
everything after the split
and the one item in the middle that you
found walking through the tree that
combined with another operation called
concat which stitches them back together
gives you everything you need to
implement a sock and that could look
like this
so here I'm going to do a split of our
count a double list at five right so now
we have our left part and our right
partner which you can see here and then
I'm gonna do a couple operations first
I'm going to take a new item
alright so now here maybe HIV so we're
missing the half threat that we found
and then we have G through back so now
in place of the F I'm going to put this
xx symbol on the right-hand side of the
left hand tree sort of layer in the
middle and then I'm going to contact at
whole new tree from the left and the
whole tray from the right to rebuild my
entire tree up from the ground and now I
have the same sequence I had before with
the F replaced XS split and capped are
both login operations we've already said
the cons is constant time so 2 times log
n plus a constant is still login time so
this is a log and replacement of an item
so we caught up a vector we can do the
things that vector can do and we can
still have on the left but we can do
more than that because now that you know
we can do a split and it can cat there's
nothing requiring you to put exactly one
item where they used to be exactly one
item you can do removes and inserts so
there's top one here we don't bother
adding anything in the middle at all and
in the bottom one we insert several
items using into write to put several
things on the end of the left tree
stitch the right tree back up onto it
and now we've got a longer vector
there's longer in the middle sorry I
longer finger tree that's longer in the
middle and it still works
the indexes that you would use to get to
these right-hand items is now larger
than it used to be right because they're
shifted over but if you think about how
we walk through the tree coming up with
the sum as we go you can see that that
can still be doing structural sharing
with the old version of the tree and yet
have new end
to get see what I've supposed to have
been saying that I have
okay so how do we tell a finger tree
that we want to account to each of the
interior notes we do it by providing a
meter objects what I call them either
object let me create a finger tree so
this code right here is essentially what
is inside the constructor function for
count double list a generic finger tree
with a specific meter a meter is made of
three parts we have a measure which is a
function that takes one element from our
collection and returns some value what
we're measuring in this case we want to
know the count the count of a single
item is always 1 so the function I'm
using is constant they want the second
thing the meter needs is what is the
measurement if you have an empty tree
how many things are in it 0 this is not
a function this is always just a
constant and finally you need some kind
of function to combine counts so the the
plus there means if you have a tree of
five things in a tree of two things and
you can cap them what is the measure of
them together it's the sum of the two
counts all right so we're happening
you don't really need to know that the
measure of empty and combined together
form a thing called a model but I
thought if you like the word model it
and want to learn more about it you can
explain to me later what this means this
is straight this is straight from the
paper okay so we looked at how you tell
a finger tree to add the data the the
meter David the measure data to the tree
here's how you use it the function we
were looking at before was called split
at and specifically for these counted
things the more generic one is called
split Treaty you give it the tree and
you give it a predicate than general
predicate that takes as argument as a
single argument the measure whatever
your measure function produce so in our
case the count and simply return this
true or false and when you tell it to
split it will put everything that
returned false on the left and it will
find actually what it does it finds a
single point a point in the tree where
your predicate switches from being false
to true so when we're looking things up
by index is worth with a count of things
on the Left matches up with what we're
looking for
it's possible to create a meter and a
tree that has multiple points in it
where a particular predicate would
switch from false to true and that's
legal but the finger tree algorithm
doesn't
make any promises about which transition
is going to find so I'm not sure how
useful that would actually be okay so
that was one kind of meter let's look at
a different meter and see if we can
figure out why it would be useful
can you have multiple meters or just one
for each tree yes you can actually only
have one meter but ma nodes are
composable and so you could actually
write they meter and may still even be
in the code there's a function that
builds a new meter out of other boy it's
like composing the function right you
can stack them onto each other and put
multiple piece of information in there
when I actually did that I was thinking
I was gonna have some wonderfully
composable thing allow you to create
your customized finger trees out of
pieces without having to get down and
dirty with the actual meter functions
but it turns out it's you can't really
describe using closure abstractions what
it is you just built you can do that but
you can't say that it is countable
without being a new specific time so
anyway all that to say generally well
we'll look that's a good question keep
that in mind we'll see something that's
related to that okay so for this one our
measure is the identity function so the
measure of the element a is just a write
itself the manager of empty is nail you
can see that here in this empty tree no
the combined function is this thing
it's always the second argument unless
that is false right there fall see in
which case it's the first term which is
kind of a way of saying the rightmost
thing so you can see that here we have a
VC and D the measure of that is deep and
that bubbles off over here the rightmost
thing is M and that bubbles up so that
allows us to ask the whole tree what's
your rightmost item well we already can
do that we could look at the tree and
get that so what are we doing
anybody kind of any guesses insertion
order yes it doesn't tell us a whole lot
unless we also promise that we're gonna
keep things in sorted order if we
promise we're gonna keep the entire tree
in sorted order we can now look things
up by their value we can say does this
collection include an F and we can rock
down the tree finding things that are
between and find a spot where F belongs
it's more than a but less than Q less
than M less than M here it is you can
find right where it would belong in the
tree or if it doesn't exist you can find
the spot where it should be and
conclusively say in log n time this does
not exist so it's a sorted set right
good sorry the set okay but it's just a
sort of set because you can't let people
had seems to be ends anymore so our big
finger tree feature is gone and it
really is just a sort of set of course
we already have a sorted set that
believe me runs a lot faster than this
will so what good is it it's good if you
had another piece of data so if you have
a new meter that does both the rightmost
item and the count you can now look
things up both by their value
sorted order or by their index okay you
can navigate the tree either way to pay
upon what predicate you pass to your
split function and so you can do things
like this where they counted sort of set
you can feed it a bunch of items in
whatever order you want and it will sort
them just like a sort of set you can
then call get to find out whether things
exist he is there so it returns it he is
not to get help those are login you can
also do end you can find the physical
thing now in a in a closer persistent
sort of set the only way to get the end
thing is to walk from one side end and
so that's a linear operation here it's
login because we sort of built in an
index into our tree of how to find
things in sorted order and of course you
can do other counted kinds of things on
because we know at the root how big the
whole tree is so that's accountants or
it
okay so that's all the pre-built finger
trees that are included in the library
so I've got a little bit more here where
we can look at what it would take to
build your own finger tree the idea here
in this example is that this could be
and very application specific kind of
thing you could have an application that
is dealing with say a queue of items
each of which have some kind of cost you
always add things to one side and you
pull them off the other and maybe you
have some limited resource I don't know
if the cost is maybe how large something
is and you have a fixed amount of space
but the idea is you have to take things
in order because it's a queue and you
want to know where is the what's the
straw brings the camel's back if I have
a fixed value of say 7 I've room for 7
cost units and I want to know how many
things will fit in under that wire and
immediately start processing anything
beyond it that's what we're
demonstrating so of course we're gonna
build a finger tree and we're gonna tell
it what its meters we're actually gonna
make sure that all of the items in this
particular finger tree know their own
costs so we can just that's a simple way
to do it so we're gonna look up the
costs of each of the items and then this
is kind of like count write the cost of
an empty trees is none no cost at all
and we're gonna add up the cost list in
order to figure out the total cost of a
tree or subtree and then we're gonna
build one right here's our empty cost
tree and we just made and so we're going
to comment
and now we can ask the root what is your
major so before we're using count that
was sort of a specific thing this is the
general finger tree function for finding
out what is the measure of the whole
tree so we can immediately see that the
cost of all of these items added
together is 15 and then we can find out
what are the items that will fit that do
not fit in under 7 ok so we had these up
manually we can see that this first one
is fine we add another one in there 6
that's okay
7 8 that's gonna take us over the level
so starting with that one
that's mr. J there that's our first one
that doesn't fit and here's a sequence
of all the remaining items so again if
this were some kind of regular queue
where you didn't have this cost function
on it the only way to find out would be
to actually start from the beginning and
walk in counting things up to find out
where the transition happens and this
allows you to do it in log in time
instead and so you can see how this
essentially pops one item off the left
here the rest we take the expensive one
off the end of the queue and now when we
ask what is not going to fit it takes us
straight to hell because one plus two
plus three is still 7 or less
okay I think
so good alright so here's what's in the
finger tree library right we've got
double lists which is like a list but it
lets you have them either side right
left to right got counted double list
which is like a double list but you can
do em and count online fast we've got a
counted sorted set which is like a sort
of set plus N and the tools you need to
build your own now despite Stuart
Holloway's best efforts they're not
actually completely done
some things that could be it could be
improved in particular they don't handle
some of the normal things you'd expect
of a closer collection there's no
support for metadata I think if you
compare a finger tree to anything else
it always says false it's they're all
different from each other one of the
things that that was bothering me while
I was writing it was having to introduce
these new functions console and cons are
and ft split at we have a sequence
function to split up right that isn't
abstract at all
same thing for King cat so it would be
neat if closures built-in functions were
sufficiently abstract so that we could
use those instead of having to have
specialized functions and there's a
bunch of unit tests in there already but
I'm sure there's some cases I haven't
covered so test for
breakfast would be nice but even more
interesting to me would be complexity
it's hard to say whether I understood
the paper fully
or not and so it'd be nice to
demonstrate that all the complexity
guarantees about log and efficiency and
average cost of time that are proved in
the paper actually pulled out in my
accommodation and performance of course
you can always improve that and
primitives see any reason that we
couldn't do the same thing for finger
trees that majority did for generic
vectors so they can hold the primitive
values instead of only audience
