tell you a story about diatomic and it's
great composable queries my name's
Elizabeth angleman you can find me on
Twitter and Instagram at you Bethany and
on github at over the Pangolin I'm a
software crafter a consultancy in Mesa
called a flight based in Chicago and I'm
really excited to be here here's the
table of contents for today's story
first we're going to take a look at an
overview of diatomic then we're going to
look at an example data and how we would
implement in diatomic and then we'll
throw wrench into our system to see how
to cope with the pressure and I'll shoot
then I'll share a couple of other things
I've learned while working with the
atomic in a production system when I
first be able to talk about the atomic
it was about a year ago this time an
internal a flight mini conference it was
really excited to share with my
co-workers what I had learned about the
atomic on my client site but I also just
adapted these ducats that I was really
excited about as well so it was
inevitable for these few line my feline
friends to make their way into my
presentation last year and as it turns
out I can't help but think about cats
when I think about the atomic so you all
are going to get the cat treatment as
well these two are about seven years old
and our brother and sister the Kanes
with the name became with the name Miko
and hello but I wanted to commemorate a
new chapter in their lives by giving
them new names I've always loved animals
since I was a kid but I never got the
opportunity to name a set of animals
before so their name choice was very
important to me and I ended up going out
with a different few different options
and trying them out even though it would
be really cool if this conference was
called cats West it's not as closure
West I'll help get some software in the
mix so I don't spend my full time
discussing cats so let's suppose that I
have a traditional relational database
that I want to keep track of my pet data
in I would likely create a cat table
with the name field then as I was
changing their names every couple weeks
I would go in and update the database
with the name field with that name as I
mentioned they started off with a name
semicolon hello and then I decided to
try out the names Niles and Daphne after
two characters from Frasier
however if we'll notice with this system
I would be replacing their old names
with the new
and thus losing the record of their old
temporary names actually if I was
working on these wives doing some
last-minute preparation I was listening
to the Beatles and the song rocky
records came on and I was reminded that
I was going to name them Rocky and
Miguel or Lil but since those records
were replaced I lost that data and that
wouldn't have been the case with DES
Tomic since it's always additive I'm
always going to be adding new facts to
the database about my cats never
replacing the old ones all data in DES
tommix is stored in what is called a
datum which is a five tuple that
includes an entity which represent
something in the database here it's
indicated by the entity ID an attribute
of that entity the attributes value and
then the transaction number one this
datum or fact was added to the system
and then the last column is the
operation whether it was added or not
when I first entered these two in the
database I added two facts one that says
the entity of cat 1 an @ review of cat
name of neko and the other one that says
that entity 2 has an attribute of cat
name of hello I can then add the other
another set of facts when I changed
their names Niles and Daphne and then
since I was had atomic on the brain
while I was naming them I even
considered changing the name to Richmond
Hickey
but then I've occurred to me that since
they were brother and sister perhaps
naming them after a famous brother and
sister duo would be best
and then it hit me to named master gene
and the Ouija belt gene and Louise
Beltre from Bob's Burgers and as I
thought about it it seemed like these
characters really their personalities
really fit with personalities with my
cat so Tina and Louise they are and so
let's add those two facts into the
database as well since this database is
always additive and be able to go back
in time and query for what their names
were as of transaction 1 on 2 15 2016
when I first got them and then I would
get the names information that cat 1 is
named Nico and catches me and pillow or
I can query as of the current database
value and the names of B gene and Louise
as expected this immutability is
probably one of the biggest differences
and atomic and all the other relational
databases I've worked with probably also
one of my favorite things but the
implications of the immutability are
really powerful so let's begin today
Thomas a little further to explore lab
first let's take a look at the
architecture so this talk is going to
focus on the composability of queries
specifically I'd like to note that the
atomic is composable even in its
architecture it's compressed comprised
of three main pieces first a datastore
here on the bottom is unique and that is
external from the database system this
allows users to persist their data in
anything from a sequel system such as
Postgres to a no sequel service such as
DynamoDB the de Tomic team reasoned that
storing data is a problem that computing
has already solved so they focused on
challenges like reading handling reads
and writes Sapir on the top left is any
application that includes the atomic
peer library these peers have the
ability to query data within the
application itself communicate with
other elements in the system and also
represent a partial copy of the database
through heavy caching because our
application is able to query locally
each application instance has the
ability to interact with the data sent
independently and since the data is
immutable we can feel confident that
query and as of a certain period in time
we will all just go exist the same
results the trans actor upon the top
right is separate from both of these
components its sole responsibility is to
write trans write information into the
database and then alert the peers of new
facts that are added it ensures that all
data is assets all transactions are
assets compliance as I mentioned earlier
I got the opportunity to work with DES
Thomas will on a project the client
project last year the team I was on at
this client worked on a multi-tenant
application that would allow financial
investment organizations to create
customized customized web portal for
their customers so these customers could
view their account information look at
fund research or documents the main use
case for DES Thomas on this
the micro service that we called the
visibility service we would query the
service and get a list of documents that
a particularly user was allowed to see
there are also a couple of important
reasons for creating this visibility
service one is that the previous the
logic was previously in a series of
sequel queries that was spread
throughout the application over time and
so trans extracting this logic out into
a micro service made a lot of sense it
also became clear that the graph
database like structure would be helpful
for this kind of data and so we are
using David atomic is basically a graph
database also we were implementing a new
customer who understood the visibility
of documents differently than all
previous customers so the ability to use
the same kind of data that we previously
had but in a different way worked well
with the Atomics
because they Tomic is flexible in its
structure for this new customer we could
add attributes to the data without
needing to backfill existing clients to
make the database happy which we'll see
in our example schema in just a second
so let's explore this problem in a bit
more depth with the simplified data set
with some more cats and some left client
secrets involved so let's pretend we
have some software that animal shelters
can use to keep track of their animals
and also share information about animals
on their website depending on the
permissioning of the user we have two
visibility groups the public visibility
group allows users to visit the website
to see animals that are currently up for
adoption and an employee visibility
group is for animals for people to see
for the users to see animals I have just
been taken in but aren't ready for
adoption yet this would be for the
employees if we look at the public
visibility group they're in or have an
association if we look at the public
user exactly excuse me they are in or
have an association to the public
visibility group by being a member of
that group were able to see all the
animals associated to that group but
they will not be able to see animals
associated to the employee disability
group the employer users would be a
member of both
and so they could see all the animals
now look at the stage the stage set
let's make sure we can implement this
default behavior and atomic taking care
to leave our code open for changes in
the future
hint there's going to be some changes
sorry
we could probably talk about the atomic
schema in depth for hours which is a
little out of scope for this talk
obviously but I want to highlight a
couple of things before we move on to
discussing the database structure schema
and atomic describes and themselves in
the database the set of possible
attributes that an entity can have it
does not however describe which entities
can have which attributes which we'll
see in a second for our example database
we'll have a user entity that has a type
attribute which we'll use for either as
a public or employee user will have an
animal entities that also has a type as
well as a name or probably we want to
conclude more attributes on to these
tables but for now we'll just keep it at
this for simplicity sake and then we'll
have the group entity also have a name
attribute as well either public
disability group or the employee
disability group and it will also have a
group member attribute whose type is
reference which means that we'll be able
to reference another entity in the
database because of the atomic FEMA is
flexible this group member attribute
could either be used to describe a user
which is how we're going to associate
users with groups or it could be used to
describe an animal which is how we're
going to associate animals with groups
now let's write our first query that
allows to get from the user to the group
and then to the cats as we walk through
this query the first time let's pretend
we're looking at a public user so we're
looking at the top branch we use data
log to query de Tomic data log is a
logic based query language which
utilizes pattern matching at the top of
the file here we're requiring de Thomas
API and then using its queue or query
function here in the user to animals one
function Q takes in our query clauses as
a list and then a database value
since we're querying the database as of
a certain time and finally any
parameters that were passing to the
query the first clause here is saying to
find an entity which were representing
with the variable a and this is what
we're returning from the query next we
have the in clause a variable that
begins with a dollar sign here
represents the database value this
idiomatic just use a single dollar sign
this is also where we'll include the
user type of premier parameter lines 8
through 11 are our where clauses which
are written as data patterns you say
data patterns are in the same format or
order as our five pieces of the data in
this example we're only going to care
about the first three pieces so the
entity the attribute and the value and
then we can leave the other two pieces
out of the data pattern so line 8 is
asking for an entity represented by you
that has an attribute user type with a
value of the user type for passing in
line 9 is looking for an entity G with
an attribute group member has a value of
the user that satisfies the predicate on
the line above line 10 is looking for
the same entity G that also has an
attribute group number with the value of
a and finally on line 11 we're saying
this entity a must have an animal those
must have an attribute animal name
you'll notice that we don't specifically
include the value in this last data
pattern that's because we don't
necessarily care about this value of a
in this particular query it's also
important to note here that for any
variables that are in more than one data
pattern is accesses it as an implicit
join and if we've run this function with
our public user will the Basques the
black and white cat and then if we run
it with the employee user instead we'll
be fast all forecasts it's also
important to note that the atomic
doesn't return pictures of cats it's
just going to return the entity IDs but
I thought these are a little bit under
to look at
so this is a basic task of querying our
data where there's some refactoring that
we can do because this particular query
isn't really taking advantage of de
Thomas composability so here we have the
refactor three factors of query
operation to be composed of two query
rules that are defined in the first two
depths on line 17 and 22 rules are
little packages of reusable logic or L
algorithms that we can plug in to our
queries we can even use several rules
together in our query clauses to compose
larger more complicated queries the des
on line 17 is defining a rule that
describes how to traverse the graph from
the user type to the Associated group
the first line in the rule is the rule
head which names this package of logic
and the other rule defines how to
traverse the path from the group to
their associated animals we can plug
this set of rules into our Q function
much the same way we're including our
database value and parameters the rule
set is represented by the percent sign
in the in clause once we've passed the
rule set into the Q function we can then
use any of the included rules in this
query and if we run these queries again
with the public user we should get the
same results the two paths and now it's
the employee user again we get all
forecasts
now that we've got our query in order
and refactored it let's put some further
pressure on our system and our
composability by adding a new special
customer for this customer let's suppose
that they also have this idea of
hierarchical
animal visibility we also want to being
able to assign animals directly to users
but if the animals that aren't in two
groups specifically maybe the use case
for this is that animals that have been
adopted and employees assigned to them
so they could follow up with them later
so now we have two different clients
with two different ideas of its
visibility they'll each need different
queries to represent those disparate
concepts of visibility they'll have
different data sets and we want to store
it all in one database
these challenges these challenges but
several pressures on our system our
schema will need to change to
incorporate this relationship from a
user directly to an animal will also
need a mechanism to decide if the
incoming user should get the default
query or the special query keeping in
mind that our particular customer also
wants the default behavior in addition
to their special case the schema change
is necessary for our new customer would
include introducing our new
relationships between the user and the
animal we're also introducing the need
to know if it's a specific user rather
than just a user type but as we've
established previously our schema is
flexible so we can add new attributes
for the user email and the user assigned
animals and that's it since our schema
doesn't describe which entities can or
should have which attributes there is no
restriction in our database that will
force us to go back to our previous data
and backfill they assigned animals
attributes for users that are already in
the system we just won't add an assigned
animal value to those users and this
means we don't have to make any changes
to our existing customers but it should
be noted that since no there is no
database restriction here
we would have to pick the particularly
mindful of our in our application code
and make sure that we are never
assigning an animal to user for our
normal customers so let's look at the
query here instead of splitting the
logic of getting from a user to an
animal outlets to smaller rules as we
had in the previous example I'm just
grouping them all back into one role
defined from on line 42 to 47 just to
make this a bit simpler to read this
rule called user to animals behaves in
the same way it did when it was in two
separate roles and here on the second
rule is on line 49 this is this rule
that's pretty interesting
this rule has the same rule head or same
name as the rule above but the
difference definition is different we
now have a data pattern that is looking
for entity you with a user email
attribute that has a value of user email
that will pass in and then
checks with the entity you as an
assigned animal attribute and assigns
that value to a so how does this work if
a rule has two definitions but the same
rule name this acts as an implicit for
so here we're redefining how to traverse
the graph from a user to an animal by
adding another possible task to the mix
okay so now let's put the whole thing
together our multi methods
user Danimal function at the very bottom
will now dispatch which query function
to call based on whether or not we're
passing in the customer query parameter
we were passing in the particular
customer as our custom query will
dispatch the special user to animal
function otherwise the default behavior
is used the normal user to animal
function that was previously defined
know on line 59 we're including both the
default user to animal role and the
special uses an animal rule utilizing
the implicit or that these rules offer
and so let's run this function and we'll
get back just the black and white cat
for a public user the black and white
cats but when we run it for the employer
user we'll get back all five cats we
could actually refactor this a little
bit more instead of having different
query functions for the normal customer
versus a particular customer what if we
just use the same function and then our
multi method could just decide which
rules to pass in based on the custom
query parameter so now that we've built
our system and had to change it for our
particular customer I'll mention a few
things of note that I learned while
working with DES Tomic and on the client
side
one is that we should be mindful of the
particular customer because because
there's always going to be another one
my client project experienced something
very similar to the scenario and at some
point realized that our query namespace
even worse the Associated tests have
been overrun with mentions of the
particular customer it was no longer a
generic query to find aloud tasks from a
user to the animal the solution to this
problem is probably quite obvious in
hindsight we just extracted out a
specific namespace for our particular
customers and kept a default namespace
nice to end generic speaking of tests
unit testing list atomic is pretty is a
pretty great tool in managing these
particular customers as well as
developing composable queries one thing
we found about really valuable with our
unit testing is this nifty function into
atomic API called width which allows you
to interact with any database value with
any additional data you would like so
we're able to test our queries without
ever having to transact test data into
the actual database fact that we can
include these different data models into
one database is pretty powerful but it
also requires some additional planning
and mindfulness at my client we begun to
build began to build out a set of data
for each use case the normal path and
then the subsequent particular customers
with the intention of using it for
regression test since they Thomas is a
fairly new technology our team was still
learning new and better ways to do
things all the time and so it was really
important to us to have a way to
refactor confidently
and we hope those the regression tests
would be a great tool for that as we
implemented new and different customers
into our systems we learned a lot of new
and different things about our system
one customer of my clients has lots of
data to traverse in the graph which tell
us the lesson that though query order
may not matter and logically with data
log you'll get the same results whatever
order you put it in but performance it
really does
matter so we should put the most
restrictive clause first because we
found it that a function that took or
that a query that took I don't know a
couple hours one way we took 24 hours
before we refactored it which was not
okay okay and so now to conclude this
idea of creating a multi-tenant
application or having one application
with the possibility of multiple
different existing data sources has been
prevalent in my experience my current
client now is actually dealing with a
similar issue and this question of
whether we're designing data and our
systems based on how our database is
currently set up how our clients
database is set up how our third parties
database is set up or how the data
should be structured is one that's come
to mind a lot these days
learning to comment has helped me open
up my mind to this problem it may be
more aware this is something that will
continue to exist and we should be
considered we should consider as we're
designing systems because there are so
much flexibility in day kamek we have
more creativity to model our data in a
way that is more efficient for us and
makes the most sense for us but also is
more most efficient and makes the most
sense for our users
