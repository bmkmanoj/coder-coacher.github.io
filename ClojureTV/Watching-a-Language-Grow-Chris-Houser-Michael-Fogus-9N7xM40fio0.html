hear me okay I feel like we're missing
something we're missing the bearskin rug
yeah so before I begin I want to want to
tell a little story and which is which
is keynote reminded me of the time that
the master of metrologist pi mu was
invited to a panel at the little
Languages workshop and typically PI mu
would stays on the mountain he doesn't
want to come down and but in this event
he decided to and he came down and he
sat on the panel there's one of those
things where you have these big minds
talking in talking about their languages
and I did this and I did this and what
else should we do this and also do that
he said silent the whole time just
Fanning himself and it got to the point
where people started noticing that he
wasn't saying anything so no audience
members said PI Moodle what do you think
about programming language development
he said he found himself he kept doing
this to the point where started to
become a little uncomfortable and any
just before someone was about to speak
up he said everyone does have a
programming language inside of them and
in most cases that's where it should
stay and he stood up hit his hit the
microphone with his fan and walked up
everyone was enlightened
so this is a conch talking I I've been
bad at this in my previous ones so I
thought I would include a dictionary
definition I'm not sure I'm doing it
right you can't say I didn't warn you it
but this is this is this is real snot
why I go by that name but you know I
looked yours up as well but I I don't
know how to do this part I am an enigma
so um speaking of programming language
development on about 2005 there was a
programmer with with the background in c
plus plus in java who was dissatisfied
with the landscape of programming
language dissatisfied with his
experience and so he decided to take
some time and you know see if he could
do something a little bit different mhm
and the language that he thought of was
was a functional language scheme like in
nature
somewhat interesting syntax I'd say
hosted on the JVM a richer set of data
structures that you might find in
something like a scheme lists of course
book maps and integrated production
rules and units of measure what yeah we
yeah do we have it was a language called
X and it was created by this guy
so my first introduction to closure was
in actually trying to make my own
programming language and the fate of
that programming language I'll leave
that for a little bit later but as you
can see where there are no X conferences
happening but really we wanted to talk
about a language by this guy yeah so
we're gonna go back to 2005 which is
more than ten years ago but this is when
we when the first commit in the current
set of reposes is there and the initial
ones were in CVS so take yourself back
to a time when we checked code into CVS
and created projects on SourceForge and
and that's that's where closure got
started so lines of code a little hard
to know how to take these into account
but just we'll look at a couple more
numbers in a bit but the the peak right
before it was released was the twenty
one thousand lines of code
about half Java and half C sharp and
then just before release the C sharp
went away so it's interesting that that
originally the the C sharp runtime was
targeted equally the first actual
release and announcement came out that
the code was in a zip file and it had
12,000 lines of code and before today
that would end up growing by three times
the closure code was 582 lines
so a handful right and that grows fifty
times by today and 129 bars of course
they weren't bars yet because bars going
namespaces and there weren't namespaces
yet but there there were 129 symbols so
if you wanted to learn the entire
language that's how many you had to know
when it first came out this is a commit
from exactly 10 years ago today I don't
know how well you can see all that but
the the commit message is swapping : T's
keyword T for the letter T and in the
the smaller print there you can see that
until this point there was a global
variable named lowercase T that was
assigned a value out of the Java
interrupts layer and at this moment
it was removed and replaced with the
convention of using a keyword I think
this is interesting yesterday there was
a talk by Ariel Ortiz where he was
looking at the original Lisp
implementation by McCarthy and this was
one of the things that he had to call
out was that that there's this
convention of using symbol T and so this
is one of the steps where closure is
starting to take it slightly different
paths on some of these details no boli
ins yet this is um this is there's still
no support and closure for billions at
this point just the convention of using
truthy and non truthy things also words
they probably weren't used yet not yet
this was also the same day that the
function zip map was added that does the
pairwise building of a map so that was
ten years ago today what what closure
looked like
so in this era the 41.0 it was allowable
reasonable to rename function so I
thought it'd be fun to list some of the
old names of functions and see if
anybody could guess what names they
become so one of them nail it out yeah
yeah yeah oh yeah go ahead so curry
partial great guess no but hang on to
that we'll see
that's the only one here yes that's fine
so this this this release is kind of
interesting because this is just a just
a little month later and this is I just
I didn't distinctly remember this I had
to go back and look at my blog but this
is this is the first release of closure
that I got and checked out because going
back you this is this is really starting
to become a language that that we can
recognize right this it has things like
range mold amendments were in there and
and because I was creating my own
language at the time I wanted to was
exploring the landscape and at the time
I don't recall a lot of languages on on
the JVM but I just need to remember je
scheme I think that was Peter Norvig
implementation there was armed bear I
think even armed bear was back then and
a couple more but that's a common lisp
right that's right that's Congress and I
think even then back then it was very
low dot number is the only point zero
one or something like that and and so
well in creating my own language I
wanted to go and look and see how people
handle big numbers okay and so that's
how I came across cross closure and and
on the date 1024 I created a little blog
post my own little notes and that's the
first time that the word closure appears
on my on your blog that's cool
I don't I don't think I knew about
closure yet at this point I think it was
a little lady that I stumbled onto it
I'm sure that I downloaded it and then
forgot about it download a lot of things
so the language is growing as is Rich's
hair
so I don't know speaking of growing I
don't know we couldn't figure out
exactly when to fit this in but I we
wanted to mention that it was great that
guy Steele gave a talk last night and
one of my favorite technical conference
talks of all time was his growing a
language so the title of our talk is a
little homage that he had a lot more to
do with that talk than we had to do with
this language so we're just watching but
it's okay so 2008 we have some more
renames this is this is where we can
have yeah any any guesses as to what
bang is now called good good what about
select yeah it's like keys yeah so sort
of set this is this is almost unfair
some of these things are not the final
names obviously yeah to set maybe he was
closer to what you're thinking scan
that's good some no I don't I don't
think so
this is my favorite I think this touch
that's surely no see a little a little
unification of the names there we're
getting good ones and ass exports not
too shocking okay this one we got right
yeah contains the controversy begins
adding adding the question mark didn't
didn't didn't anything solve the problem
okay people were guessing this one
before Apple didn't eventually become
partial and of course we finally get
some boolean Xin there and these are all
by status before these are all before
1.0 so it's okay to make breaking
changes so in 2008 is that's that's
about the time that I really started
exploring closure I had downloaded and
run it and and you know found some good
things in the source code and so I was
really curious about trying it out but
at the time I had worked in a secure
facility and so to bring things into
this secure facility was a major pain
and so what I did is I had to fill out a
little form and write down all the live
paper form yeah paper form and write
down the libraries that I wanted to
bring into this secure facility and one
of the things that I wrote that was
closure jar and so my thinking at the
time was we can use this for testing and
so it's it's integration with Java and
and the ability to call it to Java
libraries I thought this is probably a
good way to to leverage this thing and
so I brought it in I managed to fill out
the form and this is not a this is not
exactly the ant task that we had used at
the time and that stuff is no under
locking pieces over yeah but this is in
the in the spirit of what what we were
trying to do with closure at the time
and we did we did I I wrote some test
code I don't know that it was fully
appreciated at the time doing that but
in my spare time I started up a series
of blog posts about porting
on Lisp - closure and so my first blog
post I did this this funny thing I think
it's kind of funny I thought I can't
change any values I don't know how to
change values so what I did is I if you
see in the code if you hopefully you can
see the code is I created a one element
array with a zero in the in the array
and so I closed over that and then the
counter I just just modified that one
little piece a mutable cell there yeah
and and I thought it was being clever
yeah and some guy named Chris Houser was
the first person to ever comment on on
that blog post and he said you know I
think it's really cool that what you did
there but that's not how you do an
enclosure there's this closure expert
explaining to me how this is done I
think that's just that's so cool and
being 2008 that means I had been aware
of closure for probably like two weeks
and was ready to dispense advice Oh
so yes I wanted to talk about this this
is around the same time that I actually
contributed something to closure that
I'm still proud of and that is the reg X
literal syntax so you can see there on
the left the way it was at the time and
after you know collecting input from the
community and advocating for a position
and posting patches and rationale and
all those things we had this major shift
over to what you see on the right so at
the time when you say got feedback from
the community this is the mailing list
yeah yeah yeah you were conversing with
oh I don't know there was maybe hundreds
hundreds I mean so I think there were
fewer people that were using it that
were inactive in the context right
almost anybody that was using closure I
think was was probably conversing on the
mailing list um so yeah
I'm glad you appreciate as well I
it doesn't look big on the slide but I
think you know that's a lot of slashes
if you don't do that so and I think it's
also interesting because the amount of
weed there there was an anal on the
thread of people actually communicating
on this particular topic there was there
probably was you know half dozen dozen
people but there it's it's not a short
thread it was a substantial amount of
discussion spanning in total multiple
months and of course the change is looks
like a three line change to the code but
you know you have to you have to be
careful about these breaking changes
right that's right speaking of breaking
changes mmm one of the little syntax
pieces that I'm personally responsible
for is the the use of - dot - to access
all of the fields the fields yeah and so
that interestingly enough that that may
be the first time that I'm jumping ahead
a little bit yes the first time that
close your script okay
2009 here okay so this is the this is
the closure 1.0 2009 and so I have a
graph here and there's there's two
triangles and one sort of in the middle
and one on the right that you can see
there the the one in the middle is for
the the initial release and then the one
on the right represents 1.0 so there was
actually several releases in between
there but they were all pretty 1.0 so I
didn't try to list them all and I don't
know I tried to just show sort of the
the growth of the language and and so we
on most of those lines are stacked lines
of code so you can see on the very left
the the yellow and blue together are the
Java and c-sharp and then right before
the first release you can see that the
c-sharp disappears and even the Java is
trimmed back some but just a matter of
weeks a week or two before that first
triangle you can see the Green Line
starting to come up those are the number
of bars or
or var like simple things and those that
has of course has a different scale
there on the right of the graph but it's
interesting to me that that it really
was just a week or two before the first
release that the first dot clj file
showed up in the repo and got those
first hundred or so symbols but then
over the next you know that next year
it's growing quite a bit in a number of
symbols and and lines of code and by the
time 1.0 came out it was already four
hundred fifty bars in the in the
namespace so just the breadth the the
seriousness of the language was starting
to really really settle in mr. furious
times there was there was a lot going on
a lot of changes you know that's the
span where all these renames are
happening and and fundamental things
like multi methods showing up and yeah
so it was exciting times to be paying
attention to the language um oh and I
have a little note here it was it was
just a couple months after that 1.0
release that the words closure cons
referring to a conference showed up in
the IRC logs so it was still another I
guess a year before the conference
actually happened but people started
talking about it and I don't know if
it's ever been called anything other
than the cons so it is
so skipping ahead to 2010 it was
speaking of the conch this is this is
the year that the conch oh okay yeah and
so interestingly enough for me I have
given the first talk ever
so you open to the open they open the
conference and I it wasn't the first
talk that I had ever given but it was my
first closure talk and to give a talk
about a language when the language
creator is in the audience I know what
you mean and I distinctly remember at
the time that I I was so nervous that I
spoke probably 1.75 times faster than I
should have and the talk was over in 18
minutes it was a good one though I bet
you have you gone back to look at it and
just put it just just scale back the
speed oh yeah you can do it right on
youtube and yeah 2011 the year of
closure script yeah it's hard to imagine
now that the closure script has been
around since 2011 yeah I distinctly
remember when we first started talking
about it at relevance at the time and we
were discussing rich was discussing
about what what is what the goals could
be for this thing and who could who
should we bring in to to help with this
thing
and I I know at the time that everyone
was in favor of having yourself come in
you were not an employee of relevance
right you came in and joined us on these
weekly calls yeah it was that was an
interesting it was an interesting
process to be it was it was run like
almost like an agile team right like a
weekly stand-up and but there was a few
of us from outside the company I got to
join yourself and I think Chaz was
involved David Nolan definitely right
and actually if you look at the the
commit logs for we're still there we're
still number five in number seven that's
good but all of that stuff is sort of
front loaded right yes is when closure
the compiler was maybe a thousand lines
that's right that's I think I think rich
likes to joke that it was it was small
and tidy and then he handed it to us but
it was it was a lot of fun and and we
did a lot of cool things early on but I
think really the turning point for
clojurescript was came a little bit
later on in that year with this commit
and this is mm they would no long
the even Nolan's first come in to
closure script and I think I think it's
maybe it goes without saying but I'm
going to say it anyway that coming on to
closure script is probably the most
important thing that ever happened
absolutely I mean look at that for a
first commit I'll just add reify yeah we
show you how it's done
yeah and and it's just amazing how David
is shepherded that and and not only
David right I mean he's been he's had
help from
yes as well I mean and Antonio gave a
talk yesterday yep
very important yeah yeah and and
starting then but yeah for the next
several years clear script grew and
changed in in many dramatic ways we
don't have a whole lot of details in
this talk but Antonia did give a good
overview of the last few years his 2012
10 or 12 so you know at this point the
language is not growing in size quite so
rapidly but there are still interesting
and important things happening so we'll
sort of go through some of these
releases reader literals you know so
even I don't know maybe I don't know if
anybody else has this perspective but at
least for me at this point a lot of
these things these features seem recent
to me they do they feel recent and but
they're not right this isn't so reader
liberals have been there for that's that
five years now so and then yeah so yeah
I'd mentioned that now this is really
the first time right so just informed
closure right and the reason was what
because in JavaScript there's what you
can hold in an object's field can be it
could be a function or it can be a value
and so you can never really tell so you
have to have when you refer to it do you
want do what the function that's sitting
there do you want to go get the value
yeah and so we devised this little
syntax that allows you to say I want the
property yeah I want to pull out the
property and that was critical for
closure script yeah not critical for
closure that's right but in order to
decide the language yeah so that's great
and I don't think I don't recall anyone
ever complaining that it broke them but
it had the potential to breaks
yeah it did it's in the it's in the
release notes as a as a breaking change
so that you know before that I suppose
technically you could refer to a Java
field with I guess a dash in the
beginning of the name I don't even know
if you can make such a function like
this
yeah Ritchie's shaking his head so
that's that's enough it was listed as a
breaking change oh so yeah you got to be
careful because was it the closure
implementation was buggy in one six
that's okay it's it's all still in the
slides so you know that's all in the
past it's fixed now that's all we need
to know you could probably blame me for
that bug reducers says a year later 2013
one point five reducers the new
threading macros that's the arrow sum
and era when and I guess it's not called
somehow I yeah you even have the old
name for that one my head because these
are so recent these changes closure one
six Interop for Java programs calling
into closure namespaced keywords so here
you can see more sort of cross outside
in yeah outside influence going around
because that's a thing that's most
important for diatomic or at least if
not influence in the in the syntax the
just the thought processes that are
going on it's almost as if the same
person was thinking about all these
things at the same time yeah some deep I
didn't I didn't note I was making these
slides that if some is a thing
people use if some that's great rich
likes people to raise their hands to
raise your hand if you music that's
great no I'm sure we'll use it now that
I know about it
transducers says 1.7 2015 we're getting
a little closer to modern times here
and reader conditionals so again more
closure script influenced synergy I
guess right there you can now not only
Kimmy is it possible to write code that
works in both languages but you can
starting to be serious tooling support
for that 1.8 and direct linking so I
guess the closure is that the closure
core itself is direct linked right I
don't know if people raise your hand
does anybody use direct linking outside
of closure core itself a couple that's
great for performance right that the
that's the main purpose so that's great
one of those may be infrequently used
features that's important for certain
contexts this socket repla I think that
that I don't see a lot of people using
that either although I think that it's
somewhat of an important step in that
prior to that the way that people could
communicate you know via their tools is
to sort of call out to this this server
mmm this middleware that and now this is
sort of bringing the idea of having this
interactive repple environment in
process yeah so yeah well I guess
without having to either provide your
own your own middleware like you said or
be in charge of watching the process so
I'm sure we'll see more tooling
supporter on that
okay so this is this is that same graph
as before but up through up through well
not today but a few weeks ago when I
made the graph so you can see more
triangles as there's more releases lines
of code is growing number of ours is
growing we're up to the 600's now of of
ours it's not you know I was we were
talking about this yesterday that those
of us that were around in the 1.0 era
think of closure as a small language and
and it is it is but it's not as small as
we think anymore it's quite a bit bigger
I think it's it's somewhat interesting
that between this this 2008 area and
2004 the mid 2009 I suppose it's really
the number of VARs just shot up yeah
from 221 to 458 yeah exciting times a
lot was going on and and since then not
not as much rapid growth right so would
you say the closure is dying
well the no so here's the thing if you
want to look at just the language itself
right you can you can look at in a
perspective that does but I I did made
another graph and there's a lot of
closure code out there but even just the
officially supported they're not even
it's officially supported but the code
that's hosted on the github comm
organization right so there's lots of
important libraries and we'll get to
that a little bit later but but just the
ones that are on on the github you can
see that that's almost linear you can
see actually it's kind of interesting to
me that there's while the language was
still changing rapidly the the
contraband other libraries have not
taken off yet but right around the time
2009 when that's starting to taper off
the community support for just reach
into other domains shoots up and so you
can see the the green layer there is
closure script starting to layer on top
you can see the the C sharp while the C
sharp is at the beginning it dropped off
but closure CLR is as the band at the
very top showing up and growing steadily
through this time type closure and and
all the rest of contribs who there's a
lot of of activity in the community and
running through the whole thing at that
that bottom blue layer is the language
itself they're changing but not growing
rapidly and so I think it depends on how
you look at it if you you know these
days we're working on I'm working on a
team that's building large pieces of
closure code built on top of this same
foundation and I for one am pretty happy
that the language is not changing quite
as rapidly as it was in the pre 1.0 days
so I think it depends on your
perspective I think which which parts
you choose to look at it so
so what in this time 10 years later we
can take a moment to reflect back about
the things that we thought we were
getting when we first came into closure
and never discovered it and now 10 years
later what did we actually get yeah and
so when when we first started exploring
closure we thought we were getting a
hobby language yeah and so that's that's
that's what I used it for and that's the
way I viewed it but now 10 years later
what I actually got
was the language that I can base a
career on yeah and interestingly enough
I think it it happened before now but
closure I think recently or cross the
threshold where there are people in this
room that can spend the rest of their
career writing closure code hmm yeah I
think that's really interesting but
before I started learning closure I had
learned new languages and sort of jumped
from one to the next every couple years
and assumed the same thing would happen
with closure that I would learn the
lessons and move on but I'm still
learning things and we just we just
found that's
so that back ban I recall that there was
a it was a video or yeah I couldn't
remember what I have images in my head
of seeing rich talking about a six
hundred core machine but I couldn't find
any video so maybe but there's there's a
little chat on IRC of
I think was at a JavaOne conference
maybe where cliff click had these as
little machines with J with 600 cores
and how pleased rich was to run some
kind of album off as the anti demo or a
different one that was driving all 600
CPUs to 100% and making good use of the
machine and at the time I really wanted
one yeah of course and we knew you know
we hit we had the Intel timelines and
these these these massively multi-core
machines were coming and and so what do
we have now as soon as they show up its
I guess I guess a four core machine in
my pocket is a yeah no no not really
don't have to do it'll have to do but
we're ready closures ready to go as soon
as we have all six under course so I had
mentioned that I wanted to use closure
when I really started thinking about how
to use it I wanted to use it because of
its access to job we had written just a
mountain of code Java code yeah probably
a million lines of code that we were we
were maintaining and so to test that
levered say you test that I wanted to
yes closure in that way and so
finally taking that that step to to use
it for real beyond a hobby context yeah
that's what I said this is where I
thought it would end great this is a
tool for testing how quickly I can do it
interactively but interestingly nearly
enough
yeah lots of closure libs now as well so
we still have I mean we're seeing talks
during this conference of people still
leveraging new Java libs from-from
closure but we have a lot of libraries
of our own now so I went to the closure
toolbox website and this isn't all of
them and there are no repeats on this
slide so there's a lot of activity in
the in the closure library ecosystem so
many categories and so many options in
each category to choose from and at the
beginning when we didn't even have
support for loading in love files from
you know coding code loading in code
from enough from a namespaced file or
anything like that to imagine that we
would have this much of our own code in
our own community was is stunning to
realize so so what did we think we were
getting well in the beginning it was a
warm and welcoming language and I think
that a lot of that had to do with the
fact that very early on rich sort of set
the tone for the way the language the
way to interact with each other um we
didn't talk about this before but I
think this is a good time to mention
that if you go if you I do have logs for
the IRC and they're there online you can
look for him from the time that I joined
the channel because that's when I
started keeping the logs and if you go
back to that first day you can see me
showing up saying like I think my
program ran but I'm not sure I can tell
if it finished or not and Rich's in the
room you know right there and I didn't
realize he was the creator but it was
like friendly and welcoming and okay
something really stands out to me it
from that time and and there were there
were many discussions and and sometimes
they would get heated and but there was
always a
tone but there was one discussion I
think it was between Chazz Emmerich and
and rich that got a little heated and
maybe one in a direction that rich was
uncomfortable with it was the first or
second conch hmm
before rich gave his talk he took a
moment and apologized publicly to Chazz
I thought I had never seen anything like
that yeah that was I think it's
important because we all you know we we
do make mistakes and if you choose to
ignore it or defend yourself or whatever
it's impossible to heal from those
situations right and it would have been
entirely easy to either ignore it and
move on or to apologize personally which
would have been sure sufficient but rich
took the you know personally risky
choice to stand up as physical and a
representation of this community as you
can get and and call it out and address
it directly and and that's an embodiment
I think of the way that the community
has gone and it's a community that is
trying to get better yeah and it
continues to work on it continues to
work long yeah identifies it that that
sometimes there are issues that we need
to work on it so I'm proud to be a part
of that yeah
so back then we thought we were getting
some great concurrency primitives yeah
and we did I mean they were there right
yeah software transactional memory yeah
I use reps all the time so aside from
code examples in the book I don't think
I sold Stuart's here or use it once yeah
and that that's maybe the only time yeah
so it's good they're there but maybe
when the 600 core machines show up yet
maybe we'll need them then I don't know
that's what I've been waiting for that's
right agents yeah yeah okay but it's not
like the dominant mechanism in our code
base is right it's right better that's
really what we needed that was thus we
needed all the super powerful
concurrency primitives yes of Adams
Adams that's very useful oh yeah I use
them all the time so finally in this
sort of retrospective we thought
eventually once we move past this hobby
the view of it as a hobby language
though okay it's a programming tool
something I can use in my tests but
really I think that it became a lot more
than that and for me closure became a
lens I've said this in a couple of talks
but two lands for viewing how to
construct programs how to design systems
architect systems yeah I think the thing
for me that that was really has really
changed my thinking because of closure
is is the separation of the parts of of
object-oriented programming at the time
I was pretty proud of my own abilities
to use object-oriented principles to
design solutions but it wasn't until
the the mechanisms enclosure allowed me
to see how you can separate inheritance
from multi method dispatch and separate
that from you know data yeah your data
doesn't have to live in your code in
order to have inheritance you know those
kinds of things and and that ability to
think about it in those pieces extends
way beyond just the the programming
problems but into large level system
design where they maybe even have a more
positive impact thinking about where you
keep your data versus where you keep
your code and where the code executes
and how that that those things can be
separated so that's been hugely
influential and in lots of systems
designs that I've had to impact on so
instead of a programming tool maybe it's
safe to say that the discovery of
closure was transformational yeah I'm
sorry so what about what about the next
ten years well rich has given us this
tool and it's a tool that we can use to
create the systems and even the language
that we want so we you know we don't
have to wait rich if you want to do
something it's there and we can leverage
it so yeah next ten years up to you so
we have thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
