great ideas are so obvious in hindsight
so let's explore this when John McCarthy
created Lisp he created around the list
abstraction the list abstraction was
very innovative at the time it allowed
for powerful natural recursion and
common access to data but the list
abstraction was a leaky abstraction the
console that was the part of the list
link list implementation was very
visible to the user and this limited its
applicability in creating closure rich
re-envisioned Lisp around the sequence
abstraction the sequence abstraction
trades the car and cutter of the console
for first and rest of a sequence derived
from the data structure he applied this
to lists vectors maps and sets and also
whatever sort of data type you wanted to
create as long as you create the
sequence abstraction now I want to
highlight the difference between the
data interface which is on the left and
that the data implementations which are
listed on the right the persistent tree
map is one that stuck out to me how many
people here are familiar with the
persistent tree map more than I expected
but not that many more people will
probably know it by its other name
sorted map sorted map is always given me
server problem it's a great data
structure there's also a sorted set
which I'm gonna live for for time but
these data structures provide persistent
maps and sets with keys returned in
order and prescribed by a sorting
function but the problem I have is every
time somebody says sorted map I here
sorted map
now I think we know where this is going
no closure talk would be complete
without a definition and so here we are
sorted involving ignoble actions and
motives arousing moral distaste and
contempt so what would a sorted map be
well it would be a data structure of
corrupted values so we have many
features one of them is data compression
lossy data compression really when it
gets full it just stops accepting new
values it's also just plain lossy values
go in values come out and they're
similar but they're not the same values
now don't worry it's typesafe sorted map
so we'll never change the type of the
data values you put in and moreover its
spec compliant if you create a sorted
map with a specified closure spec it
will mangle the values according to
something that would comply with the
spec it's also also often immutable I
think in closure we get too comfortable
with immutability so sorted maps will at
their discretion mutate ancestors and to
protect you from the horror of this
sorted maps provide a developer friendly
interface when you print them out they
print the values that you'd expect and
they reserve the corrupted values for
programmatic access so believe it or not
there is an impress implementation of
sorted maps I welcome any contributors
to add their detractions I mean
enhancements to the implementation so I
think we can all agree that this is
clearly the missing piece of closure
well perhaps it's not the missing piece
of closure and perhaps not so obvious
but many of the insights and features
that are in closure weren't obvious
before a closure was created and perhaps
this is an odd way to say thanks but
there's a tremendous amount of insight
that went into closure and so hopefully
by abusing the language I was able to
highlight the features and insights that
closure offers so I want to thank rich
for the personal sacrifice the hammock
time the insight the persistence and the
care that he has put in to making
closure so thank you rich
