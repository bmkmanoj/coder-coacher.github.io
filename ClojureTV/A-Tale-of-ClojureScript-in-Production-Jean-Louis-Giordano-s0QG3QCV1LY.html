talk to you about using transcript in
production so let's find out and what
I'm going to tell you is our journey
from rails to clear script I'm going to
talk a bit about who we are and what we
try to achieve when we got started and I
would like to also talk about how it was
like to introduction introduce closure
script in our company and at the end I
will just go through the takeaways from
this experience and I'd like to mention
that this journey was not particularly
epic they were like no battles of fights
or great victories it was more of a
mindful walk with many small steps we
took always trying to be aware of
ourselves and our pain points it was
full of many small surprises and
happiness I am extremely happy both
being here today but also with the whole
journey so I hope I can convey some of
those feelings today during this
presentation I won't have time to cover
everything I wanted to say but this talk
is extremely meta so of course you can
see that the slides are implementation
our demonstration of how we write our
closure script code in production so if
you're curious about some things you can
look them up I just made this repository
open source right now
so you can look it up on github I have a
ton of cool metal slides that are
implemented in themselves so you can
look it up who we are
simpler we're a small Swedish company
founded in 2012 we're very small 27
employees at this point 7 developers and
2 designers and we build a mobile
payment solution I'm going to show you
quickly how it looks like today
the way our system works is that
merchants will include our solution on
their webpage and when the user wants to
make a payment they will go through our
checkout if the demo gods are with me oh
yes so this is this square here is our
checkout that's how it looks like today
returning to our script so the user will
put in their phone number and they
receive an SMS on a mobile that they
input and then they get to choose
between paying by bill or by card and if
you choose by bill you will confirm your
personal information and you will
receive an invoice from your bank so
here this success box here would be the
merchants own success implementation
like it's outside of a control after
that so that's just to give you an idea
of the product we've built using clutter
script to give you an idea of the scale
of our project as well as I mentioned
earlier with seven developers and two
designers we are available in two
countries Sweden and Finland and also
across three locales so that's one
aspect you have to consider we have
about 7,000 active users and about
60,000 euros worth of payments every day
so it's not Google but you know as
honest numbers here and you see that
about 10 percent of our code today is
closure script the rest is Ruby on Rails
fun fact we have about as much CSS code
as we have true script code today so
just shoot out the designers out there
you're very important so the beginning
of our journey that was 18 months ago we
had three Ruby on Rails apps
introduction one of them was our old
check out so we already had a check out
running in production at the time
um spoilers that's where we introduce
the critter scripts later on and at that
time we just hired our first full-time
designer other company and we were
planning to add a lot of new features to
our checkout in particular new payment
methods which would require massive
changes and a lot more branching in our
checkout flow the thing is we were not
happy with the status quo with keeping
doing stuff the way we did in rails part
of the reason was that we had a lot of
braided flow state and view logic which
is a bit intrinsic to the idea Matic way
of doing things in rails it was a
particularly painful for this
application because our checkout is very
much a step through wizard kind of thing
which is not very easy to implement in
out-of-the-box with rails on top of that
we started to have very slow running
tests about ten minutes to run the whole
test suite and developers ended up being
the bottleneck to any change to the
checkout in particular if designers
wanted to get in and make a small visual
change developers would have to come in
and help with the template language we
were using so we set out at the
beginning with the goal to get a new
more flexible solution and I can handle
all the upcoming features we wanted to
implement while at the same time
addressing some of the pain points we
had earlier given that we're a payment
solution like we were we had a few
constraints to begin with so we were
aiming for high availability we're a
service that's consumed by third parties
and downtime on our side will affect all
our customers and their customers on top
of that we really wanted to choose a
solution with an acceptable barrier of
entry both for designers and developers
so if we choose a new technology we'd
have to be accessible from the beginning
why we wanted to get that is because we
were playing to hire more people
and it was important for us that they
don't get overwhelmed by a cord or our
architecture and we were hoping for them
to be able to hit the ground running
we were also focusing very much on
keeping a simple development environment
when we use rails you got a very simple
setup you do rails new and you got
everything in place and you don't have
to worry about the infrastructure of
your development machine so we wanted to
keep that and on top of that each
writing faster is really important for
us we try to keep being agile even after
four years as a start-up so for us it
was extremely critical to get fast and
simple deploys as well so what was our
plan we already on other rails app so we
thought let's just break out all the
view and flow logic out of the back end
and into a single page application that
would run in the browser and we would
just turn the existing rails application
into a pure jisun REST API so visually
this is how it looks like at the top
this was were our existing application
where all the logic was basically in the
backend and then the server just sent
ready-made HTML to the browser directly
so was not very interactive we couldn't
run that much things in the browser and
what we were planning to do is move the
flow and the logic into the broader so
we could do some inline validations for
instance and then talk to the backing
back-end using a JSON REST API so
spoiler for the single page application
we chose to use it to use clear script
so why closure script well to be truly
honest we had a bias to begin with we
had two developers that we're interested
in closure and there were a lot of
uncertainties at a time that was one and
a half years ago but we believe that
closure suite would be a good fit for us
and our goals we considered many options
and
we acknowledge that there's probably
many more good actor natives to this
solid to this kind of problem but we
really wanted to explore this track as
an option
um so once we had this kind of feeling
that curse-free will be a good fit we
try to sell it to our colleagues and I
think the strongest selling point is
compared to JavaScript closure script
provides simply much better semantics if
you know JavaScript equality through the
nests and scoping our complex things in
JavaScript and that out of the box is
much better with your script clearer
script also provides just namespacing if
you worked with a big enough codebase
you know that name spacing and
modularity is really important and it's
not something yet out of the box from
JavaScript you get dead code elimination
and a big standard library all thanks to
the Google closure compiler so that was
also like battery included from the very
beginning on top of that it was a fairly
safe bet
since closure script offers seamless
JavaScript Interop so you could use any
existing JavaScript library from closure
script which felt like okay in the worst
case we have an escape hatch by using
just existing JavaScript library or even
writing some code in JavaScript if we
need to and one really useful thing with
CRO script is just static name
resolution if you can at compile time
find out if if a variable is defined or
not that's like if you if you felt that
power it's very hard to go away from it
you'll notice that functional
programming per se was neither a selling
point nor hurdle for us first of all we
were fairly familiar with functional
programming concepts as we were reading
writing Ruby code in a fairly functional
way already but it didn't really enter
into consideration when we sold the IDE
to our colleagues
and finally we run a two-week experiment
showcasing how we could build a precious
tree top and at the end of it we held
the presentation and Code walkthrough so
that all our colleagues could understand
our motivation and see what kind of
power working at Whistler Script so
after we sold the idea of triangular
script we started with phase one I
wanted to put some kind of avenger'
quote but I am out of time so nevermind
so the first phase was we took a few
steps and many small steps to work going
to production and the first step is of
course building a prototype the way we
did it is our designer newly hired
started to work on pure HTML and CSS
mock-up
completely static they didn't wait for
us developers to set up any particular
infrastructure for them they just hit
the ground running where there are
unfamiliar tools to develop HTML and CSS
in parallel and developers worked on the
core functionality of the application
that is setting up the basic
infrastructure for API calls deploy
scripts and tests and also our
application needs a lot of state
management because of all the KH cases
we have with the payment solutions so
this this back-end of the front end of I
like to call it that nobody likes it but
I like it the back head of the front end
could be developed separately from the
actual rendering logic which was present
neat and the way we did it was the whole
state of the application was contained
in a single atom and the view ended up
being just a pure function of that state
so we were working like that on two
parallel tracks tracks and in the end we
just came together using a library
called and focus and n focus is
something that can take pure HTML as
template and add dynamic content to it
so that was very powerful thing that
from the very beginning we were able to
work in
parallel and come together and not waste
any cycles in our prototyping so here is
how the code look that look like at the
top is the pure HTML file that the
designers were able to write on their
own and at the bottom is the closure
script code that adds dynamic content to
it this whole slide is of course oh
c'mon
yeah live reloadable so that the thing
that I just demonstrated is of course
because we introduced feet wheel as the
library so every time you save a file
the closure script will be recompiled
and uploaded into the browser so you get
a very interactive experience and the
nice thing about fin wheel and that we
mentioned that earlier in this talk that
you don't need any special tool for that
you can use your own editor you just
change your clear script code and it
will compile and you can see the change
immediately we took the same approach
for running tests there is this cool
library called lane and do and it does
the same thing it will watch for file
changes recompile your script and run
the test automatically for you in the
background again no special integration
for an in your test extremely nice
besides those two tools we use also a
tool that was brought in bar our
designers which is browser sync and it's
a purely JavaScript tooling library that
provides a server that will do automatic
page reload when some of your file
changes the nice thing there is that
designers could do their work without
having to care at all about clear script
like our weird UFO in the backyard they
don't have to look at this and I think
so the takeaway from this is that if you
can show us the super show super crisp
feedback loop without any special
tooling it made us super happy and
productive from the very beginning
very early on sadly not everything was
rosin pinky because once we started to
test this application on small device
turned out that manipulating the dome
directly was super slow but we really
liked the way we wrote the application
having the whole state in one place and
then deriving the view from that state
so we're wondering can we keep that
logic but just speed up the rendering
and at that time there was this cool
library called react it seemed to
address exactly this issue we were a bit
worried because it seemed to be pretty
big so we didn't want to introduce it
too early but since we felt that okay
this is starting to get a pain point and
we do not want to optimize our rendering
rendering logic
maybe react could be a good fit for us
so we wrote out our options and we
settled for a library called regions and
that's the Kuro script library that
wraps react into a idiomatic closure
basically and another nice thing is that
this there is this other library called
qiyu that basically does exactly what
Enfocus did with us by adding the
dynamic content to HTML but what it did
is it took raw HTML and compile it into
regions data structures so this is how
it looks like at the top it's the same
HTML as before but at the bottom it's
almost the same code except this one
compiles down to react data structures
which is pretty powerful nice thing is
that we introduced react completely
painlessly and in a manner that was
transparent to the designers actually
because they were able to keep working
with the same old boring HTML and CSS
I say boring just as a reference from
the earlier I'm not saying as bad as
good so we had a working application
that's fast enough and the basic
features we needed so we were ready for
phase 2 which
is going to production before we could
go live there was a bunch of boring
things we had to take care of first of
all given we were available in two
countries and with free locales we have
to take care of localization from the
very beginning the solution we used is
this collaborative tool called
phrase app which means that anybody can
go in and change the text and then you
just have to pull the change in your
application and that's it we use it
together with a library called tower you
can just look it up but provides
localization features for chloro script
closure and travel script something we
didn't think about from the very
beginning is cash posting so if you do
front-end development you know that
cache invalidation is an issue or
surprise the way to solve that is to
rename all your Sata's your assets with
a new oral that contains md5 of their
contents so that when you fetch a URL is
always uniquely as linked with a
specific version of your assets not
something I was thinking about when I
got started but a program we had to
solve before going live we also of
course had to implement some kind of
deploying scripts which we use ansible
for details but good to know there's
ways to do things also it was taken care
of SSL Certificates
we saw that using CloudFront so we
didn't have to deal with too many things
we use honeybadger
for error logging so that was pretty
nice when we get an exception in the
front end application we just upload it
to a third party so we can look at it
afterward spoiler since the whole state
in a single atom you can upload it to
your error logger and you can very
quickly quickly debug what went wrong of
course we had to add the usual
continuous integration tool so we use
trayvis for that which means every time
we push our code to our github
repository the tests will be run
automatically and we make sure to run
a full battery of cross-browser testing
using sauce labs so after we took care
of all those details we actually went
live with a minimum viable product it
took us three months to get there from
the first commit to actually going live
and from there on we were able to focus
on adding new features
sadly annouce we got some random errors
in production on the iPhone for quickly
looking at the error it appears to be
something to do with hash look up logic
and sadly it took us a whole week of
debugging to figure out what it was and
the crazy thing is it has nothing to do
with our code I was talking to do with
JavaScript it has to do with the way the
JIT compiler is broken on certain
hardware of the iPhone and annoying
thing with JIT compiler bugs is that
when you use the Safari inspector it
turns off the JIT compiler so it's kind
of a nightmare to debug anyway we did a
workaround on project you can wrap
pieces of code in a try-catch and it
will decide disable the JIT compiler for
that piece of code fun fact
so that's how we sold it and just to be
fair like this was our biggest time sink
and the biggest problem we had we spent
a whole week debugging it was not our
fault it was not fair Script schools it
was some hardware problem but still I
mean if it happens to you come to me we
have a workaround with try-catch um ok
and we had this setup and was nice and
everything but our designers were not
extremely happy with their own tooling
basically we just patch things together
using make files and bit of scripts here
and there so by the designers request we
introduced a new tool called gulp and
Gope is a JavaScript build tool and task
runner
for JavaScript it's like kind of like
lame again but for node.js and the cool
thing with go in our case is that it
helped us integrating with a ton of
extra javascript tooling that's not
necessarily available from within
closure script we used it to compile the
sass into CSS if you familiar with this
thing or even just minify CSS and we use
it to do the cash posting of our assets
also it's nice because it can run tasks
in parallel very easily so we were able
to add a bunch of quick hacks to our
workflow using that also in our
experience and I'm talking about a year
ago and clever script and Linnaean have
not been super great at handling non
closure script tooling for instance sass
compilation using lane again was fairly
slow and also we took quite a lot of
time to boot so I'm thinking I'm talking
about a few seconds of course but it was
frustrating to our designers there
they're used to using tool that are
sub-second from this from the very
beginning like you have a sass file you
want to compile it you don't want to
wait 10 second for it and also the sass
compiler kind of crushed you every now
and then when we're using perl script so
in the end using gulp instead of doing
everything in closure script helped us a
lot at least for the approval of our
designers and then of course we did a
bunch of other cool things like I
mentioned earlier we upload the whole
app States on when we get an error in
the browser so we get the user agents so
we know what kind of hardware the code
was running on and then we know exactly
the state the application was in when it
failed
later on we hacked together rebel driven
tests using fig wheel and this is the
part that you know we still get the
ripple driven
using free will without any special
integration with our editor of course
you have to type a bit more if you don't
have a browser engine editor integration
but still it works pretty nice what's
pretty cool and also since we have the
whole state in a single at home we
couldn't resist
but implement full-blown time-travelling
debugger right that's the first thing
you do when you see your whole out state
explicitly so I'm gonna I'm gonna make a
quick demo of that just because it's
cool so this is the same page earlier
but if you scroll down on that page
you'll notice that we have a bunch of
developers helper tools like I can go
directly to a given state by clicking a
button so then it will just take us
through this particular state you can
interact with the forum of course and
you can see that at the bottom of this
page the whole state is dumped in the
Dom to let you know exactly what how we
derived the view from that site and the
state contains actually here the current
view with nuclear payment and the forum
values are okay remember true and that's
kind of nice and and you can navigate
all the previous slides very easily
since they're all super explicitly you
just have to keep a list of them and
then you can navigate back in time and
see every single sub state things that
might go too fast in your real
application to focus on like this state
here
this is a state where we are waiting for
a server to respond right it's very nice
to be able to get back to that state
from your tools and of course once
you're done you can just resume
execution and keep interacting with it
okay
so that's basically where we're at now
we've been using the setup for a year in
production we feel that we've reduce
overall complexity especially since we
break broke apart a big chunk of complex
logic into two smaller chunks seems
obvious but it did it did reduce the
complexity and we were indeed able to
implement all the feature we set out to
implement from the beginning so mission
accomplished
so from their own looking at the future
turns out that our designer want to do
more than what HTML and CSS allow them
to do and turns out they're not super
interested in learning closure script
either if you spend most of your time
programming then it makes sense to deep
deep into programming knowledge to
improve your own skills towards that
direction to make you a better
programmer but if we're being honest
learning closure script will not make
them big better designers this is a
separate skill set so we've been looking
at some of the alternatives we have and
we are thinking maybe we can have the
templates as separate JavaScript
dependencies in particular we've been
looking at using reacts GSX
template language while still keeping
the whole back-end of the front end
written closure scripts to control the
flow and the state of the application so
we have a proof of concept ready using
that with live reload and all the good
stuff we have I have a slide implemented
in that later on if I have time I can
show you so wrapping up I'd like to go
over some of the conclusion we reached
during this experience there's a few bad
things and color script was out of our
comfort zone at the beginning so there
was a certain learning cost upfront and
I'm not only talking about learning the
language but learning the ecosystem
takes time to be aware of all the
options that are available there not as
many as in JavaScript so in that sense
it was much easier to get into clear
script than in would have been to get in
modern JavaScript development but still
a little cost also tooling set up like
the overhead is still significant for
things that are not directly cloris
ripped I mean if you just want a clearer
script running in production with only
developers then you get fig wheel and
that's you get everything out of the box
like laying new fig wheel you got a
things that's very close to be
production already but if you start to
factor in more things like designers and
extra toolings you need when your
application is a bit more complex then
you have a bit more setup to to to fix
and of course this iphone 4 hardware bug
i mentioned it earlier i just want to
make you aware that it exists it has
been a big-time cost for us but we did
find a workaround and it might not even
be relevant to you I mean it just turned
out that some of our users some of our
important users had the broken iPhone
maybe you don't have that problem anyway
just in case you get those weird error
in productions maybe it's not your fault
all in all we didn't regret any of our
drawers of our choices were very happy
and very happy with where we are today
there was a lot of good things first of
all it made me love front-end work which
was not a given from the beginning like
I was scared of doing front-end stuff
and being afraid turned out - snarky
remarks and you know dismissing odd is a
ton of complexity in the front-end does
this Jas fatigue I don't want to get
their model of the fact is I just didn't
know how to do things and then I got in
using closure script and now I'm like
yeah this is not it's not that hard
there's a lot of things going on but
just chews away and
one small step at a time by being aware
of your pain points you will get there
also I really love the way we
organically grew our projects our
Minimum Viable Product was all contained
within a single namespace a single file
or script and then we just added more
routes and we're like oh this starts to
get a lot of rodding going on maybe we
just break the routing namespace into a
separate file you know we didn't have
from the beginning the need to
architecture our whole application we
didn't even know what we wanted to do
but using clutter script it was really
nice to see that yeah just small step
just only add abstraction when you need
them only add structure when you need
them as awesome and also at the end of
the day people got empowered and both
developers and designers there were
getting more things done faster and it's
really great feeling in particular like
our designers are now able to design
implement and deploy their own av-test
without having to touch a single line of
closure script or anything they just use
a bit of markup in the HTML and that's
it it's really cool so I think that's
all I have for today so I'd like to
thank you all for having me here and in
particular I'd like to thank Lynn for
the logistic and organization was
awesome I'd like to thank me how that
helped me with mentoring me on those
slides and gave me very good feedback
and all of my simpler colleagues for
this awesome journey together so thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
