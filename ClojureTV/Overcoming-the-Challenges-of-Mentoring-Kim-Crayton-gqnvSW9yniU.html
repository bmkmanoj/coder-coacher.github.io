interaction I need you to energize me so
mine this talk is overcoming the
challenges of mentoring successful
mentoring doesn't just happen it's
planned Who am I i am kim creighton i
have a website jr dev mentoring com i am
at twitter at Kim Creighton one and then
i have jr devynn mentoring i regularly
contribute to a it's like a one sentence
or a daily monday through friday what I
call mentoring minute where I'm giving
some information about learning
mentoring newbies that kind of thing and
I'm also currently pursuing a doctor's
of Business Administration technology
entrepreneurship and my topic is
strategies that some saw senior software
developers used to mentor junior
developers so this is a passion of mine
and so what I'll do is give you how this
all started two years ago almost exactly
I as only channel one of my greatest
fears was dealing with the death of a
parent and so my father realized that
cancer I took care of him until he
passed away after the funeral and
everything I went to Maui and let me
back up I am an educator by trade so
I've worked with young people well let
me I work where he learners from age
five till almost in the grave I've dealt
with in the school out of schools summer
camps Tom public school education I am
certified special needs teacher I've
taught I've trained adults who work with
kids so I'm all about learning and how
people learn so as i said i went to
malware after my father's passing and
then i sent back email a text message to
anybody who was interested who would be
concerned about me
I said I'm leaving education and I'm
going in a tick and I put second quotes
and say when I figure out what that is
i'll let you know i'd always been
interested in technology but never saw
myself as a producer but consumer I'm
the person who watches the Apple Keynote
not just about the products but because
I want to know why they put that button
right there and how does that work the
thoughts behind it and so I never wanted
to be a teacher I was like screw this
i'm done and my father left me a little
money so i was like you know i'm going
to dive into what this tech thing is so
for the first six months it was just all
about learning I didn't know there was a
thing called Internet of Things I knew
what that stuff was I didn't know it had
a name you xui I mean it was like I was
like this kid in the candy store just
learning just going just is amazing and
for the first time I learned being a
black female meant something in tech
because i was going to this stuff was
free people were just giving me stuff so
having a being black with a vagina and
georgia was like for the first time I
was like halle-loo I was going
everywhere I am i if they hear somebody
had a free ticket I was taking I was at
my first Java Script conference and did
not know what JavaScript was had no clue
I just SAT there I was like I'll pick up
some of this I'll figure some of this
out so that was my first six months just
diving into this whole thing that I knew
nothing about and I just quickly
realized how generous the community was
so I was like okay for me to really get
this i'm going to have to learn how to
speak the language so I you know you
have all these boot camps and tutorials
Oh learning code in 30 days and get a 90
thousand dollar job da-da-da-da-da which
spun my blog posts cuz i actually was
doing a blog called tech talk for
non-techies at the time where i was
finding you to curating information to
help people who in the you know in the
normal community who just weren't tech
savvy and I was just getting pissed
because I was like you know what the
hell
wrong with me till I realized stop not
lining newbies this shit's hard stop
saying it's not please stop saying it's
not because you would want a doctor to
say Oh somebody said oh it was easy I
just went on through that or an attorney
man I took an online 30-day course and I
got my certificate I got my license and
I'm going to do your divorce you
wouldn't want that but yet we keep lying
to newbies about all this is so easy
everybody can do it a lot of people can
do it but it's not easy it's hard but
it's worth it and so what really
interested me is the growth of
technology technology touches everything
and so I am an educator I my last job in
public education was I worked in high
schools where I could care less if they
knew how to rewrite and whatever my job
was to get them ready for the real world
because school is an artificial
environment nobody in the world is going
to give you a paycheck just for
participation fresh is showing up that's
not going to happen you got to
demonstrate something and our young
people just do not know how to
demonstrate anything but technology
touches everything and they're just not
prepared I'm of the belief that their
second language needs to be a coding
language they don't have to be a
programmer but they need to learn how to
speak the language just like I'm
everybody's not an English major
everybody doesn't need to be to write
but we all speak English to understand
in the United States how to communicate
so I think it's that vital and so and
particularly in Atlanta we have such a
eclectic texting unlike other places
where they specialize we have everything
in Atlanta we have sports tech
entertainment tick fintech a health care
we have great colleges and universities
we have all that coming in one
place in in Atlanta so it's been really
important to me that this whole coating
movement gets started and you just do a
google chat I mean Google search on
indeed you can see how many jobs are out
there everybody's talking about they're
not enough coders out there and there's
so many jobs well there's a reason this
shit's hard
so there's an ongoing mantra you know
they're in the developer community that
though there are so many jobs out there
but then you hear that there's a
challenge of finding people entering the
space they're like they're not enough
people entering this place I disagree
with that there are people every day
making the decision to go into town to
learn the cold develop and like I said
that the developer community is
overwhelmingly gel generous I'm a black
female I'd love you guys I mean I walked
in there yesterday I have not seen
something in white men in one room it
was like oh my god but I was like hey
you brought me so good for you um and
it's affecting business costs because if
you don't have the programmers
businesses aren't able to and you know
business is about bottom line so they're
not able to produce they're not able to
get their deliverables out things you
have people who don't so it's really
affecting the business environment and
so what I want to talk about because
this is where people get upset about get
confused about mentoring someone self
out four quadrants of mentoring so
there's a difference between
professional and personal mentoring and
mentoring for youth and adults so when
you're mentoring about for youth it's
all about them it's not about you at all
as the adult in the relationship you is
all about getting them to where they are
taxpaying citizens law abiding and can
produce that's what this all when I'm
mentoring a young person it's not about
my feelings it's not about it's about
making sure that they when they become
of maturity they can fend for themselves
so it's and it's very open-ended there
are no goals it's whatever if I see that
they're struggling in something over if
I see their teenage mother if it's
whatever they need so it can it's and
it's very personal adults it's different
when you're mentoring adults is usually
career goals is something they're
focused on it's not just some they
there's something specific that they're
trying to get to and it's focused on how
to become better at what they do and
it's about climbing skills and knowledge
and it's and best practices is that it's
mutually beneficial it's it's a great
relationship
the mentor and the minty who wants to
mentor somebody they don't like who
wants to be mentored by somebody who is
rude and discounts your value whatever
so it's a bit we're adults so and it
also mentors to find themselves in both
mints adults can find themselves in the
role of mentor and mentee because you is
when you're working on you learn never
you're learning closure somebody might
know a aspect of closure that you don't
get so you mentor them but there might
be an aspect of closure that they don't
get so you meant to them and so it has
to be a balance it has to be a
peer-to-peer thing it has to be a mutual
respect also the personal when I'm
mentoring young people it's very
personal I'm in their family's life
because I really can't impact them if
I'm not impacting the family it's
open-ended I mean there's some things
that I'm dealing with it I rear ever not
deal with that's why I don't mentor
young people anymore I remember spending
one Christmas trying to find a girl who
decided she want the prostitute I was
like come on now this is the Christmas
holiday I don't have time to be
searching Atlanta streets for you but
that's what you do if you're a mentor of
young people would I do this for an
adult no I don't even have to come to
your house for Christmas you know it can
be just business it has to be respectful
but it doesn't have to be personal and
that's one thing one reason people get
concerned about mentoring in the
workplace because we don't have to have
lunch with each other it doesn't have to
be you know what to get all in my life I
don't have to know about your husband
and your wife and your kids that might
be nice but I don't have to so what
we're going to focus on is adult and
professional so that's how the
difference when you're working in a
professional environment it's adult and
professional so what mentoring is not
it's not one off problem solving is not
casual and it's not static stack
overflow is not mentoring slack is not
mentoring someone just told me that on
their company's website for their
mentoring program they have a page that
says that one reach out to somebody step
two
when you're available and step three
whatever i guess that is not mentoring
mentoring is a relationship and and it's
it's personal in the fact that there's a
connection and there's a commitment and
this it can be professionally
transformational so are great with any
relationship that you value you put time
and effort into it you think about it
you nurture it you make sure that
everybody's taken care of if this is a
relationship but you don't care about
you ignore their calls you put them as
soon as you see them you put them on
block or whatever you don't return
emails at work so for it to be really
good or mentoring it has to be about
relationship is all about building
relationships and it's personal like I
said it to a point of that is just a
connection I like spending time with you
enough to answer your questions you like
spending time with me enough to add get
these questions answer and its
commitment you can't this is why I stack
overflow and slack are not mentoring
this is what I've experienced so I'm
trying to get on my website I'm trying
to get it's a ruby on rails app which I
got from some tutorial figure hey this
is close enough to what i want i can
tweak this but there are some things
that I just didn't understand so I go to
slack because Atlanta has a channel
called tech 404 and there's a channel on
there called mentoring and mentors and
beginners so you go in there and you put
your coat up and you're trying trying to
figure out what's going on and somebody
is really helping you and you're
changing your coal based on what they're
saying and all of a sudden there's dead
silence did they die did they just go to
the bat what is the problem they don't
say hey I'll be back they just drop off
I don't know if they just got off work
or what same thing with some Stack
Overflow your guys can be real jerks on
Stack Overflow the newbies I just want
you to answer my question I don't know
need to know the many ways that this is
a stupid question just answer it so
that's not mentoring it has to be if if
you want to mentor finish the job so now
I've changed my whole coal-based based
on something you see and you're gone
it's like what thank God for
version-control you know so i can now
revert back to where I was but I still
don't have an answer to my problem and
again it's personal professionally
transformational somebody who has a as a
mentor let's be honest there is no boot
camp unless you have previous experience
as an engineer or just an affinity for
learning the cold we're in 39 t you're
going to be junior dev ready so there's
a big goal between finishing the program
and being junior dev ready without that
mentor in the middle you it's almost
impossible for a newbie to get there
they're just so many pitfalls this is
this is the wild wild west guys people
come at this from every discipline in
every direction and there is nothing
normal about programming about learning
to program or coming into this field
there is no career path there is nothing
I can wake up tomorrow and say hey I
want to be a developer and there we go
nobody's going to say you don't have
those credentials they're going to tell
you all give you all these resources and
all this stuff and then you need to do
this language you need use this text
editor units it's like oh my god and
without somebody there to say hey hey
hey back up you get overwhelmed and you
feel that something's wrong with you so
the factors that make effective
mentoring a mentor must evaluate your
motivation and I'm going to say this a
bad mentor is worse than having no
mentor at all and you need to be honest
about that everybody does not need to be
around somebody's learning think about
if you've taught your child to drive and
usually I just can't do that somebody
else got to do it everybody cannot be
around learners um take an honest
assessment of your time your talent in
your temperament because when you take
on a mentor they're expecting you to
respond in
any manner you know let's say you set up
a beginning i'll get back to you in 24
hours or something do that because again
it's a relationship and when you don't
get back to a learner just like with any
any learner they're sensitive it's like
having like I guess where the snake
feels when they shed their skin you're
just exposed and and when you're
mentored as i get back to you it's just
like oh my god what did i do you know
what it is just like all these other
stuff going on it you just a headache
you don't need and you need to set
realistic goals with your mentee and for
mentees it's reciprocity I tell when
people ask me about getting the mentor
or how the network do not ask for
anything unless you've given so if so
make sure you're in a giving space
that's how I got one of my mentors he
runs the javascript meetup in Atlanta
he's like you just keep coming back you
just keep coming back I have no other
job this is this is for me was no I had
no plan B so it's like I got to figure
this out so he just saw that I just kept
coming back and kept asking questions
respect the mentoring relationship if
someone is scheduled a time with you be
there if they've given you homework get
it done if they've done just no excuses
just get it done because they're
volunteering their time and their talent
to help you and I didn't have identified
desired goals I want to be a front-end
developer I want to learn closure I want
to do this it's if not it's going to go
on and on and on and it never ends and
then that's when the mentor just drops
out because now you just sucked up life
and no one has time for that reasons why
the development community needs
effective mentoring the industry needs
to do a better job at recruiting and
retaining the numbers of new
developments it needs to fill these jobs
we can do a better job of this newbies
find it difficult to level up on their
own we don't know what we just it's just
so much out there that you just don't
know that you just don't know you don't
even know how to begin to ask the
question because you don't even know
that thing exists that's why I love Cal
Simpson he's a JavaScript just like
rockstar to me and the one reason that
he's
got that I follow him is because Cal is
a person with 18 years plus experience
but when he has the screws up a dev
environment or he tried to do he puts it
on Twitter he lets everybody know
seniors please let juniors know it's not
just you because what we do is
internalize it because somebody told us
this was easy and so I can't figure
out so what's wrong with me and then
needs to stop because you just need to
be honest tell them I spent 10 hours on
this thing and it still doesn't work
this is normal also one of the biggest
paradigm shift it took me forever to
figure get over when I was starting was
again coming from education you're
allowed to make mistakes not only are
you allowed to make mistakes you're
expected to make mistakes because if you
don't make mistakes paper like
something's wrong with your coat net
just was too easy where else when you're
a doctor you're expected to no no no
there is no there's no guessing when
you're a teacher god bless us you're
expected to know every other industry
what other industry you know that you're
not hired because you're an expert what
are the industry that you're not hired
and paid the salary that we get paid and
you're not an expert so there's a big
paradigm shift for me because I was like
something not right that mean other shoe
has to drop there must be lying what's
going on that kind of things that was a
big one and then um learn the coldest
heart and like I said it without
somebody giving me a reality check so
one of my men like my mentor he saw that
I was struggling with JavaScript he said
put that down pick a Python oh oh my god
I know what a for loop is now it makes
sense cuz i was getting too caught up in
all that Jarvis javascript stuff they
had nothing to do with learning the cold
it was all about JavaScript it wasn't
helping me solve problems and that's
what we do we solve problems um and so
he once I guess I was like wow I'm not
stupid I can do this I can be a
developer oh this shit's hard got it you
know it's like okay I got it I'm not
stupid um and since there's no clearly
defined path you just don't know I mean
it's just you're just like stepping on
landmines it's like I hi closer I mean
it's like you just don't know and then
somebody gives you again slack they'll
say you're doing something and then
they'll mention something totally off
there is something but not gonna go
research that I just want to do this and
so it's just like again you don't know
what you don't know so you just go
chasing that thing over there and then
you come back two days later that didn't
work but you still have this problem
this is something i want to touch on
because i keep hearing this term
impostor syndrome this is a pet peeve of
mine I don't have many pet peeves
because I don't really take that much
that seriously but this when it comes to
learners I take very seriously learners
are not suffering from imposter syndrome
they are learning learning is hard you
would not tell a baby get your ass up
and walk you're suffering from a posture
syndrome no it takes process they have
to first row over then they have to
scoot then they have to pull up then
they have to crawl and then they do this
thing right boobs you don't say get up
you're suffering from a pasta syndrome
but we do it all the time to new people
learning is hard learning is hard and I
have people jump up newbies all time oh
I'm suffer from imposter syndrome shut
up you're not you're learning this is
one more negative hat that they put on
and says I can't do this and we're not
going to get the numbers in that we need
with people who are need to trying to
come into Cole saying I can't do this
cuz I'm how do you you can't even fake
being a program because you're not even
a programmer how do you that doesn't
even make sense to me it's like my
saying you know what I'm a white male
I'm an impostor I'm suffering from
posture syndrome everybody can look at
me and see I'm not a white male it's
never going to be possible so how is it
possible so if you come with that is to
me please if you come across a newbie
who says I'm suffering from a pasta
syndrome please sit them down and say no
sweetheart you're just learning and this
shit's hard so I find it interesting
again stackoverflow has value I found it
interesting and that's one thing that
newbies are afraid of so another thing
if you see a newbie who's afraid to go
and stack overflow please walk them to
the process of how to ask a question
because when I got first got on there
somebody said what's your stack trace
the hell are you talking about no what
the hell is a stack trace was that they
didn't explain it but when I said what
is that and I was like okay wait a
minute this is just way too much I just
want this problems off please explain
what this thing is so and and as you
know so many of our questions have
already been answered on Stack Overflow
so anybody was not using it it's doing
themselves a disservice so take a newbie
by the hand and say hey let me sit down
with you and show you how to use stack
overflow so you can get the answers you
want or how to Google a question but I
found this interesting sixty-nine
percent of developers say they are
self-taught if every computer science
class in the United States was filled we
still not have enough programmers the
majority of people are self-taught and
it says 43 / and it says thirteen
percent of fully self thought they
didn't I mean they they used to use
their own you know their own resources
the average person who's learning says
student says they have three to three
point four years of experience so why
are we telling newbie city can learn
something in 90 days that's not fair it
might not take somebody three to four
year three point four years to become to
get their first job
but or even become proficient but to
tell somebody hey this is going to
happen in 90 days is unfair people work
at this they do projects and if you want
to know how to mentor someone
project-based learning you're doing
projects already it's it's it's not
subjective it's quantifiable either you
know it or you don't and if you don't
know it then we can scalpel back and you
can figure this out that somebody says
they want to be a data scientist or what
the one of our SQL you can evaluate how
well they're learning SQL by having them
Duke SQL type projects and if they don't
know it then okay let's come back you
didn't get that concept and that's a
project and that's a commitment so you
don't have to mentor somebody threw a 33
years just project by project again like
I said project-based learning these are
from my blog or is to me the best that
was the best way I for me to know that
students knew something i could care
less if you is or AP student or if you
were honor student because honestly all
you knew how to do is take a test
because that's what they taught you they
taught you how to pass a test for me
it's about doing on your jobs is about
demonstrating knowledge and skills so
projects make it easy for you to
evaluate in and for people to
demonstrate knowledge and skills and it
says worldwide I participate in the
mentorship program correlates to higher
average how you pay it matters it helps
the mint the person who's learning it
helps the mentor because it puts you in
a space where somebody's asking you a
question I always tell people you know
you really know something if you can
teach it to somebody else so if you're
telling me to use this tool and I ask
you why you're using this tool and you
can't tell me anything other than
because I do that's not a good reason
because that might not be the most
effective tool to be using for this job
so mentor mentoring helps of
both participants as well as it helps
productivity in RI for businesses so
what I want to take a little time to do
is I do a self-assessment so I want
everybody to either decide that they're
a mentor or mentee and I want you to
write think of three personal strengths
in that role if you're a mentor what are
my three personal shrimps that I bring
to that role and if you're a minty what
a three-person I mean three and three
personal challenges and if you're a
minty the same thing and I want to at
least three people to volunteer because
I want to help you work through whatever
those plan strengths and challenges are
so if you can just think about this for
a second think about whatever role
you're in I maybe they're going to be a
mentor or mentee and one of my three
personal strengths that I bring to the
role of a mentor or mentee and what are
three challenges again because this goes
back to you need to have us have an
honest assessment of your time your
talent in your temperament if anyone
wants to volunteer you can just raise
your hand yes sir
you have patience and what about a
challenge conveying contents so what's
your strength again patience alright so
when since you have patience which is
good they're going to test it so who
conveying concepts it takes you it's
going to take you to because for me when
you say that you have to come out of how
you learn and think about how the
learner learns so because you have
patience I would because I have to
coding students now ones 10 and 1 and 16
I'll go over concept and then i'll have
them google the same concept they might
pick up an article because they might
get it by reading they might do the
youtube videos because they might get
about YouTube videos and then what I
have them do not just watch or read but
now report out write something or babe
explain to me what you just read or saw
or did or whatever that tells me that
you got that concept and it also tells
me where your the lack still is so if
you totally didn't get it then I need to
figure out something else but if you got
parts of it now because I've listened to
you now get say okay this is what you
have now these are the gaps you have an
S work on that again now that's
measurable because this is these are the
skills you have we don't need to go over
their part but these are the things
you're missing so let's write this down
to make a plan for how we're going to
get those skills anybody else yes
okay so he said in the role of a mentor
he has empathy as a strength but as a
challenge he forgets that their learners
that they're learning things so that
causes his empathy the kind of Wayne
because because you get frustrated with
the fact that they don't know exactly so
what it challenges with it what it does
for me is say it strengthens again it's
a benefit for you it strengthens your
level of empathy because um in that case
what you need to do is have some kind of
signal where they can say I know this
this in this but this thing you're
saying I've never heard of o our no
discipline so what I would do is now
this is going back to my special needs
training I would get like a chart
between 1 through 5 where is your level
of comfortability between 125 on this
concept and then if it's any if it's a
four or five then you give them you let
them go off on their own to prove that
they understand it but if it's a between
a one and A three then that means you
need to do something else until they get
to a one or a three or four I mean a
four or five because again you always
want them to go off on their own to do
it because again this job is about
problem solving it's about problem
something it's about problem solving you
can't problem solve for somebody else so
if they if the chart is between a one
and A three then you're still sticking
with them when they get to a four or
five didn't just send them you give them
a project to work on so they can
demonstrate that they have that skill
anybody else yes I'll get you to what is
your role okay
that simple all right so if that comes
you are they coming to your email form
exactly okay so whatever form since its
you write it down you I want to learn
closure what are the three things you
tell me right now what are the first
three things they need to learn anybody
where the first few things you need to
learn foreclosure shout it out syntax
development environment and what come on
three one more math all right so then I
was sent back I wouldn't do it in slack
because most of these slack things
they're not paid for so nobody's
curating it so I get an email sending me
email and say if you want to know
closure and I will have this as in a
library as a google doc every time I ask
me these things these are the three
things you need to do and if they
respond back to you that means they're
series if not you've not wasted your
time I mean it's just that simple you're
putting the onus back on them because
again you're volunteering your time as
the minty it's their responsibility to
do what they need to do so create a some
kind of document that says if these are
the questions they asked if I want to
learn closer or these are the standard
things i have i have our first place for
them to go and again you want them to do
more research this is a starting point
you do your research and get back to me
sir go ahead yes you you
so what are your challenges
okay so what's your problem why are you
sure I mean ok I can tell you right now
there's somebody sitting right here
where I had lunch with who wants a
mentor so what's the problem they don't
get it on stack up again because what I
tell you meant newbies don't go to stack
overflow looking for that they are
frightened you guys are really mean to
newbies so I'm going to connect you
right now what's your name again I'm
Dorian question who Arthur and Dorian
there you go thank you I took care of it
that's done hold on just a second get up
go back he's the guy standing at the
back door go ahead right here excuse me
I'm sorry
well what you can do and I'm just going
to take this because now you're talking
about specifics and programming could
there be a level a B and C this is what
we need you can get fancy on a B and C
so you're you're allowing them to make
sure they're at a level that everybody
understands so that's a and then you can
get creative on some other things
somewhere else and B and C and then we
can look at it and see if we want to
implement that in a does that make sense
i mean i'm not i'm still learning but
I'm just trying that makes this because
you want to again special needs teacher
I want to make sure that at least
everybody has the basics before we start
speaking is reading Shakespeare
everybody needs to know what the letter
A because as generous as the as this
this group is community is you can't get
really arrogant and narcissistic about
cold and so we want to make sure that
even because you might not have to
maintain that cold so you want to make
sure that the at least a bare minimum
people understand it but yet you're not
stifling their creative I want to make
sure I do not fall off the stage you're
not stifling their creativity by so
you're saying hey make sure we have at
least this and everybody gets that
that's what gets pushed or everything
else you get to do and then we can have
a conversation about because you know
what you're so smart I want you to bring
everybody up to your level if that
doesn't stroke the ego right there so
start having some lunch and learns where
they're now explaining these things so
everybody so now they feel hey but
they're doing it in a way that's
respectful to everybody
there you go yes less luck and that's
that's why you need projects so find one
thing that you want to learn and you
don't have to have just one mentor find
one thing that you want to learn and say
hey and present it and if they're busy
presented in the email checklist can you
help me with 81 so you have five take
that back you have five things which one
of these can you help me with you get me
with two and three okay let me go to
somebody else and that's how you get
that and it's going to be on you to keep
up with that so this is how you can help
me I have the website junior dev
mentoring com I need mentors to sign up
I need people i just added a internship
portal to it because i really want one
place for people to find internships
there are tons of internships out there
but they're all word of mouth no one
ever you don't know the person who knows
the person knows somebody you don't know
about the internship and i also need
someone I want this to be a community
project one this would be open sores I
can't do this by myself I don't want to
do this by myself and if somebody is
willing to help me turn this into an
open source project I would appreciate
the assistance so I am Kim Creighton
