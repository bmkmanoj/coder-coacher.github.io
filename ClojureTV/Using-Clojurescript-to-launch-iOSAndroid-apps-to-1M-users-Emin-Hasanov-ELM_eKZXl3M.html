my name is Amin I'm really pleased to be
here stage and unlike the rest of it
because we need to the technology for
your product there are lots of decisions
to make lots of tools libraries and
plane folds which is found and most of
those tools will have technical
documentation and tutorials describing
to details how to use them most of them
will also cost a number of great
companies who use those same tools and
frameworks to build as much what we
require fun is a story notes from adults
and Facebook's and Google's of the world
not from the companies that have endless
resources we can put a lot of money and
a big team of people to develop anything
they want in an language they want the
stories on the company that is similar
to you that has beauty levels that is
title budget has three big lines and
that River needs to make a decision and
I so let's actually convinced that kind
of companies that this is a joke this is
something that could help them so this
is the kind of story I'd like to to tell
the top boss and hopefully for some of
you it will be exactly what you need to
convince yourself that if we were able
to do it then you can do it off as well
with that I'll just give a quick
background for forever confirm and how
we arrived at the decisions are the
decision to use it's called stock and
they will go in details coming how we
actually I live in Abidjan
too small for service counting as I said
it's about four times smaller than
Germany by Agra voltage and smaller by
it's a little small country a little
adrenal emergency and like most
post-soviet countries we went from
having almost multi ecology to late
nineties to a lot of Technology in the
last 10 to 15 years and especially after
all money started flowing in these roads
all sorts of gadgets he visited
high-speed Internet
sweetie hundred percent coverage of 3G a
Costa County now coaches people adopting
smart for evolution using all of those
apps Facebook Instagram YouTube Google+
but maybe not this one and that adoption
global services started to grow as well
so I hope in saqqaq using services
actual services not just getting the
content and a lot of services started
developing on top of their goals and we
have found ourselves at the forefront of
that in last few years because we are
broad spiced website incomes in our
countries and you have have depending on
where you come from at the Craigslist
oil leaks of evita
and this is our website and you have
used any of those websites you know what
a little bit it will give you a to buy
and sell stuff online another fit these
peoples internet users coming and we are
the Falcons of it and and when we
started this project we were so in love
tightly maskala today from 300,000
musculars to one and half million mastic
monthly users and we still have this way
limited team were regulated resultss and
small team so we have to pick our
battles we have to decide what to focus
on what to develop next how to grow the
product and the visualization is
acknowledged Eagles
rapid shift to new technologies and what
happens in those cases you skip over the
generations so I think
head of the global terms of everyone
moving mama for the last few years
almost all of the sides and countries
have more than 70% of the users from
mobile and we certainly see the same
pattern on our website and for quite a
long time we've been solving all of
those will be serving women website to
all of those users and it was fine we
have a desktop website for this purpose
of mobile website for mobile users it's
fast in lot quickly you see the full
access the full features and we will
focus on that but up this one points as
you go we started to realize that a lot
people get used to having an app on the
device icon the licking click they want
you to have that too they actually
expect you to that too they demand you
care enough
it is be supported serve I don't hang up
and as we approach either means mark
millar most users we decided okay we got
respective eventual have to do something
about this Oh mobile I think and so I'm
all voted the one more important point
apart from customers being unhappy at
least space for competition to come in
and heating the weak spots they will run
out and start to compete with you in
your in this year so we decided that
since as I said we have to kick out a
nose usually happy where guys with this
mobile app thing we have two it has in
certain content for us to be able to do
it and that it is a simple and everyone
wants to be able to watch any to make
quickly and apart it was even more
important because we didn't want to
build separate eyes and under-18
beginning we didn't have anyone of the
team we have before that who build
animal balance I all know when you
objects in our new Java at least in the
context of Android development and not
only did you not want learning languages
through our toolkit we also want to over
time multiple copies support because
make them safe ions under which mobile
works and discover sides of the
different products even though they may
end up being so in the same need you
have to actually support them separately
you have to go to negative moments of
the teachers you have to tell some all
soccer player so be more different code
bases you have the difficulty stuff keys
now we wanted to have that but at the
same time we also have some access to
native teachers and we wanted to get the
fluidity and in the feel of the native
app and so that we exist the biggest
another of options you have and
basically if you develop if you decide
to develop a half between hand and
website and having a couple hundred to
cengage web and also some different I
just and I won't go too much into
semantics but basically anything that's
not of exercise and other kinds of sense
like this like Oh classic and it's
impossible to choose for all of those
alternatives so we had to choose a
specific points on this ranch and what
wanted to do is to get as much possible
to the right site without actually going
major and basically for series options
from starting from the easiest one to
order so the simplest thing you can do
and the double compound all the regulars
we had is just to make a website draft
of the scholar the day launches and you
have something already working for
customers and it is really quick to do
you get exactly hanako-san code
co-chairs even all of your platforms and
inputs pathology works for your mobile
Wi-Fi can't work everyone has an act
and it turns out that expectations are
different and people who access your
website and access your app if they get
exactly the same service that the civic
service will build works on mobile app
because the expectations are so much
higher but yet this is not to be
underestimated
for instance looking back and thinking
that maybe we should have started with
this while we were developing anything
that responds with developing code
collecting audience because it gives you
two things first it gives you
discoverability and for many people they
just open escalate packages and they
don't find you and they also another
thing or maybe they find a competitor
and use them instead and also give them
a quick access to your service by having
a screen as I can on the screen and we
can say okay this can still put a
shortcut to the website on the screen
but next is happening it's us
it's geeks it's like not wanting to do
which in Jackson what now when people
don't know where Google start and
balance what's the difference between
Wi-Fi internet so let alone being able
to install a shortcut so it's not matter
if it's a good step to do if you really
want to start something value you also
have a plan to develop it otherwise you
will keep getting not too good reduce
some of the ninjas before us was
undergoing semi-
because we use will be old rail from the
back end and also Basecamp develop this
for the cultural beliefs which allows
you to have a native shell so you have a
native code very important and you use
web use for everything else sort of like
we build option but obscured and it's
very good option if you have many many
screens like they do for instance if you
have fun with screens different speeds
are things they have different screens
you don't want to implement them all on
your app that this is the way to go you
implement the common shell navigation
may be important the formal sense upon
Sofia everything else is with you and
just the dog across works is
you know Jenna Jay and Jenna the
development of shells however minimal
it's still you need to know that but
also the performance despite the fact as
it's much further than the first case
it's still not after speech not not on
the same level resonating so which
burned us to them really the selection
going almost places and it's almost
major data give us the reason is that a
bunch of tools bunch of libraries that
you can use I'll be honest I haven't
eyes not muscular most of them because
we have already experienced with react
on the web it's worth profiles who looks
at that you can we can use same tools
the same language that we always know
and we get almost Iraq it's magnetic
I'll talk about why thermostatic like
that the basically get almost everything
that we want and we get to use a silent
language occur and the same for bicycles
to violence so we have native and anyway
if you haven't used it before it's like
it's a way to define your device in
terms of native components for within
JavaScript so you ought to say to all of
the interaction which in JavaScript but
the actual components themselves erases
and we we saw that it's got a good story
on both Android and iOS and it's got a
good ecosystem and we had we already
know new react
new react before from our web experience
so we decided to get started and see
where it takes us and the good thing the
great thing about react is how easy to
react native is how easy is to get
started assuming you have all of the
dependencies installed it takes five
minutes and these four simple commands
to have something up and running granted
it's a simple thing and you can say well
big deal but it is actually a big deal
the the reason it is a big deal is
because it's extremely satisfying to get
something on the screen on your screen
without knowing anything about mobile
app development I certainly was really
excited because for me it was like a
whole new world I don't know anything
about it I don't haven't ever touched
Xcode not Android studio I don't know
how to configure whatever needs I don't
know the build pipeline yet I am over
there having something on my device up
and running I can edit my JavaScript
file I can change how it looks so this
short feedback loop is it's almost
reminded me how 20 years ago when this
all this was starting we have active
server pages if I don't want to remember
them you have small visual basic script
and you create a loop and you generate
HTML and voila you have something
running on the server so it sort of
reminded me that because I knew nothing
at the time and then I already have
something and it was the same feeling
and this is what you get when you that
is that the file that you get after
running all of this or that command
there are so number of dependencies and
configuration files but this is the
essence this is your J's file and as you
can see it's pretty readable even if you
haven't touched any of react native any
of mobile web development before you got
a bunch of inputs we've got something
resembling style sheets and you've got
in the middle you've got a component
that defines the view which contains a
text and some Styles applied to it and
almost anyone who has done any
programming in JavaScript will be able
to change it to start working on with
this immediately now you will notice
that you still have this view and text
components which are native components
so despite the fact that as I said you
are running it from JavaScript the sums
what you render on the device is an is a
native view component which contains
native text component so you still have
to learn that part obviously you still
have to learn what are the different
components available what is ListView or
the scroll view how to put an image but
this is expected because after all this
is exactly what you wanted we wanted a
native app and this is sort of cool that
you can you can do that you can do that
so quickly but also it's JavaScript
right and I don't know about you but
after this after how you things will be
on the background after using closure
I don't enjoy working with JavaScript at
all it's got all of those creeks and
watts and lack of standard library and
all sorts of issues
and we really didn't want to develop in
JavaScript as a language so we liked the
act native as a platform but not the
language but if you think about it you
already have we already had the same
problem problem on a web we've been
adapting react and we used it together
with colossal script and it works fine
for us also why not why not - right here
why not see maybe this maybe we can do
the same here so closure script I don't
think this cloud needs much breaching
the benefits of the closure of the
language at the same time I think
closure script as a platform still has
faced some skepticism yes it's adoption
grows as closure state of clause of
shows but still compile it to the size
of the JavaScript as a hotspot form to
the JVM it should be much more popular
because before we can say it reach the
same level of adoption and a lot of that
was because it came later it had some
sort of difficult to link in between in
the beginning the apple there were some
issues with launching apples and things
but things have significantly improved
and then this mobile apps thing comes
react native itself is relatively new
has all sorts of edge cases that you
need to manage so you you normally it's
expected that you would be concerned
about using it with closure script so we
did we were not sure so we decided that
we should actually just try it and see
see if it works for us
and that's what we're going to be
talking right now about and by the way
if you yourself are not yet salts on
closure script I highly recommend this
talk it was given a couple of years ago
and closure conch and it's even it's
even better now because a number of
developers that have been mentioned in
that talk have already been addressed
since and even if you are convinced it
may help you to convince your colleagues
to adopt closure script
speaking of improvements if you are not
following closure script dog has a some
news regarding recent developments it's
a lot of new singers are coming so I
suggest to the dead so the biggest
benefit that using closure script for
mobile apps is it's an extension of
having the same language across your
whole stack we are not there yet
yourself ourselves but we have this
ability closure on the back end closure
script on the browser
Clojure script on for mobile apps and i
think i think it's great and every and
this is something that should be
considered when evaluating the options
so on the web we use this library called
reagents and if you haven't used it
before it's a very minimalistic layer on
top of react which allows you to define
instead of using JSX instead of using
some specific constructs did you just
work with functions and data structures
to to define your UI and you have these
atoms that are observable and by trick
by updating that atom you retrieve you
rear end for the rendering of the via
interface so let's look at the simplest
component that we can have that straight
from the reagent for the web reagent
documentation as you can see is just a
function that returns and then a vector
it returns vector yes it got some some
additional attributes to define CSS
classes and ID's but basically I think
everyone can immediately understand the
HTML that it will render to so it's a
div with some text in it and a couple of
formatting pieces and this is the common
theme I think this is what the sheet is
all the same so it's much better to have
a limited set of data structures and a
lot of functions working on it so this
is what works with the dead paradigm
just have a simple function and that
returns a data structure so let's look
at the more involved example and this is
a pattern that you adopt in almost all
of the reagent applications you have a
atom in this case its global atom it's
usually its global item that holds your
app state it defines how your app looks
absolutes in this case it's just a
simple click counter just holds an
integer and notice it's not a regular
atom its reagent atom so what it does it
tracks all of the updates to this to
this atom and renders all of the
components that degree of this atom so
if you look down this is a component
itself it did have the atom it shows you
the actual click count and it's got this
button with a function attached to its
own click event
what this function does it increases the
value in this atom and because this very
component did have this item you
immediately see the result and this is
very simple concept
I'm only describing in case for those
who haven't seen it before it turns out
interesting is that this is conceptual
everything you need to know to start
working with JavaScript and react native
so let's see how it's done let's see how
it's done with in course crip world
again assuming you have all of the
dependencies installed just for commands
and you have you up and running again
and but it's a closer script version now
so instead of just JavaScript it pulls
in all of the dependencies that you need
sets your up with the framework it could
be reagent it could be on next it could
be some other wrappers around yet
because we use the agent we kept using
it but it could be other frameworks as
well under a NATO which we use it does
all of the heavy lifting behind the
scenes to get you up and running and
again in five minutes you have something
running on your device as you can see
it's more advanced that's plane react
native version and it comes with big
will so if you ever have any of you has
used have used to grill it gives you the
ability to hot hot to do a hot code a
lot so you can change the file and
before you turn your eyes to your device
or emulator you already see it's updated
even on a larger relatively larger pipe
isn't that large would you get sub
second sub second delay between saving
file and seeing it reflected and if he
did properly you maintain in the current
state of the app so you don't have to
repeat any of the steps that you did
before again what it gave to what it
gave me is the confidence actually once
I ran those four commands and saw this
for the first time try to load a few
more native components this gave me the
confidence that we can actually do it
that despite the fact that we don't have
much experience we can actually do it
and this was a sort of liberating
experiences like something I just
somehow felt relief that it's not it may
not be that difficult after all given
all of the works that have been done
with these tools and
so just to compare the output I dumped
it down a little bit to the standard
version - this is the version that you
will get in closer script conversion and
as you can see it's also a bunch of
imports and deaths but the big
difference is style cities and the
object animal just a map just a data
structure and the component itself again
just like in react in the agent for the
web version is just a vector the only
difference is instead of returning
paragraphs and divs you are now working
with those same native components like
view and text and a few hundred others
such you will need to know about if you
want to use them in your app but the
biggest benefit that you get is you can
use all of the power of your programming
language to manipulate those data
structures instead of working with the
custom objects with a custom behavior so
for instance if we compare that specific
piece on JavaScript side you have this
class that extends other class that
returns has render function which
returns chase X which get basically and
if you have to wrap your head around it
enclosing scope world it's just a
function and data structure that's it
yeah I think for us it was sort of
simple made easy moment when we realized
that we could actually use this
beautiful simple language to manipulate
and manipulate our mobile app with ease
so sort of a manifestation of the
concept and if you haven't watched this
talk at least three times I suggest I
highly recommend you do I think I've
watched it five or six times my burn
slow to understand I don't know but I
think it's a great talk and the other
side so we have this sort of a
manifestation of that in what we
developed so I'll show that we I wanted
to show you quick demo but before I do
so we decided we build a prototypes we
built a prototype that had some very
basic functionality and we decided yes
this is workable so we hired a full-time
engineer to work on this it's just one
one device was just one developer and
after three months of work including the
work to design through the mock-ups to
the develop back-end API deals also of
integration going to
staying fixing the bugs after three
times we launched our first version in
production and it has got no native code
at all except some configuration which
isn't code and you just add a couple of
libraries configure them very minor
types and everything else is in peel
closure script and this is what we were
able to develop in three months I hope
it plays so it's a kind of his absolute
got endless scroll of listings you've
got search filtering you've got build
category fields detailed view photo
galleries zooms bookmarks swipes the
back on both iOS and Android you've got
native shave buttons you can post your
own things it supports multiple language
so we've got the localization building
so it might not be that basic after all
but clearly not a base camp either but
the important part that I want kind of
to stress about the stress on here is
regardless of how simple your app is the
important part is how well it works how
fast it is how fluid it was how easy to
support it is and I hope the demo gives
a sense of how it works and it is indeed
something very similar to what you would
have built with a native with a native
app so if there is one takeaway that I
want that I want to share so that I want
others to take from this talk is you can
actually do that if we were able to do
that you can do that too and yes it's
not a painless process yes you've got a
lot of things to learn along the way but
it may not be as difficult as difficult
as if you would be doing this the same
thing from the scratch in native
language so obviously I can't go in
detail to describe how we done
everything that we have done but I will
kind of focus on two examples because
some of you may ask so why did you even
take your three months if it's so easy
and straightforward and in a way you
would be right because first version of
this product was developed in a month
the conceptually title of this funky
most of this functionality what takes
the other two monsters to develop is
ironing out all of the small issues and
this is what differentiates
bad applications from good applications
is amount of effort you put in the
little details starting from
when you do swipe to back when it should
react at which position it should react
ending with how well your Gallagher
works on multiple devices and multiple
sizes did you do enough testing so all
sorts of all sorts of small things that
you have to take care about and when you
develop so I'll just give two examples
that I think I'm the right screen yes
just give two example so one example is
on the left side you see this the
listing of product when you click on it
it opens up the detailed view and you I
hope you have seen it with the demo that
it's fluid in the media box immediately
so quite often what I see and what I'm
going to say is intelligent science I'm
only telling talking about that because
I see it so so many times have seen it
in a relapse maybe this is because when
you develop on your local website on
your local machine the on a high-speed
Internet the response is so quick that
you don't don't notice it but what
happens is when you click you would file
a request you get a JSON back oh and
then you render your result and it may
be fine it works right but we can do
much better because if we'll if you look
at the tail follow on this screen we
already have a product name we already
have a price we already have a city we
already have some other data and this
system that we already have a picture
this same data is available over here
and instead of filing a request waiting
for it to come back
you can already show something you can
already well it will take time to
process in for the customers of what
they think you will already have
received the remaining pieces that were
not available there and it's so easy to
do in react because everything that
defines your application is in your
state so if you populate this stage with
partial information it will render that
partial sum but you don't need to do
customer logic you just populate what
you have and then you request the
missing bits of missing pieces and that
would work but we can go even better we
can do even better
because if you look again on this screen
it's got very little additional
information just a few lines of text
contact number
maybe links to all of the images
basically just a few hundred bytes maybe
a couple of kilobytes by a couple of
still
by listing and it's not much and there
is nothing stopping you from sending
this information along when you receive
when you send the whole list of products
which allows you to immediately render
the second screen with all of the data
available now you may ask but that means
I need to send more data yes you do
but the payload difference is negative
the exhibit is so neglible
negligible that and the experience is so
much better that I think it's a good
compromise at the same time if your
payload is really big what you can do is
to load all of the things that are
visible above the fault that the visible
wants to load the screen and load
everything else after that we actually
do a little bit of that so for instance
we don't load related products we don't
load some other data that's below the
screen until you actually go to the page
but you know you never notice that
because by the time you scroll down it's
over to them and second example is
similar in conceptually so you have this
list of categories when you click it
you've got list of subcategories in each
subcategory there is list of additional
fields a few hundreds different a few
hundred different variations and again
what's quite often I can see is you
click on it it loads up next next level
of the tree you click again it loads at
the next level of the tree but if you
look at the whole three it's just 20 30
kilobytes of data before you exhibit so
again nothing stops you and you only
need to do it once you only need to do
it to synchronously if you like only do
it from the first time user launched an
app you load those 20 kilobytes of the
information and then you don't love date
it in the background and what it gives
you is a product for the user it's
always up to date it's always has got
this fluid experience and they don't
need to wait and so you what it gives is
always up-to-date data yes it may be
changing like once an hour but for for
this use case specifically it was more
than enough and again this might be
obvious for many of you here but it's
because it's so often isn't done I
decided to talk about it so with that we
built our app it's working but it's not
enough it's just one part of the
equation because you also need to send
data along from there back
and API and you might say you can use
JSON and you would be like you can do
that but JSON is good it's spiky Steiner
which is easy to understand but also
it's got a lot of limitations and if you
haven't if you have tried to pass dates
or sets over the JSON you will know what
I mean and the transit format is sort of
like closure and closure script it's
it's hosted format if you can say this
way so it works on top of JSON and
message pack and the it gives you all of
the benefits without all of the
drawbacks so you can use suppose any
data types many built-in if some of the
data types are not supported you can do
custom passives and customer items for
them and you can use arbitrability s not
just ring and it's real language
agnostic there are pickle
implementations in a bunch of language
and there aren't official
implementations for most other language
so for instance you can use it to power
your angular app working with the Django
back end so you can do that nothing
stops you from doing that and it also
got compression and caching for
performance and somehow reading all
everything that's happening on the
Twitter and Internet I get a feeling
that not enough people appreciate the
benefits of transit so I've sort of I'll
put it here because that's what we are
using to communicate between our Ruby
backend and color script application and
again sometimes what's missing is the
silly examples and this is an example of
the map hash in Ruby and it's got this
keyword what we could which we call it's
a symbol in Ruby it's keyword in closure
so if you were to send this map over
JSON you would you'll have to you cannot
use symbol cells you have to use strings
as a keyword so as a tease to the map
but then you lose that ability to work
with idiomatic Ruby and closure so you
either have to custom and call it
somehow to be able to read back the
feedback symbol as a keyboard oh you
just use transit and it does does it so
you transparently so for us it was very
very useful because we like to use
simple we like to use symbols and we
like to use keywords and transit gives
us a separate
so we don't need to delegate the lowest
common denominator and I recommend using
transit everywhere where you now use
JSON I think it's so much comfort and
it's very easy to do again you need you
import couple of libraries you do some
additional work to generate this files
but that's it everything else from that
point forward works transparently so we
have an app we have an API we have we
have the habit voting but then it comes
time when you need to ship up the ship
update and one of the criteria if you
remember in the beginning was for us to
be able to iterate quickly because we
are so used for that in the web world
you just commit you deploy and voila
everyone to get latest version you can
get that level of interactivity yet here
but you can get very close especially
that sending updates in a normal native
app world is quite quite an experience
if you haven't tried you working with
Apple App Store you will again know what
I mean
Google's is much better but still and
have lots of hurdles to do Apple has
also give you your app it takes now
three days it used to be three weeks so
much better but still you have to go
through that process they also lose all
reviews because by default they only
show you reviews for the latest version
but because of all of those reasons what
happens there developers tend to
accumulate the accumulate changes and
push them every few monsters which
results which results in a slow way
iteration but most updates don't require
you to change binaries because if you if
we had a website wrapper anytime we
would update our JavaScript and HTML we
would get a new version everyone would
get a new version but this is also
JavaScript this is also the can can be
updated from the internet and there are
some services that allow you to do that
and one of those services is called code
push for Microsoft by the way so you
register and integrate SDK and then you
push up this to the server and then on a
application you can download it in the
background you can download their
background and apply when it's
convenient when we started we did it in
a really stupid way we applied
update immediately so user would be in
the middle of the Florida bump it would
be large so now we are more careful
we've download it we wait for either
period of inactivity or 15 minutes or
its application is exited and on the
next launch you would generate a new
version and it's and most features that
you deploy most features that the change
are like that it's either a bug fix it's
a layout change it's some small update
to some small section so obviously if
you updated react native if you want to
ask for new permissions if you want to
dinosaur to integrate some native
library you have to go to that so but
that is relatively rare and you can
bundle all of your ongoing updates that
you have down to a code push with those
sorts of updates and also it allows you
to rollback
so just for my commands which and list
your deployments you can see the
adoption like 70 percent adopted new
version and in case you see exceptional
going through the roof you can roll back
quickly so it gives you a easy very easy
way to manipulate your deployments so
let's let's see what the results so that
kind of brings me to the end of the
presentation just wanted to share the
results so we built an app we created an
API we developed way to reuse the way to
update the app and we launched it about
a year ago with iOS supporting iOS 8 and
Android 4.1 and higher we got now almost
200,000 installs we've got about 20
percent of the daily sessions from the
app and 99.8 crash sessions on both
platforms and when we started was once
the first better it was 80% so it took
us it took some work to bring it to 99%
and then to ninety-nine point eight now
it sounds like a small difference but
it's actually eight times more reliable
than 99% so five times sorry my message
of I wanted average rating is above 0.7
granted part of it is because of the
service itself hopefully it's good but
it's also because it allows people to
actually do what they need to do in a
comfortable way
and speaking of give user
was one review that I will share in the
end it says I didn't like the app but
I'll give you five stars for the effort
that was we're going to this thing give
you so not where your phone your
customers appreciate the effort that you
have put it in so thank you anonymous
give you and thank you do the
