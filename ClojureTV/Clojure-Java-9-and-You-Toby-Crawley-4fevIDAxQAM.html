today about Java 9 and how it's gonna
impact us as closure developers so Java
nines next big release of Java it's
scheduled to come out currently in July
2017 but that release that he slipped
several times so it may slip again if
you want to follow along there's this
Java 9 countdown site which gives you a
release clock everything I'm gonna talk
about today is in an early access build
everything but one thing is in an early
access build the most recent is build
162 which can be downloaded from the JDK
9 site so I'm going to cover every
feature in John 9 I'm just going to try
to focus on some stuff that will impact
us both for good or ill so I'm talking
about these things and I'm gonna talk
about and then give each of these things
a subjective rating and then talk about
some future work that we could maybe do
in a community for tooling and whatnot
around those but really this list should
look like this because modules is the
most impact will change the biggest
thing in Java 9 that's kind of the
driving force in Java 9 right now so
we'll spend quite a bit of time on it so
let's get started let's talk about
compact strings first so in Java 8 and
lower strings are represented internally
as 2 bytes per character even if you're
using a single byte encoding so if
you're using utf-8 or ASCII you're still
using 2 bytes internally for each one of
those characters Java 9 now recognizes
that situation and will allocate you one
byte per character array internally so
now single-button cuttings will use half
as much memory so if you're using utf-8
everywhere
you can use less memory which means that
string is also no allocate more quickly
because you're allocating half as much
memory so this is a pretty quick one the
rating on this is thumbs up that's what
my son and I think we're fans of compact
strings and future workaround compact
strings nothing we have to do anything
you use Java 9 you're gonna get this for
free
hopefully C memory savings and a slight
speed improvement next thing is multi
release jars this is a new jar format or
extension to the jar format really they
lets you provide class files classifier
implementations for different versions
of
so if we look at an example of it so
we've got this
this fruit package with apple banana and
pear in it at the top level and you'll
see we've got that versions nine path
under meta F so what happens is if
you're using Java 9 that banana
implementation under meta F will get
loaded if you're using any other version
of Java the one at the top level will
get loaded so what this allows you to do
is to take advantage of Java 9 features
but still ship jars that support out of
older versions of Java so I think this
is a cool feature I wish we had it
before now but we've got it now so we
give that a thumbs-up and future work
around this it'd be cool if we had you
know because built because to build
these things you're gonna have to build
twice right you're going to build a part
of your code for Java 9 a part of it for
whatever you're targeting whatever your
lowest Java version is so big we think
there's opportunity here for extending
Lanigan but-- etc to make it easier to
do these multi target builds and then to
be able to smush those stuff together
into a multi release jar excuse me
the next thing alt compilation so when
there's a closure person when you hear a
ot youth you think of converting clj
into byte code what I'm talking about
here what they have and Java 90 is
converting byte code into machine code
ahead of time and this this may reduce
the time to optimal performance because
we're not having to compete with a
thread that's doing just-in-time
compilation and maybe it would reduce
startup time for our applications so I
played with it a little bit and so Java
9 ships for this new compiler J a OTC so
in this case I have an uber jar which
just has closure in it a single
namespace with a single function that
just prints hello world so the first the
first Jo TJ a OTC line is I'm compiling
Java dot base which is the core of the
Java standard library now that they've
broken up into modules it's not one
monolithic thing so I'm just gonna Bob
compiling the the core of the standard
library which takes a while 460 seconds
or so
and then I'm compiling my uber jar to an
Esso file which takes about 360 seconds
so it's not it's not a fast operation
but how do we use these so there we go
yeah so if we look at so just to get a
baseline so I'm just looking to startup
time right now to get a baseline we just
run that uber jar with and so this is
using no äôt at this point just to get
a reference so that takes about one
point two four seconds to run on my
machine now if I bring in the a OTD Java
dot base s so things get better right
we're looking at one point one nine
seconds where we're starting a little
bit faster and then if we bring in the
actual Oberer jar compiled things get a
bit worse right so it's in my crappy
benchmarking I did not see an
improvement startup time but the
interesting thing is if you look at
seconds actually spent on the CPU so
that first number is wall clock time
that second number is actual time on the
CPU cuz we've got more than one CPU in
the machine we see a significant
improvement in CPU time and so I think
what we're seeing there is weird just
not seeing the JIT happen does JIT
that's happening at another thread so I
mean that supports my theory that we
would see a reduction in time to optimal
efficiency but there's concern about
because what how the JIT works is the
JIT has run time profiling to know to
how to optimize that that just-in-time
compilation with a twith ahead of time
compilation you don't have that or those
runtime metrics so even if a OT makes it
where we can get to the optimal state
more quickly it's possible to get if we
let JIT do its job that optimal state is
higher it just takes longer to get to so
some caveats around this it is highly
experimental right now it only works on
64-bit Linux and the arguments you pass
to joao TC things like tier compilation
and garbage collector settings they have
to be the same between your a OT c call
and the java call that ultimately
ultimately consumes those Essos
so it's not straightforward to
pre-compiled things and then ship them
with libraries to customers right unless
you have full control over what their
Java command line is going to be so our
rating here yeah I don't know jury's
still out
I think that we may see since
experimental in in Java 9 maybe we'll
see it get better in 10 and 11 and
actually be something that's that's
useful to us
future work here is better benchmarking
actually see if we do have that
improvement in time to optimal
efficiency and then tooling around
making it a little easier to compile
these things so they left out quite a
few command line switches they had to
put in there to get it work and get it
to work it's a little a little fiddly
next thing I want to talk about is the
g1 garbage collector now that the G
one's been around since Java 7 so
technically it's not brand new but the
change in nine is that is they all the
default garbage collector and that
they've been issues with it since Java 7
that they either guess they're confident
that they fix those issues and are
making of the default GC so advantages
of that garbage collector if you're not
familiar with it are it basically breaks
your heap up into a bunch of blocks and
then sort of D fragments as it garbage
collects and moves garbage into blocks
and then you can say what you're willing
what your pause time is for your
applique it pause the garbage collect
and then it learns how many blocks you
can actually free during that time and
gets pretty good at hitting your target
every time the downside of that is if
you don't properly benchmark for your
particular garbage production profile
then you can produce more garbage than
the garbage collector can keep up with
hitting your target and so it'll
eventually have to pause the world and
do a full full sweep another cool
feature is when it does this
defragmentation process it can recognize
when multiple strings are identical
since strings in Java are immutable what
it does then is it takes all these
string objects it has an all-pro point
to one internal representation which is
a memory savings which would be I think
would be useful you would see savings
if you were doing possibly a lot of JSON
processing we had string keys and she
had the same key same strings over and
over and over so our rating is a
tentative thumbs up I think there's
still more work to be done on the g1
like benchmarking for with closure
because we do have a different garbage
profile than typical Java apps and
getting real world well real world
reports because I know there are some
people in the closure community that
already use g1 in production so because
those people folks could share what
they've learned about g1 now we're going
to move on to modules I'm gonna talk
about this for about the next three
hours so so the module system in Java 9
if you if you read their rationale for
why they wanted to do it it kind of just
deals down to these these these three
things one is they want to provide
stronger encapsulation be able to give
library authors and the JVM itself a
standard library more control over who
can see what write more so than what you
get with private and protected keywords
so so that's one motivation another is
an effort to make class loading more
deterministic so with the way works now
with the class path you can have
multiple things on the class path
provide the same class right and that
class path is searched sequentially so
if if we're if we are using the exact
same things on the class path but
they're in a different order we may get
different results because we may get a
different implementation of a class and
so their solution to that is the module
path where things on the module path
there can't be two things with the same
name of the module path and two things
on the module path cannot export the
same package so that's their kind of
their solution to make things
deterministic and finally they want to
be able to break up the standard library
into modules and allow library authors
to do the same thing so and they've and
Java nine ships with this new tool
called J link which allows you to make
these things called J mods which are
sort of basically smaller binaries right
and so the idea is that these would be
more
more usable on on smaller hardware IOT
style applications so those are kind of
the motivations so let's talk about what
modules actually are so it's a named
grouping of packages that specifies what
packages it exports and and specifies
what other modules it depends on and a
module really is just a jar file that
happens to have this module info duct
class at the top level which is a marker
that it's a module and is actually the
module definition itself and you can opt
in the modules you don't have you can
continue to use Java like you normally
do with class path and everything you're
getting nor modules except you can't
because when you opt-out of modules you
actually put you in the unnamed module
and there's changes that we are going to
impact you which we're going to talk
about so that module info duck class is
compiled from a module info Java so they
added additional syntax to support
modules because we all know you camp too
much syntax and so the what the module
looks like is it has a name so in this
case T Crawley fruit it requires two
modules one is Java dot sequel which is
part of that breaking up with the
monolithic standard library so now I've
got this Java sequel module and
requiring and everything implicitly
requires Java dot base I'm also
requiring this other external module
called plants and then I'm exporting to
packages so I may have other packages
inside this module that don't export so
they will not be visible to consumers of
my module but there's something missing
from this definition and that's versions
all right they explicitly said we're not
dealing with versions we're punting and
saying versioning is a build tool
problem right that's that's that's
that's that's not a Javas problem so how
do we use modules here is a Java command
line and we've got a couple of new
command line switches here we've got
this module path which is similar to the
class path except everything on it is a
module there's jar files and now if we
want to initialize from a module we have
to have this module switch that says
from the fruit module the apple package
loading
class so it looks it looks very similar
to what we're used to doing with the
classpath in the main and in fact since
those modules are just jar files that
happen to have a module in photo class
in them you can put them on the class
path and they'll work just like a jar
file does now so you can opt out of
modules and continue to use it like
you're used to so that's a really quick
intro to what modules are this next
section I want to talk about things that
are going to the potentially going to
break for you because of modules and
everything I'm going to talk about will
affect you whether you're opting in or
opting out of modules so if you're going
to say I don't care about modules I'm
going to opt out completely all the
stuff is still going to bite you
potentially so the first thing I'm going
to talk about is changes to the class
loader hierarchy so to do that I'm going
to talk about what it looks like before
Java 9 so we've got this hierarchy of
class loaders at the very bottom if you
use enclosure you've got you've got this
tree of dynamic class loaders which are
managed by closure for you and most the
time you don't to worry about those the
parent to that tree is provided by the
JVM that's the application class loader
it is an implementation of URL class
loader and is responsible for loading
everything from the class path above
that is an extension class loader also a
URL class loader it loads extensions or
what used to be called optional modules
and they're deprecated in Java some
version of early version earlier version
of Java and are removed completely in
Java 9 so we're not gonna worry about
what those are finally you have a
bootstrap class loader and so how this
works is you know each a class letter
has a parent and so if you call get
parent on the application class loader
it'll give you back a handle to the
extension class loader if you ask the
extension class letter who its parent is
it returns null even though there
actually is a class over there and
that's the bootstrap class loader it's
responsibility again before Java 9 is to
load everything from the Java standard
library and everything on the boot class
path and one important thing to know
about class loaders is the way
delegation works so if you ask a class
loader to load a class for you first
thing it does is it asks it's ok asks
its parent class loader if it can load
the class if the parent class loader
says no only then will that class loader
then try to find
class you're asking for the important
thing to know is that class letters have
no knowledge of their children so they
never ask downward into the in the class
letter tree or hierarchy to find a class
so what does it look under Java 9 it has
the same shape right looks very similar
enclosure things are still the same
dynamic class letters they're the
application class loader however is no
longer a URL class letter all we know
about it on the surface is that it
implements class loader it's now
responsible for loading JDK tooling
modules which are part of the broken up
standard library and loading things from
the module path and class path above it
instead of an extension class loader we
now have what's called a platform class
loader also an internal class it's
responsible for loading deep privileged
Java standard library modules these are
things that don't need full security
permissions to the full JVM finally
we've still got the bootstrap class
loader still can't get a handle on it at
runtime and it loads privileged Java
standard library module so things that
do need access to the full JVM and still
loads things provided on the boot class
path so why do we care about all that
well one reason is since those since the
application class loaders no longer a
URL class loader we can no longer easily
inspect it so there are closure
libraries like Java dot class path we'll
look at the application class loader and
tell you what your class path is they
can no longer do that easily and there's
also anything that uses Dino path down a
path is a set of protocols that lets you
read or modify class loaders and this
used by pomegranate cider anything that
tries to generally tries to modify the
class path at runtime will no longer be
able to do that at the application class
letter level so though there may need to
be some changes there to get things to
work like we're used to
under Java 9 another reason is issues
with the boot class path so closure can
no longer be loaded from the gnu
classpath and that is because closure
inse the closure dot instant namespace
relies on java sequel timestamp it
imports that
javis equal time stamp is now provided
by the Java sequel module which is a
deep privileged module so it is actually
not visible to the class loader so it's
a situation where now we can tweak the
whole Java standard libraries not
visible at that bootstrap level so and
since delegate since since bootstrap
will never ask the extension class later
for classes
it'll never see Java sequel timestamp so
why does that matter because things that
are on the boot class path skip bytecode
verification which which is
time-consuming so line again and other
command-line tools in all over the Java
space put themselves on the boot class
path to start up more quickly and that
that no longer is possible under Java 9
it doesn't affect boot because of
technical limitations of the way boot
does pods it can't have closure that
high in the class letter hierarchy
anyway so it can't it can't take
advantage of this boot class path pack
so there's an open issue in the closure
JIRA
2077 to discuss this but the first thing
that has to be decided is is this a use
case that closure even wants to support
like it it's never had to worry about it
because before now the Java standard
library has always been available at the
bootstrap level so you know the possible
solutions are don't support it which
isn't you know you just don't do this
anymore and now there is that closure
changes a little bit so that when you
loaded for the bootstrap class path
you're actually getting a slightly
crippled version closure possibly other
solutions would work too so let's talk
about reflection on module private
classes so what I mean by module private
is it's in a package that is not
exported about the module that contains
it that wraps it so here's an example
this distilled from dated XML the
closure or closure data XML so in this
case we have an XML import factory we're
creating an instance of the factory and
then we're calling create XML stream
reader on that factory this call is
reflective because closure doesn't know
the type of factory the way this is
an under job at 8 and lower this works
just fine under Java 9 you'll get this
you'll get an illegal access exception
complaining that you can't access this
particular implement internal
implementation class this is because new
instance returns an instance of XML
input factory but the actual
implementation is this internal class
which is not in an exported package so
how do we work around this problem one
is we type int like if we type int
factory they tell closure it's an XML
info Factory
it will be able to reflect because
what's happening is it's it's in the
previous case here it's actually calling
get class on the factory because it
doesn't know what class it is and it
gets back that it's this implementation
class and this so it gets this method
handle and it tries to invoke that
method handle but but the way part of
their encapsulation is setup is they
prevent you from invoking method handles
derived from classes that are internal
even if that method is comes you know is
inherited from a public implementation
or a public interface so if you type int
then closure knows that it's an external
input factory gets the method handle
from the XML input factory which is
legal for it to invoke but we don't
always want to have to type int it's
kind of annoying to have to type in just
to get things to work properly right and
also in this case data doc submit data
XML doesn't type int because create XML
stream reader has quite a few
implementations depending on the type of
input source you're providing it so
they've decided to just let reflection
happen here instead of implementing
every wrapper for every one of those
create XML stream reader methods so they
having to type in it's not ideal but
Java provides this new command line
switch ad exports and so what this is
saying is from the java xml module
export this internal stream package to
the unnamed module and this would allow
the previous code to work but for data
xml to work you actually have to do
three
different exports across three different
internal packages for it to work fully
this isn't ideal because data XML is a
library right so now as a consumer of
that library you as a user have to know
when I invoke Java I have to add these
add exports flags to my command line to
get that library to work but last week
they announced this new flag I'll permit
illegal access it's not it's actually
not in any early access builds yet I
suspect it'll be in early access 163 the
next build coming down the pipe they
also refer to this is the big kill
switch and what happens if you use this
flag is it a warned every time you do a
legal reflection to stand it out to let
you know you're doing something you
shouldn't be doing and it'll also be
removed in Java 10 they're saying this
is just for the job in our transition
period and you can't use it after that
and it only works if you're using the
unnamed module if you opt into modules
you can't do this anymore you have to do
the add exports trick another solution
is to change closure itself so there's a
patch on clj 2066 which changes it to
when it gets an illegal access exception
it walks the ancestor chain until it
finds method handle can actually invoke
so it slows down reflection slightly but
only in the case where you've already
hit this illegal access exception and I
think that searching is dwarfed by the
reflection costs anyway and if you care
about performance don't reflect right so
that's the the module private reflection
let's talk about a different type of
reflection that's when you're reflecting
on a private or protected fields and
methods and these are things that have
like the private or protected keyword so
here's some example code this basically
what this is doing is it takes a URL
class loader gets a handle to the add
URL method on it which is protected call
set accessible which makes it public and
then invokes it so what this is doing is
this modifying the clasp
it's adding jar a jar to the classpath
you can do this no problem under job
eight Java nine you'll get an
inaccessible object exception because
the module Java dot base which against
that the core of the standard library
does not open the java.net package to
the unnamed module and there's not much
we can do about this in code right we
can't work around this very much but
they do give us an ADD opens switch
which looks very similar to add exports
so where we can take and expose the
java.net package from java dot base to
at the unnamed module or whatever module
we're working with and I feel like this
is a little bit silly right because we
already have this speed bump of oh I'm
not I'm not advocating whether it's good
or bad to invoke private or protective
things but we do it sometimes right but
we have the speed bump up we have to get
the method handle we have to call set
accessible on it so we know what you
know we have this hurdle to get over
right but now they've just added another
speed bump in front of us which is the
add opens flag but it's worse because
again as a library author I can do
reflection and you as a consumer don't
have to know about it
now you have to know now you have to if
you're using my library you have to have
add this add opens flag so annoying but
there's the big kill switch again which
also opens this up for you and again
we'll print warnings every time you use
it so that's a bit about like a little
bit about modules and some of the pain
we're gonna see from modules but let's
talk about what modules do for us right
so here's a problem on wanted modules to
solve
I've got library a which depends on
fubar one oh right I've got library B
which depends on fubar - OH
fubar one oh and two are incompatible
with each other library a can't use two
library B can't use one but as a
consumer I want to use a and B I don't
care about fubar I can't do this right
but oh if I use OSGi I can do this not
that advocating anybody ever ever use
OSGi but you can do this Osei you can do
this with JBoss modules I wanted to be
able to do this with Java modules but
you can't Java modules doesn't let you
do this because when it has no concept
diversions and to the module path is
lat right so I can't have two food bars
on the module path Rich's answer would
be
don't call food bar one and two the same
thing they're different things so give
them different names but that's not the
world we live in unfortunately you could
try to say well I'm going to make a
fubar
fubar underscore one module and a fubar
underscore two module but then the
module system will complain because it
knows you're trying to version if you
put numbers on the end of module names
it says that that's that that's that's
not recommended it may be an error in
the future and you're still in the
situation where even if you name them
different things they're going to be
exporting the same packages you have to
Nate rename the packages - so what's the
problem it does solve so I try to come
make up a problem with the closure space
that like I could use modules for so
it's the situation where I've got
internal namespace and I want some
confidence that people aren't using an
internal namespace and I was like sorry
I think I just knocked something off the
mic the cover Keast you hear me okay
okay
so guardians internal namespace I want
some guarantees that nobody's using it
right so I can refactor it will change
whatever I want in there so I actually
got this working it there's a little bit
of work to get closure to run as a
module there's a few issues around it
but I got to work as a module exporting
this fruit banana package and I got
excited that I would not be able to
access their internal namespace but I
can no problem and and the reason why is
because there's if there's a few reasons
why but one is that if it's a clj file
closure doesn't load it as a class it
loads it as a resource and that and
there's this there's a loophole in the
encapsulation where you can load
resources inside modules without
actually having permission to do so and
also since since there are added exports
flags and since modules are just jars
and somebody can stick it on the class
path it gives me no guarantee or even
confidence that that people aren't using
my internal namespace so I'm in the
situation I'm in the same situation I'm
in now which is I just document hey
don't use this internal names
if you do double dumbass on you because
I just changed it right so so it doesn't
it doesn't give us a lot like the like
the only potentially compelling thing I
see about modules is the deterministic
class loading bit but I thought that's a
problem we've solved with tooling right
how often do you run to that problem if
we're both using Lonnegan we're getting
the same class path right so I mean
there's smart people we're into modules
they have their reasons it's just not
evident to me what the value of modules
is especially given the pain that we may
see from modules so if I want to guess
what the rating is for modules
yeah thumbs down my son loves this is
his new minecraft sweater he's got those
yellow swords over he's he loves it he
wears it all the time so another
possible benefit too is that that small
being able to make things that are a
smaller footprint these j-mods
but I think it's possible I mean I'm a
I'm not clear exactly on the
implementation how that all works but I
seem it seems like you could achieve
something similar by breaking things up
into jars and just loading the jars that
you care about right instead of trying
to load the whole Java standard library
if it was separate jars I could just
bring in pieces of it maybe so if we are
forced to or choose to embrace modules
in the future there's some potential
work one is getting closer to actually
work as a module there's this feature in
modules I didn't talk about which is
automatic modules and that's to help
with this transition period where you
can take a jar file throw it on the
module path and it will be wrapped in a
module automatically for you but the
same name as the jar but you can't even
do that we're currently with with
closure there's issues around resource
loading and class generation at runtime
they should prevent the closure from
working as a module guys shave runs done
some work on what it would take to
marginalize closure and he was very
helpful to me and preparing for this
talk and we also have opportunity for
tooling support around being able to use
modules as dependencies being able to
launch our Java command lines with a
module path and just being able to build
close
your libraries as modules if we choose
to do so so summary compact strings yay
multi release jars
yay alt compilation may be garbage g1
garbage collector at nata modules boo I
apologize that the prints don't match
and so in summary I record everybody to
test with Java 9 and see what problems
you run into if any there's a this issue
this repo on github that when the issue
tracker is kind of a clearinghouse for
issues I've discovered in various
closure libraries and closure itself so
this really links out to other issue
trackers the law protected libraries are
into closures issue tracker itself so if
you're running the problems come there
and see if it's a known issue and you
may see a workaround or potential
solution if it's not on the list at it
and so we can help each other out and
then the this really the only link you
need to pay attention to is this T
Carlita org j9c LJ that has some
resource notes or research notes from
preparing for this talk and has all the
other links in this talk as well so
thank you and I've got a few minutes for
questions everybody has any</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
