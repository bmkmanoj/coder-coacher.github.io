want to hear me yes okay my name is
Antonio Andrade and today I'm going to
be presenting to you some work that I've
done to put on top of the atomic the
title of the talk is building a data
platform with the atomic so the first
thing i should say is what exactly do i
mean by a data platform and what i mean
is a software system that defines a data
representation and abstracts its
persistence in retrieval and provides
tools to manipulate the data so in this
diagram where blocks represent either
consumers or producers you have the
hardware out the very lowest level
providing services to the operating
system and the operating system
providing other services and tools to
higher level layers so the talk is going
to be mostly focused on those two layers
the database layer and what I call the
infrastructure coat layer which some
people call code libraries or frameworks
or whatever codes people senior people
in your company right for other you know
application developers to consume so
that's what I'm going to be talking
about and so first of all I'm going to
introduce myself I'm a software
architect adaption happiness a software
company headquartered in reston not too
far from here and what we do is we have
a software platform that let other
people build and configure applications
and then from those applications on top
of that platform now when a company
wants to buy software they have you know
three main options one is to build them
build a software themselves if they have
an IT department you know maybe they can
do it second one is maybe they want to
hire a consultancy company to build a
product for them right the third option
and the option that a peon provides is
we give you the tools we give you an
application
platform for you to build applications
design applications on top of it so our
customers build their own apps and they
design their own date models on top of
the platform now the system is is highly
dynamic as you can imagine and most of
the configuration and things that we do
happen at runtime which means that we
cannot make too many modeling decisions
beforehand we do not know what our
customers are going to use our platform
form we have customers and health
insurance insurance financial
applications you know commercials and
and government agencies so that's the
challenge and so you may wonder where a
paean to gets all this power from and
I'm going to try to describe it really
fast appian is a transactional system it
has a very rich day in the model its
supports arbitrary arbitrary structures
not like the atomic which supports a
navy schema we have a very strong data
manipulation in in query language which
is a variant of APL Mike Anderson was
talking about core matrix yesterday was
talking about the APL and we we use a
language called k which is a variant of
AAPL is an array processing language so
we get the power of the data
manipulation and query from there the
atomic gets it from data log mainly now
data consistency means we can also issue
multiple queries on a single data
snapshot which means the programming
model that we follow is very similar to
the one that the atomic provides you now
the Tommy gives you this through in your
ability right if you make a query to the
database and you you want to keep making
queries to the to the database and and
make sure that all those queries are
looking at a consistent snapshot you can
do it because of in your ability we
with we don't do it through in your
ability we have the same programming
model which is very powerful then we
have performance we use a high speed in
memory column-oriented data store and we
also provide an embedded programming
language in the platform so a lot of
these similarities between the Appian
platform and some of the characteristics
of the atomic and that's the point of
the talk so what I'm going to try to do
is use my experience and expertise on
this type of system and try to describe
to you how would I build a similar
system using what the atomic provides
right so we're going to focus a lot on
the data model and this is the roadmap
we're going to talk about schemas and
the in models then we're going to over
always look a little bit at the diatomic
data model then we're going to go very
deep into way that you can use or decide
to generate the schema that is cell
self-described and this is very
important because it doesn't necessarily
apply to the atomic but you can you can
take a lot of this input and use it on
your own project we're going to see some
techniques for doing data versioning and
migration data constraints enforcement
and then what what means what it means
for diatomic to have a rarefied reified
transactions okay so first of all what
is the data model data model i think is
a conceptual thing every system has a
data model whether or not is explicitly
defined or its its its implicit on the
data that is being recorded in the data
support the data model exists regardless
and it just describes the structure and
of the objects on those systems and the
relationship between those objects now
regardless of what everyone you may
think about schemas I think danimals
have really powerful or provide a really
powerful come
education tool and documentation and
schema is a way to represent these data
models so I talked a little bit about a
peon and if I if there's something that
I would like you to take from this talk
is that you know I think data models are
at the core of data platforms if you get
your data model wrong then so this is a
real photo of an oil platform it's in
the nori Norwegian Sea it's called
dragon and when I look at software
systems I sometimes like to look at this
picture and you know that's your data
model but I call the data platform is is
that thing that is on top of that data
model and the rest of the application
code this is what you see on top now if
you're working at the application code
level is really difficult to see the
problems that you run into when you try
to expand or make changes just right so
it's not very cost-effective to go and
do something about that data model that
was decided very early on right there is
no much room to build on top of on top
of this flat platform now one thing I
you know wanted to separate this is a
data model is a mental map of the object
relationships on your system which is
separate from a physical schema that you
may encounter when whenever you you're
dealing with databases right so this is
a messy if you will database schema but
it doesn't mean that the data model is
not it's not that messy it only means
that people don't like to be working
with this type kinds of systems but
schemas are really good for performance
they are a great
documentation tool especially if you
work in a company that are bringing is
bringing new people the new hires really
appreciate the fact that there's there
is some way for them to figure out what
what the data model is how to interact
with the system so it is great for the
documentation it's good for enforcing
data construct contractors as we saw in
in a talk yesterday and it is really
good as a reflective reflection API on
very dynamic systems it seems it may
seem counterintuitive but I think in my
experience the moon the most the more
dynamic a system is the more important
it becomes that you have a schema
doesn't mean that it has to be if you
know hard coded it just just means that
you pay more attention to it because you
can get a lot more information from from
what the system is is doing a runtime
which otherwise you wouldn't get and
they're good for cogeneration yesterday
someone someone was talking about how
they were generating code based on the
schemas we also do the same thing we
have native platforms or engines iOS and
Android and the web and we for
convenience we can take those animals
and generate static classes or people
like to be working with some people like
to be working with static typing and it
makes junior developers understand and
the code faster and be more productive
but schemas are also really bad when the
structure needs to change so can you
imagine wanting to change that or to do
an upgrade it's probably not going to be
very easy so the key on all day and all
this is is adaptability which is
something that we that I think that the
atomic provides really well and the key
part here is that the application code
is the one that should be
deciding what the shape of the data is
whenever we make queries to bring the
data back from the from the back end and
so a system that requires live data
migration to reshape the structure of
the data or to you know reach our door
to do other other kind of stuff is is
not very adaptable and I think that in
general if you're building a system like
this you should try to avoid building
something on systems that only lets you
make where is efficient queries against
data that was stored in a certain way
that's I think what one of the
disadvantages of document store or
schema-less databases they will let you
put anything on the database the problem
is not storing the data the problem is
that whenever you want to retrieve the
data it's hard to get it in a different
shape than that the shape that it was
put in so let's jump into the atomic
data model this is the basic API that
you would use to install new datums into
the system and in this line board just
requiring a an API and then we get our
connection to the database and we
finally with that connection we can
transact a bunch of datums well datums
are our database is a fact it's a
addition or retraction of our relation
between an entity and attribute value
and a transaction so in this case you
can see that we can either add or
retract facts and we have to give an
entity to the system an attribute in
this case we have an entity with an
attribute called person name and person
aged a value and finally transaction the
atomic
doesn't you know show this initially but
what what really happens is every time
you make a transaction there is a new
entity created in a partition call TX
for transaction which captures the
instance of time in which that those set
of datums were storing the database so
you can always get from a transaction
you can always get all the datums that
were added or retracted from the
database and been given any entity you
can always know or find out where which
transaction that entity came from
they'll be very important later as Alex
plane and there is a shorthand notation
this is important because I'm going to
be showing a lot of this example so this
and these are basically the same thing
your word transacting to datums john age
25 and the first key differentiator
differentiator of the atomic is that
attributes are facts or data and you
install them into the database just as
you would install any other entity
attribute Association so here we are
defining or installing an attribute
attributes have a name a type and
accordion ality and you can install them
on the fly and something that people
don't realize initially I didn't
understand this initially but but
attributes have free associations with
entity you can you can create an entity
that have you know there's a person and
has a car top speed and computer
keyboard which doesn't make any sense
right but the idea is that the platform
allows you to do this and usually the
convention is you know if some entity
has an association with a person as last
name attribute then that means that that
thing that entity is a person so right
so the
those are conventions that we give when
we work with the atomic 22 to give types
do to those these entities the problem
is that if I ask you what you know what
what's the schema or what's the animal
of this entity I'm not sure so what I'm
going to show you next is a way to
define a higher level schema that
provides reflect a reflective API on top
of what the atomic provides and this is
again important if you are building a
dynamic system where data mouth
decisions don't don't happen when you
code the application they happen after
you deploy deploy it and this is what we
use adapt bein this is what the data
core data model looks like it has a dte
stands for data type we have a data type
that represents the the type of the
entity namespace and name mainly for
this application purposes this is
usually driven by customer data if the
customer wants to name their data moles
whatever they want they can use these
attributes we have a parent attribute to
create type hierarchies a list and a
component attributes to create
multi-dimensional lists and a phils
attribute that represents what what do
you think it is so
this DT attribute is more or less
equivalent to a doublet class that you
would do an object-oriented programming
right if you have any object you can
always get its class from from calling
that method this is the an analogy and
when an entity this is just when an
entity contains an association with
these attributes I'm going to call it a
typed entity right it has a type that
entity has a type and you can think of
it as if an entity doesn't have this
attribute is another was more or less to
a map and if it does is more or less
analogous to a type right you can get
information from it namespace is
analogous to a class package name and
it's used mainly to resolve naming
collisions a name is a local name or
less and now goes to class that simple
class name parent is analogous to get
super class and it's used for building
data type hierarchies list is used to
support multi-dimensional values that or
order generated at runtime right so the
example below you can see that Java
raised do not exist until you actually
need to create them so the JVM creates
new class definitions as you reference
this this array multi-dimensional arrays
the same the same we're gonna do here a
component which is the opposite if you
have a class array class you can always
get its items type by getting the
component type and the fields which is
what you imagine the fields of the data
type right properties so this is this is
a summary of what we just looked at it's
the basic reflective API that Java gives
you just translated into the atomic
attributes now we're going to go through
an example and we're going to see how
this is actual
applied imagine what you have again this
person instance that we started with has
a name and an age right nothing tells
you that those attributes are actually
associations that are supposed to be
bound to this this instance they're just
they're just there so what would happen
if we add an attribute Association right
if we add a hint that points back to
some type information well suddenly we
have a typed entity which gives us a
little bit more information when when
we're dealing with this type of entities
right but where is this being defined or
constrained by well if you define a
person data type which is no nothing
else that an entity with an attribute
data type attribute whose value is also
the data type attribute right so this
represents both an entity and the sort
of a definition of a data type we can
see that we have a namespace in the name
just name them and then fields that
represents what the instances of these
data types are supposed to contain and
then here we go up layer above we have a
data type data type which is a metamodel
this is both an entity that represents a
data type definition and an instance of
itself and that the atomic lets you do
things like this is it's pretty cool
it's what actually makes I think the
system data modeling are in the atomic
very very powerful so we're going to go
through this analysis really quick we
have a 90 at
that's the identifier in the system
right that points to the attribute that
we just define and I previously say it
said that when that DT / DT attribute
appears as a value that means that the
entity is a data type so this is a data
type data type it has a namespace and if
you see here the field or defining the
its its own structure right so we have a
namespace because the field says that
instances of data type must have a
namespace attribute we have a name we
don't have current list and
componentized but doesn't matter and we
have fields which points back to its
site the same entity right so this is
the definition of a map metamodel to
work with with data types now this is a
graphical representation and the number
one that's or person instance it has an
attribute data type attribute pointing
back to its person data type entity that
person data type entity number two has a
fields attribute those fields attribute
contains the definition of that instance
right so it it has a dt attribute and
name NH in a weight and if you take that
person data type and go back again we
reach the data type data type and is the
same is the exact same model which means
that whenever you reach that made the
model you have a model that describes
itself now okay so how do we use this
well we can start creating more complex
or higher level data models we can start
defining data type hierarchies if you
have a data type and you have a parent
attribute that points to another data
type they then you can suddenly model
type hierarchies
here we assume that that students cool
attribute was previously defined nothing
that we haven't seen and here is the
graphical representation or what we just
model you have a number one as to the
instance which has fields that are
coming from both the person data type
and the student data type right so this
is so think for a second what this means
it means that if you have a student
instance that would otherwise be a
complete it would all otherwise be a map
right even you wouldn't necessarily know
what the structure or the spected
structure of that instance would be once
you have this data type attribute you
can go back and look at what the
definition of that the student instance
is supposed to to be which is really
powerful in a dynamic system you you
really need this hint in order to either
you know generate meaningful data for
the ultimate user imagining I don't know
you are creating a UI an interface and
you start with the student instance
right well if you're representing a form
that's supposed to capture data then how
are you supposed to know what other
fields you're going to show in the form
for the for the end user to populate
right you you couldn't know unless you
had a schema or a dynamo for that
instance so this is this is powerful now
those are data type hierarchies next we
have multi-dimensional values and here
we have two entities one on the top that
defines a few attributes
the component attribute points to the
datatype entity and the the list
attribute on that entity points back to
this and to this entity so this is
showing that this is necessary because
the atomic provides bi-directional
references so this link between two
entities you really don't only have to
model one relationship but this is here
for completeness and this entity on the
top is more or less analogous to a
person array if you will if you're
dealing with a person data type but you
can go even further than that and define
a person a multi-dimensional person
linking the entity on the top that we're
just creating with a new entity that
creates that that link between those and
you know this is the visual
representation of what we just created
let's start with number one you create a
simple data type then you generate a
array type of that data type and you can
go up and up and generate
multi-dimensional data types and then
for each number three and number six
here if you follow the reference from
number six here so you know that the
value of this instances is going to have
this shape at the shape of the data type
that this instance is pointing to and
you can traverse that the relationship
to understand what what the the data
looks like so you can imagine you can
once you have this information this tie
pins then you can create functions or
rappers that having arbitrarily nested
data structures enclosure can actually
go and immediately persist that data in
the database the atomic that only
provides like one layer
multi-dimensional values other than that
you have to build something yourself
like this
one thing I think is maybe lacking from
the atomic danimal is the notion of an
any type or a variant type which means
you sometimes at the same time you you
don't know what the type of the data is
going to end up being and the atomic
provides all the primitive types and
reference types but other than that
doesn't let you it doesn't provide
choice groups or unions for you to to
say okay this attribute is going to be
either a string or a reference there are
some some times what you actually need
to do that so this is a way to get
around that which is a little painful
but the idea here is you define an
attribute and then a bunch of because
I'm enumeration values or a bunch of
other attributes actually that represent
every single type that you can hit in
the system actually there are not that
many all the primitive types plus the
reference right so in the okay it's not
working but you can see that dots in the
in the bottom that means that you have
to replicate that actually for each of
the known data types to the atomic and
the definition according to our type
system or schema system would look like
this right you would have a data type
called any and its fields would be any
other known data types for the atomic
and you will need to make sure that at
runtime only one of them is populated
other otherwise it wouldn't make sense
right and something related to this is
is the concept or of typed reference
typed references in the atomic you if
you have a reference you don't know what
that thing is actually pointing to you
only know that is an entity but you
don't know necessarily what the type of
that entity is so because attributes or
facts and data and you can associate
attributes with attributes themselves
you can add hint type gains here to say
that
this specific reference is of this type
right is of any use of typing is a
variant type and the diagram again looks
something like this where that person
metadata on green is really a pointer to
a bunch of any instances and they can
this is another low so I guess if you
will to the metadata support for in
enclosure so you can have any arbitrary
data structures attached to one entity
so this is a way to do this in the
atomic now this is that's only one of
our problems the opponents are much more
difficult to solve one of them is a data
versioning and schema changes so for a
second we're going to pretend that we
have a person a data type version 2 for
person and we are going to add an
additional field person weight and this
this really means that this attribute is
an optional attribute and all the
existing the existent person instances
in the database are still valid you know
that they just don't have that value
that's fine the problem really happens
when you have a well you can see this as
an automatic automatic migration like
adding a table 2 column to a table
everything is not allowed no problem
with their right but if you there are
other cases where you need to make other
changes to the schema that do affect
existing instances so imagine that you
need to have health insurance attribute
to that person entity and you want to
make that mandatory well the problem is
that
that whenever you add that health
insurance attribute to the person that
is no longer optional in our inner
system and which means that existing
person instances are no longer valid you
know the atomic is not going to do
anything is not going to crash or
anything but it just means that our
intended meaning has been violated
because now there are persons in the
database that have no insurance well how
do we fix it well there is a very
powerful tool in the atomic and that's
the ability for you to persist or use
database functions just as you can have
a attribute of type string you can add
an attribute that of type function and
you can have that function receive a
database and the entity that you want to
modify and then generate whatever
information you need to make in this
case a person instance a valid one so
the idea here is that you or someone
would define how to take something how
to take an instance of something that is
invalid and then make it valid in this
case we're just hard coding the health
insurance to you know to something just
to make it value but you can imagine
that you could if you're if you
initially model a person's name first
name last name and then suddenly you
realize that you relieved that they want
to do that and you want to create a
single one full name let's say for some
reason that you could write a migration
function that would do that for you and
the whole point is that
this type of attributes are just like
any other attribute in the system and
then your application could I could take
this information and do something about
and new entities being transacted in the
system that violate this constraint
right you could run this migration to
set the data to a valid state again well
the problem is how when do you decide to
validate and how do you suck do this do
you decide to do it you can every time
you in this model every time you add an
required attribute you must also specify
a migration function otherwise there
wouldn't be any default value to assign
to all the instances and what you can do
also is enforced that new entities
created contain this required attribute
and how you would you do that well you
would write your own transact function
that is wrapping the original and that
it would do this checks now the biggest
problem is to the side went to my grade
you could potentially do the migration
on the fly at the query time imagine you
have a query that returns a bunch of
persons and your application code is
depending on the fact that they have a
health insurance so what do you do do
you code that logic on your application
code to make sure that it doesn't fail
what you could do that but the points
that you could do it at you could run
this migration function at query time
but in this case the atomic doesn't let
you use migration database functions as
I showed you as rules inquiries so it
would be more complicated than that you
could fix the data migration time but if
you made queries they could return
invalid data you could do the migration
every time you ask for an attribute
relative you have an abstraction on top
of the atomic and someone asked for a
person's health insurance at that moment
you can figure out that okay so that
instant doesn't have
health insurance and you would you could
use the transaction from the database
function to calculate it you could also
use our background processing tasks but
that would only eventually consistent
eventually fix your your instances in
the in the database or you could unless
the sword you could manually do it in
application code the point is that this
hints this information are there for
someone to take an action on them the
way one way to enforce arbitrary data
constraints is to use this same database
functions this is an example of an
enumeration in the atomic you have a
person gender and then you have two
entities of represent female and male
which means that right now in the atomic
you could do this you could add a you
could add a person gender and map it to
something completely arbitrary right
this that will work there's not a
problem with it but how do you fix it if
you really want to make sure that that
doesn't happen in your system well you
write a database function not going to
go through through through this but this
is a function that giving a new value
make sure that that falls into one of
the valid valid constraints so you have
to whenever you define database
functions you have to give it a name you
have to add some information and when
the entities are being transacted you
have to look them up look the correct
values on the database and fail this
transaction if that if that doesn't
match and here you could use the exact
same syntax almost using the eighth
foreign key function and this will make
sure that that transaction would fail
last I want to talk very briefly about
refi transactions which is the ability
to attach information to the
transactions themselves mugging you have
a audit trail or you require another
trail where you have to retract
you have someone retracting information
from the database but you probably want
to know who did that right so you can
instrument the code to add additional
information to the transaction in this
case it gives you back the username that
is performing the operation and it gives
an audit trail of in this case which
which retracted that information and you
can add a lot of more information to it
I think that's it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
