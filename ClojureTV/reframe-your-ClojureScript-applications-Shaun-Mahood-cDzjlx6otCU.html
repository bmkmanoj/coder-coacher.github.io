today I'm gonna be talking to you about
reframe which is a closure script
framework for writing single page
applications and my goal for this talk
is to give you enough of a background
and enough knowledge that you can get
started building your own applications
with reframe right away you'll still
have to go back to the docs and things
because it's only 40 minutes and I can't
cover quite everything but should be a
pretty good start at least so instead of
showing a presentation I thought it
would be a little more fun for us to
build one runway there we go
so we're starting with a blank closure
script file here and I've got all the
CSS built already so we don't have to
deal with that and first thing we're
gonna do is just add our name space and
a few dependencies so we have to include
reagent for anything that's going to be
rendering views because that's what it
that's what reframe uses for all your UI
definition and we're gonna include
reframe because it would be a terrible
reframe talk otherwise and then there's
a library here reef risk which is
relatively new and immature but the
developer has been doing a lot of great
work with it and it's very easy to add
quick visualizations and then spec
because I went to the workshop and it's
kind of fun and then we have this as
views as well that is just a little bit
of helper stuff I don't want to throw in
the same file and I'm gonna I'm cheating
by using cursors live templates or
IntelliJ is live templates so we're
gonna start by defining a few reagent
components so we've got our main one
which is this slideshow and then our
title slide and a vector of slides that
we can move back and forth between and
if you've never used anything with with
a hiccup markup before you know it
pretty much as HTML you replace your
angle brackets with square brackets and
kind of squint and you can pretend
you're just doing normal web development
and we need to add sorry we just need to
add something to render to our screen so
we use this reagent render method and it
takes any valid reagent component and if
i refresh the page we get our first
slide up here but I hate having to
refresh the page so we're gonna put in a
fig wheel with this on j/s load hook
it's all built into the project clj and
this run function is what we're calling
straight from our HTML so if i refresh
it again we've got now live updates with
fig wheel and I've added this reef risk
into it and we're gonna keep going with
adding some of our views I guess so I'm
going to add this footer for our slides
and then we're gonna replace our title
slide so that we actually have some sort
of controls and let's see I just have to
reorder things a bit and is is the the
code on the side is that big enough for
everyone yeah perfect
so now we've got these forward and back
buttons but they don't do anything I've
got them hooked to these reframe
dispatch functions but we haven't built
those yet so we should probably figure
out what we're doing so I'm gonna add an
extra slide here and just replace this
with our intro slide so we've got our
sort of classy marketing spiel here but
I'm not a huge fan of marketing so I'm
gonna cheat a bit here and we're gonna
add a bunch of slides down to the bottom
that I've already prepared
clean up some of these let's see what's
duplicated this is about my favorite
thing about the new fig wheel because I
make a lot of mistakes when I'm building
any way out and since we don't know how
to actually use reframe yet I'm just
gonna cheat some more and start moving
through the slides manually so when
we're building a single page app
mutation is fundamental to everything we
do we have to change our Dom change our
application state and most of the time
we want to interact with the world
somehow so we're gonna be changing
things on our local machine like local
storage and cookies in the browser and
then we're gonna be making calls to
api's and databases and particularly
when we don't control those this is like
a nightmare of you mutation and we have
to build that into our app somehow but
we also really want to program
functionally so we want to be changing
our Dom functionally which thankfully
react was invented we can do that we
want to change our application state
functionally and we have all the power
of closure to do that and changing the
world functionally is a little bit
trickier so we need to move all that
mutation out to the very edges of our
systems so when we're building what our
business or our clients want we don't
have to think about it all the time so
we're gonna look at sort of the basics
of how reframe works and primarily how
do we get change moving through our
system so reframe is an event based
system and if no events are happening
the page is just gonna sit there so what
we'll do whenever an event occurs we're
gonna dispatch or whenever an action
occurs so whether it's a user clicking
something or something returning from an
API or calling calling our set page
we're gonna dispatch an event and
there's a couple things to know about
events
in reframe one of them is that it is the
only way you should be changing anything
in your system if you start mutating
things directly it it's going to get
more and more unpleasant as your
application grows and the other thing
that's great about event dispatch is
we're dispatching data so all we're
gonna send is a vector with our event ID
and whatever arguments we want in there
and so that gets sent into reframes
central event router which is then which
is sort of got an asynchronous first in
first out queue and when it goes to
actually process that event it's not
going to execute any of the effects
you've told it to do so if you're
telling it to update the database it
doesn't immediately action that it's
going to return a map with keys in this
case it's gonna be a database key and
it's gonna tell you what you what effect
you want to have on it so again when we
run these these event handlers we're
getting data out the end and we do have
to realize those effects at some point
but reframe handles that all for us so
it's gonna go how whatever whatever
you've defined or the system is defined
for you for how to execute those effects
reframes gonna do it in the background
you don't really have to worry about it
and so one of the expectations is after
those effects are realized most of the
time your application state will have
changed so we want a way for our
application state to go and change our
views and reframe does this all
reactively so we're going to define some
queries on our app state to say this is
the part of the data that I care about
and whenever the application state
changes those query functions are going
to rerun and they're gonna push out some
more data they're gonna compute our
reagent views and update that hiccough
data so again we're not worried about
actually executing any
facts even inside our system those
computed views are they going to be
pushed by reagent out to react which is
going to realize those changes and move
them into the DOM and our system then is
back at rest and waiting for the next
event to occur so to get started writing
a reframe app we have a few things we
need to do so we're going to define our
views which we've already done a couple
of we want to define the initial shape
of our application state and this is one
of the places that you have a lot of
leeway but as your app gets bigger you
can start adding things like spec into
the initial app State so you can make
sure that everything is well-formed
you can also in this step go and pull
things out either
maybe you're pulling something from
local storage or calling some other API
to populate your initial data after that
we're gonna register the events we want
to run on our on our page and the
queries we want to run to populate our
views then last the last two things we
kind of do are just that final plumbing
so we're gonna link those queries into
our views so we can populate them and
link the events so that our users can
actually do something so we're gonna do
here we're gonna add in our initial
application state so we're going to set
it our current slide to zero and we're
gonna start registering our events so
this first event you'll see it we've
defined we've got that unique ID which
is a name spaced because this was I kind
of clean these up after rich and stew
stock so now everything's name spaced I
think and and then your function takes
as an input context and we don't
directly supply that context it occurs
as a result of what's in our system and
what we dispatch in our event so if I
were to run this right now
nothing happens I've no visibility on
what's going on and I'll zoom in a bit
on here
so we can see in in reef risk it gives
us this automatic view of our app DB
which is where all your applications
data is stored but we can also add data
to it so we can do kind of the sort of
sprinkling our code with all the debug
statements we want so if I addy
add this in here I'm just gonna add some
data which is going to show us what's in
that context and if we expand this we
can see it's getting in this DB key
which is your application database sorry
this is a difficult to move around but
and then it's also getting our event
vector which we've just passed in the ID
so because we have all the power of
closure here we can D structure this and
give it a little better of a debug view
see I might have messed something up
here but we're gonna try and dispatch
this again there we go
so now we've got our context broken up
into this event and DB as well which
makes it a little bit easier to deal
with and if you've used the previous
reframe this is essentially what was
passed into the old versions of
registering the event you just got your
database in your event keys and what
we're gonna do here now is add some
output to this I'm just gonna get rid of
the old one and so what we've done what
I've done here is I've added aspect to
say is my current slide in integer
because that's what we need and then if
it is we're gonna pass back a map of
what we want our new database to look
like
so I'm going to take whatever the
existing database is and a so sin this
current slide if the slide number is
less than the total count of slides
we're going to increment it and if not
we're just going to return what we had
and if speck returns an error we're
gonna just display this this error
message so if I were to dispatch this
right now you'll see my application
state has nothing in it so I get this
speck here but well I get this thing I'm
calling a speck error but it's not
actually a speck error and tells us
gives us this message it's not a valid
and so we need to initialize our data in
order to actually start working with it
so I'm just going to register this other
event slide to initialize we're going to
D structure it so we're just worried
about the database and we're just going
to replace it with this initial state
and so we've gotten our slideshow
current slide is zero if I rerun this
you'll see it now increments I don't get
my spec error anymore so we know our
data has initialized successfully all
right now what we're gonna do is just
replace this run command here so that
along with certainly setting up a reef
risk and mounting our route it's also
going to initialize our or application
state so i refresh this and we zoom in
again it's all there
so we've got our next slide event I am
gonna want to go back again in case we
go back and forth so I'm just add a
matching a matching event to move to the
previous slide now we can now move move
back and forth in our app dB
and we can we can do this as well with
our buttons they're all wired up
properly but our views aren't changing
at all so we need to get those
subscriptions in there and link them up
so I'm gonna register a subscription
that just queries our app DB says give
me the key that matches this slideshow
current slide and return that value and
again this subscription is returning
data so we don't you know you can do
whatever you want with it and this is um
this is probably my favorite part of
reframe is that every single step
through the system you've got a function
you're returning data that data goes
into another function and and there's
nowhere where you really have this
uncontrolled mutation which when I do
this myself
I usually cheat and I'll have a couple
functions here where I was too lazy to
make it really nice so we're gonna come
in here and start wiring up this our
slideshow of you there we go so I'm just
gonna replace this here and you can see
all we have to do is dereference a call
to reframe subscribe we'll pass in the
subscription ID that we want to return
and this is another area where if you've
used the previous version of reframe
before 0.8 this was not really a thing
you could do the developers have taken
it and they've they've kind of really
revamped the subscriptions under the
hood so now they are really are now a
deduplicated signal graph that
instantiates the only when you're
looking at those particular
subscriptions so it's it's kind of cool
particularly because it means I can be a
little lazier when I'm doing things so
when we look at it now we can actually
move around in our application and what
we want to do now is start growing our
app larger than this starting prototype
and there's a few ways that reframe
gives you that make it really nice to
sort of decompose things and then put
them back together so that you're always
working with something that is
understandable and all your
cross-cutting concerns can be moved out
into other areas and again because it's
all data you can test those all those
portions as much as you want in
different ways there's as well it's all
written in C ljc and one of the
companies who's using it heavily has
really invested in the testing tools so
they're testing all of their events and
I believe all their subscriptions using
closure not closure script so the runs a
lot quicker you don't have to deal with
anything you know that is try trim okay
I can't remove the name of it but some
of those other testing libraries for web
apps are not fun so the ways we have to
grow our application one of them is with
Co effects and it took me quite a while
to understand these but they're not
difficult so all it is is if an effect
is the thing you are doing to the world
a co effect is what that effect needs in
order to run so it would be whatever
parameters you've got you can pass them
in through this Co effect and this
website is really good he does not sure
how to pronounce his name but he does
he's doing his PhD and parts of it on Co
effects and one of the really
interesting things about it is you can
you can sort of inject
things about the world so your function
never has to worry about them and and
one of the examples he's got on his site
is GPS coordinates so you can pull them
from your phone your app just has them
there when it starts the other side of
that is we can define our own effects so
the only effect we've used so far is
this database effect which updates the
state of our database but there are
there are other built-in effects and
there's effect libraries already
available for reframe and one of them in
particular is for HTTP requests so
rather than having to build your request
writing to your functions you simply add
this this key HTTP effects you pass it
in some data and it does all the work
for you and I've done some stuff where
I've then further wrapped that with my
own effect so I don't even have to pass
in my API location or anything like that
and it makes it really nice to sort of
just decompose all of those concerns and
the last one that we've got here is
interceptors which are very similar to
middleware but they give you a little
bit more power so we're going to look at
how we use those and let me go right
here
so what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna
add an interceptor that does my logging
into reef risk for me so we pass it in
and I an ID which is optional but it is
kind of nice
and then and then we build a before
function and this is going to run before
our regular event hat Handler and we
build an after function and both of
these are optional so you can do one or
the other and so what I'm going to do
here is just when my before handler runs
I'm gonna pop out my context at that
point and when the after function
function runs I'm gonna pop out the
contacts there
all right so I moved back now and so
what you can see is that in here
somewhere there we go
so I've got this event log which it's
it's popped out my event ID previous
slide and my before I've got you can see
my interceptors can see the co effects
which is our context you can see the co
effects that were there before that funk
that handler run and then it's also got
two things in here we've got a stack
which is all of the handlers or effects
or whatever Co effects everything that's
run beforehand and I'm not sure of the
particular order in this view but you
can go through and you can say okay
what's already happened do they have a
before or after function and easily find
that in your code then we've also got
here a queue of things that are gonna
run after this particular handler went
so it's very nice particular or I use it
generally for logging but you can also
affect those things in your interceptors
so in our before interceptor we can mess
with the context and we can inject more
things in we can pull things out you
know you can doesn't mean you're gonna
always make good decisions about it but
at least we have the power to do that
and what I'm gonna do here as well is
we're gonna look at oh and sorry I
didn't I didn't cover this part but if
you look at these functions now all my
logging is out of here so my event
doesn't have to worry about logging
except for adding this logging
interceptor and if we wanted to add that
through our entire system what we could
do is just wrap the event registry
function and add that interceptor to
everything we called and then run
not in our development mode with
whatever logging or a testing we want
pull it out in production and you're
just running happily so I'm going to add
another interceptor here oops
oh there we go no I'm I'm just mixed up
about the order sorry what I'm gonna do
first is I'm gonna change my initial
state here so we have this other key to
test with because if I if I mess with
this current slide
nothing's gonna render to the page so
this is kind of my lazy way of
simulating a screw-up so I'm gonna just
replace these events again and you see
now I'm just passing in two interceptors
so we're we're gonna move all of our
spec checking out there and not not have
to worry about it in our event and so so
now I've got in here all of my spec
handling and if I if I run my run my
application and and it's working you can
see I get this I get a spec here but I
shouldn't
I think that's just a bad definition on
my side but what I can do is simulate in
here I'm gonna look at my broken slide
instead and this should give me a spec
error for sure really all right I might
have to just you might have to take this
on faith or I can show you after because
I made a mistake here though an
essentially but essentially what it
should be doing here
sorry no the ID doesn't matter on these
I think I I must have just in copy and
paste mode before the talk messed it up
but what it what you can do here is I
can I don't know I'm gonna do is I'm
negative I'm gonna run my I have a
complete application here that should
work
so when the when I'm checking this speck
I'm gonna I'm gonna switch it to this
broken slide here and when I try and
move here all right sorry about that um
what you can do essentially is when I
run into this error I can clear my
entire queue here so along with sending
back whatever messages you can also say
none of the following events are going
to run at all so it gives you a lot of
power to say how do you want to handle
errors do you want to kind of just warn
do you want to log it do you want to
stop the whole system and the other
thing we're gonna take a quick look at
here is how do what we can do with Co
effects just can get our slideshow back
so so there's this demo application on
the reframe site which is doing a to-do
app and one of the and it's it's got a
pretty good set of specs in here and if
you're interested in that part you can
take a look and see how they've done it
what it what it also is doing is it's
storing to local storage so if we want
to declare our own Co effects what would
do is we do this register Co effects and
here he's just reading in the - dues
from the local store and you know in the
in the function where we're actually
setting those up you can either put
those Co effects as part of an
interceptor or you can find it here
yeah or you can just inject it directly
so they're they're injecting these Co
effects and then also running the spec
interceptor and so that's essentially
all you need to know to get started with
reframe there's tons of stuff on the
docs I
they're good videos on lambda Island
that he's recently released purely
functional TV has one kind of one hour
with reframe and if you're if you're
coming from the world of reagent most of
what you're used to
it's probably doing that stuff under the
hood so you don't have to worry about
how you're wiring your application
together you can still build your
reagent components with local atoms you
can put cursors in if you want and do
more complicated local stuff but you
really want to be using reframed for all
of your application level organization
communication everything along those
lines and that is all the material I
have for today
so thank you very much for coming to the
talk and I'll take questions after</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
