sparks an Innovation Lab for staples and
we were no one has run out before after
acquisition that's our new name and I'm
here to peach why you should consider
working with us somebody suggested that
I should you know we first of all I
really thank cognate tack arranging
closure cons and we're proud to be the
sponsor and speaking of cognate at we do
work with guys from cognitive and
somebody suggested that I should
register fake rich Kiki calm and I'm
really considering it seriously sorry I
got to talk to rich before I do that I
guess anyway so what I would like to
talk here today is basically I'd like to
you can find out a lot of details our
who we are what do we do and our culture
vision all that an hour sparks calm
website there are brochures and stuff
but what I would like to briefly mention
is our tax stack our tech culture and
our vision so that if any of those rings
a bell to you or you have any other
suggestions that we can do better than
that the things that we're using you
know about be happy to talk to you we
have guys from our office here would be
really excited to share and talk to you
guys as well okay why you should
consider working with us I'd like to
start with the tech stack that we have
closure of course initially we came to
closure for exam you to bility
concurrency after a few years of working
with it we realized the most important
thing for us is the distance between the
requirement and the implementation
because that has been over in time
our secret weapon to be successful
startup and finally get noticed by
staples and acquired us and since then
we've been delivering awesome products
and for our data team they use spark
they started with a dupe and they got
tired of it at some point babysitting
and they start using safari it seems
that they liked it a lot and we use
postgres we've tried many databases we
tried and that's has been performing
really well for us so far and pure Jenny
and I talked to some people why not ring
in all the composure and other stuff
that system they're great for the
purposes that it's designed for but we
have a very strict oscilla and we would
like to really close to the bare metal
as close as possible so we just wrapped
charity and for concurrent we use Java
util concurrent that's like a main
staple for us over the years to tackle
any kind of concurrent issues
concurrency performance related issues
and we use one of my personal favorite
is a google guala library a lot of cool
stuff you guys should check us out and
it really really helps you in terms of
performance and in terms of a lot of
abstraction people's on top of it and we
use a redshift for our data warehousing
for etl s and among other things we use
in-house libraries tools at one example
that i can give you a chef we started
with using chef photo was Runa and then
chef did enough damage to us that we
decided that we need to come up with our
own solution we have in-house solution
where we use perl bosch may file it's
super awesome it works really well we
can actually bring up the entire
production within a few hours with that
total and we hope to be able to someday
open source is it share it but we're not
there yet
our tech culture very major Xtreme Ian
people come with the library cool tool
all of the stuff you say okay fine
here's where we are if you're thinking
that you can do better than this show me
the numbers will take a look very simple
flat hierarchy no senior junior
architect all of this we have engineers
co-workers great engineers working
together if you have a great idea
there's no limit that you can experiment
with the show us and numbers prove us
that that's better than what we have
will go for it lean agile pragmatic
whatever you name it it's very very open
and you know we have daily stand-up
scrum and all this but we're not
subscribing to any kind of methodology
and dogmatic way but very pragmatic
experimentation we do have an
experimentation platform which is you
know a nature of e-commerce world you do
need to do a B testing and all of this
but we do a to z testing it's a
multi-paradigm experimentation platform
but at the same time our culture is you
know if you think that's a good
framework library not a framework much
by the library of tools in a language or
fittest at the domain the problem to
recharge solving you know experiment
with it show us and we'll take that and
would like to dive deep we really get
truly the bottom of whatever we do we
build up our allocation we have very
strict SLA most of the times we need to
deliver 99.5 percentile most of the time
requirement is under 30 milliseconds and
we really really need to think to
achieve that performance is not easy
over the years we found that the best
way to do it is to start from a small
function level that you write in every
step of the way measure and build up on
top of it that's how you
game performance and any performance
related stuff and if you you know
there's a disruptor the marching
Thompson is a guide to follow on that if
you really need two performances ladies
stop and simplify this is really
important for us one of the reason is
closures enabled us to simplify things
and OSHA has tremendous power that I
really don't have to mention here but it
helps us to really see the core of the
problem and abstract the real core in a
nice way so that we can build on top of
more abstractions on top of it but such
a way that is manageable because the
language never ever stands in your way
in terms of implementing what you want
to do and that's why we love and help us
simplify and we have a excellent test
coverage our engineers are very that's
one of the area that our engineers
really really subscribe to we test our
products extensively it's extremely
important because a lot of our products
is customer facing we really don't want
to throw you know stack traces and all
the exception to face its customer and
it's really important that we cover as
much as we can and there's a problems we
tackle it sounds interesting I'm just
presenting here so that you know if
you're interesting come talk to us will
share more detail there's like an issuer
and concurrent calls should result in
just a single evaluation for
personalization engine there's one issue
where you know there's a 10 or 20
concurrent call comes to our service and
we need to be able to say hey we just
evaluated once and will spit out
whatever the thing that your point
forward it is looks trivial but and the
details of it there are ways to
implement it it really well it makes it
really bad and how to make sure hi
available for growing data driven and
micro AP is mainly it's a jelly wrapped
and web services exposed to the HTTP
endpoints and
how to make sure the data fees in our
system is reliable volatile and this is
actually extremely important part we
have working with stable stable and they
have you know as a big company they have
data in different places ftp SFTP SQL
excess somewhere right and we need to be
able to say can extract the data
reliably in full tolerant manner so that
the data that comes to our system so
that we can use it to do a you know
modeling and again how to achieve 10
milliseconds per request and 40,000 was
for second SLA that has been one of our
core product that we have done in the
past while we were still start up for a
big ecommerce company and we're so proud
of that that the beginning you know
who's that lovable in terms of
prediction engine which is one of the
things that we did is a shifting
prediction so and and then how to
personalize recommend products and
offers in near real time as for a tough
problem and we have a lot of work to do
to solve that and our vision from since
we join staples from up top they have
been very supportive and they have a
vision where we get to a point where we
have eighty twenty eighty percent for
company twenty percent of your own time
doing your own projects and that's the
thing that we innovate and there's a
strong support for that present papers
to conferences open source tools
internal libraries we have and Bill the
world's best product personalization
engine and best recommendation engine at
the end of the day I mean it's all about
giving great customer experience in 250
million users the staples have which is
the third largest e-commerce in the US
so that's about it please come talk to
us said I thank you for your time
thank you our next to here is going to
be david james give him a second to
switch over here and he's going to be
talking about something called fondo and
i will let him and tell you more about
what that is good afternoon my name is
david james i'm presenting today joshua
miller has been helping out along this
project this is a work in progress it's
a specification for distributed and
beautiful derived addressable data i'll
explain what that means the reason i'm
talking is i think there's a lot of
overlap between what we've learned with
closure and where we might be able to go
with networks data go clicker okay okay
many of us here write programs that
interact with data via networks that can
mean discovering data using it
transforming it or publishing it lots of
other things in practice we use HTTP to
consume and publish our data over
networks it's just kind of what we do I
want to read a quote by one would in it
so far HTTP is the most successful
distributed system the files ever
deployed coupled with the browser HTTP
has had an or most technical and social
impact it has become the de facto way to
transmit files across the internet yet
fails to take advantage of dozens as
brilliant file distribution techniques
invented in the last 15 years that's a
cool paper it's the interplanetary file
system much better thought out than what
I'm about to tell you that HTTP is great
and we can do better so we have a plan
called fondo which is an Esperanto a
word that means foundation it's one way
to do network data better it's inspired
by a lot of concepts enclosure by we
it's an open we
helping Joshua started I've got some
other friends interested like to get
more people interested my goal here is
you know maybe you like what I'm talking
about maybe don't but I do want people
to get a little dissatisfied with the
status quo of distributing files with
HTTP and I think anyone in the audience
has problems you wanna solve encourage
you to think about those think bigger
and pull together an interesting ideas
that you like and see what you get it
that's kind of how this came about I'm
stealing a lot of ideas from others here
the design goals that we're starting
with that we care about open to
broadening the list contracting it but
here's where we are now so in these I go
into on the later slides this is just a
quick quick summary provide content
based address ability for data
distributed across device and devices
and networks diverse device and networks
diverse devices and networks ensure data
mutability in integrity support derived
data efficiently and embraces diversity
of underlying systems okay so the first
one kind of boils down to decoupling
location from the from the way you get
at it so in fondo and address is a name
not a specification of location so this
is more like you are in which is a
flavor of uri which people may or may
not know about but you could do things
like go from a ISBN number to identify a
book even if you don't care where the
book is located on a server and the
other cool thing about decoupling
location is that you can let the system
be smart about choosing the data that's
closer to you or has certain desirable
properties maybe you're talking about a
mesh network of distributed mobile
devices and they can't guarantee at any
one time which M is going to be
connected but they still need to get
access to some data this kind of a
system like fondo but there's lots of
others that view this is a goal another
interesting goal that I hope closure
developers will be really interested in
this idea is the idea of derived data so
values can be derived from other values
you can transform data and arbitrary
ways
we think we're going to need to impose a
minimal set of types there's two ways
that you can derive data one is by using
persistent data structures because that
decreases the cost of due to cheat
modification another way to do it is
with actually functional transformation
so you might imagine person a gives you
a 10 gigabyte data set person B gives
you 10 gigabyte data set person see only
joins them now if someone comes along
and wants to consume the third item
should they have to download the whole
20 gigabytes if they already have the
original to 10 gigabyte files I don't
think they should they should be able to
take what they already have it's
immutable apply functional
transformation and there they go this
fourth one I haven't seen mentioned as
much there's a lot of great distributed
file systems out there but if you wanted
to run an organization on kind of one
standard maybe it's fondo maybe it's
something else you don't want to impose
necessarily one underlying technology so
how do you how do you allow these
different systems to work together they
all have different distributed system
guarantees they all handle these
guarantees in different ways consistency
availability partition tolerance I'm not
an expert in this field but what I'd
like to do is have the system as a whole
be able to tolerate that diversity and
offer up your data in the same way that
makes it easier to work with so it's a
heterogeneous system that builds for
mutability so what that means in
practice is that it can't guarantee
availability you might ask fondo for a
bit of data you might have to look
around the network the data may not be
available right then I don't expect it
to be a system that holds all the data
it probably is just going to point to
other data systems let's same took in
time so when you talk a little bit about
benefits there's four layers of benefits
ranging from sort of a programmatic up
to sort of the community level so at the
bottom level is this idea if you're
writing a data consumer if you have to
do with a fragmented
set of standards it's going to be harder
to work with if you go with some
standard way of consuming data with
immutability your job should be much
easier as a data consumer another
interesting to think about is at the
network level data sets should be
cheaper to discover and faster to
transfer especially with the derived
data so one data provider might offer
sort of a time series set of data
another might just want to summarize it
if you already have the time series you
don't need to redownload it you just run
a computation to get the submarine
another benefit is at the organizational
level if you're thinking about how do
you find data from another part of the
world another part of the your
organization if you just use a URL you
can't be sure what's under that URL so
it'd be nice to know that what's
associated with that ID is actually the
data you're expecting and you're not
forcing someone else to use whatever
databases you use so that it's tolerant
of that and this is this may never
happen but if this was a broad adopted
broadly it could be a nice data
foundation for the Internet we welcome
participation all kinds of criticism
whether it be hey I want to help or hey
here's a time bomb in your design goals
they may not theoretically work together
but we do want to transform how people
think about and use network data and we
have a github repository it's just to
start but we welcome to spacious and
thank you very much thanks a lot we're
going to have shalimar on and we mean
you did it over the other
and talking about Iran hi thanks so when
I mention I'm going to talk about in
regards to accessibility resources in
schools chris toman and i have been
working on a few things with regard to
this and i'm gonna be talking about that
so we're good company called pros we are
publicly traded companies and in Texas
I'm a closer kripa developer and we
build applications specifically for the
sciences of airline ticket the rising so
we provide that to our customer analysts
through these web adaptations but before
then I was a JavaScript game developer
and this is something that I ate it was
a accurate report and that is
demonstrating how the girls are begging
since a very educational and they turn
into cookies that a Weymouth full time
in a minute I was an indie game Evolis
year working on this game for the iphone
it was made in JavaScript I do not
recommend it he says it tolls for the
games when addition to the engine i may
be winter tools for sculpting periodical
paths selecting the background layers
animating and attaching collision as
well as a creative in ugliness in
addition to that i found the developing
experience is all our interesting than
the product the game was actually moment
but i wanted to write it was sort of an
experiment to see how if it was if it
was exactly right all about Dominic
Greene's so when I'm really big in
education this so I have to be me no
money I joined a company xmas taught me
was assuming these cool thing about a
closer and I really with maintaining
collects Pee of what i was doing games
very much so he told me about
and I did company and they allowed me to
learn close dependable tools with it
what about a patient 80 developers one
of them have transitioned from a job too
close and your wide variety developers
you have some some old ass and we have
people who are pressure thank you sir um
so since I like games one one of my
friends Lane she wanted to celebrate
tetris birthday so I like well we're
like I close every one we just like
build the games we have a condition so
it's actually do two things of the past
30 years you get to play the Christmas
I'm enjoying the last minute and like
dashboard so we projected did it while
we were playing and could you see like
wasn't leaving and I ensued what I did
with Terry attack i want to explain how
the listening so these these slides are
sort of another experiment is to see its
value sort of illustrate how we did and
it is it really shocked me how cool was
to do an English it was a very clean uh
so I probably started a building a new
product we made sure my down here I did
not serve a time okay started using all
my building project I don't and
Christmas onions he doesn't really
minimal implementation research am boot
camp sessions to start introducing
people at the company so many people
join but complaining about the resources
into winning so I decided that closes
you need a website we need a website
guys and we needed an easier pilot
school says Chris Odom in his problem
are he started creating the first time
seal GSR test fitted maybe we'll look
like Canada source like a very important
component so we did he started combining
the best parts of three tools like a
closed-door work really nicely for that
grimoire amazing filter search all the
different symbols and closer to you but
we did is he kind of organize these
things sort of a beta kappa versus a
very top conceded the most frequently
used things like that and it whatever
and i'm not sure if you see that topic
we could we give you my digital hughes
like these are predators these are great
for vectors these are operating for
Madison drinks and a jobs been dropped
so you're not gonna find closure so this
is a start um he's also a designer so
he's starting to really uh ride the tool
ticket for and they make a good you make
me look really nice and an addition to
explain Thierry's he's not just doctors
why would agree more human readable
virgins to be more accessible um so
that's that's the website we're kind of
working out with it in dishes that we
want one compiler to use a little bit
easier use two principles here I don't
push me neat job developers really their
favorite editor if they're moving closer
to the two cells can be difficult omgg
kind of experience and about every
fellow called compilers experience this
is windows like never you're piling I
left the premises and I get it is it's
not at all windows because it isn't
elevator and if you see that line little
that's weird so sealed is still is sort
of a the tool that reduces that output
but I went to debris on second yesterday
for curses of like people insider there
really anything so that's sort of the
communities Angeles sort of provide a
tool over my so I first up I thought it
would be cool and
kind of weird experiment to justice
rifle can be minimal it's not an ID but
it provides it like the bass parts like
a golden and it kind of shows you the
errors only there's you're interested in
so you would use this sort of beside
your favorite editor and of course I
can't believe in two days incredible so
this is something that Krista Minister I
try to build until the plugin but we
created it you know but it's like it's
called a shuttle so it's an application
so you want to project its application
and I just open in a detector project
and you can see that it is disciplining
the different types of diffe different
bills detected from your project and up
at the top you like which project to
build you can talk about the library
papaya and we're going to change the
soil and you can hit that up on in the
course I'm gonna test because an engine
compilations a little okay and right now
it's doing i'm going to ruby from the
piece to see here that is now just like
red lines there we want to commend that
or even like me just slightly the hope
I'm I reckon on a place is here with
under the position of the air and you
can see what would you reap Isla it's
just as what you expect and I'm going to
use a simple that I'd like it so that
reduce is a warning so this is just a
very minimal later over the compiler
it's um I think it'll be a nice
accessibility thing for four people are
going to use is okay thanks thanks for
summoning for building evil
I am really starting to help about it
and you can and you can go to github for
the league for the below the teaching
and we need help I'm gonna ask you guys
about parlor stuff isn't made it and
these are some things I think small
things are really important especially
when we took a demon language which i
think is thank you all right for my own
presentation and we'll have a read river
and and take it away we read thank you
how many of you have ever found yourself
executing a search algorithm in your
daily life or as a remember i started
feel really bad about doing that and
that's like a good computer to do so i'm
gonna tell you a little bit about how
test check simplifies counter-examples
it's not okay for you so this is a test
case that failed in testicular data
structure specific enclosure 16 and this
was generated from a random past and
this is the kind of thing that you know
you actually have a fail in custody she
definitely would not honor in your tests
or and you could probably try and figure
out what's going on you know I think we
all have an idea that not all of this
Jenny walls contributed to the burg but
I don't want to start seeing like what
happened to remove that persisted bank
or what happened 170 so that for you and
you get a really nice and then in the
cases of this bug 109 negative 2 11 10
and i gotta say that shattered i will
win figure that out tested also simplify
other kind of data structures so this is
a bailey custody for a situation where
someone forgot to use PR sir and used
print instead turns out the problem was
the suspicious character
somebody looking a little bit how cuz
let's check out goes completely
automatically none about describe do you
need action stand in order to
successfully use the track but I think
uses in the mobile settings and it might
be fun to look at the implementation so
when we write tests check probably use
generators a generators describes a way
to generate and string some particularly
so in this is we're creating a generator
that generates balance between 0 and 100
and we can set up all those valleys so
when first oxidation it might seem like
a generator is a function from some
random the state to some random value
that fits in that doing so we pass it
over and estate here to the integer
generate every week 61 maybe the next
week at 47 where we get an eye on this
is absolutely not how has generated work
in addition to generating a number we
actually generated free that's not shown
to your magazines but we also streaming
training which lazily describes how to
shrink the number nine and as usually
different Combinator's this is true you
can manipulate behind the scenes as the
ring a bell to generate so here is a
expanded spring training for the number
9 and let's say that we will use
mathematica comedy which allows us to
apply every time is generated so we're
going to generate the integers and
multiply the double by 2 so now we have
our number 9 which is alpha x 2 we now
have 18 at the top of our tree but we've
also supplied as a function every single
node and it's true but we can do so
easily so that we only actually realized
a tree as research so now we have a pre
where every noon is the x 20 in addition
we can use the same technique forces in
the northern player so this is a
signature of a comment on it allows
based on balances others say you have a
generator phase and a function takes
today and return to generator peace you
can combine those together
to get it a generator so example of that
you might have a power to generator it
generates two for a 16 etc and then you
want to create a vector whose length is
one of these random the powers of tears
so we bind this is how to generator to a
function that takes that power to and
returns of energy generator it uses that
out length so little house thank you for
that so let's say did we generate 5 23
and one for a first generator we create
the screaming train then we apply this
assumption to it and now we have a
screaming tree where the values are
screaming trees and it turns out we can
actually just use a little logarithm to
flatten the tree one layer this is a
little joining and we now have agreed
it's just why during a little bit deeper
it's actually incorporating the
streaming tree for the original
generator and the generator if you pass
a second image behind so when we
composer image together you still get it
the full power of thinking without ever
having to think about it anyway if
you're sitting this go check out the get
out of age or come afterward to compile
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
