the title wasn't on the program and
actually really didn't know wasn't to
talk about that's getting more and more
challenging for me to come up with
something really exciting but actually I
decided I was gonna do a talk that's
kind of a part two of the talk I gave
that closure tray in Finland in
September that talk was called the next
five years of clojurescript if you
haven't seen it I recommend checking it
out raise your hand if you use
clojurescript at all okay that's really
awesome so it's a lot of you it's really
great very exciting so closure scrip is
now five and a half years old it's been
a while which means that there's
actually a lot of stories that people
are familiar with lots of technical
decisions and things that happened that
people missed along the way five and a
half years is a long time lots of
country interesting contributions and
that's a really great story but that's
not what I want to focus on today when I
talk when I gave that talk it sort of
ended it sort of talking about the
community side of things specifically
whereas that talk was about the next
five years of clojurescript as far as
its continued technical progression I
kind of want to talk about the next you
know five years of close your script
sort of from their perspective of how do
we grow the community and how do we get
people interested in this some pretty
awesome technology that we've built so
again we've come an incredibly
incredibly long way when I gave the talk
at closure tre I mean very few people
remember clojurescript from the early
days it's a handful of people I mean
there were two years without source maps
Figg wheel was much appeared much later
and a lot of the awesome tooling and
integrations that we have with the wider
tropic raava script ecosystem that's all
those are all recent developments right
it's all new stuff and now I think this
story is really compelling for the
average developer previously you know
closure Cooke was cool but it definitely
felt a bit like alpha geek
so what's what's nice about Collider
script I'd want to start off I mean
these your goodness this part is kind of
going to be upon a repeat of things that
have been said numerous numerous times
but yet they form the foundations of
Collider script and when we talk about
closure script I do think that we should
emphasize these things because these are
the essence of the of the technology and
why we like it I'm going to talk a
little bit later about things that I
think are easier to get people to try it
right that's something that I think we
need to think a bit more about how do we
get people to try the thing but at the
same time once they try it they'll see
that wow you've made a lot of very sound
technology decisions in this really cool
piece of technology that makes me want
to stay right so there's two problems
getting people to stay and getting
people to try it but I think the getting
people to stay part is really has been
solved in a really awesome way at the
foundation of clojurescript if you use
closure or closure script it's
persistent data structures this is
something that even when I started doing
closure as a hobby I think in 2008 you
sort of like really immutable data
structures can you really design
interesting programs without typical
amounts of state and it turns out wow
you really can write almost any program
that you used to write and you can
really narrow down the places where you
have to think about state transitions
and you never want to go back right once
you have this this this is the way you
want a program when closure came out in
2007 I was this is a long time ago right
that's almost 10 years ago I was it I
was like once you once you got into it
you're like ok person's data starters of
the future you know 10 years from now
all programming linkages will come out
with persistent data structures and the
truth is is that closure is still as far
as gonna tell itself almost a decade
ahead right it's still not the case that
people are designing programming
languages with immutable data structures
at the foundation so in this regard I
think closure is far more sound than
most of the alternatives which is cool
so this is
a kind of an interesting thing there are
these weird side effects things that you
could not predict so rich icky designs a
language for the JVM it's about
concurrency and writing you know these
really awesome expressive highly
concurrent programs and you know when
cloture script came out you know people
were scratching their heads or like well
why do we need persistent data
structures on a single threaded virtual
machine that doesn't make any sense
and that's because we don't know what it
means yet and I think it's become
blindingly obvious now to many people
and people far beyond the closure
enclosure script community the immutable
data structures have really awesome
implications for single threaded
applications specifically for UI were
and it's because closure and
clojurescript are founded on immutable
data structures as a principle and to a
large degree we already had a culture of
let's put our state in a very small
number of places since that's the
pattern that closure guides you toward
um that things like fig will are
possible so fig wheel I'm sure rage
Hanif use fig wheel yeah yeah basically
almost anybody uses closures could uses
fig will but this is really a real cool
thing a synergy right you started with
persistent data structures and you think
okay it's easier to reason about my
program but you don't realize that it's
it's that discipline around functional
programming a persistent data structures
that make fig will works it makes it
work really really really really great
um there is nothing comparable to this
in the JavaScript world there are hot
code reloading patterns but they never
work as well as closure script because
we are starting from the right place
philosophically for live coding to
really really work with very few issues
this is something that once you have
again you never want to go back you know
persisting data structures live coding
you're like no I'm not gonna go back to
the old way another thing that's very
sort of at the foundation that I think
we should talk about more is Google
closure a very solid choice this is this
was definitely yet another head
scratcher in the early days for people
on the inclosure scripts existence but
it turns out to be a really really great
idea if you want to have large libraries
you want to have a large standard
library if you
gonna have very lots of interesting
dependencies whether that's a layer of a
react or whether that's gonna be a
date/time library or whether that's
gonna be core async or what-have-you on
you have confidence that Google closure
will do the right thing with respect to
dead code elimination um it also has
features it's had for at least five
years things like code splitting and the
code splitting is function level code
splitting it can move functions to the
correct module and this is something
that you're just it's never gonna happen
for JavaScript people have said I've
listened to people say about web pack
and all these other built tools we're
gonna get dead code elimination we're
gonna get automatic code splitting and
it's never gonna happen because there's
a culture of writing code which is very
hard to statically analyze um and that's
not true for closure script because we
generate that boring JavaScript for you
that Google closure has a very easy time
manipulating to do these kinds of
optimizations so this is huge and so
we're watching sort of the JavaScript
community struggled to achieve this and
we've had this for five and a half years
then you have things like react like
when I gave my gotten I gave a talk on
react I don't know it's been three years
since I did my three years three years
maybe two and a half years or so since I
did my first post where I said I think
react is gonna be a big thing and and
but I don't know it was like a month ago
the react team said react now has 55,000
github stars it's far you know exceeded
I think pretty much everything with
maybe the exception of angular but I
think it may have surpassed angular um I
think it's um you can say without
qualification that a react is a massive
success and things like react native are
just picking up more and more steam so
react is delivering on the promise of
being a way to get to lots of targets
whether those are wet targets desktop
targets or mobile targets and that's
great we can just ride that wave it
worked out more or less how I expected
it to react I think is again without
qualification just light-years beyond
what people were doing prior to that but
the cool thing is that the closures from
Kenya was prepared while a lot of
people the JavaScript comedian were like
well I don't know about this thing with
xml literals closed computer like yes
let's go we're ready for this because
finally you have a UI solution which is
good for immutable data structures right
it's just a perfect pairing we want
functional programming we want to do UI
work but we kind of want to do
functional UI programming and react gave
us the perfect story for us to be able
to do that and now you have you know an
explosion of Awesome amazing
bindings to to react whether that's
reagent rum you know you of course you
have um you have quiescent you have a
bunch so there's a bunch of different
things you can use but everybody agrees
that react is a very very very good fit
flow for closure scripts so there's a
sense here I think Clojure script is
very well positioned in many ways we're
ahead of the industry well you know what
works and we're sort of ahead of the
curve and I think we should be aware of
that and when we communicate the
benefits of closure script we'll talk a
bit more about that later um there are
some new things and you've heard me talk
about these things and they're starting
to pick up steam I mean there there's
there's a time when something gets
released and there's a time when people
decide hey we're gonna do that thing
relay and graph QL
Falkor and atomic I think these have
really huge positive implications for
the way that we think about UI
applications specifically when there's a
very serious client-server component and
you're seeing this happen github I think
a couple months ago maybe it was a month
ago they announced that their entire API
uses graph QL um so if you have a look
at these technologies I highly recommend
spending some time looking at them I
think it's always really important that
for closure and closure script program
is that we're all with them and we're
not always looking at our own stuff
there's lots of interesting ideas
outside of our circle on then we should
assess them and figure out which which
parts either we can just use as they
exist for example react or maybe things
like graph kill maybe perhaps there is a
very great way to you leverage graph QL
well but also maybe there's an
opportunity here to show ok we can take
that idea we can do it better
much in the same way that you know a lot
of the typical things that you see in
react programs a lot of these sort of
closure script bindings over react try
to make the scope of what react needs to
do quite a bit simpler than what it does
out of the box okay and then I think
finally as far as the sound techno
technology foundation because of things
like react and react native and the fact
that closure script targets
I mean JavaScript runtimes going back to
2001 right we generate JavaScript code
that was valid in in 2001 so if you know
JavaScript that's valid for 15 years and
it's gonna be valid you know moving
forward because they're not gonna change
JavaScript cuz they can't break the
internet so we have a very good mobile
story so we were delivering on the
promise that rich icky sort of stated at
the beginning which is that this is
gonna be the mobile story places where
the JVM can't run on that closure tray
it was also clear that this was the case
I saw two presentations I think on react
native people are building and shipping
stuff with react native on closure
script and they really really liked it
and that experience is only gonna get
better okay so this is stuff that you
probably already know that you've
probably already heard and I think you
know never sort of forget the principles
when you want to talk about why closure
scripts compelling this is the sort of
sort of sound technical foundation that
a lala's is cheap all the other things
but this but does picking good sound
technical foundations actually lead to
success to a people actually adopting
your technology and and then and and the
truth of the truth is is I'm not sure
that that's true as a programmer who's
been doing this actively for about a
decade you know you see lots of
interesting technology that seems better
design it's better thought out and for
whatever reason um it doesn't succeed
and there are lots of reasons for this
and it's a it's a complicated thing and
there's no simple answer so while these
sound technical foundations have
definitely contributed to a degree of
of Clojure enclosure script success I
think there is more to do and actually
that work is not surely of the sort of
technological variety I do think that
marketing your your technology is really
really important I mean this is why you
have communities and user groups and
meetups and all this stuff like
spreading the word is really really
important because the truth is the the
the lifespan of a typical programming
language project is a quick death right
this is a slide from Simon Peyton Jones
talk on the history of Haskell where
he's really talking about like he's
stunned that Haskell was successful at
all right in academia people make these
little toy research programming
languages and they're gonna die once
they release the paper nobodies didn't
use that thing it was a toy some of
these languages get make it a little bit
further and maybe you get one user and
now you die the slow long death atoms
eventually you get tired of supporting
one or two users that is the typical
road map for a programming language
initiative so closure script and closure
similar to Haskell Haskell for various
reasons because it is a very strong
piece of technology did get some
traction in the industrial world and
closure and closure script obviously
have you know there's there now quite a
few closure including script conferences
and and you know I'm sure that many of
you are using it for work and that's
great
but there is a question of you know how
do we continue to make this a viable
thing a sustainable thing so that all of
us get to write closure and closure
script as long as we're happy with it
this is something that you want to do
you want to think how do we keep growing
the thing so I want to talk a bit about
that uh so this is an image that I that
I took from there's a variety of posts
these days about JavaScript fatigue you
know and then there's all these posts
about fatigue of JavaScript fatigue
because people think maybe this is not a
real thing I was a professional
JavaScript developer for eight years
right I did that for about eight years
and I think JavaScript fatigue is real
right I I started back with jQuery and I
actually did I used something in the
back of the neck
mootools and actually it turns out that
all the react people were actually
originally mootools developers in many
ways react as revenge of mootools
but anyways even if you haven't heard of
that this was always the case in
JavaScript you have so many options and
and you're always navigating this sort
of minefield of am I making the right
decision and it really seems to me these
days that it's exhilarating to the point
where you really have a crisis of choice
and not only that there is also a
culture I think of of I would say small
libraries to a fault and the problem
here is that small libraries they sound
good and of course there's nothing
fundamentally wrong with the idea of
small libraries
but the point is is that you know we
used to use very traditional virtual
control we used very typical notions of
versioning and when you really sort of
tie all these very small things together
the interactions between these things
it's very very very very very
complicated
and you see lots of stories in the
JavaScript world of people getting
bogged down between these all these
interacting parts in the closure world
we you know it's not like we can
completely escape this right we also
have to deal with dependency management
in version control we have to deal with
some of these problems um but at the
same time I think we are more advert
we're more our sort of spidey sense goes
off like this is probably going to
introduce more complexity in the bill
maybe this is not a good idea I think we
have a more slightly more refined notion
of how do we build something that's
that's simpler you know so we're trying
to market this thing the idea of
something that you know it's like the
thing that other people want to do but
we're just gonna reduce the number of
options right you know in our program
amount model we we have less state we
like pure functions we want to remove
and by removing it allows us to be more
productive or more expressive and I
think this is huge this is one of the
sort of golden principles of the closure
or clojurescript program right but this
is actually kind of a hard thing to sell
you know because I think if you you sit
down with closure script or closure and
you use it for like six months and you
probably like your
at the mouth like this is the most
amazing thing I've ever used everybody
should use it and you're like this is
UFO technology and you really truly
believe this and the problem is is that
maybe you think that but that's not what
anybody else sees right that like this
is this is an image you have in your own
mind a belief that you hold and other
people look at her like that's this
that's from 57 why are you still doing
that right so we really have to think
that this is something we have to
actively consider that the outside
perspective maybe once you're inside of
course it seems great
but you should always be sort of
sympathetic and empathetic to the people
who are peering in who might be curious
that just don't have the information
that you have and I think a lot of this
is just a framing kind of a framing
problem and sort of again like sort of
it empathizing with the person that's
new to it problem whoops so somebody who
is really good I think it was very good
at this is of course rich Hickey his
talks are great there are like one of
these talks you know one of the socks
you can watch them so many times one of
the best ones I think is simple made
easy simple made easy is particularly
good because it's a talk which sort of
distills the philosophy of closure but
really doesn't talk about closure very
much right it really does you don't see
any closure code on this is what's so
awesome for the closure program you're
like oh my God he's talking about
closure but for a regular program it's
like oh these are really cool principles
about software that I believe in it's a
great talk and again this is when you
watch this talk you see that closure is
sort of an artifact of a philosophy but
the philosophy is something that's
that's that's quite deep and this is I
think a good way I mean it's in many
ways you often have to prepare your
audience you know you say closure is
awesome but maybe people don't have the
context to understand why that's awesome
and you say watch this video and they're
like did you like that video and you say
yeah it was amazing or like that's
that's how closure was designed and
that's how it continues to be designed
there's another thing that's nice about
this talk and that it also gives us a
hint about
how to talk about some I would say
problematic things that you often
encounter in software development which
is that sometimes in software culture
people prioritize things that are
actually at odds with with the thing
that they want this talk is called
simple made easy and in fact it's
putting in contrast ease with simplicity
but often I think that people watch this
talk and they think it's only about Oh
easy as wrong or easy as bad and I think
this is a misinterpretation this course
is my own interpretation of the talk but
I believe this is a misinterpretation of
what rich was trying to say the problem
is not that whether something is easy or
not it's whether you're prioritizing
ease and destroying this the sort of
larger goal of simplicity so I'm going
to take a very famous quote and I'm
gonna change it and that's ease tends to
corrupt and absolute ease corrupts
absolutely right if all you do is
prioritize them making something easy
then it probably means that there are
not that many sound foundations to the
thing there's no direct correlation here
but the point is not that easy as bad
it's that premature ease is a bad idea
like premature optimization it's not
what you want to do I think the goal is
make something that's truly simple that
really follows these principles of
simplicity of you know taking something
and taking something complicated and
really you know splitting up into its
bare essentials and then once you've
done that once you've done this hard
design work of making something that's
simple then you can start saying now is
the time to make this thing really
approachable to make it easy and
actually I would say if you look at the
development of closure in the large I
actually think this has been happening I
mean whether you're looking at things
like fig wheel or cursive there is
finally now a narrative that now that
the language the core language
development slowing down there is a
collective movement around sort of
lowing that lowering the barrier to
entry but I think now more than ever is
that
we could do a lot more we're in a good
place a great example of this is fig
wheel so you know in the early days when
I was doing closure like most people I
was you were either doing vim or Emacs
and and and still to this day Emacs is a
huge influence or sort of huge tool in
the closure user base but I don't think
it's that important I don't think any of
these things that are important right a
lot of people are using a lot of
developers are just using the terminal
and they're just using a text editor
like Adam and and the fact of the matter
is something like Clojure script works
perfectly fine with this and in fact
it's a great experience for beginners if
they're using Adam with something like
par infer they don't have to think about
how to close parentheses they don't have
to learn new bindings they just have a
text editor and because they're running
fig wheel they just save and their
browser updates this is a great
experience for somebody just starting
out they don't need to include other
things in this process of I just want to
pick up this new language and I think
that as a community we should realize
that we have something that works really
great with hardly any other external
tooling needed beyond you know you know
brew install line line in slot you know
line fig will new or line new fig wheel
the project and you know in 30 seconds
right in 30 seconds as long as you have
a JVM installed you can be live coding
in your browser and you can show users
yes you're gonna get source mapping yes
you can set breakpoints this is doing
something like this is actually quite a
bit more complicated if you're gonna
scale it out in in JavaScript yes you
could make make a little web crack
project that has live code reloading but
there's lots of things you have to
decide on to make that work whereas if
you use fig wheel you start with
something trivial and the truth is is
that that can scale to your 40,000 line
closure script application I use fig
wheel for work at cognitive and we're
building large closure script apps right
it works it's not just it's not just for
newbies it's gonna be exactly the same
thing you use when you're become
eventually an expert closure a closure
programmer
and and these and really the experience
has come a long way again looking
outside of the the clojurescript
community for ideas about how do we make
things easier for a larger base of users
figure wheel has done a great job
they've looked at Elm Elm is like I
think there are lots of cool things
about Elma one of the best things about
elem to be honest really the great thing
the great idea is that you can have
really great error messages right and
close your closure I think you know
there's not much we can do instead the
sense of closure itself closure is gonna
do what it does but as long as it gives
us the information we need we can
provide a better experience downstream
and Figg wheel is I think the perfect
example of how much can be done and it
doesn't really require any changes to
the language at all so in fig we all
you're often typing code and you make an
error and you're gonna get a warning in
the browser you don't even have to look
at the repple it's gonna tell you
precisely on what line and what what
symbol you made the mistake on so when
I'm in fig wheel I hardly you know when
I'm live coding a lot I hardly have to
look at the repple when I make a mistake
because fig will tells me immediately
where that mistake is there's tons of
possibilities here I think we're just
sort of starting to scratch the surface
I think spec actually offers a lot of
opportunities here and I hope that in
the coming you know into 2017 you'll see
people really show sort of how much ease
you can add to understanding what's
wrong with your program with the
information that closure spec gives you
specifically I think explain data is a
really powerful thing that tooling can
plug into okay so so you know hopefully
this gives you some ideas about how to
talk about the thing about how to
introduce the thing how to frame the
thing but eventually you're gonna run
aground of something that I think is you
know it's hard to do anything about this
which is that as software developers you
know you have this sort of fear of risk
if I adopt this thing I'm gonna be stuck
with this thing that that's the truth
that is the truth of technology you you
build something and then you're stuck
with it and you make the wrong decisions
you're stuck with it and and even if you
were gonna pivot at some point you have
to factor in that's gonna take some
amount of time to transition away from
whatever choice that you made that you
now decide wasn't the right one so how
do we sort of deal with the fact that
people may try the same they may they
may like it and they're like but you
know nobody nobody I know directly seems
to use it and it just seems risky the
funny thing is I think is that you know
a lot of its I think I think we just do
a horrible job communicating how old
this stuff is right you know we've been
doing this for five and a half years
very soon it's gonna be six very soon
it's gonna be ten right this is not new
stuff tons of companies are using it
right we've long past the point where
the closure script home page has a
hundred companies using closure scripted
production the surveys that we run every
year the number just keeps going up you
know I remember when it was like you
know 40% of closure programmers used
closure script but now it's like 67% um
I think the number is gonna continue to
climb closer script is just mature
technology and we should point out the
fact that like you know it's under
active development there's a hundred and
forty six contributors now actually
there's more you know I'm the lead
developer so I actually have to apply
every single patch that comes through
there's more activity consistent
activity behind closure script that's
not me sitting writing code then there's
ever been
there's more people understand that
compiler works contributing than has
ever been and I want this to grow I mean
this should definitely be moving in a
positive direction there's a lot of
stuff to do and I I want this to
continue to expand but this is something
to point people a lot of people like
isn't closure script this new thing and
you're like point point to the get
history it's been going on for a very
very long time another thing I think
it's funny is that you know in the
industry you you you really like people
like Oh
closures weird and and close gets weird
the thing is closure scripts and closure
are built on boring technology the most
boring conservatives decisions you could
possibly make right closures built in
the JVM that's boring everybody's on the
JVM Oh
script targets JavaScript that's boring
JavaScript is everywhere but this is in
fact our greatest strength we have we
make very risk-averse decisions right we
make decisions based on yes we know
doing something novel is risky so let's
focus on these fundamental things like
functional programming or persistent
data structures but we're gonna target
something that is really the most
mainstream thing you could possibly
target and we're gonna interrupt as well
as we can with that stuff because no
we're not gonna rewrite sequel drivers
no we're not gonna reinvent you know
what web programming right we're not
going to do this we're not gonna develop
custom runtimes we're just going to
compile to regular old JavaScript and
we're gonna provide very good Interop so
that's another thing I think we need to
communicate is that that closure and
closure cover are actually very
conservative they're very conservative
technologies they're very much designed
with risk in mind and again just looking
at Stack Overflow
if this is to give us an idea as a
community like how much growth potential
we actually have right the number one
and two questions on Stack Overflow are
JavaScript and Java right those two
together dwarf everything else right so
our potential to grow is quite large
most people if that you throw if you
throw a rock at somebody in there in
technology they're probably writing Java
they're probably writing JavaScript but
this is a good thing for us that means
there's a very wide audience of for us
to convert if you look at the way that
rich Hickey sort of marketed closure in
the early days there was no closure
there were no closure programmers right
so he had to go to Java meetups and say
hey I'm building this thing I'm sure
you've been doing java for probably at
that time you've already been doing Java
for you know 10 years a decade and
there's probably lots of things you
don't like and here's the thing that is
much more expressive that addresses some
of the problems that you might have with
Java at the same time it doesn't really
require you to give up the things that
you like about Java which is all the
libraries and the robustness of the
platform and I think actually it would
be harder to make this argument for
JavaScript but I think it's becoming the
case that now as a community we can
actually act
we reach out to JavaScript communities
and point out that there they are and
Counting encountering similar problems
to the problems that you you were quite
aware in Java in 2007 when Rich res sort
of marketing closure and and and again
this is this is that the Java the
JavaScript fatigue is a real thing it's
not a fake thing JavaScript developers
are now realizing that they really have
a very sort of complex ecosystem and
system that they're having to deal with
and I think this is this is a perfect
time to capture some attention that we
provide something that's I think
markedly simpler so I don't think it's
gonna stop I think JavaScript will
continue to do what it's doing there
couldn't be more libraries and be more
options that's not gonna change at the
same time
javascript is language is going to get
more complicated the Ekman script 2016
standard on this already nearly as long
as the Java eight specification this
JavaScript is no longer a 50-page thing
there's no way that anybody knows what
this language means right it's not
possible it's too big it's just like
Java anybody that says they know what it
means is lying so but this is also an
opportunity javascript is getting more
complicated and I know that they're
developers out there that don't like
that they want something simpler I think
that we can offer them something simpler
so a really great talk for that I
recommend sharing is one of the most
popular talks is a great talk was by
Derek
Slager it's really worth sharing which
is the closure scripts for skeptics and
this is a talk for people who are like
well it's a talk for like well we need
to do you UI work and we're using
javascript because we have - Derek is a
very smart developer and I wouldn't say
he's the typical like diehard JavaScript
person JavaScript is something he has to
use and he loves closure closure script
and this is a great talk which points
out why is closure practical for
somebody who absolutely must use
JavaScript to accomplish some task
why is closure script I'm a sort of a
pragmatic choice if you haven't seen
this talk watch it uh and just last
night I was at Vienna J s
are actually vanity s and closure Vienna
and Vienna react they did a combined
meet up and there was awesome there's
like a hundred people there I kicked it
off and I talked about closure spec that
was a lot of fun that had a really
really huge response from again a
primarily JavaScript audience I'm going
to talk a bit more about that in a
second
but the talk after me was actually by a
JavaScript developer somebody was doing
JavaScript for ten years they'd started
with script oculus as a script oculus
developer they were just making little
nice transitions for rails apps and
eventually they moved to jQuery and
backbone and you know using grunt and
then of course their last thing that
they did before they their team decided
we're done with JavaScript was they were
doing mutable Jada's lodash web pack and
you know on all the various bits they
needed sort of strained together and
they really were losing time on just the
complexity of all these tiny decisions
had been made in the JavaScript
ecosystem that actually just sort of
point everything towards incidental
complexity so he actually his narratives
pre interesting because he actually said
okay this is too much I'm spending more
time fighting web pack plugins and I
meant actually writing any code so he
decided to try out Elm and you know new
language initiatives have this benefit
of there aren't that many choices
there's probably one build tool and and
even though that's just be just because
it's a new thing still it does mean that
it narrowed a lot of the complexity Elm
also gave them a really nice clean sort
of UI programming model he was coming
from react and if you know Redux and
react or reframe or whatever it's all
more or less the same stuff and so for
them Elm was a huge win in terms of
reducing a lot of this complexity they
had it sort of grown over time in the
JavaScript ecosystem but eventually they
decided it wasn't right for them because
Elm is really great there's the great
aspect of it is that it you know it is
sort of an ml that has a typed ml but
because it wants to really give accurate
type error messages but when you
something goes wrong they actually on
put JavaScript at arm's length so in
order to talk to JavaScript you you need
to basically setup FFI and that really
brief you if you're gonna build a
project over a long period of time and
most of your libraries are using are not
written an elm because that's definitely
the case right they're not written to
help they're written in JavaScript
they found themselves spending a lot of
time creating ports and they really saw
themselves as not getting that much
benefit since they weren't gonna rewrite
a lot of this stuff an L so that's what
led them to closures code so this
developer had not do nothing about
closure and knew nothing about closure
script they started rewriting their
application three months ago knowing
nothing about closure and closure script
and immediately they started using fig
wheel and the various build tools that
we have and they were blown away right
so like Elm you had a thing which allows
them to make something with a lot less
complexity both for the build and during
development but also something that
offered more right this was a team that
had tried to do with react and hot code
reloading and mutable j/s and they were
struggling to ever get that to work and
then they use fig wheel and he said it
took me five minutes
he did not actually have Java installed
in five minutes he had a live coding
experience and they demoed their app and
it's beautiful works great and their
whole thing is built with fig wheel and
no point he said he had any problems
right it's a problem less experienced
the live coding thing just works but the
point here is we're taking somebody who
is not somebody who's like a believer
not somebodies are already bought in or
drink the kool-aid as somebody who's
coming into it cold and said wow you're
offering something that's that's
demonstrably better than what I was
doing
previously in my JavaScript um only
stack so so that's something to think
about these are things to think about I
am if you have if there's a JavaScript
user group go to the JavaScript user
group and take some of the things that
I've mentioned present it but present it
using the things that JavaScript people
are familiar with you know do it with
atom do with fig wheel show them
something very simple show them
fast it is how easy it is and then you
know once people are intrigued then
point out all these other benefits these
deep sort of great technical or
technology decisions that we may I do
want to spend before I wrap up talking a
bit about spec I think spec is huge it's
really really huge and so when I
presented this set yesterday I had to
cut off questions because people were so
interested in it I definitely think it
satisfies a specific area of risk for
some people especially if you're coming
from it's it's very unlikely for example
that most of it potentially was coming
from Haskell Haskell itself is a small
community it's more likely that people
are coming from things like C sharp or
typescript or flow or Google closure but
with type annotations that's much more
likely and they're gonna ask this
question well okay closure sounds good
it sounds reason but you know I mean
what do you do about the fact that it's
an untyped language and I think the
types discussion is not really the
important part when people say types
they mean like I want to have this as
documentation as specification when I do
my types it's a way for me to
communicate to other people on my team
what does this program mean what does it
do and I think we had we had the
beginnings of this with schema with
prismatic schema and people wanted
something like schema though I think
schema was probably not an idiomatic
solution to the problem and I think
close respect really is idiomatic one
and its really great because it ships
with the language so it's guaranteed to
be something that everybody's gonna use
but I think this is huge we have an
answer to the problem of how do we
communicate what our program means um to
other people and I think when you show
people how much spec does the fact that
you get testing the fact that you get
declarative specifications the fact that
you can generate an example data I mean
I think the implications are huge and
it's gonna take a couple years to even
fully understand all the things that you
can do but I think you for reaching out
to other communities spec is a great way
to start so if you know if you go to a
JavaScript Mena for
or Java Meetup talk about spec talk
about the things that you can do and I'm
sure you will blow some minds finally I
try to wrap it up by saying so the
clojurescript site exists I haven't had
that much time to talk about it in talks
other than the same that exists again a
huge shout out to Alex Miller but this
this actually needs a lot of work so
maybe you're getting into closure script
and you're like well I want to
contribute and the compiler seems scary
even though David Nolan says it's easy
maybe you're not convinced it still
sounds scary but a good place to
contribute that's really easy is the
website there are many links that aren't
fleshed out there are many places where
things can be touched up there are many
places where we just need better CSS
there's tons of contribution work and I
think the clojurescript site is our sort
of our first impression for many many
people who don't know anything at all
about closure script I think we could
easily make this an amazing portal for
people who just want to get started very
quickly so if you're looking about
looking to contribute something
I think clojurescript org is a huge huge
place to start I'm probably probably in
the coming months become much more
active there and alex is already pretty
active but I'm definitely gonna become
more active in keeping this up to date
eventually we're going to sort of
deprecated the wiki and make this the
single source of truth so if you're
looking for something to do to help out
help out with the website and so I
joined my talk I hopefully didn't run
too far over its that you know I've been
doing closure now as both hobby and for
work for since 2008 so that's you know
eight years and I still love it closure
closure script definitely and closure
bring a lot of joy this is a great book
if you've never read this book I highly
recommend its focus and Chris Houser
there's something really fundamentally
awesome about closure and closures
philosophy of software and I think as a
community we should think a bit more
about how can we sort of you know make
the tent bigger so hopefully I've given
you some inspiration for that today and
I think I'm done thank you
