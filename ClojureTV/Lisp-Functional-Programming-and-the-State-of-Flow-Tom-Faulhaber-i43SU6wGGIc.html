combined and this mysteriously called
the state of flow which I think some of
you probably know about but will review
a little bit to begin the top so as
focus said earlier closures the language
build up deep philosophical roots and
and we're all channeling Alfred North
Whitehead here since we're issues it is
earlier talk as the jvm summit and so we
know we live in a world based on sort of
deep philosophical Cruz enclosure but I
don't want to talk about whatever I talk
about today is a really important fact
about closure closure is fun and
everybody look at the earth blogs and
I've got 1,400 references closure about
is fifty-four thousand hits a google
something things closers fun I said it I
think you said it too but what I'm not
going to why is closure fun and rather
than zelda get too deep philosophy and
all that stuff will get plenty of I
would have turned to pop psychology 310
feet high rice and speaks about this
notion of flow it's a way to achieve
meaningful happiness in our lives and in
our work how many people know you sent
me hice work pretty good pretty good
fair this isn't this has been very
popular in the programming community
because it seems to strike a nerve I'm
to talk a little bit about that today
don't worry for those of you who don't
like talking about too much psychology
stuff there will be closure
as we get deeper into the into the
presentation so I want to start with a
disclaimer here this is a really opinion
driven talk right it I'm going to talk
about my experiences through what how I
felt about code and how I deal about how
things interact this isn't science but
you know as I say here I just want to
get a conversation starter I think it's
an interesting thing to think about as
we code and so without further ado I
will introduce blow to those who don't
know and maybe give you a different
perspective for those who think you know
so to proceed smoothly and readily feel
like a good thing we think you know all
about that right here's here's a nice
example from nature of flow right this
river proceeds smoothly and readily not
a big thing but actually there's an
interesting point here that you miss
when you just look at this right in
order to get to this state of easy
movement the river has actually done a
ton of work right the rivers dug this
channel over millions of year through
hard rock it's pathways through the
topography that makes sense for a river
to flow right I'm anthropomorphizing the
river a little bit maybe more than
necessary but but you get the idea that
sometimes to get to this easy state
actually requires finding the right way
of making the right way so we know about
flow to right we've got flow jars
we've got flow of control we've got data
flow right all these notions from
computer science have the workflow in
them there seems to be some things
mixing up here right but she exactly how
I talks about flow as a state of feed
and I'm just going to pull a couple of
quotes from his book on the subject flow
when the information that keeps coming
into awareness is good through it with
our roles psychic energy flows
effortlessly right so this is a receipt
of being frustrated the opposite of not
knowing where we're going the officer to
be passive right we have the information
that we need to do what we need to do
when we need to do it and that makes us
have psychic energy and so this is what
seems happy hai talks about is the state
of blow so again here's another key hook
the self becomes differentiated that is
I get more identity as being somewhat
different than say David Lee t as a
result of blow because overcoming a
challenge inevitably things a person
feeling more capable of more skilled and
again this feels kind of right right as
and as we ask you do things in life we
gain a sense of who we are and a sense
of our own confidence and so right so
what does it feel what's the state a
flow feel like this is the sense of
optimal happiness that cheats at mean I
talked about it and he didn't talk its
head 2004 has been very popular event a
lot of you have seen it I'm actually
just steal this slide from that talk and
then the references that will be in the
slides from your online so you follow up
on stuff through completely involved
focus of ecstasy if he uses this in the
Greek sense of the word be outside of
our cell
and not being concerned with ourselves
we know what needs to be done we have
this clarity about what we're doing you
know we can do it we're not worried
about things are not advocated with
serene and we don't worry about time
glossop program is that experience and
process itself becomes its own reward
right we don't need to we don't we're
not only doing it for the money we're
not only doing it for whatever comes
outside a rather just doing it makes us
happy done something nice life heroes
there we go how do we find well in
program this is so so now I'm going to
connect these ideas of programming and
some of the ways we think about dwell in
programming and how and as I get afloat
that we get so the real question is how
do we find flow and not frustration
right with all of our familiar with sort
of the timelessness of programming but
sometimes that timelessness is trying to
get my linux printer driver to print my
existing printer and yes it turns out to
be three in the morning what I've done
and I've lost my sense of time but I
wouldn't exactly call that a state of
optimal
so so we're trying to ski with these two
senses in which program can be timeless
right and then what can we do welcome to
the point of view of our language
environment and also in terms of the way
we approach code of the code we write so
liz has this long hacker tradition of
people have been building things in his
classical computer power and human
reason Joseph wise upon talks about this
as compulsive program people at me and I
rubber NMIT way back the old days of AI
and as I had known a lot of these people
who just couldn't separate themselves
from the computer there in the AI lab
all night guys like Richard Stallman
come from online and they sort of
detached from humanity and soul is was
clearly an addictive world right but
there were some factors in list that may
limit a really interesting environment
for finding this state of club right and
two key ones were home anissa tea and
the fact that Lizbeth symbolic right
this changed the nature of programming
from you know what was that at current
quarter and COBOL alcohol world into
something where the computer was a
canvas on which you could express sort
of an arbitrary idea there's no surf
symbolic computation the language itself
could be manipulated at the time people
were mostly using self generated code
now we use macros right but matters are
going to stand in the long time to
develop ministry was
for another talk and then so the other
side as we have this campus and then we
have the rapper right the raffle is a
way that instead of you know a normal
write compile debug cycle the computer
is a target it's something we work on
right in the model that works more like
a grapple and this isn't the only one
that habit but because of things like oh
my intensity sometimes throw this
version is more intense but because of
that it's more like we're mentoring a
partner in some ways right we can
investigate as current stage is you know
what's happening with the machine what
our algorithms are doing underneath and
I'm very graduated with the rebel now
functional also have some interesting
characteristics that i think push us
towards this state of flow right
immutably immutability composition and
horizontal abstractions of allow us
allow us to enter this world where we
can really focus on exactly where we are
in a problem we can build these
structures out of the same tools we
always have in our tool belt and build
new new solutions that mechanism to feel
very familiar to us so I think the
functional world service as hbu through
the hassle lens or the pure functional
world as opposed to the list functional
world gives us a real power
is getting to flow luckily it turns out
a lot of people in this room probably
know the language that combines these
two threats and we call that language
closure so we come back we come back to
the notion that flow is a feeling right
the code is almost an extension of
ourselves we get into our code we
understand it I think the business or
riding with the data and transforming
the data as we go along right and how do
you build programs and feel that way
right how do you build program do you
feel like you're actually manipulating
the data in sort of a continuous of
smooth way again remember whoa proceed
smoothly and readily right where one of
one of these that make that happen is
this feeling that we have tools on our
tool belt easy there easy to transform
today right so I would claim that the
right bottle to do this is data flow and
not flow charts and other models right
right not to run off my bullets going to
Kara murder by michael is a head here so
you know the really important thing here
is that we have this nice granularity
when we're dealing with data that isn't
always deals with data and about the
same size trunks in a given part of our
programming experience right so we
manipulate and we move forward small
number of you to my abstractions helps
conditional execution should in order to
achieve this regularity you need a box
up additional execution in first order
functions like filter and so on right so
that's sort of distant engine let me
give you an example this ABS was a
system we
1990 in a functional language called C
and but we've really got it right with
with this and I hope this with Craig up
students and other people way back when
this is a system for science for doing
visualization of data and it was built
around some key abstractions about out
scientists use data and we reduce the
number of actual data structures we have
to some very coarse grain fields element
meshes geometries they could then be
manipulated in an abstract way right
despite the fact there were vast
differences from application to
application how n-dimensional fields
were actually used for instance right by
doing this we were able to give
scientists this tool belt and this gets
a tool about usually wasn't programmatic
you can access it programmatically too
but most people actually just use this
graphical interface and get animations
out of very opaque scientific data and
it was amazing thing to see so this is
the native Oh model and again the key
here was granularity of scratches ok so
that's the dinner distant past that sort
of sort of the ether of this idea now I
want to begin to talk about some
examples that are real closure codes
what I really care about in these
examples is both the way that they're
created has this idea of flow and in the
way that you they allow for their use
encourages this idea flow okay and
really all over the problems that a lot
of back and forth in a problem typically
right and with the solution
for those problems smooth that out and
creates a nice new way of thinking about
the day so the version 1 i'm going to
look at is a really nice piece of code
that was written by Chris Hauser without
Chris Vicki as if you trim and it's
called Phil q how many people here abuse
bilk you for something okay this is like
zippers is another obscure future
closure they didn't know you had and is
one of my favorite so I'm glad to be
able to talk about it right my statement
the ideas a little bit simplistic and
bias based on how I tend to use it right
but bill allows you to take things
happen in to the external world or
things that may result in long
computations or other things you would
normally think about using some sort of
concurrency or some sort of you know who
knows what and turning them into
something we all know and love enclosure
which is a lazy sequence so will you let
me over here so I can actually point
since I don't laser pointer Phil Q has a
simple idea right you have a generator
function that generates new data
potentially slowly potentially very
asynchronously and you have a consumer
that wants to consume that data is
serial way you create a bill Q by giving
a generator function to the Phil q world
it then wraps that generator function in
a future cause it with the bill function
the film function is the function to the
generator could call whenever it has new
data so you can think about their
generators just sitting there running in
an infinite loop the time between loop
iterations maybe microseconds or maybe
days back let me show you an
implementation where usually is days and
when I get some data it causes bill
function the problems are just cues up
the data it would pass more or less it
will see the details later and there's a
lazy seat on the other end
blogging cuit women consumer so now we
take it a completely third asynchronous
worldly thing and turn it into just
sequencing process right I'll talk about
how this works oh this don't don't try
this at home I taken all the special
cases that make this actually work okay
as I think it's Chris Bosh said earlier
would fit on a slide by hand so we see
we call Phil Q here with the generator
function the one weakness of this in
terms of implementation from chris's
point of view as the functions all kinda
have the same name so but but the filler
function is passed in and that's the
user-supplied function that will
generate the data and then these are the
legacy we create the three elements we
have the cue that connects things we
have our builder pump out or the
internal field function to the generator
function will call you see all that does
is put a put the past in data on the cue
and the real implementation does a bunch
of stuff in case the reader is going
away in other stuff and then we wrap it
all in the future we call the generator
function with the fill function and so
on and then the other side this creates
the consumer and I can't tell you how
many times I've read chapter on the IRC
saying it's almost always an error if
you begin with two parentheses but here
he does and it's not an error
so he's creating the great function that
will create the lazy sequence this world
is just creating a lazy sequence such
that it can essentially recurse on
himself it's not actually recursive
because it is a lazy see but and this is
just reading initiative that's for super
simple so this is very simple but what
is done is has changed the way we think
about this data that comes in and I'm
going to show you a use case here so
here we have what looks like a ring app
function at the top right and what we're
going to there's a a view content sorry
what we're going to do here is show you
the code that auto doc uses inside so
that when rich check something in the
closure you get documentation three
minutes later and this works because get
up actually will call my server and tell
it tell me that there's been this update
to the source repository and then I can
run my build and check in the new
documentation and this is all automated
and the way that's automated is using
fill key of course right because it
would be very bad if I it rich checked
two things in within a one minute period
and I started building to auto docks at
once because of course that hadn't made
it robust to parallelize which is
running all over its own policies and
you wouldn't like the results of
documentation so so we see realize
you're using bill cube and we have that
function again this is slightly
simplified but we have an appt function
that is a Coney ring a crunchy because
it has this first fill argument and then
it takes a request like a normal rehab
function would it simply decodes the
incoming Jason and pulls out this paper
arguments and passes the payload
arguments into the film functional and
then it returns the and we see we see
the full function we could pass over it
there and they were judge of 200
because it get up doesn't care if you
succeed or fail that's our problem so
that next thing is we have the code that
is the executive of the application the
executive it with the application call
skill queue with a function that just
called jetty right and then so we called
we make a J and point we build the
partial app Phil so Phil is actually a
constant by the time it gets passed over
there and we just read off his cute
right this is juicy got lazy sequence
now right we read it on the Internet
we've been burning the entire internet
into a lazy seat well they're not the
whole internet but the part we carry and
then we just call the routine that
actually builds the autodoc and that's
trivial so with the results of payload
so that's guilty so again what we're
looking for here it is things that take
this sort of rock programming with lots
of special cases and lots of changes in
granularity and turn them into things
that smooth that out and give us a sense
of constant granularity and working
within the abstraction set of tool belt
that we already know anyone is
interested in learning more about the
intricacies of this can just look it up
I don't know watch something any context
ok plenty of time plenty of time so the
next thing I want to talk about is Ajax
push right now a check which is one of
those big issues in the internet right
now it is one that I think some of you
have asked you already heard me talk
about previous occasions but it we want
to create servers that could dynamically
update data on clients typically clients
will
side web browser right under you an
example where the client is a jquery
client using a synchronization a
sickness XML requests but not going to
talk about the client at all here really
and I said people kind of know what
clients do we're going to talk about
server they can do this and and this is
a clunky operation right it's like I got
clients have things I need to know when
i sent the glass they said i'm sending
new information all the time do they
already have some of this information do
they not have it how can I make that
efficient do I need to wait for new
information because I don't want to send
them the same data over and over that's
not very efficient and I don't want to
save a bunch of dead historical state
for clients that don't exist anymore
nothing is running out there so seats
feel kind of wrong for this right and I
don't really wanted to keep track of
what each client ID sent them and what I
didn't set them as the session state is
annoying it said I want to talk about
ways that we can sort of meet all these
goals right and i'm going to use as an
example of a developer dashboard that we
did at three BR sort work for the record
and basically we're going to talk about
one path through it actually uses a tech
stuff in a few different paths but when
we're monitoring perforce check-ins
right in real time and we want to be
able to show a little big screen and so
people are always sitting around writing
source code as a manager I wish we were
doing more of it and committing it into
the perforce server right and the
program or server is a big leg
you have it you know it's just sitting
there doing its thing and doesn't know
anything about it and here we have a
dashboard web app is serving out anyone
who wants to observe the state of you
know what a particular team is checking
in or what's happening with a particular
release and this backward web app is
simply polling and using an advanced
technology called shell commands the
perfect server and the remote server
tell them what's new and it updates its
internal state and the idea here now the
good news is my team isn't so productive
that this state exceeds the size of
memory so i can actually just keep it
right in a closure structure obviously
to get bigger data structures you have
to think about that a little bit but i
get an update and the web app always has
the current state of what we're doing
now you have clients that are doing
requests and responses right and sort of
the magic secret here which is not that
magic is weak man and we tell the client
to keep a serial number and so so we can
just make in terms of cereal right and
the serial numbers are really just
unique cookies that correspond to each
state update it turns out there
incremented because that's an easy
okay so the solution revolves around
this magic three-part data structure
right we have the sequence number which
represents this version of the stage we
have the current value of the state and
we have a promise that someday we'll
have a newer better current value right
and out of this we can make what I call
it GC friendly pseudo sequence that is
things get dropped no one's referring
that we don't have to hold ahead we
don't have to remember any history but
we do get the advantages of a sequence
and you'll see that a second and it also
will give us a clean interface and we'll
walk through that right now the ether
something with a client comes in looks
at this three-part structure they can
return immediately if the data there is
new and new means that it has a
different serial number than their own
serial number or they can wait for the
next value of the data there is old and
always a per client concept if if I
already had that data I want to wait for
the next update and the producer itself
can reduce delta list the producer has
access to the serial number information
and can break it send minimal chumps a
day okay so here's the first part of the
implementation and this is the function
that actually does the update and it's
gone again as in bill cue the user
provides us a function and this is the
function this update FF big function is
the function that well actually in this
case call into the perforce system and
get the new data from the purport system
and figure out what the new value should
be based on the old value which it gets
passed and we also get this sort of
existing structure is this is the
current value and again it has the three
parts the serial number
the next in the next whistle promise
that it has that we D structure it there
and so of course we do this advanced
calculation come up with a unique serial
number that we get the new value just by
calling the user-supplied function
passing the old value in the serial
number till use it several hundred for
marking deltas this is now the new
serial number we're getting in so you
can use that to mark deltas and we
create a result and then we do two
things with the result and the result is
just a new triple actually next goes up
the right but it's a promise called with
no arguments it was nothing there and
then we do two things with that one we
deliver on the promise so anyone who is
waiting on the old value of the state to
get that they decided that that value
wasn't good enough for them and they
were waiting on the next card will see
that it's like 20 they now get the
results you can proceed and then we
return the result of which will then be
stored is that as the current state
though and that's higher status is to
keep job from garbage collecting holders
and so here's the puncture we call to
create a new version of one of these
right and again with a clock when the
programmer wants to create a new updated
state and this is a this particular one
is this particular implementation is
focus on polling right so it's based
around a timer in an update on but
obviously you could come up with similar
versions that were more been based if
you had perforce unfortunately
we don't do it but we you know when we
do this we create sir the initial state
which is zero number 02 promise and no
value you know colon colon value return
nil we just don't specify it so we go
and then we create this timer that calls
that do update function we saw the last
thing again as a partial and it's called
current state and we tell to run the
timer right now at the interval that the
user specifies I mean the first example
I've talked now you'll see the say we
pull every 30 seconds and get my team
isn't fast enough to make it worth
pulling faster than that and then we
update the time especially we don't lose
it and we return the initial state to
the Eudora magnum sorry we returned to
the state reference to the user alright
and that the state weapon for the user
basically serves as a cookie so that he
can call get next on now when new
requests come in and we want to get a
new state we call get next with the old
serial number and this reference to the
state and then this is a really simple
decision look at this thing and we say
oh it is it already up to is it is it or
is it already knew IE is the serial
number our old serial number different
than the serial number of the current
state if it is you just return the
current state and serial number because
the clients that want to keep that for
next time he calls I did not we return
to serial number and a value of the next
day again that's a promise of that might
hang there until the next update runs
typically it does typically the client
will come back right away after we send
in one piece of data who want the next
piece of data as a while until the next
one comes through but that's as we all
know the internet that's all
we might miss some updates etc etc so
then here's the company uses this for
perforce pretty simple we start at the
bottom here we create this updating stay
with our own update function here and it
runs every 30 seconds right so then
here's a imagine you go through this in
detail this this basically gets the
printer force data it builds it into
just a list of maps the interesting
thing here is an ad on the serial number
where we discovered this particular
perforce command as one of the elements
and that was us on the other side
distinguish which things are kneeling
which are and here you see how we do
that to get all the new values forgiven
serial number first we do to get next to
get the latest state and that may hang
for current state is all set and then we
compute we compute this new serial
number by by filtering through the state
we have only getting the new elements
right so we'll end up with your outside
we return the new serial number and the
filter only new stuff of the old sero
alright so what we're getting for
getting a delta from the last one disk i
got data in our database to the new
stuff so and then recent submit just
does the stuff that it needs to get sent
back I don't have the ring above it is a
sort of mustache brain interface to this
stuff that actually does the to Jason
and all that stuff but eventually what
will get past is that you Jason this so
that is how we consume it and here's a
result we can see here in the result
these are this site is actually the
perforce check-in in real time of
getting these and marking them in this
state
updates on the dashboard people can
watch it see who's actually working
today then we can trigger off some grass
and some counts everyone's happy that
we're doing things right so that's how
to make a non-magical shop look a little
bit agile too so a couple of disclaimers
about this right obviously this is a
threaded version right if you were
trying to serve millions of clients
through this version you'd end up with
all these threads waiting on the
promises and you probably get pretty
unhappy pretty fast I don't think it's a
long stretch I haven't yet done the
implementation so I'm just assuming it's
a long stretch to do a vent style
implementation and grab it an elephant
we have about four clients through this
right now so it's not really that big
deal for us and another thing this does
sort of implicitly is with long poles in
HTTP you actually want to return
sometimes the polling architecture here
creates new many versions every prefer
forth every 30 seconds so we don't need
to deal with that for if we didn't want
to do that we eat something that had
come out some promises done in titles or
reason slightly different mechanism says
to think of those ok so now I want to
talk about a mod which is one of my
favorite programs and Chris off as you
set me up really nicely earlier and I
want to talk about sort of how that
interacts with this style of flow and
was really nice about it Rod is that the
templating style separates the design of
the HTML completely from the dynamic
content it uses zippers you guys don't
favor of zippers now the morning talk
directly great set up this topic thing
and the key interface and croissant
talked about this a lot right is now
you're using fully first order
interfaces with a little macro orient
syntactic sugar but a lot of syntactic
sugar is actually not created by macros
I'll talk about that in a second and you
can create what seems to be declared a
style is a declarative style but you
have the ability to use our whole tool
belt across a declared style unlike
something like say sequel where you're
leaving the language and or even a fully
macular right thing where the syntax is
driven by the dsl I strongly recommend
everybody read the source to lie this is
very mind-bending but read a lot of
really good examples of that included so
let's talk about what's magic you write
because magic is first we have these
selectors these are selectors are just
vectors because i'll talk a little bit
this morning about how to handle those
in terms of processing but these factors
are actually functions right down
functions themselves but the at macro
that christophe users will see that as a
vector and wrap it in a function right
so in fact you could use a function
there that's not a vector to do special
purpose selected ok so it's a really
nice combination where use functions and
therefore becomes composable right
by the function you can then use a
selector and again on the right hand
side so so all these in live template
eating's our right hand side of
selecting I'm sorry left hand side
they're selecting in a right hand side
that doing the transformation on the
other line data so here and there is no
space actually make this left and right
on the top and here we see we're
combining functions that was interesting
is content looks like just a function
you're calling that does a direct
transformation but it's actually not
content returns a function that can
modify any set of sequences of data and
depending on the selector that content
function is returned is going to be
called any number of times what's
important about that what makes that
different from just Optima called
repeatedly at different times as you
Christoph watching the antennas I hope I
get this right what makes it different
than just calling content several times
is because the mega returns a function
is then composable and in fact some
parts are composable themselves here's a
simple example to do macro return will
combine the two functions is called with
it and execute the boat more complex
examples come with clone for which
allows you to create a whole sequence
and the function becomes a function that
will actually then do the the repeated
thing right so again composition we have
internal punk gypsy we use a splat here
because we are actually just sort of
making a new function rather than you
one of the predefined function returning
functions and live but then that uses
the at macro and does a whole new
selection of what's down inside there
right and this is actually I was right
out of the inside auto dogs have you
ever wondered how the audit looks
created here it is and you know
similarly we can make functions that are
returned conditionally right on here i'm
working on a given a hoasis only if it
was added some version but filling this
content then why recognizes nil is being
just a race that particular part of the
template an entrance has to be really
useful so again in live by really
working on this functions and
composability of functions and creating
a DSL out with functions where you might
have some shorthand like using factors
are using their simple notation you can
get this composability that makes things
grow much easier and if you look at
about your goalie HTML and the autodoc
is is the most elegant piece of code but
you can see where i leverage that all
over the place to make a much clearer
program which is where it's very obvious
how the autodoc is getting billed and
how the templating is running inside the
autodoc so to boil it down so the goal
here is you want to bring your cold in
line with the existing abstractions
right so where you can turn an idea into
a sequence a lot bill q that's super
powerful makes every makes a lot of
stuff more flexible makes you feel again
like you're getting this this notion of
forming your data right and let you get
your tool about that we have rigid give
us and editors building on top of giving
us a rich set of tools for working with
sequences zippers are had a great
example of this right zippers give you
an abstraction interaction in addition
to sequences but they also leverage as
Lucas talked about this morning they
leverage existing abstractions right and
that's really important right we can now
use not only the tools that zippers give
us are doing particularly pre
manipulating things but we can use all
of our underlying abstraction we don't
lose the underlying data type right and
that makes it makes our thinking we know
how to do it as opposed to sort of a
fourteenth of the nouns approach where
every class has a different set of
things going on now we're in our whole
tool belt to the job and we have some
new tools that are specific for that job
along that line we will do abstractions
we really want to think about the
abstraction we're building right and the
more that we get the sort of rich
extended extractions into closure the
more is going to feel like we have this
data flowy transformational composable
world right so again I bunch of zippers
is often really glad we had that talk
earlier right where zippers are a really
nice layer in the closure implementation
on top of the existing abstractions it
can be co photos really nicely working a
consistent granularity one of the things
that we saw in both the Ajax example
until Q example is the ability to turn a
bench in two things we can work on one
at a time right and keep each of those
things as a level we're processing so
each part of the system we have this
consistent regularity I did closure can
really
doing that in nice way right is it sort
of natural to tour it consists of
granularity rather than in a more outlaw
style language where you tend to sort of
go back and forth you're accessing some
field of some classes that right be
aware right but a big part of reaching
this state of flow and reaching this
habit is especially in programming right
is to be aware of the way you're
approaching it and how that affects your
mental state we're having programming we
want programming to be fun right we have
a lot of tools to make it that way but
it's up to us to remember to do it every
could code so that's what I have to look
I think just cuz I'm on the discussion
slided only the microphone anymore oh
that's what I have for today doing time
for QA a student out mamani ok time to
teach thanks again ok
