today about creating DSL specifically in
the context of my fledgling DSL that
I've been developing called spectacular
this is gonna be a tale of spectacular
success and failure so once upon a time
there was a company who had a problem
they knew they would have a lot of
financial data a lot of critical
financial data and they needed a place
that they could store it manipulate it
that they could trust and also that they
could understand so spoiler alert they
chose closure right and they also chose
de tonic the atomic has a lot of really
really good properties that they liked
it's data driven it's functional it has
a closure API it has a free version up
to a point
you can audit the history of your
database because nothing is overwritten
only added to and it also has support
there's a de Tomic community and
cognitive itself provides say tommix
support so a lot of good features the
features that we cared the most about
was that it was data-driven everything
is data right so schemas your de Tomic
schemas our data I do not mean prismatic
schema I really mean de Tomic scheme my
hair so if you're gonna tell des Tomic
what kind of things are on your database
you're just using a vector of maps of
keywords saying that I have a relation
called a house color and it has type
string just data you install that on the
database via data you make a transaction
which is just data on to your connection
you say you can add things just by using
the DV add keyword you say I have a
house that is the color red or you can
retract that fact about the house my
house is no longer red poles are also
data so if you have an entity on the
database and you want to get the house
color then you can just say pull the
house color with a vector of keywords
and you'll get back a house color that
is the color red like database queries
also just data right so this is finding
a house in the database where the house
has the color red and you get back one
two three four which is
NTID and then you can use state Alma
Kennedy in order to get that off the
database and get back into Tama Kennedy
thing all right so just to sync up
really quick just so that we're all on
the same page data is great because you
have the power to create inspect destroy
rebuild all with closure artery with
with functions that you understand and
as a bonus it's all immutable we like
immutability right so I just told you a
whole bunch of really great things about
the atomic and now I'm gonna convince
you that it's not enough right so
spectacular exists for a reason and I'm
gonna try to explain why all right so uh
what spectacular we wanted to still be
able to use they Tomic would be cooler
and safer when we do it so our mission
statement is to make the border between
closure and atomic and more convenient
and safe place to live and we do that
with one really simple concept that
entities themselves should have types
not just the attributes not just their
relations and it is themselves should
have types and I'll show you what that
means right so instead of schemas we're
going to talk about specs so you can def
spec a house so now this is an entity
type I have a house type that has a
color which is the string almost exactly
the same thing except now you can talk
about houses and not just about house
color right so when you define your spec
house you get a mat based constructor so
you can create houses as if you were
creating a map you say I'm making a
house through the color red and you also
get a predicate to check to whether a
thing is a house right and then you can
just use normal keyword access to get
the color out of that house and then
when you actually need to interact with
the atomic spectacular just gives you an
easier way to make a schema out of these
specs you can say just make a schema out
of my house and it handles all the
boilerplate of making the spec for you
you can make a schema out of your single
spec lots of specs or name space and
then you can just use spectacular to
just take that schema and put it and
create a database with it and then if
you want to add new things to the
database it's really succinct all you do
is you create a house and then just say
create that helps on the database all
right so you say make
that has the color blue and then create
it over there and that's it it does it
it returns it
it now has a DB ref attribute which is
one two three four which is the entity
ID over on the database and you can
still use keyword access so you can
still say just get me the color out of
that house and it'll say well life that
house is blue and then you can use a
Stosh a social pain to then update the
the color attribute on the database to
be the color white instead and it'll
give you back a new house well actually
it's the same house but a new object
with the same DVID so it's still one two
three four except now it is the color
white it's so really succinct to create
a so just do the thing very declarative
and spectacular also has a map like
query syntax so for example you can
query for a house on the database where
the house is color is red and right here
I'm using percent as in like closes
anonymous functions the the hash and
then the percentage so it's just talking
about the first thing in the query or
you can find a string where the string
is the color of aus or you can find both
a house and a string that are related by
a color so if you create specs if you
write down this spec in a file
spectacular will give you runtime
verification of the entities that you're
creating if you try to make a house with
the color five it'll say no no you can't
do that right if you try to make a house
with an attribute that it doesn't have
you should say the paint is red it'll
also stop you from doing that but it
also gives you static verification so if
you're ready query say you're looking
for a house where the paint is the color
red it can tell you at compile time that
that makes no sense
and if Core typed is your thing core
types closure is your thing then you can
say well I have a function called make
white house and it's gonna return a
house and that house has the color five
static error you can't type check that
function so there a lot of other things
about spectacularly I don't have time to
talk about there's also a DB cardinality
mini which means you can have a bunch of
different things in the same field we
support that there's also a Def Union
Union type of specs and then there's
also generators so core for closure test
check generators you just get them for
free and you can bard your database with
random stuff we use that a lot so a
thesis statement of spectacular maths
are cool we really like maths right and
when you're right down your spec it
should be a lot easier to create to
update and to query well type things on
the database oh and right everything
should be well typed so does it live up
to those grand expectations for
shadowing from the beginning of the talk
suggests maybe no right so I'm gonna go
over a lot of properties that I think
libraries DSL xapi is in general should
have and then I'm going to talk about
with very concrete examples whether or
not I think spectacular actually lives
up to those good properties that I think
everything should have hold all right so
the first thing I'm gonna talk about its
types right that's what I keep hammering
on um and I know we probably have a lot
of mixed opinions about types in this
crowd so I want to put it really simply
right uh type system if you are not with
me then you are my enemy right if you
make me do things that I don't want to
do and you don't give me anything for it
then why do you exist so imagine you're
Indiana Jones uh you have been almost
set on fire put through a bunch of
trials almost run over with a tank you
get to the end right you think you're
done and this old guy comes up and tells
you to fight him and select a type but I
mean a Grail before you can save the
world in your dying father right I don't
think this is gonna be much of a stretch
for some of the developers in the
audience because you work really hard on
your software and I'm sure it could save
the world if not for that pesky type
system right
but closure and atomic are gonna be
really nice about it
they're gonna keep you from taking the
first of a number because it's probably
not what you want to do but if you
selected the wrong metaphorical Grail
like maybe you took the first of the
string it'll try to do something with it
right you get back to character maybe
that's what you wanted
but spectacular he's not gonna let you
do that it's gonna be a lot stricter
about entities and specific to make sure
that they have the right fields in them
so for example if you have a spec that
is a person you can say people have
hearts and you say you have a spec that
is a car and cars can have paint right
in day Tomic you would then get a schema
with person slash hearts and car slash
paint and if this was just the atomic
right well the Atomics not gonna stop
you from putting a heart on a cart or
putting paint on a person that's just
cool because it doesn't have a notion of
like a person entity right but
spectacular is gonna take a very firm
anti kirby anti blue man group stance
here right because you've said that cars
can't have hearts cars only have paint
and you said people can't be painted
right so what's gonna do that for its
gonna check to make sure that the Blue
Man Group doesn't sneak it so what's
that good design is it good to disallow
things like this well I think yes
definitely because you wrote down a spec
where they were separated and they
should remain separated and as an
improvement over day Tommy because they
Tomic only has a DB type ref just like a
pointer right and that's not what you
broke down you didn't write down a point
you said people have hearts which makes
it a lot more predictable when you get a
person off the database you know what
you're getting but unfortunately it also
entirely excludes DB type wrath right so
that means there isn't just like a
generic pointer type there's no any type
in spectacular and obviously that's the
thing that should exist so we shouldn't
have excluded that oops so like I said
earlier you can also statically type
these things so if you wanted to
statically type this function find
houses by color that takes a color and a
database and returns a sea cable house
well you can do that right cuz this
query here says I'm given gonna give you
back is a sequence of houses statically
which is quite nice
is that good design static typing yeah
if that's your damn
it's totally opt-in you can just totally
ignore the type closure exists and not
this function it's also a lot less work
to trying to get the same result with
day Tomic because you'd have to do the
cast yourself okay what if you have a
entity type that absolutely needs to
have a field what if a man needs a name
well you can say that and spectacular so
you have a man that has a name field
that is required and if you try to make
a nameless man it will give you an error
and that's good design you're completely
unable to express this in day Tomic it's
opt-in you can just ignore the fact that
required exists it's simple required is
required it is enforced everywhere so
run time if you try to make an error if
you try to make a nameless man it's an
error and if a nameless man is sitting
on your database spectacular will you
get it like it just it just won't let a
nameless man come into your domain which
is what you said um
so to summarize I think types should be
an equivalent exchange I'm making you
write down a spec and it should be worth
your trouble it should give you things
back in return
a spectacular gives you a lot of things
back in return verification static
runtime verification great it's
documentation you can hand your spec
file to someone and they know exactly
what's on your database it's declared if
they can just look at it read now I know
exactly what your entities are which
also makes it maintainable right and
since you've wrote down a spec now I can
make creation update inquiry very
succinct and it also gives you
guarantees like required that are not
enforced by the host and finally it
makes refactoring really easy because
you basically just change your schema
and then just track down the places in
the code where you need to make these
changes where it gives you static and
runtime errors but it also has some
drawbacks right take space on the
database I mean everything needs to keep
track of what type it is that's just the
fact but I think what's worse is that
you actually lose control over the
schema right because now spectacular has
control it has you know the from spec to
database it has control over your schema
because it needs to be able to
anticipate what's on your database which
means it needs to look like what it's
expecting
is a problem so so say you have a spec
called a large house anesthetic called a
small house that both have the same
field they're both a color a house with
a color so in spectacular when you make
your schema you get a large house color
and a small house color which is not
what you would do if you were just using
the atomic he would use house color
right that's the string it's a string in
both cases house color makes sense it's
well typed spectacular totally excludes
this right now it disallows this
idiomatic day Tomic attribute and is not
inherently unsafe so that kind of
control over the actual attribute name
some sort of polymorphism over house
types should have been available from
day one and it's it's not so you have
now lost control over your schema and
spectacular it just kind of leaves you
out in the dry right so on type
spectacular gets a b-plus it excludes
idiomatic day Tomic like I just said but
also adds really new interesting useful
ways to to interact with enemies right
okay so modularity you do your thing
I'll do mine we don't really have to
talk about each other right so likewise
right they don't have to know each other
know about each other two exists and to
be built up into two new and exciting
things so I really want to talk about
spectacular ability for you to write
Mont modular programs and not about the
actual modularity of spectacular itself
so in diatomic each database is pretty
much like it has its own schema and you
can talk about them separately but in
closure you can split up information in
a lot of different ways into different
namespaces into different functions
records protocol types all things like
that and spectacular does a pretty bad
job unifying those things because yeah
you can define specs and different
namespaces bananas absolutely no effect
on the resulting schema it's like I see
that you did that but I don't really
care so it's impossible to isolate specs
encoder that we're not otherwise
conflicted the atomic and I'll explain
that but what it basically means is that
the Legos are a lie in spectacular it is
more like Highlander
specs to literally fight each other
to be recognized so if you have a
namespace called people with weapons and
you define Highlander to have a sword
because that's what you care about and
you have another namespace where people
have closed that defines Highlanders who
have a kilt you get the atomic
attributes Highlander sword and
Highlander kilt but spectacular knows
about the two separate highlighters and
this because of a problem because
spectacular kind of keeps them together
and you can make a schema with a
Highlander with a kilt and then you can
send it over to de topic and atomic can
create Highlanders with kilts but as
soon as you try to query de Tomic and
just say please give me a Highlander
you'll get something back that's
spectacular doesn't know how to deal
with it actually doesn't know which
point ended up winning which is a
problem why is this badly implemented
yeah undocumented non determinism is my
favorite kind of non determinism because
half the time they'll get an error
because it wasn't the spec it was
expecting and half the time it'll just
let it happen right and then it's not
good design either right because this
these aren't incompatible abstractions
but they're being treated as
incompatible by spectacular and what's
worse is that there's really quite a
simple solution right you just need
specs to provide modularity and closure
justify them in different namespaces or
what-have-you and then just use the
database for my modularity and atomic
the only time that you really care about
theological schemas is when you have
like an attribute Highlander age that is
both a string and a number that's a
problem that's what you really have to
exclude but eyeliners with swords and
kilts not really an issue so spectacular
gets a what use modularity it's not even
an F like it didn't even try I didn't
even show up so so that's bad
composability things fitting together
right so it's the ability to have your
Legos and then build an x-wing out of
them so spectacular goes pretty well
having composable construct and update
so if you have creation or query then
you can directly pass those objects
directly into a social and that's good
design right because if
you make a hashmap you can immediately
associate that's fine that makes sense
that's closure
it's not really an improvement over IDEO
Tomic because they Tomic gives you back
an entity ID which you can then transact
on to and what source is is kind of an
oversimplification because it implies a
lot more asynchronous safety than then
it really helps you with right because
if you create something and then 20
minutes later you associate it what has
happened in the meantime it looks like
it's the same object but it's been
sitting on a database so maybe someone
has come and just clobbered it right so
even though in your code it looks like
it composes really nicely weird things
could be happening right and so spec and
query they're armed echoes their big old
macros and syntax is not composable in
the same way so you can't compose
queries you can't just like say I have
one query I have another query make them
the same query you can't do that and you
also can't reuse parts of specs so
that's not good design there should be a
way to to reuse these logical parts even
though they're they're there macros so
spectacular is gonna get about a C on
composability it's got some nice
composability features but it's not
really trying that hard immutability we
love this right
I'm preaching to the choir and
spectacular basically takes the if it's
not broken don't fix it at attitude
because the atomic databases are
immutable the atomic entities are
immutable closure maps are mutable and
spectacular just uses that and doesn't
break it so yeah obviously that's good
design you guys all know that
immutability is good design right so
spectacular gets an easy a yeah it's
like yoga class I didn't even have to
try right but but effects happen all
right so does spectacular help you
reason about these changes that really
need to happen because we're talking
we're talking about at the database here
right it it changes over time side
effects are real and atomic transact
does the side effect it creates in your
database something happens and
spectacular also has these create a
social ease actually take real effects
so what spectacular does is it defines a
lot of different update semantics that a
so she can have and I'll explain that so
the first thing that I wanna talk about
is by value so if you just have this
spec that is a house that has a roof
that you just say it's a roof I don't
care what you do with it then and you'll
have by value semantics so roofs can
have shingles which have tights which
can be wood metal plastic so right so we
have rooms that are wood metal or
plastic and so if I have a blue house
with a metal roof and I want to add a
new roof that is wood what spectacular
will do it won't touch the metal roof
I'll just kind of leave it orphaned on
the database and it'll put that wood
roof onto the blue house that's right
now you it won't try to mess with the
metal roof it won't mess with the wood
roof definitely won't try to merge them
it'll just give you back a blue house
with a wood roof and a metal roof just
kind of hang it out okay that's often
not what I want
usually this is what I want by reference
updates so if you instead put a link
keyword on your field I would have
called it breath but ref is a thing
already
so it's called link link is by reference
then what it'll do so if you have a roof
a metal roof and you change that to a
wood roof on the database right so I
associate i'p on to my roof you can see
and a Tomic that metal roof becomes a
brown wood roof right but since these
objects are immutable back enclosure
land if I try to get the shingle type of
that metal roof it's still metal right
okay that's gonna be metal forever even
if it's changed on the database now what
if I continue and put that metal roof
into a house what color is the roof of
the house well spoiler alert it's brown
there's a picture right there it's brown
and that's because you've told it to do
it by reference like don't look at
what's inside this object just take the
DB identity and put it at the place
right and so on the database that was
already a brown roof so you get a house
with a brown roof okay that's what I
want like 99
said of the time which is why this
exists Anna Lessing is component it's
almost like the atomic component so you
just add the component keyword to it and
what a thing is that this roof is kind
of a component of this house it doesn't
make sense outside of this house and so
when you have a blue house with a metal
roof and you put on your wood roof it
deletes the metal roof it doesn't leave
it stranded on the database and then it
gives you back the blue house with a
roof so that's component so three
different flavors of almost the same
kind of thing is this good design yeah I
like it a lot because it's really easy
to reap to reason about the asynchronous
changes because you've been very
explicit about what it should do in the
face of weird things happening and it's
really easy to specify you just add a
keyword and the semantics change but
component and atomic is slightly
different for those of you that know
diatomic it won't actually retract the
metal roof that'll still be there but
yeah I named it the same thing right so
that's that's a helpful for de tomic
programmers coming over here because
you're gonna wonder why your metal roofs
keep getting deleted and what I've said
explicitly is that these don't try to do
merges right well what if you actually
need to do a tree update right those are
things that we do spectacular is gonna
make your life hell it's not gonna help
you at all you basically have to go down
in the tree and set that fire to a six
that you wanted to do because if you try
to do it with just spectacular it'll
probably end up trying to recreate your
entire tree which it's not what you want
and so even though I said you know maps
are really cool mats are really cool I
didn't give you a so shin I didn't give
you update in and that's that's not
helpful so spectacular gets a beat and
then it really does keep scary things
from happening in general you don't
really have to think too hard to keep
scary things from happening but it also
doesn't help you with the scary things
right sometimes scary things need to
happen you need to do these weird
asynchronous merges and it doesn't help
you with them so next extensibility
leaving room to grow and your framework
so spectacular doesn't give you five
specs and make you use just those five
specs right so you can extend the the
specs that your database has obviously
so good um what about the base type
environment right so de Tomic base types
are not extensible and that's that's
totally reasonable right you can't just
say I have this new type now please the
atomic work with this type on your
database you can't do that fine but in
spectacular the base types are also not
extensible so if you want it's actually
not exactly the same base type we have
more interesting types like for example
calendar day as a financial company we
really just care about banking days we
don't care about like instance with time
so I created a calendar day implemented
is say tommix insan the database when it
comes on and off it's basically coerced
it does add a time with only the year
month and day fields right but I had to
write that into spectacular
I couldn't just define that in my engine
and like not have spectacular know about
that because spectacular is based type
environment is not extensible and that's
not good design but it's also not bad
design it just hasn't gotten done yet
like it's there it's just not done
because finding hours in the day okay
but spectacular is actually quite
extensible with respect to databases
themselves because the the coercion of
entities is left open so it's database
agnostic so if you wanted to come in and
give an API for data scripts you could
totally do that you wanted to which is
of course good design all you'd have to
do is basically write the coercion from
whatever entity type you haven't data's
the data script into spectacular and
you'll be able to use all the nice
spectacular things with that so that's
good yeah
specs themselves are just data so if you
don't like my day Tomic API you can
write your own all you need is the spec
which is data it's a record of fields
with types with fields with types right
and you can just write your own Assoc
row and create I'm gonna stop you so
yeah good unfortunately though
the the the macro syntax is not
extensible you can't for example define
your own query types right you can't add
new kinds of updates into existing
functions um and it's not bad design
it's also not good design I just don't
really know why you would want to do
that so if you can come up with a reason
why you want to do that then I might
make this extensible so it's just not
there so spectacular gets the c-plus
on this because although the
opportunities aren't there I basically
just told you don't do it yourself am I
gonna help you like make a data script
API you have to basically crawl through
the code and do it yourself fine and
some extensions like the base type
environment are disallowed for like no
particular reason the last thing I want
to talk about is incremental abstraction
because I'm basically sitting between
closure and a Tomic which means I'm
building on the shoulders of giants and
I shouldn't forget that all right so I'm
gonna explain this with this really
beautiful picture of Moldova Falls and
I'll explain how so so let's talk about
query for example the atomic query as I
said before is just data spectacular
query is a giant macro that expands to
add atomic query which doesn't give you
any control it doesn't let you inspect
the query that it generated it doesn't
let you tweak it and it doesn't let you
change anything about it before you
actually end up creating the database
right
de Tomic pull also just data you might
have even forgotten about pull since I
haven't mentioned it well because
spectacular poll doesn't even exist
I didn't implement spectacular pull so
if you want to do pull you have to do it
with rod atomic but now you've lost
control over the schema which means now
you have to know what schema and
spectacular generated which means now
you have to work in terms of large
houses and small houses instead of the
house color that you wanted for example
right so how's that
they tell me transact just data but
spectacular just tries to hide the
transaction data right when you do
create or so she doesn't tell you what
it did it just gives you back the object
what if you wanted to change that before
actually creating this what if you just
wanted to see what spectacular wanted to
do and then maybe do some tweaks and
then send it off to your database nope
no you can't do that so spectacular is
just like way up at the top there with
its fancy cue and create and it's so
ocean atomic is way down there at the
bottom when it's query and transact and
it's pull and you might be thinking you
know I was promised a bridge you know I
was promised this five minute hike to
this bridge where I can look down look
up at the pretty waterfall and I could
look down at the pretty pool and like
exists in both worlds simultaneously it
lets a look at spectacular look at what
spectacular is doing and look of what
the Atomics doing just kind of like live
in between right and spectacular does
you want worse like you cross the bridge
and then it burns you but burns it
behind you right so that's not good
so yeah it's bad design but it's also
not horrible I mean it's really easy for
beginners if they wanted to just sit up
at the top of the waterfall be like oh
pretty waterfall like that's that's
perfect right like really easy for them
to get started really easy to create
query they don't have to think about it
too hard it also gives you static typing
these are these are giant macros because
it has to exist at compile time in order
to give you setec types and other things
that are expanding but I told you it was
opt-in right I told you like you don't
have to care about types for now you're
losing something because I want to give
you types so it's bad it's bad because
you have no control if you're using
query that like spectacular square you
have no control about what comes out
you've no control about the transaction
data you have no information about the
transaction data right so even though
you took the time to write down these
specs and ends up hurting the person who
actually knows the atomic so a lot of
times I know day Tomic and I find myself
raining day Tomic instead of writing
spectacular end
so if a diner gets a D on this hey
because it is really friendly for
beginners but as soon as you have
something complicated that doesn't just
quite fit in my my crazy syntax it's
like well too bad fall down the mountain
used a tonic I don't like falling down
mounds so where do we go right
spectacular is not going away spoiler
alert it actually works really well
spectacular works in production as long
as you're willing to make the
compromises that I talked about and the
reason that we make these compromises
because we have a guarantee that a logic
ideological beta doesn't reach the
database it doesn't go on it doesn't
come off and even if someone like tricks
the database into having a logic the
theta you can't get it back off and
that's a huge guarantee which is why we
use it so there's a lot of things that
spectacular could improve on just as a
reminder like this is version 0.6 point
oh it's existed for a couple of years
and hasn't gotten a lot of love so
there's a lot of places that it could go
it could provide tree updates if it's
provide namespace isolation could give
you a schema control can give you schema
migration which I didn't even talk about
pole would be a nice thing and maybe you
could support data script closure script
those are all good things but I should
have right and I just want to remind you
of the general properties that I talked
about so if you are about to think about
picking up a new library API DSL or if
you're thinking about implementing a
library API or DSL
think about these things if they make
sense in your context just think about
them please so thank you thank you to
the organizers who are putting on this
wonderful conference thank you for
giving me the third talk slot so I can
enjoy the rest of the conference thank
you to all of you for listening and
thank you to all of the people who have
either contributed to spectacular or
been a soundboard for me bouncing design
ideas off of
I'm gonna wait one second on questions
make sure you have it Mike before you
start hi jiff ideas about how you might
be able to use say something like a
module
sorry attribute set or some sort of
modular description of a set of
attributes which you might want to be
able to move around and use in different
and different types is that something
you think might be possible yeah
absolutely
it would be really nice to package
things up and just say this this one
gets a package just this one gets a
package this one gets a package yeah
absolutely
I'm not sure exactly how that would look
but that is definitely something I'm
thinking about
cool so first of all just met a really
impressive presentation I find it really
impressive that you kind of have
ownership of the library and you gave
very objective grading based on software
engineering like pillars like that was
really really impressive great
presentation great style great slides
and all that I wanted to ask about name
spacing that seems like something that
you can just concatenate like the
namespace on how difficult is it really
when should we look forward to that so
it's really easy to do that with like
the spec name itself like oh yeah I just
put the namespace on it but what would
the attributes look like in that case
because I do exactly make the namespace
of the attribute be the namespace of the
thing you defined so you'd still kind of
get your Highlander that has the two
different things that I'm not sure
exactly how to reconcile that right now
maybe that's totally fine to have right
maybe it's not so that's like yes that
seems like an obvious solution and yes
that is definitely the way that I'm
looking towards right now but I'm not
sure what the consequences will be in
that
thank you
can you elaborate a little more on how
hard it will be to implement support for
data script I think it's kind of very
strong use case or newcomers to cloture
community especially yeah I would love
to do that I don't know much if at all
about closures about a data script but
in general I can speak that basically
all you need to do in order to hook into
spectacular is to find one def method
that takes whatever kind of entity you
have in data script and tells
spectacular basically how to translate
that type into a spectacular spec so
that's really all spectacular the atomic
does is define that def method another
question if you are going back and
editing types that you've defined and
then we running like does it does it
manage sanely the the migration of one
set of schema to the next is there any
lifecycle around that yeah so I can't
really speak about schema migration
itself because we actually don't have a
persistent service export fund reasons
so I'm not exactly sure with schema
migration would look like in this case
but it does give you the new schema it
can do a diff for you and basically
it'll tell you all the places in your
code that need to change via
verification that you've written in so
as a library maintainer how are you
weighing these competing drives to
maintain backward compatibility which
I'm sure is priority and adding from
this feature set you're looking at yeah
that's a good question
I'd say you basically just have to weigh
the the amount of code that will need to
change in order to support this and the
benefits that you'll get from it
right so every time I make something I'm
like well this will probably take me or
the average person like
day to update all their code or
basically something like that and then
but you know how much is this gonna do
for me down the line like every the next
time that I write a query because I
write you know a query a day kind of
thing how much quicker is that gonna be
for me and then so I basically let it
build up to a breaking point where I'm
like I can just keep doing this I can
just keep doing this I can just keep
writing these helpful queries and then
I'm just like no I can't do it anymore
and then I fix it and spectacular and
then I go on with my day
I was just wondering if you're thinking
maybe down the road it seems like right
now it's really good at guaranteeing
that your rights don't corrupt database
but that the reads become problematic
because you can't do like projection or
read into a different schema if that's
something you're thinking of like having
a read schema where you can do more like
a talk like read parts of this and far
as that happened to this new entity yeah
you know I hadn't thought about that but
I would really love to talk to you
offline about what that would look like
I so I really liked the the grading
criteria that you gave for yourself I'm
curious whether you apply that when
you're cos is where you're at when
you're considering them not that
explicitly but those are certainly
things that I look for it's kind of hard
to to give those grades until you'd like
try to use this library every day you
know like I wouldn't expect someone else
to be able to just look at spectacular
and be like oh yeah it doesn't I don't
know I look at all those things but I
don't get great yeah it would be really
cool if that was like if you could see
that when you were deciding whether to
use one should do that hurry up okay
