which can be subtly not basic when you
look at the details behind them but
really gonna try to presume nothing and
talk about first principles you may know
a lot of it or you may be surprised that
you know some of the things you've
presumed weren't true
before I dig in so we're going to talk
about data structures today and the core
data structures built into closure but
the first step prior to data structures
is just to understand the reader a
little bit alright everybody I think has
heard the term repple right used to
typing in things like one and you get
back 142 you get 42 and we can type in
strings and what you what's happening at
the repple is is what the acronym stands
for read eval print the first part of
which is read and the critical part of
closure is that the reader can process
text and returns data structures the
next step in the repple is the e which
is eval which is the compiler kicking in
and evaluating whatever that data
structure was but the key point to
remember is that the reader is an
independent thing that reads data
structures in when you when you say give
me the next thing from read you're going
to get a data structure back you're not
going to get characters or a line or
string or anything like that you can get
the next object read so there are
certain kinds of objects the reader
knows how to read we've seen a number
here and a string this last guy is a
character what's the character a and
there's a couple of other atomic things
like that like symbols keywords so
that's a key word begins with the colon
so those things are all atomic and for
the most part the ones I just showed you
they're numbers
strings characters and keywords they all
evaluate to themselves so the difference
between read and eval you don't see
because what the reader read in is what
the evaluator returns so they're the
same but there are things that the
evaluator tries to interpret one of
those things is a key is a symbol so if
I just type in a here we get an error
because symbols and lists in particular
are treated special especially by the
evaluator and so one of the things the
evaluator does with a is it tries to
figure out what H stands for now there
was a treat symbols as the names of
things and it tries to find out what
they named similarly there are some
composite literals like vectors so if we
use square brackets and type something
in square brackets we get a vector which
is a little bit like an adjustable
length array or most similar I would say
to a an ArrayList but very much not
exactly the same and we'll talk more
detail about that but the thing I want
to point out here is that if I say 1 2 3
in parentheses that denotes a list and
lists are treated specially also by the
evaluator in fact when it sees the list
that thinks this is something I'm going
to call ok so what was read by the
reader was a list of the numbers 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
and when the evaluator sees the list it
tries to call it and so in this case is
trying to call 1 and 1 is not a function
and it's not a functional thing
so that's yielding an error
the third kind of thing or another kind
of thing the reader the third kind of
composite thing the reader knows how to
read is a map and particularly this is a
literal hash map this goes in the curly
braces and it consists of key value key
value pairs when the compiler reads the
curly braces it reads in a literal map a
map is kind of an abstraction again I'm
going to dig into these types in a
second but the kind of map you get from
a literal is a hash map totally I'm
gonna go into depth I just want to make
sure we on that all understand what's
happening in the reader so when I read
this literal map by the compiler Sora
the key word a the number one the key
word be the number two and said I'll
make a hash table essentially a hash map
where a will map to one and B will map
to two the key words however the same
evaluation rules apply so if I say a1 b2
now it's a map of what it's a map of
symbols two numbers okay but we know
something about symbols right what is
the evaluator try to do with symbols
it's gonna try to figure out what they
denote a right and that we haven't set
up a and B to mean anything yet so this
will also fail in other words just
trying to read a as a well I don't want
say variable but as a the name of
something and figure out what it names
and doesn't name anything yeah so that
won't evaluate similarly if I try to
make a list of I mean a vector of a B
and C while they're read in as a vector
of three symbols the evaluator then
tries to make a vector of what those
three symbols mean and since they don't
mean anything yet we get this we get
this problem if we were to define
some meanings to assign some values to
these names like this and we'll talk
about deaf in a little while we've now
set up meanings for a B and C so now
when the evaluator tries to evaluate
this list of three symbols it's going to
have the things that those symbols mean
and it will actually return a vector of
the three things the three values so
that's the difference between reading
and evaluation okay what was read in was
a vector of three symbols what the
evaluation of that produced was a vector
of in this case three numbers because
that's what those symbols stood for so a
key thing to remember distinguishing key
words and symbols is that symbols get
evaluated and key words always stand for
themselves every okay so far it's a very
important part of closure that it uses a
reader that the language is not defined
in terms of some grammar and that
there's a lexer that interprets
characters and they mean special things
the evaluator evaluates data structures
and the reader reads data structures you
can use the reader
Alucard in your own program to read data
in just like you would use an XML parser
but the beautiful thing about the reader
reading closure data structures is you
get that for free and it ends up you can
build a language like closure that's
defined in terms of data structures and
not in terms of character strings and
character interpretation so let's talk a
little bit more about those data
structures in lieu of having any kind of
slides prepared I figured what I would
do would be go through the site as a
just launch off point for topics the
data structures part and sort of fill in
the blanks because this is very terse
it's a reference things are said you
know I would hope with a lot of
precision but
often not with a lot of prose and
supporting supportive you know
description so what I hope to do today
is describe some things and answer any
questions you might have so closure is
built on a pretty rich set of data
structures certainly compared to lists
traditionally it's a lot richer I think
that Python and Ruby have brought the
notion of you know in language data
structures to the forefront probably
JavaScript started that trend the
closures data structures are pretty
unique particularly on point one which
is that they're immutable you know I
said a vector is sort of like an
extensible array it is except for the
fact that no particular vector can ever
be changed similarly no symbol can be
changed no keyword can be changed no
number can be changed no list can be
changed no map can be changed none of
the core closure data structures can be
changed now there are lots of contexts
in which it may feel like you're
changing things but that's never true of
closure data structures so they're
immutable as we just saw a bunch of them
are readable that means that the reader
has direct support for interpreting a
set of characters as a data structure
and yielding that data structure because
they're immutable the closure data
structures support what I would call
proper equality semantics and by proper
equality I mean if you want to compare
if two numbers are equal let's say you
had two variables in a traditional
language amv and you you asked if they
were equal and they both had the number
you know 42 in them you would say you
know 42 is equal to 42 is definitely
true and you would never be worried for
instance that 42 could be changed and
that for some reason it could no longer
be equal to another 42 somewhere because
the number itself changed numbers don't
change you
of numbers as values similarly in Java
at least strings are immutable so you
could treat strings like values even
though there are a reference type
they don't change and if you compare any
two strings they're going to compare
either equal or in equal forever and
ever
based upon their values and it ends up
that there is a proper way to think
about equality and that is if things are
values that cannot change they can be
compared by value and the results of the
comparison can never differ but if
things are mutable then they should
never be compared by value because if
you were to compare two things that were
mutable let's say a poorly written date
object in some language where you could
change parts of the date object
you really can't treat date objects in a
language like that as as values because
you could compare two data objects at
one point in your program and get a
certain result and compare those same
two data objects in another part of your
program and get a different result
because they could be changed so proper
equality means if it's a reference type
that's mutable equality should be based
around is it identity are they the same
object if they are they're equal if
they're not they should never be
considered equal but a lot of libraries
and a lot of languages don't do that
well they allow you to define equality
for your own types you can make mutable
objects that have defined equals as a
value comparison and that is in my
opinion broken proper equality means you
compare the values only on immutable
things but because even these rich data
structures like vectors and maps are
immutable in closure you can compare
them by value and all the comparisons
under closure are by value they're also
very optimized so you may be concerned
whoa you know what happens if I have you
know two huge things tonight can I see
if they're equals that is an optimized
thing the hash values are cached and
various tricks are used to make sure
that that's a that's really efficient
under the hood
there's a bunch of things about the data
structures that I think are important
one is that they're manipulated via
interfaces which means that even though
you see literals for maps and vectors
they represent particular instances of
logical abstractions there's a logical
abstraction that corresponds to map
which is basically it's an associative
data structure mapping keys to values
now there's lots of ways to implement
map you can implement map as a hash
table you can implement map as a
red-black tree right you can implement
map kind of naively just using an array
of key value key value which wouldn't
have good performance but it could still
behave like a map when you see the
functions that manipulate these data
structures you have to remember that
they can manipulate the abstractions and
they're defined in terms of the
abstractions not the concrete data
structure types so anything that
manipulates any map manipulates all maps
anything that manipulates any vector
type relates all vector types and we'll
see that as we move forward the other
thing about the data structures is they
support sequencing a huge part of the
closure library is the sequence set of
functions which manipulate logical
sequences of items and it ends up you
can take most data structures and figure
out a way to represent what's in them as
a sequence of things and all the closure
data structures support all the
composite closure data structures
support sequencing you can walk through
the values in a list of course that's
pretty straightforward because all this
really is a sequence but you can walk
through the values in a vector you can
also walk through the values in a map
where each value will be a key value
pair and you've seen iterators which are
a little bit similar in other languages
perhaps but the sequencing abstraction
is much stronger than the iterator
abstraction as we'll see later
they support metadata which we probably
won't get into today too much depending
on how fast I can start moving they're
all iterable that's a means of getting
back to Java right there are some Java
API is that would like to see iterable
things and all the closure composite
data structures are iterables so if you
have an API that says I want an iterable
whatever you get that in addition all of
the composite collections in closure
implement Java util collection the
read-only part of that the non read-only
part of Java util collection is actually
defined by the authors of the Java
collection library as being optional and
so closure of completely corresponds to
that in other words it opts out of the
right part of the collection API and
fully implements the read part so if
you're in a situation where you have a
Java API that requires a collection you
can directly use a closure vector for
instance because it is an implementation
of Java util collection which really
helps in interoperability a lot of API
is to take collections or or intervals
all right into the actual meat of it the
first data structure isn't really the in
structure at all it's the thing we use
to represent no data structure and
that's nil I'm going to talk about it
from first principles and just say
enclosure nil means nothing it means the
absence of anything and you can use nil
pretty much anywhere you need something
to show that you don't have anything
because all closure numbers are boxed
you can use you can pass null to any
function that's expecting a number it
doesn't mean the function is going to be
something useful with it but it's not a
distinct incompatible type with numbers
for instance which has a lot of value if
you want to make a data structure that
might have the number 42 and eight or it
might have no number in it you could put
nil there because there's there's no
distinction between your primitives in
terms of mapping to Java nil is the same
as Java null
so if you get nulls back from Java API
is they may print as nil it's the same
thing Nolan and all are the same
I used nil because that's a lisp
tradition it's a little bit shorter and
I think is a richer notion than know an
important thing to know about nil the
value is that the closure conditionals
like if and everything built on top of
this look for two things really nil and
false which I'll talk about in a minute
if if a a conditional sees nil or false
it says false logically false if it sees
anything else it's logically true
traditionally Common Lisp nil meant the
same thing as we would normally use for
false and didn't have a separate notion
closure has a separate separate notion
of false strictly to ease
interoperability with Java API is that
return boolean because it ended up that
translating them to and from nil is
something you cannot do symmetrically if
I have any questions about logical truth
yes you've all stumbled over that nil
has another key use in closure which is
that all of this sequence functions
which basically iterate through things
need to indicate when there's nothing
more to iterate through and they
indicate that by returning nil I don't
think given you haven't had a lot of
list background that you would be
confused about it but in Common Lisp
it's a problem that nil and the empty
lists are sort of the same thing and
people especially coming from scheme for
some reason really get tripped up by
that nil means nothing it's not an empty
anything it's not anything
that's a good way to think about it I'm
gonna go through numbers pretty quickly
essentially there are small and large
integers the main thing that you want to
understand is that there's a transition
from one to the other and it's automatic
so if I say one would I over omen by rap
I got 10,000 10,000 that's like 10 we
need much bigger numbers
there's no limit to the size an integer
can grow if you start with small
integers and you keep multiplying them
or manipulating them and they'll
eventually transition out of the ability
to be represented in 32 bits there's an
automatic transition to using big
integer internally which means that none
of your integer math is ever gonna fail
at least would fail in terms of the
mathematician associative fat which is
to produce some bogus number that's not
really the answer on the other hand if
you've gotten used to the rapping nature
of arithmetic in Java or C or the C
derived languages you're in for a
surprise because it doesn't wrap integer
manipulation does not wrap and closure
it grows arbitrarily large and you'd be
surprised you know I thought oh you know
who ever really needs this and I've had
several of cases where it saved me that
it just did the right thing where it
would have silently overflowed and
wrapped particularly if you're doing big
math things so there are fixed number of
an internal detail it just means they're
there efficiently representing small
integers and big numbers represent
larger integers there are double
precision floats and they've sort of the
same syntax you get from Java that's a
float an interesting datatype you
probably haven't seen other than endless
is a ratio and essentially what a ratio
is the ratio between two integers we
know that we can't represent that number
precisely with floating point and what
ends up happening in enclosure is that
it when you say 22 divided by seven you
get 22 divided by seven it's a ratio and
it maintains those two integers inside
it or it's a composite number that knows
that knows that if you put in something
that is divisible like 21 sevenths
it will figure out that it can represent
that as an integer and it will no longer
be a ratio it'll trance it'll transfer
transmute into the
it's Joe but if it cannot be reduced it
remains a ratio rather than having a
reduction in precision by turning into a
float for instance 22 over 7 or 3 okay
let's do it 20 over 5 what do you thinks
gonna happen 25 over 25 over 20 is going
to be what guesses we have point 4 point
5 point 2 5 5 over 25 or so nobody's
right yet okay it's not the same thing
as point 2 5 though because once you
have point 2 5 you have a floating-point
number which means if you interact with
another number you're going to be
contaminated that's correct as soon as
you answer operate with the floating
point number you end up in floating
point land okay so if I say x let's say
5 xx
well let's do four right if I do this I
end up with one if I do that I end up
with 1.0 pi is a double is it already a
double right so as soon as you
interoperate with a double you're into
doubles everything turns into doubles
all your ratios are lost on the other
hand if you stay with ratios you end up
with ratios so if I multiply 22 7 by 3
and then divide it by 3 I don't lose
anything okay if I start doing this this
floating point I'm gonna start fudging
fast even something as simple as one
third is if you know it's an infinite
number where you can use one third it's
a perfectly valid value and you can
interoperate with one third other ratios
and any integers and never lose anything
it will grow to arbitrary complexity
internally in order to represent the
rational number correctly and it will
reduce at any point that it can it's
it's really cool to be able to do that
no that's that's closure yeah it's very
cool if you ever needed to really know
that you were using one third in your
program you can use one third in your
program and that's gonna do the right
thing as long as you don't interoperate
with a double soon as you do that as the
last sentence here says you end up with
doubles I'm gonna go quickly through
numbers because it's pretty
straightforward but there are some
interesting things to know first of all
things that like plus and minus and
multi
and division you're typically you know
used to being binary operations they're
not enclosure they're n area or very
attic operations and they go they go
pretty low like we can say plus nothing
which is zero and we can say times
nothing and that's one there are good
reasons for those values you can also
use them in a unary fashion in which
case nothing particularly interesting
happens but you can also use them very
attic ly you can take an arbitrary
number of arguments for most of the math
stuff so you have to remember that
because it's quite convenient and it can
yield compact equations and you have all
your typical operations quotient and
remainder comparisons also note these
take one or more more being as many as
you want
and so for instance less than four five
six is true but less than four or five
three is not so we'll check for that
relationship across the set again
probably not something you're used to
doing and there are basic things like
min and Max again they take more than
two arguments they take n arguments very
convenient especially minute max Inc and
deck or just quickie one greater than
what you passed me and one less than
what you passed me they are more
efficient than plus one number and minus
one the number so use them also I think
they are more descriptive of what you're
trying to do so you want to use them in
favor of plus one and minus one zero
pause and negative test for zero inist
positiveness and negativeness of a
number again zero in particular is
faster than equal zero so you want to
use it and also again I think it
it's things better this bit manipulation
stuff and that's pretty much it for
numbers in addition you have still Java
not lying math and all the operations in
it for manipulating floating point
values and getting sines and cosines and
all that good kind of stuff those things
don't need to be built into closure and
so they're not strings we sure we saw a
string is delimited by double quotes
right red is the string literal close
your strings are Java strings okay any
Java string function it works directly
there's no layer there's nothing in
between there's no wrapper you know they
are of type Java string as such they're
immutable also all of the member all the
methods of string are available on
closure strings closure characters or
Java characters that's the capital C
character that's the object the boxed
version of character and as such again
they support all the operations of
character you know is alpha and those
various character functions they're not
the same as the Java char primitive but
they're boxed and they're also
efficiently cached finally we have
keywords and well I guess besides ratios
so far we haven't seen any particularly
unique types but when we get into
symbols and keywords and the collections
we're going to see types that are unlike
ones you've seen before keywords are
symbolic identifiers that evaluate to
themselves and it ends up that there's a
tremendous amount of utility to having a
datatype in a language that just means
itself an analogy you might make would
be to enumerations in other languages
where enumerated value is just a name
that is a value it's distinct from other
values
and in particularly in the case of
closure keywords are that you write them
by leading with a colon you'll notice
you'll never get an error doing this in
terms of I can't find it because there's
no it to find it means itself they're
also extremely efficient from a
comparison standpoint in particular any
two keywords that have the same spelling
the same name are the same object okay
that's really important thing that's
different from strings for it's the
strings are immutable and strings of
reference types but you can have two
strings foo and they could be different
objects it's kind of like that let's
just see if we can make this happen so
there is a closure function called
identical which tests if two things are
the same object
okay so here's two strings have the same
value right if I say equal foo foo equal
is the Equality I just talked about
before value equality that's true but
identical foo foo is false on the other
hand equal the foo keywords that's true
because they had the same value they
mean themselves but if I try to do
identical
that's also true that's a promise of
their keywords that any two keywords
with the same name are the same object
that again is an extremely powerful
thing is it like a string in turn it is
a little bit and in fact Java guarantees
that string literals that appear in your
program any two instances of the same
string literal will be interned and will
be the same object and you can write
programs that take advantage of that
fact to use those string literals as
extremely fast identity comparison keys
it ends with very few applications do
that but it's a clever thing to be able
to do in closure that's that whole
concept has made first-class keywords
are for that purpose they exist for that
they exist as identifiers and they exist
to be extremely fast comparison keys the
comparison that's used by equal for
keywords is identical in other words it
just sees are they the same reference
because you cannot create two keywords
that have the same name and are
different objects so internally there is
a kind of interning system that goes on
it ends up you never need to say
identical because the equals comparison
for keywords is the same so it does the
fast compare for keywords so their
values that have identity comparison
they're fast
and I recommend their use as keys in
maps for both of those reasons they
represent themselves and they support
fast comparison lutely and you can use
it could be first string it could be
food the keyword I mean keywords are our
objects and values just like anything
else and all closure things can be keys
for instance there's no there's no such
thing as setting through the keyword now
you said I abstract that you're talking
about in a map right trying to figure
that out so we want to say foo let's
just see it we were saying what you want
you want say foo has the value of the
string foo let's call it a so yeah and
I'm gonna put this in something so we
can talk about it we're going to say
this is our map m okay okay and we can
look at them and it says that then the
question is so you want to see if
they're equal yeah well any to a strings
will be equal and no but I want to see
it extracted okay so we want to say foo
of them keywords are functions of maps
and I'll talk about that more in a
minute
okay so want to say is the value at key
foo of them equal to the string a that's
what that says okay
all right so that's keywords again I
guess the the most common thing to think
about our enumerators but enumerators
really are you know sort of dressing on
integers which they're not here there's
no other value associated with us the
name is the value yes and that would be
name and the name of who is with no
colon is itself the value of a keyword
is itself there's nothing that yes you
would because you know there there are
two things there's the keyword foo and a
right and everything right we'll talk
more about maps in in a minute and
hopefully that's that will become
clearer symbols are also identifies but
here typically symbols are used to refer
to something else again like I said the
evaluator presumes that if it finds a
symbol it's gonna try to find the
Associated value but under the hood
symbols are objects they have names like
keywords and when the reader reads it
reads in things that are symbol objects
so if you say you know foo with no
quotes and no colon or anything else
that's going to be the symbol not a
string not a key word but a symbol so
it's yet another type of thing usually
that you know you name functions with
symbols you can create you know local
names inside functions to refer to
things to values that you reuse over and
over so locals global variables can be
named with symbols I haven't shown you
on keywords but both symbols and key
words support namespaces
so essentially a symbol and a keyword
are really two part names there's the
thing before the slash and the thing
after the slash if there is a slash hope
that wasn't I should talk about quote so
we've talked about you know saying well
I already defined a if I say W which I
haven't defined I get this error if I
want to suppress the evaluation of W in
other words I I want the symbol W I
don't want the evaluator to keep looking
for more meaning you can quote it so
that single quote like that is shorthand
for the word quote and when I say that I
get back actually the symbol W and not
any other meaning it's the same as if I
said this quote W quote is a special
operator in closure it tells the
evaluator don't evaluate this thing just
return it so in this case the reader
read W the symbol and quote tells the
evaluator just return it don't try to
figure out what it means so when I say
quote W I can get the symbol W so now I
can talk about foobar without getting an
exception which is to quote it to say I
want to talk about the symbol Fuu slash
bar and it prints the same way Fuu slash
bar and what it is is it's a two-part
thing we also this name function works
on symbols and the name of this is bar
there's also a namespace part which is
foe so inside symbols there are actually
two slots one for the name and one for
the namespace if you don't use a slash
and anything preceding it there is no
namespace so if I just said a bar by
itself this is a different symbol and
has no namespace
no you can't there's a namespace and a
name you can start using dashes if you
want to get fancier
anybody have any questions on symbols
they're definitely different but it's a
big part of what composes a program if
we look at you know closure source code
we see lists of symbols mostly that's a
lot of what a program is from a data
structure standpoint a lot of what the
compiler sees are lists of symbols and
it figures out what they mean but it
also means that because symbols are
objects that we can create them when we
can see well we can create lists and
everything else we can make programs in
closure by manipulating data structures
okay there's a function for symbols
called Jensen it just returns a new
randomly not randomly a new generated
symbol with a unique name sometimes
you'll need this when you're trying to
write code that writes code you need I
need a unique name I need a new symbol
that no one's used before you could call
Jensen and get that if you want to give
it a prefix that's useful like it has
some meaning to you like I'm allocating
names to stand for IDs you can pass the
prefix in and you'll get a symbol whose
name begins with that prefix and then
it's got a number attached to it and
that the type of this thing is symbol
the type of the thing it returns is
symbol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
