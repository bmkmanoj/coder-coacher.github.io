I'm going to be talking about wiring
prismatic say P I with fun house and
coax so fun house is a library that
allows us to define an API in terms of
handlers that look like this this is a
fun house handler it's safe readable and
has no global variables plus it allows
to us to do much much more so this is
the overview of the talk we're going to
start with closure functions annotate
them with prismatic open source
libraries plumbing and schema and then
we're going to pull off those
annotations using funhouse funhouse is a
library that allows us to read in
annotated functions and summarize the
information in those functions into an
annotation info a handler info and then
what's really exciting is how we can
apply those handler infos to do a whole
host of different applications so we're
going to be talking about an application
that generates documentation of your API
an application that allows you to
actually spin up a web service using
these annotated handlers and in order to
do that we have this small routing
library that routes requests to the
appropriate handler the next two
applications are ring middleware a
special schema coercion ring middleware
that coerces requests into the
appropriate form and responses into an
appropriate form and the last
application that I'll talk about is coax
which is a library that can read the
handler info and generate client code so
let's get started with an example just
to make sure that we're all on the same
page so this is my website a user comes
to my website and fills out this form
the user types in their name and pushes
submit and that gets sent off up
to the server on the server ring
intercepts this request and converts it
into a map that looks like this where
there are keywords as keys in the map
and then there can be nested maps within
it that also have keyword keys so in
this particular case the map has a body
key and then under the body there's
another map with a user key and the user
maps to a value which is the name of our
user next this request gets passed up to
a handler and a handler really is just a
function from request to response so the
handler takes this request as input and
generates a response as output the
response is also another one of these
maps with keyword keys and it gets sent
back down to the client so let's take a
look at how we can implement this
handler using closure so as I said a
handler is simply a function from
request to response this handler takes
in the request pulls out the user from
the map the nested map that's in the
body and then the user finds it to the
Caesar variable and asserts that its
present and then if it is present we
return another map with a body that says
hello to the user so this handler is
doing something very simple but there's
still a lot of boilerplate code that
goes around it so we have this lead
binding and we have the assert and you
know even though this is a simple
example you can imagine that as you're
pulling more and more things out of the
request this boilerplate grows and grows
so wouldn't it be great if there was a
library that addressed the boilerplate
for us well there is its plumbing
plumbing is a library that prismatic
released a while ago who here has seen
plumbing or used it okay great quite a
lot plumbing is a library that
introduces
macro called a keyword function and what
the keyword function does is it allows
you to safely d structure your input and
it's optimized for processing inputs of
maps with keywords as keys so let's take
a look at how we can use it to improve
on our simple handler so here's the
handler from before at the top and at
the bottom is the key word macro version
of the handler so they do the same thing
but the amount of code for the keyword
function is a lot smaller what it does
is in the argument list it safely d
structures the input map looks inside
the body and then within the body under
the user key and saves the value there
under the user variable then it can use
the variable inside the body of the
function just as before so that's what
keyword functions allow us to do safely
d structure the inputs they also allow
us to validate the inputs so here's our
keyword handler keyword function handler
when we call it with valid input like we
saw in the previous slide we get a
response that says hello John just as we
would expect but it also validates the
input so if we call it with a malformed
input so here I'm calling it with the
string as opposed to a map we get a
runtime exception that tells us as much
your function was called on an on map
and if we call it with the map but now
where the map is in the wrong format so
here I have a bad key instead of the
user key that we get an error message
that's informative and tells us as much
it says the key user was not found in
the map the only keys in the map were
bad so keyword functions allow us to
safely d structure our inputs they're
also nice because they provide a nice
syntax for doing default arguments so
here I'm defaulting the user argument to
be the string user so that if i call it
on a
on a map that has a user field we use
that but if the user field is absent
then I default the value of the user to
be the string you so keyword functions
are great safely d structure the input
and also provide a nice syntax for
default values let's see how we can use
keyword functions to build a more
complicated example of a handler so
here's a slightly more complicated
example it's a guestbook application so
users come in they fill out information
about themselves like their name their
age and their favorite language be it
closure or closure script they submit
that form and it gets sent up to the
server presumably so that later on user
other users can come by and see all of
the people who have signed the guestbook
so this is just a standard guestbook
example so let's see what the handler
for this guestbook might look like so
we're going to start with this global
map a global death of the guest book
which is just a sikh of entries
represent it as an atom wrapping a
vector we're going to address the global
property in a second but for now the
entries in the map and the guestbook are
going to be Global's then the sign
guestbook handler is pretty
straightforward we pull out the body
from the request and then simply konja
to the end of the guestbook right seems
pretty pretty natural but there's a
problem so what guarantees that our
clients are going to be sending us the
right data data in the right format
right so we know what we want we want
maps with name and age and a language
favorite language but there's nothing
that guarantees that the users are going
to send up the right form and prismatic
has a library to address that problem
it's called schema who here has used
schema okay quite a lot of people great
so schema is
a library that allows you to describe
the shape of data and it also allows you
to validate that data that you get
matches the expected shape so let's take
a look at an example so we want to get
data that looks kind of like this a map
with the name and age in a favorite
language right so this is one particular
example we want to generally accept
things that look like this a map with a
required key name that's a string a
required key age that's along and a
required key lang which is one of either
closure or closure script so we can so
this schema allows us to declare what
shape we want the data to look like
moreover we can annotate our keyword
functions using schema so here I'm
saying that the body that I pull out of
the request should match this entry
schema so now we can safely assert that
that's what we want the body to look
like and we're declaring that what form
the input should be so we can inspect
the inputs to this function using this
function in plumbing and so we say what
are the inputs to sign guestbook well
it's expecting a map the map should have
keywords as keys that map to values one
of the required keys in the map is body
and the value for body should match this
entry schema that has a name and age and
a favorite language we can also use
schema for validation so if we call our
handler using a valid map everything is
good but if we call it with a malformed
map we get an exception that describes
what the problem is with the data so
here I'm calling it with the map I've
left off the favorite language keyword
and the error message tells me that
there's a missing required key
and the value that I passed in for the
age is a string and so it's telling me
that the string is not an instance of
the long so it's telling me that the
input that I gave it doesn't match the
schema and the error message is actually
very informative it tells us that which
parts of the data are incorrect so
schema is great because it allows us to
declare what types of inputs our
function takes now let me just make a
small note about global resources so
before I said that our guest book was
going to be represented as this global
sequence of the different entries that
have been entered into the guest book
and that's no good so why is it no good
global resources aren't very good
because it couples together different
functions that rely on that global
resource so that if you wanted to test
the two functions in parallel for
example you would have you would be kind
of stuck because you would have to mock
out what the global resources look like
for each of those two functions but if
its global then you can't really do that
so what we do is we introduce another
layer in the input to the handler so now
the handler is going to take a map with
two top-level keys one of them will be
the request just as before and then the
other one is going to be the resources
that the handler depends on and there's
not too much overhead in terms of code
when you introduce this extra layer at
the top of the map because you're using
keyword functions so you can just safely
d structure it right in the argument
vector so I've kind of laid the
groundwork for what funhouse is and so
now let me talk about the details of fun
house so as I said in the beginning of
the talk fun house is a small library
that can look at handlers annotated with
schemas and pull off lots of information
about those handlers
and summarize all of that information
into a handler info so we have our
handler and the info about the handler
and we can use those things for a whole
host of different applications so let's
take a look at an example in more detail
here is a funhouse Handler and it looks
very similar to the functions that I was
talking about on the previous slide
there's a few small differences one of
them is that this keyword function has a
doc string and doc string or keyword
functions can accept docstrings and they
behave just like they would on a regular
closure function there's also this
responses metadata that we put on the
handler this responses metadata is a map
from status code so in this case 202 the
schema that the body of the response
should match so this handler the bot is
going to return a map with the body and
the body is going to be siiick of
entries so let's go into let's see all
of the different pieces of information
that are contained in this handler so
from the name we can pull off
information about the path and the
method where the method is just the last
word after the dollar sign in the name
you can extract information about from
the doc string about what the
description of the handler is you can
get information about the schema of the
responses so for the status code what
the body schema should be you can get
information about what the handler
expects from the request so this handler
takes in a request that has a body and
the body is an entry but in general
requests can have a lot more to them so
they can have query parameters or URI
arguments and you can specify what the
schema is for those two you also know
information about the resources that
this handler depends on so this handler
depends on
s book which we haven't schematized so
defaults of the any schema and last we
can pull off information about the
source map so where this handler was
defined in source code what line number
what file what namespace and so in total
we have our handler and a summary of
various pieces of information about our
handler and so together we call this
then annotated handler and so that's
kind of what funhouse does it's very
simple just pulls off information from
our handler to get this summary and
returns these annotated handlers the
really interesting thing is how these
annotated handlers can be turned into
applications so the first of the
applications that I'll be talking about
is documentation so we have all of this
information for our handlers we can just
throw that up on the web so that users
of our handlers of our API can read
about what the expected inputs are what
the expected outputs are and so forth
right this is just all the same
information that we extract from the
handler in HTML format we can also since
we've pulled off the source map
information we have these links at the
top you can click through that and it
will take you to the source code for the
for the handler right you can if you're
curious you can see how it's actually
implemented but this doc isn't very
beautiful right it's just the one that
we ship with fun house just as a proof
of concept there's been work on
integrating fun house with other
libraries like swagger so Tommy Rieman
has worked on integrating fun house even
though it's such a new library he's
worked on integrating it with swagger
and that provides a much nicer
description of what the API is so you
can see that the various inputs and
outputs a nice thing about swagger is
that it provides a client to the API
right in the dock
tation and so you can post values up to
the different handlers and take a look
at the responses that they'll return so
that's pretty awesome and that's a
general pattern for all of these
libraries that I'm talking about they're
all very small and can be easily swapped
out if you have a more preferred library
so keep that in mind as I'm going
through the rest of them so the next
library that I want to talk about is a
simple routing library that ships with
one house so it's easy to turn a
namespace of handlers into a full API
all you have to do is take your
resources pass them into this namespace
two handlers fun where you specify
prefixes that you want to serve your
handlers on and the namespace containing
all of the handler functions this
function goes into the namespace and
loads up all of the handlers from that
namespace a handler is just one that has
metadata that's has responses on it so
that's how we decide for a namespace
what's a handler what's not and then you
just call start API and there's some
routing that goes on which takes all of
your different handlers and builds this
mega handler out of them so that when a
request comes in this mega handler
routed to the appropriate smaller
handler based on the URI of the request
so this is just a very simple routing
library that's necessary for spinning up
a web server so the standard thing you
would want to do with funhouse handlers
is make a web server and so we're
shipping a small library that allows you
to do that okay the next two
applications are really the interesting
ones and so this is where you should pay
attention so this next library that I'm
going to be talking about is a special
ring middleware that's coerces inputs to
be an appropriate form and outputs into
an appropriate form let me show you what
I mean
so let's turn back to our simple guest
book example users come in they fill out
this form and send up their name age and
favorite language so typically at least
in the applications that we're working
with this data sent up as JSON and then
that gets passed into ring and ring
converts the JSON into a closure map
where it has key words as keys but the
values are all strings right so when we
try calling our handler on this input
we're going to have a schema checked
exception we're going to see that the
age isn't a long as expected and the
favorite language isn't a key word right
so to summarize what we're getting is a
map with strings as the values but what
we want is a map which has long as the
age and a keyword as the favorite
language so what can we do well one
thing we can do is we can take off the
schema annotation on the body in the
request for our handler and introduce
all of this extra conversion code into
our handler right so we take our body we
parse the age into a long then we
convert the favorite language into a
keyword and that's actually really messy
right we don't want to do that so
wouldn't it be great if the middleware
just did this for us well what we get is
a map with strings as values and what we
want is a map with a long and a keyword
right and we've already specified this
in the schema we've said that for the
age it should be along and for the
language it should be a key word right
so can't we just use this schema that
we've already put on the
audie of our request to automatically
convert the data into the proper format
low weekend with a special middleware so
middleware is just a layer that wraps
your handler that intercepts the request
before it hits the handler right so you
can do some processing on the request
before your handler actually sees it so
let's take a look at what that looks
like so here's our example again users
submit their information it gets sent up
ring converts it into a map the values
are strings but now there's a special
coercion middleware that happens in
between or it happens next and so the
coercion middleware has access to the
schema on the handler and so it can
coerce the data into the proper format
so it knows by default how to convert
Long's strings into Long's and keywords
or strings into keywords so now we have
our data in the appropriate format and
we can pass it to our handler and
everything will work as expected right
another cool feature of this special
coercion middleware is that you can also
do output coercion so not only does the
handler intercept the request sorry not
only does the middleware intercept the
request before it hits the handler but
it can also intercept the response
before it hits the client right so
here's a scenario suppose your boss
comes to you and he says you know how
you've been using entries throughout
your guestbook application we want to
convert to client entries which are just
like entries but they have the name
split up into two fields a first name
and a last name right think about all of
the work that you might have to do in
order to convert all of the places for
all your whole application everywhere
that you return a client and entry to
the client you now have to convert it
into
this format so that's not so great so
what we can do is we can use this
corrosion middleware to do output
coercion here I'm showing an output
coercer it's just a function that
matches against schemas so it says what
is the response schema that you want to
match right if it's a client entry then
take your data pull off the name split
it into a first name and a last name and
then this social the name from the entry
and assoc first name and the last name
to the map right so now when our handler
is going to return a response to the
user it just returns an entry just as
before you don't have to change any of
your code right but you can plug in this
special coercion middleware a special
schema course are into your coercion
middleware and it will automatically
convert entries into client entries
using that code that I showed on the
previous slide and then now that you
have client entries you can send them
back down to the client cool so the last
of the applications that I want to talk
about is coax and coax addresses a
problem that we had in practice so like
all of these other libraries by the way
so I prismatic we have this web service
that's implemented in closure on the
back end and we have many different fund
end clients so we have iphones and ipads
that are built using objective-c we have
web clients that are built in closure
script and then we also have android
clients or we're starting to at least
that are built in java right and so any
time we make a change on the backend to
any of the api's right let's say we
change what the definition of one of
the entry schemas looks like right any
client that sends up an entry or
receives an entry has to now update its
code base so for one change on the
backend we now have to change what three
different code bases to reflect that
change and so coax addresses that
problem collects is a library that reads
these fun house annotations and in
particular the schemas and it can
convert a closure schema into client
code so it actually generates the client
code for the different model files that
are sent up and are received from the
server so here's our entry schema coax
will read this schema and actually
output the objective-c code so the
there's a lot more objective-c code that
you need for a particular schema because
closures just a shorter language but so
it outputs this kind of simple model
object that just holds the data and
provides ways to access it like getters
and setters it also generates the dot M
file so like back troll not just the dot
H but you know the whole the whole
objective c thing and provides nice
serialization libraries so you can
convert to a dictionary and from a
dictionary and it it converts it to a
JSON data structure that's ready to be
sent across the wire so there's this
thing called schema extensions where you
can express hierarchical relationships
between your between different schemas
so here in my example I have this book
which is an abstract kind of schema that
can be realized in terms of a novel or a
comic and so there's these the this
inherent class hierarchy that coax can
respect when it generates the client
code so if for example you wanted to
convert this
into Java you can say oh i have a class
for the novel and it extends the class
for the book so coax respects these
class hierarchies that are defined using
schema extensions and the last thing I
want to mention about coax is that it's
customizable so there's this process
where it reads the schema and then it
converts it into an intermediate format
and then from that intermediate format
generates the client code but there's a
place to plug in your own emission code
so if you want to do different things
for example based on the name of the
schema you can plug something in there
and then just generate a different thing
if your schema ends with you know some
particular suffix so that's what coax is
it reads schemas then can generate
client code and it's customizable and it
respects classes hierarchies that are
defined using schema extensions so yeah
so let's keep recap what we talked about
so we started with closure functions
that were annotated using plumbing and
schema we read those annotations using
funhouse this new library to get an
annotated handler and then we saw how to
apply those annotations to different
applications so generating documents
spinning up a web server that does
routing doing special coercion
middleware that is aware of your schemas
on the inputs and outputs and can
intelligently convert data into the
proper form and coax which is a nice
library that can read your schemas and
generate client code so that your
clients are always in sync with the
current state of your API so if you want
to check it out it's now released it's
open source so you can see fun house on
github if you want to stay up-to-date on
future releases you can follow us on
twitter at prismatic edge and yesterday
we had a party at
place and it was a lot of fun and so if
you want to get updates about future
events you can email us at events at get
prismatic calm and we'll add you to the
mailing list so you can stay up to date
with what what events there are thank
you so I have a lot of time to answer
questions and yeah yeah that's a great
question so there's a lot of different
approaches that you can take I think in
house what we're doing is we just have a
separate namespace for different
versions of the API and if some things
kind of stay the same from version to
version we just kind of copy them over
so that we can safely delete the old
version once we stop supporting in yeah
yeah so sorry I should be repeating the
question so the first question was about
versioning this next question is about
coercion xin schemas so schema had a
recent update to the schema library that
supports coercion and so that defined
kind of how you can match against a
target schema and translate data into
that form so that's that that is an
older release like a few months ago I
guess we we released an update to that
what I'm showing here is how that plugs
in with funhouse right and so how you
can take these annotations on the
handlers and apply the schema coercion
to build a special ring middleware that
that does the coercion yes so the
question was whether we use coax with
core data so which part of core data is
specifically do
the data objects I see I'm not sure
actually I think that I don't think that
we do but I could be wrong yeah sokol
axis is going to be released pretty soon
and so I guess you can take a look at
the source to see ya any other questions
yes so the question was what do we do
for authentication and it's a great
question so we do have special stuff for
authentication which I did and talk
about here we we have a middleware that
basically saves sessions for different
users and then you might want different
behavior for different handlers for
instance some of the handlers might be
you know you have to be logged in or you
have to be an admin user or something
like that and I didn't mention it in my
talk but actually you can annotate your
functions with however you want and
there's a place to plug in a function
that extracts those annotations when
you're parsing the namespaces to convert
them to handlers so what we do is we put
like a little metadata on the functions
that says the off level and then you can
using a special Middle where you can
check that the request coming in is of
the right authentication level and then
either you know allow the request to go
through or not but it's very easy to
like plug in your own kind of use case
into this annotation annotations that
you can put onto your handlers so it's
very easy to extend yes
doesn't play well with Liberator so I'm
not sure about Liberator in particular
but I yeah so sorry the question was
does this play well with Liberator and
so I should say that there's a lot of
different routing libraries out there
right and the routing module here is
swappable so we're just shipping with
one that to demonstrate how you can
convert these annotated handlers into a
full web service it happens to be the
one that we use internally it's fast it
supports various features like you are I
argument extraction and wild cards also
but yeah if you want to have if you have
your own favorite library you can swap
that out and still use funhouse to get
all of the other benefits that it
provides any other questions
