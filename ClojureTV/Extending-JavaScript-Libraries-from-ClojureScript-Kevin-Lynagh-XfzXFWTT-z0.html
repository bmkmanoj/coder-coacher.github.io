rhymes with Carolina and tell you that
Kevin actually has lived in North
Carolina he represents on his Iowa he's
this hip West Coast
Portland guy but the truth is that
there's some Greensboro in this guy and
so I think it's interesting that Kevin's
topic follows on one of the points that
Neal made his talk this morning about
bridge building and I think this is
definitely that year for us to be
thinking about bridge building and
thinking about you know I don't want to
build cucumber enclosure for example but
building something building the things
that are the libraries that cause
closure or closure scripts to be in your
stack and on the web side of that that's
going to include closure script play
nice with JavaScript and people doing
what's gonna sometimes be irritating to
digging and lifting kinds of work to
make sure that all of the rough edges
that are possible there happen so I'm
looking forward to Kevin bringing
closure script and JavaScript together
hey I think you guys see me all right
okay yeah all right so yesterday Couser
talked about closure script and from
sort of a technical perspective the
compiler and stuff like that and this
talk is more of a hands-on perspective
using closure script on the web and so
I'm speaking for roughly 30 minutes
better leave 10 minutes for questions at
the end but if you have a question or
something isn't clear feel free to get
my attention during the talk my talk has
just three points that I want to make
and I'm gonna be totally upfront and
explicit with you about what those
points are the first point is that
closure is simpler than JavaScript the
second one is that using javascript from
closure script is more fun but also more
safe and more extendable than using
javascript from JavaScript
and the third point is that moving at
least in our experience from JavaScript
to closure script has been kind of an
adventure so it's been a lot of fun but
we've also gotten burned along the way
so I'm gonna sort of share one
experience with that with you guys but
before I get into the real like
technical and any gritty and details and
stuff I want to start with this story a
friend of mine in Portland named cousin
Henry I don't know why he's called this
because he's not my cousin
but he makes fine furniture and about
two months ago I wanted to get some
standing desks for our office and so I
call him up I'm like oh hey cousin Henry
you make fine furniture we make fine
Internet stuff let's let's work
something out here and so a few a few
days after that I go to his studio and
he starts giving me this tour and it
looks like pretty much exactly like what
woodworking studio like what you'd
expect it to look like right he's got a
a drill press and a table saw and a
bandsaw and all this stuff and as he's
showing me around
he starts griping about some of this
stuff he's like oh I have this new
Japanese edging squares and they're
they're marked in centimeters but but
all of my rules are marked in inches and
you can't even buy wood in centimeters
and it's so stupid and it he's
complaining about this it's sort of a
curse to me that you know this is very
similar to the situation that we have
right now right so Imperial and metric
is just like JavaScript and closure one
of them is a sort of historical
precedent ad hoc clergy thing and the
other one is a clearly superior system
that was just births from pure reason so
I mean I think there's a serious sort of
comparison here right so if you think
back the metric system it took upwards
of 100 150 years for it to really catch
on around the world and I think there's
still some countries that for some
reason don't use it Burma and you know
hopefully the tech world is going to
move a little faster but for the
foreseeable future you know for the next
five years closure and closure script is
going to be in this ecosystem that's
dominated by JavaScript so we're gonna
have to learn how to play along and get
along nicely with the step out there and
if we're
use a lot of the stuff out there right I
mean JavaScript sit around and there's a
lot of exciting stuff that's going on on
the web and so if we as developers can
sort of leverage some of those libraries
we can build you know better
applications and and do more exciting
stuff and they'll make our lives a lot
easier so that's sort of the impetus for
my talk here and why Interop sort of
important to think about and would be
useful and fun but before I get into
that I want to spend some time talking
about JavaScript itself so how many of
you have used JavaScript here whoa okay
so that looks like about ninety six
point seven percent of you have used
javascript how many of you have actually
written large applications in JavaScript
of like explicit architectures like
model-view-presenter or something okay
so that's looks like maybe thirty
percent of you um well for the rest of
you and maybe for some of the the
closure curious JavaScript ders who
might watch this talk on the Internet I
want to just sort of compare javascript
and closure on two different points and
sort of give give that feeling you know
because I've I've written a lot more
JavaScript and CoffeeScript code in my
life when I've written closure code and
comparatively it's just like a total
Wonderland over here so I want to make
sure you guys don't forget just how
great you have it and I what something
like ten days ago 14 days ago I went to
the JavaScript user group in Portland
and the host started off the meeting by
asking everyone what terrifies you about
JavaScript emotes and I think he did
this because it was Halloween right but
you can ask this question year-round and
got a lot of very serious answers
because javascript is just as really
quirky odd kind of half-baked language
this is a quote that I really like this
is from Brendan Eich the creator of
JavaScript and so it's not it's not this
big secret right I don't know how much
you know the sort of back story behind
JavaScript but my understanding is that
Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape and
they promised him that he could write
scheme for the browser which would have
been awesome but at the last minute then
you know management was like oh no no no
it should actually it needs to look like
Java and we're gonna call it JavaScript
for marketing synergy and you know much
the confusion of everyone after that but
he apparently just wrote the the lexer
and the parser and the base classes and
all this stuff and something like 10
days so Brendan gets mad perhaps in my
book for doing that but you know because
of that history there are some
quirky odd things about JavaScript and
so anyway at this meeting and one of the
top things that people were terrified at
the top terrifying feature of javascript
is the the way that JavaScript handles
variable scope and stuff like that so
this is how you define a variable in
JavaScript you say var and then x equals
12 or whatever but if you leave off this
var it'll still work it's just that your
variable is now going to be promoted
into the global scope so if you say this
anywhere in your program and there isn't
a variable X already then that X is now
going to be in the global scope so I
mean that's kind of terrifying and I
think Global's kind of have a bad rap
the real problem with Global's right is
when they change because then you have
something that's changing and you don't
know where it's changing from anything
in your program could be changing this
variable and in the case of JavaScript
it's actually even more terrifying than
that because in JavaScript the program's
very rarely sort of live alone you know
in isolation JavaScript programs tend to
live on the browser where they run
alongside a bunch of other JavaScript
programs written by other programmers so
it's just as like freakishly terrifying
situation because if you forget a var
like not only is this X immutable from
anywhere in your program but if someone
else has an X and they forget a var like
it's it's like all bets are up okay so
it's kind of nuts um
and it's nice to compare this to the
closure solution to this this whole
class of problems right I mean things
don't change that's it
you know you eliminate this whole class
of problems with forget variable scope
right mutable things are hard to do in
closure you have to think about them and
you have to go through and be very
deliberate about doing it so there's
just no you don't have to worry about
this in something like closure and a
related problem in JavaScript that was
sort of the the number two terrifying
feature is the namespace system in
JavaScript so in JavaScript the
namespace system looks like this and
that's because in JavaScript there is no
namespace system and what people are
forced to do is define everything that
they could ever want inside an
immediately executing anonymous function
and so what that does is it essentially
creates a closure that's closure with an
S where you have this sort of
impenetrable silo where all of your code
is safe and inaccessible from other code
and so you don't kind of that's
and we're to call it a best practice but
because it's so gross but that's what
you have to do to avoid getting trampled
on and you're just to protect your code
and this leads to some kind of gnarly
stuff so this is an example from the the
jQuery documentation now this is the
first example on your handout too by the
way so I'm not going to go through all
of it
but just the general idea is this top
part you have this function so you're
defining this anonymous function then
you put all your stuff in it the second
block here are all the methods so this
is the for a jQuery plug-in right so all
the methods you want your jQuery plug-in
to have you inline all of them inside a
single JavaScript object and then the
way people get access to your plug-in is
you have to extend the jQuery object
itself and let you know that's passing
as an argument
so you add one function to the jQuery
object which is accessible everywhere
and what that one function is is it's
this giant case statement right you
dispatch to all of your actual methods
using a string argument on this one
giant case statement right so this is
crazy this is like totally crazy it's a
lot of work it's a lot of boilerplate
but the only thing you know more crazy
would be to not do this because then you
have this total free-for-all where
everyone's in the same namespace and
code is just trampling all over each
other so again you know compared to that
oh and as a quick parenthetical I think
something like CoffeeScript in the end
is not going to save you so for those of
you don't know CoffeeScript is a sort of
a syntactical language on top of
JavaScript it has all the same semantics
but it sort of files down some of the
rough edges so every CoffeeScript file
is going to get wrapped in one of these
immediately executing them anonymous
functions but I think ultimately that's
not going to help because you still have
this problem and it's not you know
hiding everything from each other
everywhere is not how you build sort of
reusable extendable code you know and
it's a worse on JavaScript right because
the appeal of JavaScript is that it
works on the browser and it works on the
computer on the browser and on the phone
and on the iPad and all this stuff so if
every library if you're not doing
anything composedly and everyone's just
like look I'm gonna bring everything I
could ever need with me in my own little
package and then the application
developers are putting together some
webpage they put ten libraries like that
on the page and you're paying about $500
a megabyte or whatever to get on the
phone it's just this kind of crazy
situation but anyway the closure
solution right to this problem use
namespaces they're built into the
language so this is this is one of my
favorite features about closure and
enclosure script - because it's just
really simple right you say here's my
namespace you know I have my stuff and
then I'm gonna define my things in here
and then when you're somewhere else you
just say oh hey can can you give me like
my thing from over there and it's even
better than this because you can say oh
can you give me the thing from over
there but can you call it something else
cuz there any other thing like that and
I don't get confused right I mean this
is awesome this is so awesome and maybe
you can't really appreciate it until you
have to go through this whole rigmarole
and like boilerplate to work around
languages that don't have this stuff and
I love it it's it's one of these
language features that's never going to
make it to the top of hacker news
because it's so boring like I actually
checked and the the top story the top
story and close your namespaces on
Hacker News got three points so not cool
it's fun it's super boring right but I
love that it's boring you know I don't
as an application developer as I'm
building these big things I don't have
to think about all these hoops so you
have to jump through right you know I
kind of think the doing really really
clever stuff with with closures and
anonymous functions is fun for about the
amount of time it takes to read a blog
post about how freaking clever you can
be with anonymous functions in
JavaScript and I think it also makes
pretty good job interview questions but
so does like reversing a string in place
and who wants to do that all day long so
that's sort of my five-minute feel about
why closure is simpler than JavaScript
right it's just a more modern language
and there's a lot of these sort of
problems that have very well-thought-out
solutions that are just sort of baked in
so you just use them and they're boring
and they get out of your way so and then
sort of a tangent it's funny because
there's this this weird myth out there
that only geniuses use functional
languages I don't know if this happened
to you guys but when I was talking with
some friends of mine I was like oh using
closure like you know they assume that
if you're using something like closure
or Scala it's because you have two or
three PhDs and mathematics you know and
you're just just like super smart guy
you know I'm just gonna be upfront with
you guys I'm
I'm not that bright okay so every time I
turn my computer on in about two minutes
I get in some situation where I just
have no idea what the hell is going on
so so I sort of actually don't need a
computer for that but I love closure
because it's just it's really simple
right it's like oh we have everything
ends we have these functions and you you
feed them stuff and it's better than
that right because all these functions
end up being like 10 or 15 lines long
okay if you look at a JavaScript
function you spend the first 15 lines
like fighting with the language right
you spend 50 lines doing this weird
stuff to protect yourself from the
hostel hostel single namespace thing or
you spend 50 lines trying to D structure
your arguments because there's no multi
Rd method support in JavaScript you know
you spend all this time doing that and I
I can't figure out what's going on
but in closure it's like and so it's
great I love it so anyway part two using
javascript from closure script closure
from the start
I believe was was designed to be a
hosted language so it's always had
really good support for Interop with
with the host system so here's a quick
review of that right you just use the
dot special form and then the object and
the method on that object that you want
to call and then any arguments for the
method so in this case we're calling the
log method of the JavaScript console
object and we're just passing it the
string hello I note here this j/s slash
that's how you tell closure script that
the thing that you're referring to is
over in JavaScript world and again
because JavaScript has no namespace
system this is all you need I like the
other closures it has macro support for
this sort of nicer syntax for you to say
dot method object arguments there is one
difference though and that's how you
have to handle method method calls that
take no arguments
so unlike Java in JavaScript functions
are values so you can get a hold of them
you can pass them around you know you
can do everything with functions they
can do it like numbers or strings or
whatever so if you have the form like
this it's not clear if you want to
execute this math
with no arguments for if you want to
just get a reference to it and so close
your script the default behavior is that
latter behavior if you do want to
execute a method with no arguments you
just wrap the method name with an extra
set of friends so that's all you really
need to know about executing methods
from executing JavaScript methods from
clojurescript a quick word on types I
think as I mentioned this yesterday but
again scalar types are all native so
that means closure script strings are
JavaScript strings and closure script
numbers are JavaScript numbers which
means that everything is a double so
please do not write any closure script
programs that rely on exact precision
arithmetic on integers and then the
collection types though are not native
right and I think that's because things
like seek you know the semantics are
lazy and so you can't just map them
directly to JavaScript so if you do need
to do Interop between the closure script
programs and JavaScript stuff you have
to coerce the collections manually so
it's pretty straightforward in closure
script right you just call us a Rea
function and takes your arguments gives
you back a JavaScript array if you need
to go in the other direction you can do
that to objects it's kind of like
messing around with hash maps or
something on Java is create one and then
you can use a set or set to just bang on
and add these key value pairs until you
have what you want and then you can pass
that along to whatever JavaScript method
or library call it needs it so I think
there is maybe a reader literal support
coming soon now there's been talk of it
on the the Jireh for the project it's
not in there yet but you know keep your
eyes out for that and so there this is
the real meat of my talk I want to talk
about how using JavaScript from closure
script leads to it actually is more
extendable it lets you extend JavaScript
libraries in a way that's very hard to
do if you were just working in
JavaScript and the example that I'm
gonna give is of using chain call style
libraries so jQuery is probably the most
famous example of this style right you
just have a selection and then you keep
adding methods on that selection to sort
of bang on it and do what you want so in
this particular case you know we're
calling the Select method of jQuery and
we're saying hey jQuery give me the
element on the page that has the ID of
main
let's append a span element to it and
then set the text of that to be hello so
if you want to make the same call the
jQuery from closure script you
pretty naturally using the threading
macro right so just notice here we have
the je s slash so that we know that
jQuery is on the the JavaScript side of
things and then we're using these dot
interrupt calls to make all those same
methods so I mean the code looks very
similar but there's actually a very sort
of important difference here and that's
that the the threading macro has no no
special semantics for for interoperative
these are just ultimately function calls
they're all just separate function calls
and and so if you want to use your own
function it's pretty easy to just throw
it in there you can just throw in here
on my append function and go along
merrily this is very hard to do in
JavaScript so in JavaScript you have
this sort of implicit contract here
right the way this code is written
you're saying you know jQuery has a
select method and what that select
method returns has to have an append
method and then what that returns has to
have a text method and you know the way
jQuery does this is that you know all of
these methods just return the jQuery
wrapped set which is how it works but
it's hard to extend that so if you
wanted to do this a similar thing in
JavaScript you really only have two
options one of them is that you can
break the chain and then just call your
own function explicitly this kind of
sucks because the code is longer it's
it's harder to read you have to
introduce this new variable that you
didn't need before well you can add your
function to the the jQuery object itself
and in this case you're essentially
making a jQuery plug-in and so you have
to go through that whole namespace
song-and-dance and you have your at risk
of getting overridden right so jQuery is
a very popular library so if someone
else on the page has a Maya Pender
function they throw it on jQuery too
like they overwrite yours and you're
pretty much hos and the best practice in
this case is to just remove all of the
vowels from your method name and jQuery
but you know it's it's it's ugly it's
harder to do this kind of thing and when
you're doing this sort of extension and
if you're using JavaScript from closure
script a lot well you end up doing is
you're in the building facades around
the JavaScript library so what I mean by
that is I mean at the simplest you just
define in closure script functions that
immediately proxy to the underlying
javascript library so here right I've
just defined an append and a select
function and closure script that just
take
you know whatever you pass them and
they're gonna call a native a pen and
select method on that and so you can
plug them in here and now you don't have
to write that that's great well it's
actually it actually is really great
because what does that mean
that means you've decoupled your calling
code from the implementation detail that
ultimately what you're trying to do is
being implemented in a JavaScript
library so that ends up being really
nice and I'll give you the motivating
example from our experience this is a
screenshot of a data visualization that
we're making so this is an in-browser
dashboard all of this stuff is just HTML
and SVG and we made all of this was
closure script and a JavaScript library
called d3 for for this talk you can just
think of d3 is sort of a data-driven
jQuery so you give it an array of stuff
and you can just say okay for each datum
you're passing me let's let's make a new
SVG rectangle and set the color like
this or that of the other thing so we
did this sort of facade building trick
when we were building this out and what
that let us do is that we ended up
porting some of d3 to closure on the JVM
and so this ended up letting us take
some of our visualization code and run
it in either place so we ran it on the
the browser using closure script it goes
through this facade that facade just
pretty much immediately proxies to the
d3 JavaScript library which manipulates
the Dom well we run it on the server and
all that same visualization code goes
through our implementation of d3
enclosure on the JVM and ends up just
like mucking around with xml strings but
the calling code has you know none the
wiser right it'll work in either place
and and I think that it's really
powerful and at least for us in this
case it's been really useful so and you
know this kind of using the same
language in the client the server is
this big thing that all the nodejs kids
are super stoked about but they just
picked the wrong language and and it's
true it's like a really powerful thing
so it's nice in it it lets you do a lot
of flexible reusable stuff so quick
recap you can using JavaScript from
closure script more fun because it's
closure but also more safe right you
don't have to deal with the squared
namespace stuff you don't have to deal
with the weird variable scope and the
VARs and everything like that and then
also more extendable because you can you
can do this kind of facade shimmy and
stuff you can very easily use the macro
system to just insert your own stuff and
extend libraries as as you need to and
so now the third the third point in my
talk which is just one story I'm going
to tell you about how just in moving
from from mostly JavaScript and
CoffeeScript to clojurescript how we run
into a couple issues and we run into a
couple small compiler bugs but the real
problem for us has been actually like
sort of conceptual thinking issues that
and so an alternate title for this would
be you know what we thought we knew
until close your script showed us
otherwise and again you remember you're
on a lot of stuff here you have your
application code which is written in
closure script and then you have this
may be this facade that is written in
closure script that's gonna go through
two compilers it's going to go through
the closure script compiler and then the
Google compiler and then that's going to
go and actually call the underlying
JavaScript library and all that's built
on JavaScript which as we've established
is kind of sketchy to begin with so you
know when you have some of these bugs
they're they're hard to track down and
it can be kind of confusing so the one
that happened to us it happened when we
upgraded the the version of d3 and
basically all of our visualizations just
stopped working and so we're like well
okay well well our code didn't change so
it's not our fault and we looked at the
change log for d3 you know we kind of
read through it and and there was no no
mention of breaking API changes or
anything like that and we built a couple
of visualizations just using straight
and JavaScript or CoffeeScript and those
all worked fine so it's not like the
library was totally borked and we ended
up tracking it down and before I can
explain to you what the problem was
we're gonna have to spend some time
talking about this ok so some of you are
probably familiar with this it's sort of
this infamous concept in JavaScript for
those of you don't know this is a
dynamic variable that refers to the
current execution context so if you have
a function here that just returns this
and you execute it from the top level so
if you have your laptops open and you
open up Chrome and you just type this in
then this is going to refer to the Dom
window I think I know Jay s it just
gives you an empty object or something
but if you take a similar function like
this and you actually make it a property
of an object then this will refer to
that object so here
say you know we have this new a
JavaScript object called dog and we're
gonna put a property on it and we're
gonna give it a method I do this and you
can kind of write nice object-oriented
code in JavaScript so if you actually
get this method and this here you know
refers to this object and so name is
gonna be Rex and you can have sort of
instance variables why you want to do
abject oriented code in JavaScript you
have this nice prototype system I don't
know but if life hands you lemons like
anyway a lot of people do this so what
ended up happening is that we the d3
author had restructured the internals of
his library to be in this style and what
we were doing in our facade is we were
calling apply and so if you you write
close your script code like this you
know where you just have the dot and
then the method and whatever arguments
or whatever it compiles into job
compiles into JavaScript code like this
and the problem here is right on this
third line so when you're messing around
with things in in closure right it's all
functional you can just take this
function and it's pressing you're just
taking it out and you're gonna go
execute it later and that's fine but the
problem is an in Travis trip right it's
not totally functional you take this
method out of this object and this which
this method is using it's no longer
going to refer to the parent object and
so it's gonna just break your code so
this is sort of you know it's something
it's hard because you you R end up
writing all this stuff in in closure and
you wrap all these things and it looks
like closure and so you play around and
feel like great I'm included but you're
not actually if you're if you're
interrupting with JavaScript and things
aren't actually functions like you don't
have this referential transparency right
you give the same method all the same
arguments but you execute it somewhere
else and it doesn't work so that's been
kind of hard and there's a really bit us
for a while until we tracked it down so
kind of watch out for that because you
can write it so it looks like you're
writing closure but in the end you know
you're not and this is the same thing
with Java like stuff is mutable down
there so if you get used to writing
closure or you do stuff and then it
doesn't work and you're like whoa so
anyway that's that's pretty much my talk
so first point closure is simpler than
JavaScript second one that it's more fun
more safe more
extendable and then the third one that
it is kind of an adventure moving from
JavaScript to closure script because of
some of these things so though you know
this is some of these problems are nice
to have like we run into problems where
you know we used math in JavaScript and
then we translate it to map enclosure
script and it doesn't work well it's
because map is lazy right this problem
that you had because you're used to
working with the language but it's not
that smart and you write some code for
it and so you find right dumb code for a
smart language and it doesn't work and
you're like wow hmm but you know it for
us it's been totally worth it and we've
had a lot of fun so we're really excited
about you know the possibility of using
closure script to target all these great
things on the internet and mobile
devices and stuff like that and I want
to finish with a free piece of
unsolicited unsolicited advice and this
kind advice is always free I think this
is - similar to what Stuart gave at the
opening talk and that's that you know
tools don't make the artists so we're
we're lucky in that most of our clients
just call us up and they say oh hey we
have all this data can we please have
some charts for iPad we're like sweet no
problem we got this you know they don't
care what tools were using on the back
end they just want the finished product
so not everyone is in that case so maybe
you can't use closure or you can't use
closure script but you know don't worry
about it too much you know I think we
talked a lot about tools and we think
about tools because all of us are sort
of builders and engineers and we're at a
programming conference right we want to
talk about and think about this stuff
but at the end of day rate it matters
what you do so a bunch of these guys
like these guys they all had slide rules
right and they were all using inches and
feet like they were using inches and
feet on slide rules this is perilous
it's it sounds so hard and they went to
the moon okay so like I don't know if
this happens to you guys but I wake up
every once in a while and think about
this I'm like oh we went to the moon
like 30 years ago oh my god you know so
so whatever you do like go go try and if
you have to write everything in PHP or
somewhere or whatever like go build some
great stuff so good luck and you know
that's my advice that's my talk Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
