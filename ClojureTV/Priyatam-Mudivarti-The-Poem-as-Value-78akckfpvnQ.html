a writer and a software engineer first
I'd like to thank cognate pact and Alex
I'm a new closer developer than I send I
didn't know it was gonna be accepted so
they accepted I'm really happy my
brother and I would been working on a
project for the last nine months I quit
my job and we've been doing closure for
the last four or five months and really
excited to share what we learned and we
hope to get some feedback so when I
write I write organically most of my
friends they write organically as well
and so are my teachers so when I sat
back and thought about closure I didn't
understand what this meant in
programming so I said that up as a goal
how do you build organic software but
first the problem specific to the topic
Palma's value its publishing so when you
look at publishing this is where we are
you have content your CMS and there but
it doesn't formats in another dozen more
formats and then you have to merge
design with the front-end if you have
the money if you don't then you go just
use the format's that you have and then
somehow put the ePub or a PDF on the
browser but if you have money you can go
with the front-end design team or not if
you have you have an Android team but
what about data the idea workflow for
agencies I work for over a decade is
something like this except most agencies
focus on design publishers focus on
content and engineers like us focus on
data how do we work together but here's
a real problem and that's the topic of
my talk is poem as a value how do you
curate thousands perhaps a few million
poems from the public domain books are
pages clauses phrases sentences similes
metaphors they're not strings
this is the state of books today my room
roof roughly looks like this there are a
lot of books worth that are being closed
and this is beyond the 1 million poems
online somewhere that B there are more
millions like these archived this is
what you get in libraries big libraries
in the country have Walt Whitman poems
manuscript it like these several
hundreds of them this is the best public
domain site today we can't interact with
them and I want to show what interaction
means for a minute so I have a poem here
I wrote a couple of notes and let's say
I need a volunteer from here let's pick
a gentleman in the front I want to share
this notes with you go ahead I have a
Rumi poem and I want to share the notes
with you so the idea is this is what we
do in writing classes the right notes
we just don't tear them so let's try
that let's see what that means if I tear
these notes and give it to you here you
go and someone else asked me what's your
notes I can't do that we can't do that
in real life now used to be a proud Java
engineer you know Java certified design
patterns and all that stuff scripting
languages I started learning code if I
passed out ask my wife she'll tell you
now I keep coming back to some quotes
I've written and the quotes
always remind me of something and this
is one of the quotes I actually studied
in a workshop with several people and
she's one of them she's a great port a
great book on poetry I have a reference
of that at the end every good poem asks
a question and every good poet asked the
question so I asked myself what do I
want to build with public domain poetry
start with the page forget the book no
CMS no frameworks noemi see no buttons
no menus no forms just the page and the
poll I'd like to show you a demo we
build a browser ripple for poets it's
just to start there are bugs I apologize
has anyone here work with I a writer the
markdown editor I love that it's an
amazing piece software it's the best for
those who don't know it's the best
markdown editor for Macs
so this is my design inspiration for
that what you see is a simple poem
Sappho it's a Greek poem and this is the
poem you see the metadata you see the
tags what's happening behind the scenes
this is a gnome there are three own
components here that this is the poem
that is rendered with data structures
internally with a tokenization and a
frequency word count the metadata are
rendered using mustache which again the
data is coming from an elastic search
engine and now I promised about
interacting with the page
as such
what just happened was a rebel component
was build with ohm and there's a custom
expression that is being converted into
that command and a command is dispatched
in Co racing when elasticsearch came
back with the results and it just loaded
on the page now I just gave this
gentleman a couple of pages torn notes
right I asked a question we can't do
that in software so I wanted to find out
how we could do it so one of the ways we
could do it will just say note but
before that we need to escape into
another mode like rep like Emacs I just
say escape and there's the command line
and I say note well I want to know the
first line first word the first line
third word subtle is the path I like
that word right first for
it is highlighted what just happened was
Omri render that component
no just dispatched what happened into a
channel that channel sent the event to
the poem which is a route and the poem
rendered the note on its using a jQuery
plugin which we just used so but that's
all happening behind the scenes but now
I want to add some notes on the note
saying that well the lover is never slow
and I'm not sure what that means right
so it's really hard if you have a long
poem so I'm gonna go and figure out okay
that's a Phi 1 which means there's a
fifth time that the word is repeated 5 4
so let's see what that means
so imagine you're doing this in a in a
classroom public public school and the
teacher is teaching this this is
probably what he would do the note is
highlighted on the right you can keep
doing this there are notes many other
notes for example I can do an out just
like that and the first one is
highlighted now here's a question can
anyone suggest how do we share this with
someone the same way I shared a torn
paper with that gentleman out there I've
done three interactions
it's a fronting app I've made highlights
but I made it in a specific order if I
am a teacher in a classroom with 15 to
20 students that's typical I shared
these notes with them and then I give
the homework but I want to share them
online how do I do it anyone any
suggestions but if I share the link I
want to share a link right on Twitter or
an email if I share the link I'll
probably get a page you know the fall
ways to put the page and show all the
highlights but I want to show it
interactively step-by-step the same
exact way I did it as a teacher for
example sorry
but but we would not be able to see all
the highlights well yeah anyone else
mm-hmm
but what if we can do it better if you
work with ohm one of the things that
does is it gives you a recording play so
let's try that let me see if there is
something called play turn if there is
just gonna move my right arrow another
one another one and it circles this
entire thing is stored as an annotation
in Eden right now the only missing
component to sync with dynamic isn't
working but it's actually stored as Eden
so this can be dispatched to a back-end
server and can be saved you can save it
I will show you in a bit
the entire node saved as this imagine
you are doing more of these notes and
you have a page you can generate a URL
and you can share and that was one of
our requirements since one of my
business partners is a poet and a
teacher and he'd like to do teach poetry
in public schools
now with linguistics things get even
more interesting
you'd get nouns and warps things like
you want to see nouns you can see now
this is fairly simple
what just happened again is I'm using a
Python library analytic a library if
there are about six libraries having a
rest server behind the scenes that's
actually sinning open up as a REST API
and then that's connected to the command
in the repple and they're sending it
back but all that is happening behind
scenes we can add more commands anymore
more analytic a commands if you want but
it will it's just a matter of adding one
extra step in the UI nothing else
changes so this is what we built so far
is having a page and interacting with
the page without leaving it and if you
want to change you can switch your
context for example search I want to
search now I'll simply say search
and we'll start looking for look at
Chris grinders Granger's ideas value
it's not a poem but I like it it's a
really good essay
so
I'm gonna come in a I'm gonna come back
to this in a bit how this was happened
how this happened because initially
designed it for poetry but the data
format allows it to put any other
content type and we'll get that get to
that in a bit
I wanna get back to the presentation bit
I want to talk about what inspired me
for what inspired us to do that design
and I kept reading light table ohm and
diatomic Docs over and over again I'm
still trying to understand and I I wrote
a simple thing and I want to share it
with you it goes back to the question
before is if you notice what is the how
do you every good poem ask the question
so I wanted to format in that way and
this is what I came across how do you
contextualize a runtime engine with near
infinite customizations the answer I
found was thinking data build a
foundation on data make a platform to
adapt and grow in ways you could have
thought in the beginning and with the
ohm and I'm still learning ohm it's
fascinating it's the best thing I've
seen include the script it actually
convinced me that I should learn closure
script this is what I believe
David FAFSA thinking yeah how do you
rerender thousands of UI components with
the record and play o record
interactions in Dom with Adams for Eden
for local and shared States create
cursors with Life Path rifts view data
pointing to application state follow
protocols and optionally sing them with
server for playback and a Tomic how do
you record memories store a collection
of facts that do not change add new
facts like memory superseding old facts
over time build a snapshot of facts that
collective knowledge over time that
collect knowledge over time to reveal
meaning so that's what we found and I
want to go through the architecture one
of my favorite poets and teachers
I've been reading his books Richard he
go and he says this if you were to
choose between being
in various or being repetitious and
boring be repetitious and boring most
good poets are read for a very long time
in one setting richard hugo our history
as i mentioned earlier we've been
working on this for nine months we
started off with a python flash gap then
we switched anode Express with meteor
since we wanted real-time interaction
and then we wrote our own slow static
site generator in Python semi gears and
six months later this is what we have
content design data and their own
workflows and let we have a new we have
a plain text markup format called Zen up
it's just plain text and Yama in the
front end if you worked in Jack I'll is
exactly that and the content is stored
in elastic search for search in pure
JSON and for data we have Eden there's
an Eden format called Zen which is
simply Eden with our own Eden readers
since our content which goes in ohm is
highly contextualized and there's data
structures in it so we had to write our
own reader right now it's pretty
straightforward but we want to expand
that and there's a linguistics component
in Python and then I just started dating
three weeks ago and I'm excited what
I've learned there is a small example
I'd like to show you and then for the
design I've been fascinated by
responsive web design for the past
couple years I'm not a designer by trade
but I have learned so much by reading
blocks of Paul Irish and some of the
jQuery folks who've done fantastic
plugins so how does the annotations work
going back to that page what you saw as
a ripple was actually an annotation this
was the inspiration from light table
light table says you make everything
contextualise if you remember how many
of you are familiar with light papers
bought architecture so the way for those
of you or not the way it works is every
event is captured in a simple closure
data structure like associative data
structures keys
Veck naps or vectors and their events
are named with keywords and their
dispatch something similar not as
exhausted as like table we had is we
simply have an annotation that gets
parsed as a nice expression literally
what you saw is note 1 1 1 4 and the
notes was passed as an S expression sin
back in the data structure to Eden in
the backend commands are dispatched by a
quarry sink and sent by jQuery and poems
internally a stored as data structures
with tokenization in frequency counting
this is it I would fall if anyone wants
to know what this is I would forward you
a couple of links it's something to
attend lbk and happy to show you the
code as well how many of you are
familiar with all new to omar excited
about ohm great that's awesome well this
is what I learned
ohm is simply a full circle of UI
generating events events generating
state and it's back and I've put some a
little diagram here there are three
three core components in ohm
what is the reactive UI and one is the
message state management and one is the
messaging let's look at how the life
cycle works so you have a UI component
it's basically a giant tree you can
think of it that way and you have a
cursor that and then there's a render
rendering code the rendering code is
just give h1 to h2 is something like
hiccup if you want it but it's simply
the markup and their lifecycle hooks
first hook is in it and you can set your
state simple Adams Eden and then the
next is your about the mount now now
this is when you are about to mount the
UI component after the in it so you have
this is a good places put a channel
initializer channel for example go loop
which says well I'm about to put my note
component which you've seen i will
initialize a channel which will be
listening to note events and if it gets
a node event do something in our case
we're just highlighting that and
displaying on the right side
this is this is a good place of a dumb
event change listeners and then and then
there's another state this is a part of
the lifecycle rerender before after and
at render if you look at the protocols
it's worded slightly differently I I
feel more convenient reading this way I
it'll be I will render a night before
something like that and at that point
you will have a cursor that points to a
diff basic not a diff it's a state
changes so the way you can think of
cursor in my in my view is if anyone has
worked and get in and close the script
you get a path to an associative data
structure so that's basically like
having a nice live data live pointer to
the entire database which is this tree
so imagine you have a page you loaded
some state that's a tree now you have a
cursor it says somewhere in that tree
this branch is what my component wants
so it's pointing to that life so that's
how I understand and then you have set
state and shared state each component
can have local state and shared state
and then you simply put or get in my
case I'm simply putting on a channel you
can put anything and I'm getting it and
there's no callbacks and this section
over here is when your page renders
every time state changes Omri renders
that particular part so anything you put
here is rear-ended everything happens
without you making Dom manipulation so
what are the benefits custom rebels
eliminate the complex menu navigation
forms this is very useful for
professional users the one of things I
wanted to mention was when you're
targeting a specific segment who knew
who know what they want to do who know
what to search they're more they're
comfortable with something that's highly
interactive and they're okay with
learning a few commands for example
immutable data structures make Dom
manipulation easy like table change the
way I thought about programming it also
happens to be a great idea
splitting content and data with
elasticsearch and atomic has worked well
I'm still learning day Tomic it just
started three weeks ago I think we're
gonna put all the annotations in day
Tomic and eden and zen up make some if
not all future content types
adaptable to the platform what i mean by
that is I started off this project with
with curating poetry and created a
simple markup like markdown and then I
realized that well you can put a blog in
it as long as it sticks so that mark
markdown format you if you want your own
format you can write a spec own format
and it's a matter of simply writing a
tensor transformation anyone Python
friends here
great I'm a great fan of this Kenneth
rate he's a great Python developer he
wrote this he did a bunch of
presentation Python for humans I
strongly recommend basically he the
notion that the API at the end user
should be simple I tried to follow his
patterns and design practices this is
how our API looks like and I actually
want to show it
so I'm gonna we're gonna do some live
coding hopefully it will work so what
you see here is a demo I created for
Claudia West I've simply imported all
the code for our project and these are
the three poems that you have added you
know it's in resources there Whitman
poems and a few other poems so I'm gonna
clean up the elasticsearch we'll check
the status
but so we just cleaned up we can check
it over here
just one remaining yeah
so so it's a simple API and a wrapper so
if you work with the elasticsearch you
can see there's a lot going on behind
the scenes I believe that if if you're
working with the library try to address
the problem that you have in hand and
write simple wrappers that way you have
like two layers
I'll show I'm happy to show you the
actual code and search there's a lot of
boilerplate you need to write to setup
elasticsearch for example so I simply
wrote API is that I require that were
useful to me and that's what you see
here so if let's say you want to search
index everything next so let's say you
want to search by a query this API is
called meta query it basically takes a
keyword called title and it will take
the title and then you can give how many
results you want and then a match exact
match so we're going to test it there
you go
so I got the entire thing and I also so
if you work with elasticsearch you get a
lot of data back so this API will cut
that and short and give exactly the poem
if you want tags you can search tags
pretty straightforward well nice thing
about elasticsearch is if you're if you
have semantic content like in my case
the poetry and you know literary fiction
you can have analyzers custom analyzers
configured in elasticsearch they're
about eight of them you can also have
composed different analyzers in my case
I used the stemming analyzer and gave a
bunch of parameters and I worked till I
got what I wanted and then created a
simple leg wrapper so you can see here
if I search for after a week of physical
as an X as a phrase I do get it but I do
get some results back but what if I'm
searching for something like after week
physical which means the denounce the
you know some things are missing and
this is a common thing that users would
do still getting back so these are some
of the nice thing that elasticsearch
provides I believe the atomic doesn't
have at this point a lot of swimming
analyzers so if you
for content-based search I would
recommend elasticsearch at this point
and we also have I also have a de Tomic
API if anyone's interested I'm happy to
show but since it's not fully functional
it's not fair for me to show it but the
API is basically similar to elastic
search you have a data connect and give
the memory or dev you will connect to
the atomic you can note the schema by
saying load schema you could save a poem
in my case add a schema you can save a
poem and you can find by author's full
name and you can give a short you are a
little bit there's a UUID in my case I
was trying to work with a URL shortener
which had a bug so this is what you see
and a really nice feature I came across
recently is you can link ref for example
if you have poems and annotations if you
have two parent-child relationships from
the UI you don't know the business idea
you you don't know the ID usually so you
can pass the annotation pass the child
object and then refer to the parent
using a tweet URL for example and the
atomic will automatically link that so
that's that and that's it's pretty much
the API
and the final publish API was a single
line API published will take any
resource or URL or file depending on
where the poem is located and it will
index it will validate convert the text
format is n which is Eden it will index
in elasticsearch it will put it in the
atomic and hopefully if we're good to go
and it'll also give you a nice URL that
we can tweet about it so that was the
goal that when this is out poets
should be able to simply curate poems
and put it out we have just seen this
for those who are interested in learning
more about poetry I have a whole slide
that I can go through I'm gonna quickly
go through it and but I'm open to
questions the reason that I had to go
this route is because of taxonomy that
input things like poetry there's a rich
taxonomy and each editor and each poet
and scholar comes with their own and
they have a really good knowledge about
what how things work and giving a
generic tool like CMS would would would
not enable them to do this level of
taxonomy for example in the screen
you've seen before the demo adding a tag
say adding a command like tag and giving
the tag name would be as simple as
writing two functions imagine doing this
any other framework I could not have
thought of building new features this
way so at this point I am at a point
where if there is if my editor comes and
says hey I want this feature it's
basically looking at okay is it dead and
elasticsearch is it there in day Tomic
is there in my linguistics api if not
let me add the wrapper then I come to
ohm I add a little command and hopefully
it'll work before we had to do the
entire thing and I feel there's a great
benefit in using closure closure script
in this case so a bit about taxonomy
place time mood and type or some of the
ways you can classify forms places
continent country town time as there are
so many times and each one can go
further
and mood can introspective - all the way
to subversive and friendly
conversational and again types can be
very various classes and even within the
poem I mentioned in the beginning that a
page is consisted of words synonyms and
semantic content so when you start
looking at poems there are different
kinds of poems and we can now a at least
what we have we are not able to
highlight that sections because we have
the line numbers and the tokens in the
data structure enclose your script in
the browser and we can interact with
these sections it's a matter of adding a
style sheet for example to show these
kinds of poems anyone here isn't a magic
machine learning I'm not into that I
tried to read it I didn't I try to read
it I didn't understand I don't think
they carry taste in my particular use
case I think it's a great use case if
you have one terabyte of data and you
don't know what it is and you want to
make money that's a great way but I when
you don't when you know what the content
type is I think machine learning is
probably an overkill that's what I found
when I started to learn they don't
communicate poets communicate I think
and I think enabling poets with simple
tools can can make a great benefit to
public schools and you know sharing
poetry it's another favorite code of
mine by Richard
so the roadmap
I'd like to compose pages I started with
a page and I have a working concept of
how to make a page interactive and add
features without in a few in a matter of
a day less than a day and we want to
work with late magazines and there are a
lot of them that's the team I couldn't
have done this without the team I
wouldn't be standing here my brother
worked a lot on this my friend poet
professor Arthur had been constantly
consulting and how how the taxonomy
works he's been learning Python I we're
trying to teach Python to a poet not
that successful this project everything
but the services is on poet right so on
github it's going to be an open source
project and once the services are a bit
more mature I'd like to release some of
that as well there are way too many
people I want to thank I've tried my
best to put it I can't thank enough the
core closure guys Chris Granger like
table own David Nolan the wonderful
jQuery plug-in community and there are a
few design designers I had my grid dot
CSS and the page you've seen and I
haven't covered responsive design it's
actually a responsive web design page it
is working in grids the entire thing has
a layout which is separate from the page
I'm happy to show if anyone is
interested in design I am a new Newton
design but I would be happy to show but
that page was actually rendering in a
responsive web design layout with the
own page injected in it thanks to Sean
grow my brother wanted to put this
because he got a few really solid
answers from you guys so thank you and I
want to end with this light I want to
ask you what do you see
perhaps it's a tough question what do
you see now
perhaps we should start with assumptions
like most scientists and mathematicians
a boy a field a soaring eagle off-screen
a boy in search of father all of the
above but here's a conflict we don't
know the context don't know the values
we don't know the time so let's try
let's try it in Eden let's say we had
this information
I want to read this out this is one of
my favorite lines and atomic and every
line out there is poetry to me and I
just like to read the atomic darks
actually I'm I'm pretty sure rich Hickey
writes this but I haven't talked to him
we don't erase our old memories in order
to form new ones it's likely we will
look back at the last few decades as an
unfortunate time and computers kept us
from doing the right thing the time to
change that is now
the gentleman in the center is Minsky
that's the AI at fifty McCarthy on the
left and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
