going to be talking about aesthetics and
narrative today with obviously specific
relationship to closure and before I get
started I thought you might help to get
a little context on who I am and what I
do because I'm going to take kind of a
long walk back through a computer
science history before we get to the
closure stuff so I'm really quick I'm
the son of an artist in an engineer and
so that makes me a very confused person
but I did go and get a bachelor's degree
in computer science and then music
technology degree a master's and then I
worked in the chicago film industry for
eight years then I moved to New York to
finally sort of work at the intersection
of technology and art and now I'm here
today so first of all I'm guessing that
you're here because you enjoy functional
programming and there is of course I'm a
rate of reasons why you enjoy functional
programming one of the things that's
proselytized about functional
programming is the fact that it's it
helps you reason about code we see this
in the domains of course in finance and
in data data processing where you're
working with quantitative information
and quantitative reasoning works really
well in functional programming because
of course it's easy to cogitate about
meaning you can look at a function and
really get why it behaves of course and
when you understand its behavior it's
easier to see how to improve it and then
there's like these really hard if those
are the soft benefits there are hard
benefits like you can mathematically
prove that a function is correct if it's
a pure function of course
then you have something coming in you
have something going out you don't have
like a third vector that has some
arbitrary sort of inference within your
function so you can mathematically prove
correctness then you can also analyze
performance mathematically and get
quantitative valuable information about
that but of course what I'm here to talk
about today is qualitative reasoning
functional programming also has a very
long history in abstract domains domains
dealing with aesthetics domains dealing
with story and before I kind of dive
into that background the long history of
functional programming in these areas
want to quickly step back and make sure
that we're all in the same page about
art which is easy to do right and the
key thing about this definition is is
first of all I acknowledge the fact that
we're all coming into this room with our
own perspectives and our own experiences
with art so I'll try to make this is
like simple as possible by using this
Greek enfora as a demonstration so this
info of course was built to hold liquid
this particular one is probably a
ceremonial and forum but regardless
that's what they're built for they're
built to hold something right so they
have a utility and my definition of art
is pretty much anything that expands
beyond that utility and if you saw this
amphora in a human history museum or
civilization history of civilization
museum you wouldn't question its
presence there and if you saw in an art
museum you would also accept that that's
a good place for the such an object and
the reason it can be in both is because
the fact that it does something more
than serve utility there's all this
beautiful illustration on it it's not
only the illustration it's the form it's
also how the handles are decorated in
how they're shaped it's also the
markings on the body
enfora there's a lot of value here that
goes well beyond its utility that's
definitely what makes it art that value
beyond its utility a shovel is just a
shovel until you inscribe something in
the handle you decorate the handle in a
way and then maybe it's art or in the
20th century a shovel is just the shovel
until you put in an art museum and then
it has no utility and so that's art now
artists of course make qualitative
decisions all day and so they're kind of
like I'll just put two polar opposite
ways of making qualitative decisions one
is a chaos and surrender and so artists
like Jackson Pollock that dripped paint
on the paintings or John Cage a composer
who used sounds in a room that were
random that's surrendering to chaos
right and a lot of artists use some some
part of that in their process the other
way an artist works and this is how most
artists words is through decisiveness
and agency artists have agency and they
make decisions and those decisions are
based on a lot of different reasons
fundamentally though the decisive artist
has to know the rules before they can
break them that is something my mother
taught me since I was like four years
old if you're going to be a good artist
you have to know the rules before you
can break them programmers have to know
the rules before they can write them but
as we know most of the time we don't
know the rules that were supposed to be
writing as programmers which is a real
problem so in the domain of qualitative
reasoning I'm going to start by talking
about Aaron a lot of you've probably
heard of Aaron it was it's a painting
robot the development window started in
1968 this is a pretty big development
window
this is not agile so and continued well
into the 21st century it started in
Fortran it went on to see right and it
ultimately ended up in Lisp Common Lisp
object system so or C loss or cloths
this is an example of a picture Aaron
drew 1983 and here's an example of
something that Aaron painted in 1992 I
have to stress that all of these
artifacts are of course physical
artifacts these are not images on
screens these are things that aren made
onto canvas or paper and there are quite
a number of differences between these
two that we can immediately see the one
I'm going to focus on was the one that
really really changed how Harold Cohen
the author of Aaron worked does color so
color color is a really difficult
problem to solve even we're talking
about humans like color theory telling a
robot how to make autonomous decisions
regarding color is even more difficult
because there is no real baseline here
right especially if you're starting to
think about this in the mid-to-late 20th
century and so we know of course that
yellow and blue we mix those paints
together that's going to make green but
a robot doesn't know that and then
furthermore green also has all this
connotation that a robot doesn't know
and we know of course grass is green and
the sky is not green but a robot has no
idea when Harold Cohen started writing
systems for color he thought that what
it would look like is this large domain
of primitives and he would just keep
adding new rule sets and new primitives
in C and the language C and that would
eventually build some robot of
sophistication that could work
autonomously without without Harold's
involvement the fact is of course that's
not really how it worked at all what
we've discovered in this research of
course is that a small number of
primitives that are put together a small
number of rule sets that are put
together an interesting way that's kind
of the way to move forward and so of
course that's how he ended up in Lisp
because Lisp really works well with a
small number of primitives and so when
we're talking about making this robot
and making this robot make creative
decisions about color one of the really
important points that Harold Cohen
talked about after his experiences with
this was that he wasn't making a robot
that was creative he wasn't making a
robot that was creative in the way that
you are creative in the way that I was
creative that's that's a goal that may
be reached its goal that may not be
reached but an irrelevant question what
he was trying to do was make a robot
that could act autonomously that was the
key thing make autonomous aesthetic
choices now Harold unfortunately passed
away earlier this year in april but
Aaron of course continues to go on and
Harold would often joke that he would be
the first artist with a posthumous
exhibition of new work because Harold
because Aaron can continue to work
whether or not Harold's here at all so
the next thing I'm going to talk about
is Zork yah so I got a couple of people
familiar with the underground here
that's great you're in front of a white
house some people got that so I start
the development of Zork in 1975 which is
actually when its predecessor colossal
cave adventurers was started the reason
I start that there is because there
really is a inseparable tie between the
two between the two pieces of software
it flows really directly into Zorich the
development of colossal cave
and then I ended at 1982 when it was
finally the final chapter of Zork was
delivered to home computers that Zork 34
the trs-80 in the Apple 2 in the
Commodore 64 those sorts of machines so
again adventure started off in Fortran
eventually ended up in muddle on a PDB
10 and muddle is MIT design language and
that's also a descendant of Lisp okay
seeing the pattern and then eventually
it ends up on a kind of a reduced
version of muddle called Zille which is
essentially a virtual machine made for
home computers here's a picture of Zork
it's not that exciting to look at right
um the exciting thing about Zork is not
what it looks like it's it's how you
interact with it it's interacting with
it so in class okay have adventures you
could tell it's something very simple
like go west right you could also say
west go it didn't matter it's a verb
noun combination very simple and when
the guys at MIT got ahold of this um
they added a very sophisticated parser
that changed how powerful the experience
was for the user direct and indirect
objects preposition and conjunctions
these were added to the parser so you
could say something complex like fill
the bottle with water this is an example
of some muddle code the reason I kind of
included this was one to look at some
actual code and to just to show that we
have a thing called an axe in this world
in the story and an axe of course has a
utilitarian purpose and that is to maybe
chop something chocolate but we don't
really know the context of that unless
we know the story and so as a programmer
that would be one way to go about it to
find an axe within the realm of the
story that you you know but that's
awfully limited because this axe might
be used to chop wood
it might be used to chop a head it might
be used to open a bottle I mean there's
any number of ways this axe could be
used so instead of course we have an
object called an axe and then this thing
called an axe can do several has several
properties here's what Zille looked like
in in this case we have a lantern this
happens really early on in the game you
have a lantern and then we have all this
great metadata about this Lantern it's
in a living room it has you can call it
a lantern you can call it a lamp you can
call it a light you can call it brass
you can call it a brass lantern right it
has all sorts of descriptions actions
that can be taken with it and the
important thing about this or the
exciting thing about this is that this
is metadata but it's all executable
right so the fact that's executable
gives it its power and the fact that we
didn't have to know everything we can do
with the lantern before we made a
lantern before he wrote a lantern live
courses the power of this way of working
and we come back to this idea that
Harold Cohen also came to which is of
course a small number of primitives
instead of trying to deduce and write
the entire universe of word combinations
we have a small number of primitives
that can be composed together the end
result is a sense of autonomy for the
user it's as if we have a narrator
telling us a story that we're
interacting with and that guide that's
telling us a story that we're talking to
you in our language and our natural
language is the essence of the
experience of Zork so qualitative
reasoning then has some I guess facets
about it that are important to identify
explicitly and one is that there is an
unknown number of quantities when your
qualitative reasoning and often you will
never find the know
number of quantities and your process is
less about quantifying and more about
exploration of the idea or an object or
any a number of other sort of like nouns
but the point is is that that's a
diametrically opposed method of
engagement then you have when you are
qualitative or quantify ibly reasoning
and the important thing is to allow this
is to set yourself up with a tool set
and to allow yourself the license to
explore and not get caught up in ideas
of when I make the robot or the computer
software do this thing is it intelligent
is it creative the only thing that
matters is that it is autonomous meaning
that behind Zork there was no mechanical
turk that actually was typing the thing
right the mechanical turk doesn't exist
the fact is that Zork can interact with
people and tell them a story even
without human intervention this has
precedence outside of outside of
computer science any art making endeavor
that has more than one party involved
usually reduces to some form of this
Sumfest simile of this a quick
digression to talk about how a movie is
made and demonstrate that parallel is
the film script and the film script is a
technical document a film script is a
technical document and clarity and
precision is prized within that
technical document the specifications
for writing a screenplay are the same
specifications that existed when there
is only typewriters before word
processing and those specifications
haven't changed well into the 21st
century because the specifications of
margins of paragraph length what's a
desirable
can block those sorts of specifications
although they're quantitatively there
are some quantitative aspects to it
there we usually think of screenplay
writing as a qualitative decision-making
process but it's important to abide by a
few very strict structural definitions
in order to have the screenplay live a
life after the screenwriter has agency
over it that screenplay is going to be
passed on to cinematographers for
example and a screenwriter doesn't have
to ever operate a camera in order to
write a screenplay that screenplay is
going to be passed on to directors of
course so they can direct the actors
that screenplay is going to be passed on
to production people that are in the art
department to bring a gun to set if
that's what the screenplay calls for and
the screenplay might call for a handgun
but what does that handgun look like
what exact model is it what there are
all sorts of decisions to be made and
then also the very technical process of
just making sure that the day that the
actor is supposed to shoot the other
actor there is a gun on set for him or
hard to use right very specific things
need to happen for a movie to get made
that's why screenplay is such a
technical document in fact it is such a
non readable document that very few
people in this room read screenplays for
fun but you might watch some movies and
in fact when most people read
screenplays they don't read the
screenplay they read the novelization of
the screenplay right so the Star Wars
novels or whatever and those screenplay
or sorry those novels aren't written by
the original screenwriter there you
almost always written by someone else
based on the original technical document
derived from that person so just as a
blueprint isn't a bridge a code is not
necessarily its execution a script is
not a film the important thing here is
is that there are autonomous agents
working after we put together this
blueprint the screenplay this code
actually execute it
the script itself is an object appear
narrative in the film of course is the
result of the autonomous agents working
off that screenplay so for creating the
agency in our domain of functional
programming to the most powerful tools
we have are the tools of pure functions
and the tool of functional composition
or composing functions so from here with
that setup I want to talk a little bit
about some very closure specific
material this is a project I'm working
on called borderless with a new york
artist named kim Burgas and it involves
a kinect as the input and then the
output is audio that audio is generated
by overtone which is a library some of
you are familiar with undoubtedly now
this experience happens in a very
abstract domain we have two figures here
we submerged in a large pool of liquid
that's the visual the figures are male
and female and all sorts of races and
they are coming in and out of this
liquid and that's projected onto a wall
like this it's actually projected onto
thin curtains and the end result of the
installation experiences when you enter
into the installation it looks as if
these people are levitating an air and
sort of like popping out popping out of
the material here's an overhead of the
installation not sure how helpful this
is going to be but there's a Kinect
there on the Left that's facing the
projector so the people the audience
would come in from behind the projector
where the projectors that sort of like
this room and the Kinect is facing where
the people enter and the kinect then
creates results based on the people in
the room and what I have then in essence
is a series of transducers with a set of
inputs including people enter
people leaving or people in the space
simply moving or changing their position
now those transducers are filled with
all sorts of data that come off of that
so we have how long they've been in the
room we have how fast are they moving
the center of their body we have how
high they are the wrecked and the in the
the screen etc etc there's just a ton of
data coming out of this and then the
transducer part of it is then that
information has to be correlated to some
output which is Sonic and so it is
fundamentally based on tambor loudness
and pitch but there are all sorts of
ways to manipulate those qualities
within overtime or any synthetic or any
synthesizer this is kind of what it
looks like on the cockpit so this is
sort of this is not the installation but
this is the this is what's running the
installation on the left of course is a
ripple with some of the code above it on
the right is what the Kinect is seem
this is a quick 23 second demo of it so
a person enters on the right and then
someone enters on the left you can see
the replicon Ying to that
they have sounds correlated to what
they're doing and then maybe someone
comes in on the right again and within
the repple in real time of course I can
see what sort of sound is attached to
that person right so the fundamental
flow then of this software then is some
input from the connect a delta within
closure that that works with that data
that operates on some primitives that
we'll talk about that i defined and then
finally on the output is some sound so
the sort of operations that are
happening under the hood I won't sort of
dive in you know deeply into them but
just to give you a sense of what's going
on you'll have someone coming in and
they're added to a set of atoms that
Adam set has an ID number for a person
and then a vowel that's attached to them
the vowel is sort of the basis of the
soundscapes that we generate and then
maybe within that frame if they start
moving if they update their position
then I get their age I get some other
parameters but this is I get their age
or how long they've been there not there
you know not how old they are but how
long they've been on screen right and if
that element exists within the atom here
on the penultimate line there if the
element exists within the atom which
they do then I'm going to map some of
that information coming from the connect
on to the amplitude on to the amount of
reverb that I here on to the oscillator
which is the pitch so that's a
fundamental that's the gist of what's
going on and the thing is is this is not
a simple operation this is actually
breeds quite a bit of complexity this is
actually a function from the software
and you just look at it you know it's
it's not you don't walk up to a function
like this and say oh i grok you you know
it takes a while reading and
understanding and there's a lot of
parameters going in and so
it's really hard to abide by this
qualitative reasoning aspect of art
which is knowing the rules before you
break them I can't walk up to a function
like that grok it and say okay I got
what you're doing now I'm going to make
some intelligent decisions because this
thing is kind of fat so that's one
problem with this the other thing is
that within the world of closure its
boundless meaning that I could do
anything to any number and so another
rule of art making of qualitative
reasoning is that constraints breed
creativity working without bounds will
give you a mess on the other side the
last rule of art making that all set out
there today is um trust your instinct
again coming to a function like that
thinking you grok it and then
instinctually making a couple changes to
a couple numbers that's not the same
thing as like looking at a painting and
then making some kind of intelligent
decision about well this should
obviously be red and this should
obviously be blue because that's how i
paint so in this regard the repple is
god of course because you can do
something akin to that where you can
just experiment you can instinctually
just try some numbers get some sounds
all real time play play is an important
part of engineering and an important
part of art especially in the domain of
qualitative reasoning so this brings me
to a way to also then so if the repple
is a way for us to experiment with our
instincts this brings me to a way to
create constraints for us to work within
and that's using in spec spec is of
course great for creating known
constraints or scientific constraints
meaning this particular spec from the
software has a range of 22 to 20
kilohertz
20 hertz to 20 kilohertz which is the
range of human hearing so I know I can
create a data type that goes from 20 to
20,000 because there's no reason to have
a frequency above or below that but also
spec is a great way to create aesthetic
constraints so when I sit down if I know
a few things about synthesis I know a
few things about sound I know a few
things about what I want it to sound
like I can sit down and write literally
right down my presumptions and
experiment off those presumptions how
much reverb do I want in this piece do I
want this piece to sound like it's in a
cave do I wanted to sound like it's in
this room with all that slapback reverb
or do I want something more subtle well
I want something more subtle I can
create a constraint like the second one
there with a smaller control range with
those numbers that means something to
overtone that means something about
knowing that knowing the hardware or
knowing the software and how its
implemented the reverb knowing something
about the reverb I can make intelligent
decisions about what those constraints
might be I can also know if it's a
number or an integer or a float and so
spec gives me a way then too I suppose
test my code but testing qualitative
decision making doesn't make a lot of
sense even if I generate values and plug
them into the synthesizer into the
noisemaker that's not really testing
that's experimenting so spec yes gives
you tech like creating specs gives you
testable code but in the domain of
qualitative reasoning it gives you
experimental that's my new word code the
other thing then that spec gives me down
the line and functional programming then
in more general sense is a way to create
constraints for the machine to operate
off of so that the machine can make
autonomous decision making or make
autonomous decisions and so this is
pretty valuable for borderless because
borderless is an installation we had an
installation recently in Canada of the
piece and that piece is going to be
running over a long period of time and
so there are a number of environmental
variables that can change depending on
depending on time of day or it can
change depending on maybe it mutates it
can mutate so the experience isn't
always the same in the same notes and
the same things don't always happen it
changes depending on if there's a large
crowd of people or a small number of
people if there's up times or down times
where there's a lot of people or a few
people so it allows the machine it gets
constraints in the machine to make
autonomous decisions and self modify or
mutate its code so before I wrap up want
to take one make one last note about
autonomy and the idea of authorship
because we live sort of in a milieu of
of thinking that we aspire I think quite
often for quantitative for quantitative
outcomes things that are easy to work
with with the computer entire industries
of course are based on that and there is
a sense that the results that come out
of this machine of course are somehow
unbiased or somehow objective and of
course I don't necessarily agree with
that even if the Machine mutates itself
it's always going to be imbued with some
strand of DNA of the authorship of its
creator the person who wrote that
algorithm is a human being and that
human being is filled with bias and as
long as these things come out of human
beings hands these machines will have
implicit by
tease and of course this has major
ramifications well into the future as we
hand off more decision-making over to
machines so this idea that objectivity
and the last last several decades
computer science is some sort of brass
ring that we should aspire as a culture
as a computing culture to to achieve is
something that I think overshadow is
something that's great but it's also
something that overshadows the value of
viewing or allowing a computer to make
subjective qualitative decisions and the
outcomes of that so in this talk of
course you know there's been plenty of
examples of qualitative and subjective
reasoning by machines but the major
thrust of research or the major thrust
of industry isn't necessarily in that
domain and that says something about us
as an entire culture of people that work
in computing and as my last point of
evidence on that or is my point of
evidence on that again I go back to the
Greek and flora and the reason that this
enfora is priceless the reason that it's
incredibly valuable is not because it
can carry water the fact that it has
utility the fact that we make machines
with utility isn't necessarily what
makes machines valuable the thing that
makes us valuable over the thousands of
thousands of years it is existed is the
qualitative the qualitative decision
making that went into making this enfora
so that is something that we know has
value and it's something that we can
adopt within our own culture of
computation qualitative reasoning so at
the end leaving you with just a little
bit of a thought about like where this
can lead of course this can lead into
domain
means well any liberal arts domain and
computation into journalism into
personal assistants I mean there are all
sorts of domains where qualitative
values have a major import and that's
kind of what I think that we as a
community should aspire to in a larger
part at least than what we are today
okay so my name is Dave shmoo d
obviously I'd like to talk about big
ideas so find me on Twitter or even
better yet let's talk in person at the
