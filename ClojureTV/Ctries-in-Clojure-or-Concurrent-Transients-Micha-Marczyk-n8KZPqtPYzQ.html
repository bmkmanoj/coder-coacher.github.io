structures today but some of them
usually it won't be about the persistent
variety that we all know and love and
use every day instead I'd like to tell
you a little bit about a data structure
that goes by the name of c3 what is
mutable it's it's meant to be modified
in place now clearly for for that reason
most people wouldn't want or or need to
reach for it by default but nevertheless
I think cities are fascinating for they
are and for the way in which they brings
some of the ideas behind closure style
persistent data structures and
transients and some ideas from the realm
of concurrency research together to
achieve the features that uniquely their
own so firstly by way of introduction
I'd like to mention just a few points on
the evolutionary path that led to c3
development and undoubtedly be the
correct starting point for that is
filled by growth 2001 ideal hash
newspaper which introduced the data
structure known as the hash frame-up
tree in the literature which we have
come to know us in his persistence and
listeners the persistent asthma in close
am now interestingly enough that version
of eight amts described in that paper is
actually mutable now done their senses
and con can see you later chicks in
there like those family and see trees
but but it's mutable nevertheless and so
so that's interesting because that means
in particular that it would have been in
direct competition with hash tables in
in its design space but even competing
against hash tables
as a possible basis for implementing an
unsorted dictionary 80mg suffer some
compelling advantages most notably a
much more predictable performance
profile they just don't suffer the sort
of well I need to resize myself so you
kind of need to hang around and wait for
I'll do that's slow down and in some in
some scenarios it's it's acceptable to
trade some of the peak performance for
consistent timings and basic operations
right because he that hath made when
luck it was really with Ricky's
persistent implementation of this data
structure using pass coping strategies
persistence that it really came into its
own setting from our point of view that
happened in 2007 additionally which
realized that by the same basic idea
could be simplified a little bit to
implement a difference of shrugged a
type obviously vector was born
persistent vector and it is this 2007
persistent I saw him up three that is
the direct evolutionary ancestor of see
trees are described in the first series
paper how what's really interesting is
the version of CTU described in the
second paper will get to those two
flavors in a second and to understand
those it's good to have a look at
transients first now they may not be a
direct causal link the because I I don't
think I don't think the the paper
mentions transients are some inspiration
so it's possible that there's an
independent development nevertheless in
the order of idea of have any setting in
the order of study it's good to look at
transients first understand exactly what
they do on how how they achieve those
bets updates bdubs for persistent data
structures and only then to look
features because they do a very similar
thing which is happening more complex so
vectors are again a very key idea
originally updated in 2009 at first for
the vector and then later in 2009
crystal core implemented a transient
enabled version of the persistent asthma
and so it is the shoulders of these
giants that would have been available to
support further Giants possibly
interested in climbing onto them when
the inventors of CGS were starting
starting to work on them first of all
two years and the first the first CDs
paper via the second one appeared in
2012 there's also a reference
implementation written in Scala with
just a tiny sprinkling of Java as I just
to give you a quick overview of what see
trees are they're basically a map data
structure which supports concurrent
updates in a lock free fashion which
means global progress is guaranteed or
in other words if if a group of threads
manipulates a single see tree then
regardless of any scheduling
infelicities as long as the scheduler
schedules some of those threads at least
some other time then at least one of
them is guaranteed eventually to make
progress and eventually such a finite
number of steps those operations so that
c3 support up I primas the persistent
hash map and transient hashmap
operations taken together there's one
exception specifically the size
operation is linear time just because
it's it's tricky to maintain a
consistent counts in a date structure
that can be simultaneously changed from
many concurrent feds I think it's a
reasonable trade to just not have it
why should setting mention it because it
is the one the one major for follow
degradation versus bhms then on top of
those basic persistent / transient
hashmap operations c3's also supports a
constant time snap evaporation and it's
possible to make those snappers
persistent but actually by default they
just in completely independent cities
which first structure with the originals
well obviously this is snapchat across
some time and finally for this slide I
have ported the reference implementation
to those others some niceties hopefully
make it somewhat nice to work with and
it's it's available for for
experimentation today the current
version number zero point zero point
three and that that information will be
repeated on the final slide I hope you
might feel somewhat inspires the wavy it
may be downloaded and type the couple
expressions into the pole and then
possibly forget it until such time as my
provider an opportunity to actually use
it for something now in implementing
series clj or the first order of
business was to get the basic semantic
side but the immediate follow-on concern
was to make series blend in someone
seamlessly will be existing suite of
these structures enclosure and firstly a
second i may have entertained the idea
of supporting the persistent and
transient api simultaneously on the same
objects right but that's at second graph
that's clearly now go because transients
use some of the same java method things
with different semantics so so that can
be done instead cgc LJ maps are
transient first so if you create one
with the factory function called
concurrent map in the ctc of these days
if you create one what you get is a
transient like object with some extra
grantees namely those that if you are so
bang or dis southbank something onto of
out of that map what you get back is the
very same map and the original map will
be modified in place and so so that
means that you can write code in the
usual functional style that you'd use
with transients but run it on multiple
threads manipulating the same instance
and that's i suppose the encouraged way
to use transit to use CT enclosure in
most scenarios what persistent does here
the system bang is it slightly different
what it does with transients because
with transients a call to persistent
bang invalidates the transients which
can then no longer be used on cps
persistent thing is harmless to the
original and what had gives you as it as
it returns value is an immutable
snapshot and that in mutual snapshot is
a persistent map it's slower than a
regular assistant hashmap but otherwise
it should behave more less the same and
both those immutable snapshots and
mutable series additionally support the
DRS operation i'm also spelled at sign
which creates mutable snaps of in the
form of independency trees and so taking
all of this together what you can do is
something like this so what we what we
do here is we create a c3 then take a
couple snapshots then best the original
c2m the two snapshots in place in
separate operations those could run on a
single feather multiple
whatever and then it turns out that all
of those in place modifications only
apply to the sea three instances they
were applied to right so they're
completely independent and what we get
is this version graph depicted in the
top right corner beside which is
possible not unusual at all for
persistent data structure but if you
consider that those arrows and ellipses
stands for arbitrary sequences of
sequences collections of updates
operations potentially running on
multiple files in parallel with no use a
level locking then things become a
little medical and and has the choice of
of stars represent CDs and really this
this is the reason why I wanted to
implement them with this combination of
pds like version graphs and and lock
three concurrent modify ability I really
wanted to know how that works under the
hood okay getting back to my original
train of thought this is the closure
level API but these are not all the
features that cities have to offer
there's also a bunch of Java util
confirmed from current map methods which
I have not so far chosen to expose of
clover functions and this number of
reasons for that the main reason I
suppose is that I prefer to experiment
with API for these outside of the main
library and at some point I I might fold
in what seems to be the best approach
into the library proper haven't done so
so far but the features are accessible
estella method and as you can see they
all amount to swapping he in or out of a
map based on some condition related to
the presence of that key possibly is a
particular value in the map and they're
all atomic so say motive options
could be useful if you wanted to
instantiate a singleton object by a
single one of the type that it's okay to
construct multiple times in parallel
just as long everybody eventually only
uses one version and no other version is
ever used right so so you could have
potentially many threads construct their
own initial versions and then use protiv
options to offer them to some some sort
of centralized cash and then one one
thread will succeed and inserting value
the other threads will sail by this week
but petit absinthe will give them back
the already present value in return
right so vague and then just switch over
to that do the single term that won the
race and that sort of thing is is all
over the place like last time I I I
certain an open source project was
probably in history with grant Heslov
and remove and replace are similar now I
wanted this library to be extensively
tested and I wouldn't say I'm quite
there yet in particular I'm very much
looking forward to today to those
concurrency concurrency testing
facilities of test text to mature and
well they're not immediately applicable
to this data structure as it stands
because they seem to rely on user level
scheduling as I've controlled
interleaving of operations and some of
the operations here well they just can't
be pried apart easily but I've been
thinking about how best to pry them
apart and to to verify with semantics we
were tested of that kind also so that's
coming in the future hopefully but as of
today the test we still manages to cover
a lot of functionality
I think so firstly well we have those
immutable snaps of cinder which act as
persistent labs and it actually is
expected that they act as proper
persistent hashmap so well if you're
implementing a persistent hashmap looked
alike then you should be using exact
almost collections like it's it's really
wonderful library and and so it has in
fact it has given CTC LJ stamp of
approval for single thread of use the
web so the first step in the overall
strategy then then we have those
concurrent map methods and for those i
use a similar approach but it's it's
custom-built for for ctc LJ test suite i
have a custom custom generator of
operation sequences and i compile those
into clover functions and use them in
test jack properties ensuring that that
the resulting that the CT resulting from
the application of that function to to
an empty initial CT looks like in
several ways like a compound hashmap
that the same operations applied to and
then finally there's some compounds
stress testing with long sequences of
updates applied from several threads in
parallel using the executive framework
and some basic semantic checks at the
end so overall it seems to work that and
I say that that this is a somewhat
robust as sweet as it stands eventually
i'm hoping to hoping to add to it okay
and and this i will say conclude the
ctcl they teach each section of my talk
what I will what I shall proceed to do
now is scribble a ton of notes in the
margins of this teach eat this
various internal details which nobody is
ever likely to need to know about when
using these data sexy but it's really
actually the whole point I I think
that's that some of the content related
ideas you might be more interesting than
the data structure itself at least at
first and then the date sex is wonderful
for it can it can do for you this but
the Enlightenment provided by some of
the internals is amazing so so let's see
if if we have enough time to make that
work so to start well as i said the c3
is a variation on the theme of hash way
i'm up to ease its it's yet another
family it's yet another member of this
family of these structures and
internally it looks very similar but the
most the most conspicuous difference is
that were a hash fairy map trees
internal three might look something like
the figure on the left an equivalent
city would look more like the figure on
the right with the sec of implementing
nodes with volatile field pointing to
multi-way nose like those found in
regular regular position as mass the
reason for this extra layer of
indirection is is that without it if you
wanted to do not have it and yet still
support content updates for multiple
threads you have to accept losing some
updates to race conditions and the way
in which that could happen is that well
suppose that two threads wanted to
update this data structure by associate
two keys onto it one of those keys would
require
the would note to be expanded so it just
say this just happens to be a key that
doesn't serve those initial five bit so
it's hash value with the keys already
present in the map okay so that means
that we'll have to replace the root and
then another key another key does be its
initial sized bits of five hashcode bits
with the entries in with the keys in the
left hand side child that in the left
child of the road so so we also need to
place the child in such a scenario what
could happen is that the two threads
might race in such a way that the thread
that wants to modify the root could
succeed in doing that but still use the
old version of the left child out for
the new route even while the the other
thread descends the left path in the
tree looks of looks at the left child
and eventually replaces it in the
original route right but the original
route is no more in the city so as I'm
saying this way we could lose the update
to to the child node yeah within
direction now this cannot happen because
because we never need to replace a child
of a multi-way node any multi-way now
only hair is guaranteed to have only i
knows as children in direction nodes and
those might point to different different
children of their own at different times
but they do not themselves need to
change during a regular update
operations
okay so in this way races are prevented
and then I'm and this is the most
conspicuous difference but there's also
the Alpha some from other differences so
keeping for one slide I'll go back to
the previous one and second just it's
just a better split as in terms of
layout collection of knows that series
use internally it doesn't look much like
the collection of knows that persistent
hashmap in close i can t use one reason
for that is that I wanted to stay closer
to the to the original paper for the
initial implementation just to make sure
that it dining problems then there are
problems with my implementation and not
with the way and we're trying to do some
new feature as additionally additionally
performance evaluation of various node
modifications is very much an open
problem for me certain ease it to do
item and so I'm working on that on side
eventually eventually some changes might
land as of today we have those in
direction I was described a moment ago
then they have so-called main nodes as
children and those well bitmap index
node and hash collision out resemble the
nodes of the same names found in
persistent has maps that tomb node is a
special node type used to and for
compactness of the tree in the presence
of dis social for Asians so see trees
actually shrink when you move keys that
that turns out to be somewhat tricky
tube knows I facility that makes this
possible well I won't be going to into
that particular detail and then there's
also something called fail which I will
describe in some detail later on and
then finally the actual key value pairs
are currently reef I'd informal
singleton lives in NC trees that is not
the case
persistent hash maps are standing closer
today and that's a significant
optimization so suppose I'll have to see
whether it can be fitted on to see trees
as well now as I said a cities are in
some important ways very similar to
transients they also track subtree
ownership but but they they track it in
a different way which we'll have a look
at in second and additionally they
rewrite path in different circumstances
are so puffy writing in series happens
after snapshot operations if if you take
no snapshots then you never need to
write past even though you may keep
modifying your your cities and when a
rewrite happens it's somewhat eager it
rewrites amount to replacing i knows and
and this is actually a safe operation in
this particular context normally you
want to play sign outs here here's okay
because you're still replacing a main
node with the main node with new i knows
basically well anyway this is performed
eagerly so the tea so after snaps are
the t it well operates a little more
slowly but it fixes itself up very
rapidly and then what i think is most
interesting inside the data structure is
the pair of decals for for double cars
or cast to like operations that that it
uses to to prevent modification to
supposedly immutable snapshots of
welcome to prevent modifications to see
three from affecting other cities which
they might structure with
right and so I I think I fought them on
somehow so okay so so going back to this
point about cities being similar to
transients well this is this is how with
a regular clothes of style transient
what you do when you perform an update
is he proceeded much much like with a
persistent legislature except web at
each step of the way down the tree you
examine a so-called edit marker which is
an atomic reference to something to see
if it happens to be the distinguished
edit market that the transient instance
itself uses if so then you may presume
that you own that particular fragment of
the transient the particular node and
you can just modify it in place instead
of replacing it with a new node and then
this way you avoid additional locations
basically this is where the performance
wind comes from but you need to you need
to make this checkers every step of the
way I need and you do just once now in
see trees yeah instead of an edit market
you have something known as the
generation marker I know it's store
generation Marcus and the root nodes
generation mark is the distinguished one
you still have to look at them at each
level as you walk down the tree for
fixer for post snapchat fixer purposes
but when you finally want to make an
update what you what you do is you take
take the generation marker off the node
with you which you
to update and come and look back up to
the root and compare it with the
generation marker founder so so we're in
fanzines you have us you have a
relatively simple ownership tech at each
step of the way down the tree in series
instead the the key ownership tag that
happen guarding your updates happens at
the leaf node that you're modifying and
involves the root so somehow somehow you
need to you need to make sure that
nobody to change the nose you're looking
at in the meantime while also making
sure that route generation has not yet
change so ideally you'd do that using a
cast to operation meaning compounds
Wharf on to memory locations right
doesn't happen to exist in hardware so
so we we have to work around that using
regular concentrations that this is if
we had access to a cast to enable that
how do I get active it and then that
would obviously be AVL and and the
reason why we have those inner asian
markets in situ in the first place is to
support support snapshots again the
mechanism for that is similar to
something that happens in fanzines where
if you call persistent bang on a
transient the vet resets your edit
marker to know it's it's an atomic
reference to something right when you
set it to know that means it's no longer
active and you are no longer permitted
to make makeup days in CT something
similar happens when you take a snapshot
snaps of discards all generation markers
and install new ones both in in the
original and in the new independence III
and in the presence of a new generation
market in the root causes all access of
all accesses to
to internal nodes of the tree to update
them to the latest generation first
before doing anything else and so it is
in this way that partly writing happens
and updates the things that shouldn't be
updated in this way also prevented okay
so for this to work we need a cast to
operation let's to argument compound
swap and as I said it's not a hardware
primitive them on most architectures
today but it turns out that it's
actually possible to implement it in
software using regular single address
components for preparations many schemes
for doing that and there's a number of
desirable properties that one might one
might hope to find in a cast to software
implementation one that's very general
and in many other ways particular
particularly attractive was described in
a paper by Harris phase and path called
a practical multi-word compounds for
preparation which which is based on on
single address cars operations and
so-called script oz and see to use our
DCSS for snapshots then the problem
without so you see to use this use of
precursor operation tucows to described
in this paper source or snapshots that's
called RB CSS will have a look at that
in a second the problem with that is
that well it uses those descript objects
generally it is to be expected of cast
to software implementations that provide
data parallelism well which means that
they can proceed conquer and
concurrently as long as the access
independent memory location
they tend to be based on temporary
descriptors swapped into those memory
locations they operate on and those
descriptors generally need to be fresh
it's it's not okay to reuse those
objects so it means that if we use this
kind of cast to implantation then then
we just have to accept the cost of
allocating those objects whenever we we
call cars too now that's okay for
snapshots because generally speaking it
expects snapshots to be taken somewhat
infrequently but then regular updates
really shouldn't be forced to pay this
sort of price it would never do to
allocate an object each time you each
time yourself in newquay nvm up just
won't work very well so for this reason
for this reason the second series paper
introduces an original cast to like
operation called decals for generational
cars and and so I think that the feature
set of cities is one thing that's
interesting about them the other key
thing that's interesting about them is
how they use these two operations and
these two operations themselves are well
worth while they can close of look at so
so this is what what I'd like to do in
the final section of the talk as I said
there are two and RD CSS is the more
immediately understandable a more basic
one the name stands for restricted
double compare single fault and it's
restricted well in two ways so the first
way is that they said this the arguments
need to come in a certain distinguished
order where I salute the main way is
that it requires memory to be
partitioned into a control section and a
data section so you
you permitted to make to converse and a
single spot with our DCSS but you need
to make sure that independent rd CSS
calls happening in parallel don't treat
will always take the same addresses
after swappable addresses okay so so you
need you need to know which addresses
are your extract from control compared
verses which are the swaps in CDs base
requirement is very simple to satisfy
indeed as possible to restrict the
operational even further because because
what we want what we need for snappers
for taking snapshots is the ability to
take the route in Direction node and
replace it with a new one pointing to
the same main node and we call that
indirection notes tall generation
markers those generation markers are
fixed but freshly allocated each time an
indirection nerve is allocated so if you
manage to replace the root indirection
node while keeping the old main node
that means we have a c3 we now have a CD
which looks the same but it's it's it's
moved on to a new generation so
therefore and then if we do it twice in
philo if we take the same main out and
install it in a new I know than well
then we now have to see trees with the
same menos of them so that's about how
how snapshots work but again we don't
have a hardware operation operation to
do that with so the way in which our
dcss achieve achieve have to like
semantics in this sort of scenario is it
actually introduces a collection of
three operations two of them are
expected to be used from user code one
of them is more of an implementation
detail
our DCFS is the card like operation
which takes to compare dresses and and
one value this weapon a DCFS complete is
is the implementation detail and then
Adi CSS read is the operation that all
read accesses to to the memory locations
involved need to go through and the
reason you can't access it directly is
that is that nobody may ever see
intermediate objects that are the CSS
places in some memory locations what a
dcss does first when it's asked to to
modify to modify to perform the two
comparison and possibly the one swap is
it creates a descriptor which looks like
this in enclosure it points it points to
the well and sit in the case of c3 it
points to the old indirection out of the
one you're hoping to place and the new
one that you want to swap tin and
additionally it points to the old main
node so the main node here acts of the
control control datum and the
indirection notice the data part of the
part of the operation so this gets
swapped in in place of the route i
know'd and then and then an attempt is
made to perform a further some further
cows operations and eventually if
they'll succeed they may not necessarily
succeed but if they'll succeed then the
descriptor is replaced with the new I
know the proposal I know it again if
they fail then it is we replaced with
the old I know the reason for they use
over this crypto is that a descriptor
object which holds all the information
describing the upper the in-progress
operation is that
if the thread that initiated our dcss
stop say the scheduler forgets about it
I no longer gets the performance work
then we need to make sure that that
other threads can fix this situation
somehow because well the beta sector is
supposed to be locked three global
progress needs to be guaranteed under
any circumstances and so so what happens
is that other threads if they happen to
notice that an RDC SS descriptor is
present when they where they expect the
root I know to live they look at the
description and attempt to help in
completing the operation and this is a
pattern you find all the time in in this
type of concurrency concurrence con can
see related operation in lock 3 data
structures in white V data structures
Fred's racing tracks as a memory
location frequently help each other to
complete it before moving on to their
own business so this is what our dcss
read this for its attacks its accesses
the memory location looks at the
descriptor if it find the descriptor it
looks at the other script so it
completes the operation or attempts to
complete the operation and only then
does it read the value out of the memory
location when handed back to the color
so this works great for so far for
snapshots but again it's not appropriate
for updates and therefore a separate
operation is introduced photos it's
called decals for generational cows it
also provides double compared singles
off and it's also restricted and that
the two compares always on the same
memory locations and the swap is also
always on the same memory location
specifically it compares the kind I know
racing market to the root generation
marker and then it ends a compound swap
on the kind i knows may know now the
design goal here is to do this thing
which is similar to what our DCSS
accomplices but but also not to allocate
an intermediate descriptor if possible
so the alternative strategy that dicus
uses is to use main nodes themselves as
descriptors well this is the one
particular main node type that is all
only ever used as a descriptor mark and
it's only evacuated if operation sale
when they fail so you see it has a get
prev operation for getting the previous
value basically the idea is that a
descriptor descriptive stores the
original values and the proposed value
for the new memory location so with
decals we don't create a descriptor
instead we just swap in the proposed
value optimistically but it itself then
serves as the descriptor for the
operation because it has a pointer to
the previous value of that field which
which is only changed once it's it's
reset to know when the operation
successfully completes and if it doesn't
complete them be although value swap
like a gnome and we done and again and
again it's actually a collection of
three operations because because any
reads of main nodes need to make sure
that those are actually committed menos
with nil prev painters if they're not
then they help complete them and I was
going to to show you what one of these
operations looks like enclosure I guess
because is the original contribution of
this paper so might as well use it here
so so this is it when you attempt decals
you optimistic well you take a proposed
value of a proposed new main node you at
this point you're guaranteed to be the
only thread in possession of a pointer
to this to this node so you set its
volatile previous field it needs to be
volatile to preserve correct semantics
to the old value and then you attempt an
optimistic cars well if you fail them
you failed but if you succeed if you
succeed you then you proceed you proceed
to commit so but that's what you what
you do as a client of the cars operation
as a client of the read operation you
call decals read on an inode it looks at
the main node of the inode and again it
does it does a well appear we don't need
to we don't need to check if we need to
commit we guarantee to to have to commit
in the read operation we check whether
we need to commit path and so we do and
the commit I commit utter amount to a
loop which which has a few few places
where it might terminate early and it
takes these exit points when a parallel
operation does something in the middle
that sort of invalidates this in
progress inflation but otherwise
otherwise it's it reads it reads the
root root generation marker or actually
the would I know then looks at the
generation marker here and performs
performs as a simple identity point
identity check against the the expected
one if that succeeds if that succeeds
then it converts the value if that
doesn't succeed then
then it tries again possibly and
possibly decide if the generation market
actually changed then then I decide that
the operation needs to fail so it's
registers that fact immediately and then
and then goes back to the top of the
loop and this is where cleanup happens
and so so clearly clearly these past two
operations are DCFS is very similar
actually these past two operations have
a an internal structure that it is
possible to examine and in fact in fact
if you wanted to you could observe the
intermediate steps in user level code
but if you commit to this contract of
only accessing those memory locations
using dicas read and decals then then
you are guaranteed never to see those
intermediate values and in that way I
think that way the overall has to
operation can be said to be atomic you
can't observe non ultima city okay so so
these are the two operations that I
think are fascinating here there's any
number of ways in which i think they
could be used in closer so hopefully
i'll be able to make some some addition
library releases based on those but if I
want them maybe some of the other
somebody also the library itself may
hopefully also be useful to you
occasionally and I think with that i'll
i'll call it i'll call it wrap thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
