talking about circle CIS front end which
is built an ohm and we'll talk a little
bit about it and this talk will first be
a little introduction to Circle C I
talked about some things in the before
time before ohm and and I came to this
project we'll talk about the
architecture of circle C eyes front end
we'll talk about our experiences with
that architecture and then I'll ramble a
little bit about like kind of the future
of it and the landscape with ohm and
front end work enclosure script so
before I get started talking about that
I first want to give credit where credit
is due I basically had nothing to do
with this
these two guys deserve all the credit
yeah so Dan and Dan Daniel and Danny
here the engineer and designer who did
the bulk of the work on this and they're
now working on a new cool startup that's
also an ohm enclosure script called
precursor app which is like a real time
collaborative prototyping thing for
teams and their work is based on Omaha
which is like a very early example app
done in ohm to experiment with
architectures using react from closure
script but there's and there's a there's
a ton of other folks who have at least
one commit in the codebase so these this
is just you know people who have helped
make circle see house front and better
it is open source so there there are a
whole bunch of other folks who have
participated let me tell you a little
about circle CI it is a continuous
integration server and it is deeply
integrated with github it helps you ship
better code faster by by making sure
that all your builds and changes I go to
github get built through the integrate
call your unit test run and everything
and circles product is really simple and
that's important because it means that
our UI is really simple and so I'll show
you a little bit about the UI here's the
dashboard it's as you'd expect just a
list of recent builds and you can see in
the navigation bar on the side there's
the projects you're building you can see
all the build status and you can drill
in to an individual build and here you
can see you know some details about the
build you can drill into individual
actions in the build this is all real
time updated as your builds are running
all the log data is being fed down to
the
browser and that's that's pretty much
the app from a UI perspective well sort
of really I mean it's it's the details
that make apps hard and if you've ever
worked on a really high quality
production front-end you know that all
the little details take a ton of time
but getting the details right are why
customers love your product and so
that's why circle spends a ton of time
on the front end doing things like this
this is you know you made an error in
your config file and we showed you the
lines that failed and give you details
and point you to documentation and
getting all of that right is a ton of
work and so even though the app feels
really simple and small there's a lot of
code that goes into all the little bells
and whistles but there's also a slog of
other things that you just have to do
when you're building a web app right
you've got various screens for setting
settings and configuring billing and
you've got forms for you know picking
out different stuff than you've got all
sort of Arthur ization things to deal
with and it just a lot of stuff that
needs to get built and um helps us do
that better so what were we doing before
ohm well I don't know I wasn't there but
I did a little digging in the code and I
realized that if we look at the tech
that's involved in the front end so
server side and client side but not
talking about the backend storage and
just talking about what it takes to
build the user interface the dark ages
here we were pretty vanilla right there
was Ruby there was rails and you know
rails does all sorts of other stuff but
we used all those things to serve HTML
on our front-end and then the client
side we had backbone and CoffeeScript
and all these awful things but this is
the best we had and we should all take a
moment to appreciate like how far we've
come in the last couple of years in the
front-end space like now we're in the
Age of Enlightenment we've got stuff
like closure that's cool and all these
simpler tools but on the front end side
in the client you know we've got closure
script we store most of our data in a
closure atom we use core async to
coordinate things we use a bunch of
simpler stuff not the least of which is
is almond and react in those things and
so the question is like have now that
we've made this switch from rails and
backbone is it awesome are we
be with this are we glad we've done this
and the answer is yeah it's pretty
awesome but not everything is awesome so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you
a tour we're gonna we're gonna look
through the code the major sections kind
of look through it and kind of get a
feel for what works what doesn't and
help you maybe structure an app if
you're gonna use home for a real
production system so briefly we'll start
our tour with the client-server pieces
basically at circle we don't have any
private api's our UI is built on all the
same public api's that you guys can use
for interacting with our back-end this
is really great for dogfooding your
public api's but it's less than ideal
for some of our user interface needs
sometimes we need to do an extra request
here or there if you're gonna make a
public API as part of your product and
then it pays to go this route to dog
food your own api's but if your public
API if your API is not gonna be part of
your product it kind of makes sense to
actually tune your API for the actual
application UI you're building so we're
gonna skip the other stuff in the server
sign that you all are familiar with and
we'll talk about the client side so as I
said um circle a coffee cloture script
and it's all open source so you can
download build run against the
production back-end and contribute to
circle sea-ice front-end or you're just
curious if you just want to see what a
real proper like in production o map
looks like this is a great place to
start or you can look at a smaller kind
of toy size app in Omaha which has more
or less the same architecture I'm gonna
talk about today and it's a sizable
project but it's manageable we're
talking you know sub 30 thousand lines
of code 13 or so thousand of that is
closure script you know ten thousand
issue of that is just style sheets so
really it's it's pretty manageable and
I'm gonna kind of give you the roadmap
of where to look and see what parts do
what so the architecture is basically
you have the server and we have these
things that we call controllers talking
to the server and what the controllers
do is they basically operate on a queue
and they process data
they said they talk to the server and
then the various controllers
swap into a big global atom this might
sound familiar if you've done if you've
been listening to all these react talks
and talks so we swap into the big global
atom that's our app state and then we
render the big old atom with our views
and then the views and then put things
back on a queue and they go back into
the controllers and the cycle repeats so
this is the top level of the codebase
and it's pretty flat in the top level we
have some of the main functions and
other things that kind of kick the whole
system off and other utility libraries
and things the real interesting stuff to
get started if you're following the flow
is the go jump into the controllers
directory which is where all the events
are processed and all the coordination
between network requests in the UI occur
and then in the models directory you'll
find data functions that operate on the
information requested from the from the
API and from the controllers and those
aren't your typical models like we don't
have model objects they're all pure data
functions they operate on on closure
literals and then the components
directory has all the views so this is
where you'll find all the own bits so
the interesting is that these are all
glued together with the app state atom
and so let's let's talk about the atom a
little bit the good thing about the atom
is it's debuggable right all your values
are eaten you can print them you can
read them you can serialize them send
them across the wire it's very simple
what you see is what you get you put
data in the atom you get data out of the
atom no magic happens and it's really
easy because you don't have to think
about it that much you can just put data
in the atom and you pull data out of the
atom and it's just as you'd expect and
so this is sort of a massive step
forward compared to something like
backbone and we've all been singing the
praises of this approach and it works
pretty well
for a circle the thing is that there are
some bad sides to the big ol atom and
frankly it's the biggest thing is that
it's anti modular right every view has
to agree on the shape of the data that's
gonna be living in that big ol atom and
that is tricky because it's talking to
the server which is a different idea of
what the shape should be and then some
of you may want some different slice of
data and it's also complex because it
means that the API requests are making
are gonna be tightly coupled to the view
you have so this requires discipline to
manage at scale you actually have to be
like pretty careful about what goes
where on the atom and you have to take
stock every once in a while the schema
of this big atom because it's all
implicit and you have to keep it
straight between the various parts of
the system and the various views within
a part of the system but it gets a
little worse - the other problem with
this atom thing is that you sometimes
have a conflict between fetching from
the server and rendering performance you
want to fetch extra stuff in a larger
batch to minimize the round trips and
you know maximize the value are getting
from the bandwidth to and from the
server but then you have to like slice
the data up because if you give too much
data to a particular view you're gonna
lose all those nice ohm optimizations
about equality and whatnot for the view
you give it a big ton of stuff that it
doesn't care about you over query the
view is gonna re render even though
nothing it actually cares about has
changed and this also means that you
have to denormalize stuff and put it
into various places in the big ole atom
to make sure that you get the right
slice of data to the right of you and so
they start to take on the flavor of sort
of like a shared file system or maybe
like a build system make file of doom
that you've experienced one point in
your career and if you if you're careful
it's not so bad but if you're not
careful this can get out of hand so
let's let's talk more about the
controllers though if you go down into
the controllers directory you'll first
see that there's very few of them
the very first one of interests that's
kind of the entry point is the
navigation controller the navigation
controller is responsible for requesting
all the stuff from the server
subscribing to the various real-time
update channels and then kicking off
initial renders and then what happens is
the API controller will handle all the
responses that come back in from the
server and collate those responses into
the big atom and coffee renders to
happen then the controls will put
messages on a queue and update they'll
go into the queue the control the
controls controller which is a bit
confusing will process those things and
then again update the big atom and move
on with the view and then lastly there's
the the WebSocket controller which those
subscriptions that come in that are made
when the page is loaded they're going to
listen for a some incremental change and
then again update the adapt state so
what's worth noting here is that this is
sort of separated by technology but in
reality everything's driven by that
navigation controller the very first
thing that happens is you issue a bunch
of requests and then set up and
coordinate using Corey saying all the
different pieces and reactions that are
going to happen and then you render your
page and then you handle the things that
happen after page renders like button
clicks and stuff so let's uh let's let's
slice this differently so this is sliced
by technology let's look at it by a
particular view here is a really
simplified version of the pseudo of
pseudo code for the page load of the
build page it shows you a particular
build in your that you've run on this
our servers this is actually pretty
similar to to the actual thing that does
happen and you can go find where I
copy/paste and chopped out the pieces to
simplify it to fit on a slide this is
more or less the idea when you navigate
to the build page you put a message on
the API channel say you know go get the
build data you subscribe to the build
updates Channel that's a server-side
push notification channel and then you
set some optimistic state like the
breadcrumbs you set some like ID values
for the onion as of onion queried
information like the current
organization or a positive from github
but the build is coming from and then in
the API controller when an event comes
back in on that cue you say ok we
downloaded the build of data so now we
just so that in in the key places
replacing the temporary data that was
there and that's how you get the nice
loading experience in the UI there's you
basically check like is the data present
or not and then as things happen to the
build on the server side we push changes
down to the WebSocket channels and we
update the state there as well and so
that's basically the lifetime of a page
modulo user interaction which takes us
to the control controller which is where
you have something that we have
explicitly named events for different
things that can happen so here you have
something like a control event when the
retry a build button gets clicked we do
an optimistic update we say the build
has been queued which we don't know that
actually happened or not right we're
assuming that the API vanduul succeed
and then based on success or failure of
various states of this well
the atoms with the information as it
comes in or subscribe to other channels
but it's important that all of the
events we handle go on a queue like this
and they're always data and that's
pretty important we'll talk about why in
a moment
so like I said these controllers are
page centric and this works for us
because our app is page like it's not
really an app like we don't have menu
bars and we don't have complex
interactions and documents you operate
on we have places you go and when you go
to that place you get a batch of data
and subscribe to a set of channels so if
your application isn't like that this
architecture may not be right for you I
said it's the data slice is wrong it's
organized by technology it really should
be organized by what page you're looking
at it's a little problematic you have
like four or five controllers open at
once I think they're multi methods we
probably can just give it them I don't
know what you haven't yet but like I
said this also requires that you have
this this also plays nice but this is
the big old atom thing and so it may or
may not scale to an application that is
a very large number of pages unless you
just kind of give up on having pages
share data and caching things and or
come up with a better solution there but
it works quite well for for the limited
number of views we have and this is
being centralized is a blessing all the
data comes in as objects we can read and
print and so we have global logging for
every action that happens in the UI
which is super valuable for debugging
it's also super valuable for auditing so
we can look at one place and see here
are all the API requests that are
happening so we know basically visually
by looking at the code whether or not
there's a good chance the page will
render quickly which is important a lot
of times you do things where you have
some implicit queries happening and your
site is slow and then you look at the
timeline graph and you're like oh okay
it made 50 requests where are those
coming from having all the API requests
be kicked off from the same spots and
collated centrally means that you can
out of it very easily and that's very
important for keeping your site snappy
but there's there's a downside to this
as well as and I've talked about again
with the atom is that you don't have any
isolation between your components so you
have to be careful that everything on a
particular page cooperates so
if you have a component you reuse on
multiple pages you have to do extra work
to isolate it we don't have too many
reuse components the ones we do are
pretty simple like a button or whatever
and so this hasn't been too big of a
problem for us but it could be an issue
in an application that has a lot more
reusable little bits and parts the other
thing is that the controllers are
non-deterministic so they use core async
they talk to the network
there's latency that's a thing and so we
use Cori sync to tame the non
determinism of the network and we make
sure things come in the right order and
we coordinate them but this also
inadvertently introduces some non
determinism into our UI we do not use
court async in the own layer in the
views directly in the message callbacks
at all because Koree sync is a tool for
managing non determinism and our views
are deterministic and so this is really
important and we used to use core async
all over the app and we've since pushed
it back into the controller layer and
whole categories of bugs have gone away
and then the ones that are remain we can
track down with the global logging which
is really nice so back to the components
themselves speaking about those if you
do this little grep here which is the
two main ways we create components in
our code there's a hundred and
seventy-nine my last count things that
get rendered as components so that's a
lot of stuff these all vary in
complexity there's some little tiny ones
that just render a little stuff there's
not really big ones that do a ton of
work but they more or less all follow
this same pattern and you guys have seen
this before this is an overview this is
using Cebuano which is a hiccup style
template language so here you have a
view you take some data in you reify
view i'm interfaces you pull some
information out of the data you
calculate some derived values and then
you render a template and in the
template you hook up some event handlers
to your dom nodes and in this case we
use this raised function here which is
basically the only side effect that our
UI ever has which is it queues a message
fire-and-forget
rays returns nil we don't do any
thinking in these callbacks in fact we
probably could come up with a syntax
that wasn't a function it was just like
just the value there we probably should
do that
we have to change the blonde Oh or
whatever but we do not put code in those
callbacks I must be really have to for
some dirty hack this is again to get
that global logging and so most of our
views are pure components they assume
the controllers have pre fetched all the
data so they basically are really simple
functions of the input data they don't
do a lot of work to think about what
they need to render they say that get
some value in and get some value out and
we're pretty judicious in our use of
component local state and I've already
hammered on this point of putting all
the of all the callback stuff on a queue
but anytime we violate these basic
principles we try and package it up into
a component that has component local
state that does whatever evil Dom
Interop glue to it needs to do and will
package it up as something that is in
fact we're usable so a button that
manages you know clicking States or
something that has to do with
drag-and-drop or these other stateful
transient interactions we can try and
isolate them as quickly as we can and
the thing is is that component local
state is actually really useful I
disagree with some of the other purists
who are like we need to eliminate
component local state completely I've
actually written about component local
state and how you can make it pure
automatically there's a blog post linked
at the bottom there and I think David
Nolan's talked about this a bunch and
this was demoed in the circle CI
front-end where we can have components
with component local state we mount all
that component local state into the
global atom and we can serialize
everything including the component local
state across the internet which is super
useful we're bugging so even though
those components are impure we're able
to use all of Ohm's intercession
features to kind of make that like force
them to be pure by by redefining those
side effects but don't be afraid to use
these features just use them carefully
and keep them encapsulated and isolated
and and into purpose-built components
because whenever you're doing things
that are effectual in stateful you're
basically building systems and you don't
want to be in the business of building
systems you want to be in the business
of building pure functions of data two
views and so when you do have to build
something that has interactions system
use these things but keep them keep them
packed up I want to take a brief aside
to talk about markup
syntax really does matter I'm not really
sure why it matters but it does people
care about this Danny the designer who
did a lot of this work used to write
Hamill and now he's like I love hiccup
it's great or whatever it is he's super
into it it's important that designers
can work on these things it means that
you get faster iteration and all these
important stuff and so and so even
though there is some pros and cons to
the various ways that reagent or ohm and
whatever build and come and create their
components it is important to us that we
have that hiccup structure so that you
like HTML for for the design folks and
unfortunately we lose a lot of the
benefits of being data links to react
react will break like once you're like
stuff becomes a component react breaks
the ability to read and print and
serialize those things which is
unfortunate and if we had more like if
we if we owned the infrastructure there
we could do something more closure e
where those things stay symbolic as
opposed to become opaque objects and
also we want to ideally have something
that that normalizes primitives usually
defined components and functions into a
unique into a similar into a common
syntax so that we can factor more easily
if you haven't is a component becomes a
function or whatever you should have to
rewrite your code just because you
decided to use a piece of state or
because you decided add an optimization
so so markup is something that is still
not kind of not quite right it's
important we have it it's it's not
exactly set up right yet so let's see
you want our tour where where were we we
we've talked about the server side we've
talked about models controllers views we
skipped over builds and we got to talk
about style still so let's talk about
builds they're no fun even at a CI
company builds kind of suck we're hoping
to make it less sucky for you that's
that's we take that pain but it still
takes 80 seconds or so to build our
entire front end like a clean build
incremental builds are much better and
we're also on a pretty old version of
ohm and David's probably like shaking
his fist at me somewhere this is stuff
is really improving a lot but having all
this this magic on top and all these
cost compilers and all these things is
not free and this does get really pain
especially when you have teams and
changing dependencies and and all that
sort of stuff but asset builds are an
issue like I said an incremental bill to
include sugar faster the Google closure
compiler so little too slow but we
really want a better asset pipeline we
don't just build closure script we also
build style sheets and we built images
and we build also two different things
an SVG and we don't have a really good
story here we're using a library called
Stefan which was designed internally it
is also open source but it's sort of
died a little bit it's not really being
maintained it was trying to replace
sprockets and other stuff in the rails
world we really do need a build on
demand HTTP friendly asset pipeline
system that is closure script friendly
and now that the closure script compiler
and all the other folks working on great
tooling are are getting the foundation
in place I'm hoping somebody will step
up and produce like a world-class asset
build pipeline for the closure script
community and lastly we have to talk
about styles in terms of our tour Styles
are friggin terrible so we use less this
is basically the state of the art right
now is pre-processors this is just CSS
with concision it's shorter it's not
really any different than CSS like all
it's saving you is typing and we have
all this like great modularity that
we've gained in our components of the
view layer and we don't have that in
styles and so this is I disagree with
with earlier somebody said that like the
fetching data from the server is the
final frontier that's not true the the
style modularity problem is like the one
thing that we haven't figured out yet
and we only have not suffered from this
because Danny was doing such a great job
in the styles and once you add more
people this becomes really hard and so
we're not really sure what we're gonna
do about this now that we have we have
like more and more people coming to work
on the front end expression being open
source and everything and I guess that
basically concludes the tour of all the
technologies on our front end the
architecture etc I also promised that
I'd on Tiffa Kait a little bit so I want
to heart more on this modularity thing
we're on a quest for modularity in our
UIs
and we've come a long way in the
front-end space actually thanks to react
we're starting to see some more stuff
and we retarded with the databases
getting pulled into the front ends so
this was the desired architecture this
the archaic we had before and the desire
action we want is to shrink this down
into an individual component and then
build a tree of those where we take the
whole architecture we have now and
there's great big atom and squish it but
then also be able to do global
optimizations so with react we can get
global optimizations by doing equality
checks on our disks or whatever well we
can also do global optimizations for our
data fetching we don't have to rely on
the fact that we've centralized on a
page basis all of our data fetches so
where we want to be is we want to be in
a client database situation where all of
that non-determinism with the network is
packaged up into a nice little database
and then all the components fetch that
data on demand and then again put all
their their actions on to a queue and
the whole thing goes in a in a cycle of
cycles of cycles this may look familiar
this is Facebook's relay I live in the
future so I already know this was gonna
happen and basically all of that I'm
saying I think is a desired architecture
is crammed into that little components
block here those are the trees and this
is the model that they're talking about
they have the server that is intelligent
about the client with sticky sessions
they service graph QL queries that look
a lot like the atomic pull API request
they fill in a local data store of the
like the the social graph in their case
but whatever data you're gonna want in
your case that then drives rendering in
the recursive tree all those things put
up actions onto a queue that you
optimize the updates which we talked
about they go back to the server and the
whole cycle goes around this is a
brilliant brilliant design this needs to
happen in the closure community and it's
actually kind of sad we haven't done it
yet because we have all of the
technologies and ideas and ways to think
about it and do it and like it'd be so
much easier and better with closure
scripts of data structures then you
could ever do in JavaScript we just we
just need to as a community get on this
because this is the way things should
work but I want to put a putting a word
of caution here
which is that when you do this and you
make things more modular there are
sacrifices and trade-offs you have to
make and you don't want to rip out the
heart of ohm and the heart of the circle
architecture that we're doing which is
the fact that everything's transparent
and everything is just pure data when
you when you get encapsulation right you
lose transparency and so like I said
when you have those react views they're
opaque and we want them not to be opaque
we want them to be debuggable
inspectable etc and react recovers that
by giving you a little plug in in the
inspector where you can like drill in
and see the props and stuff but we
shouldn't have to do that we should be
able to have our modularity cake and eat
it too with all the transparency we've
come to expect and so we want to be able
to have externalized serializable
printable readable debuggable
transparent state we want all of our
events in a log and that's cute that is
data that's inspectable that's auditable
and we don't want to suffer from from
all the brain-dead stuff that
encapsulation has typically brought with
it by making your data hidden behind an
abstract interface so I think that the
closure community especially now that
we've had some exposure to how great
this react model can be I think that
we're uniquely positioned to take the
experiences from products like circle CI
and the front-end from all the great
work that's happening in the various
different closure script libraries out
there and repackage those ideas in the
flavor of closure with all the wonderful
other products going on and build
something that is an order of magnitude
simpler an order of magnitude faster and
an order of magnitude easier then a
typical front end we have all the pieces
we got to put them together and when you
have those all those modular components
that have global optimizations on render
global optimizations on data fetch that
talk to the server in a way where you
don't have to be every carefully
figuring out whether we have a REST API
and if I return 200 or 300 whatever who
cares we should be at a point where we
can build you eyes that are fast that
are beautiful that are modular that many
people can work on that can be updated
that are reliable and we
nothing more than the tools we already
have enclosure and so I think we can do
that as a community and I'd really like
to talk to anybody who's working on it
and beyond that that's basically all I
really wanted to share circles products
cool the codes out there go go try the
product with your github projects and
that run their unit tasks it's free to
get started and I think free for
open-source projects there's also the
cool stuff going on with the open source
project you can contribute there's bugs
to fix if you want to add features the
team is really responsive like sentiment
email chitchat with them they're hiring
and tell us what you think of our
architecture come talk to me and tell me
like how you think we can reach that
vision of a modular and simpler and
faster front-end architecture and like I
want to hear about the projects that you
guys are doing there and I thank you for
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
