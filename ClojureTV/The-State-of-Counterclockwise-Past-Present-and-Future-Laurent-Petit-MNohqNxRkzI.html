let me tell you that I'm really excited
and also refri tend to be here in front
of you I do my best sir program home
from Radio foreign will fix it will
switch back to the office
surface okay then so I'm franchisee
agenda first I will make some
presentation and then go through some
history figures i will have a specific
size but art installation and then we
will dive into the features and some
quick demonstrations to just try them
and then I talk about the future which
involves me and you think users and some
credits and then the session of
questions so my name is Laura patty I'm
French and when I decided to accept the
invitation and sometime soon my biggest
challenge would be to to speak English
magic now I i think that with only five
hours of sleep during the 30 last health
my biggest challenge will be to not fall
asleep during my own speech so I'm front
of closure since the early days and I'm
involved in controlling price in the
first quarter of two thousand eight but
maybe I I shall take I should tell what
eclipse is because I don't know if there
are a lot of eclipse reserve here who is
using image oh yes sir change so eclipse
is a multi-language to predator from the
wagon amount its graphical is primary
target has been shown in the JDM and
eclipse information is claiming having
Joseph users I was one of these users
and so I decided to to try to do
something for foreclosure inactives
quinton surprise is an eclipse extension
it's licensed under the APA and
sometimes is it's written CCW for short
but i will say just conjecture Christ
because tailoring a low c 0 value is not
shorter so to slice for introducing mode
control clockwise neck is an ex AC plug
in helping developers write code why an
eclipse spring and wine moon so because
i want to target a large piece of java
developers and i want to make it
possible for me to develop closure on my
next page of a project and sir i decided
to tutor it and there was driving force
which commuting me to do this writing
the first quarter of the 2008 because i
had a new job with where i was writing
eclipse plugin so it was something like
a win-win but our group is true is very
challenging to write ID plugins and
maybe that's something i did not want to
to give to my users and simplicity is
some what's relative and with control
professor I'm trying to do two things at
the same time and sometimes difficult
but I have a changing user base which
pushes things beyond what beyond the
current stage of the odds so first it
begins with installing the just of the
plugin and I want it just to tell you
that it's really easy to
just install it and try to forget it if
you really over anyclip so installed
it's really really easy and I wanted it
to be like this because even if people
are going to go in test and work with
closure the first approach will be
through maybe so clicking so it must be
a good impression for them because
somehow we like it or not it may be also
a nutrition on the long range itself so
if you have a clip this a no brainer
parents are already very difficult for
new people to grasp let the true just
get out of the way and of course the
challenge is to to provide an intuitive
dynamic experience even within heavy
heavy flow a black eclipse is so now
we'll just to fix right under history so
at least was started in early two
thousand eight bytes Katie mushroom it
was first named closure tab but then the
name was taken by rich so I switched to
another great name which was suggested
to me by Kristen calm and George I
joined the team an October and for
personal affairs Casey left very very
quickly and I got the de facto leader
sheep or sponsor manga since then so
there is no marketing behind controller
price it's open source it's donal treat
it's written free time but some figures
during the last ten ten months there has
been around two thousand euros per month
for the fuzzy home page from about 400
different visitors and we travel
regularly revisiting the site every
crater of them every month so I told
about installation so maybe I may be
wrong precise if you were the last
version of eclipse which is 336 Helios
comes an interesting tool for
discovering new plugins so where's this
new restaurant who just hit the help
menu Eclipse marketplace when your item
and then you search for foreclosure on
course not for contractual prize in
particular you find contractor price you
can't stand it it's just a matter of
donating this megabytes of content so
now let's talk about the features so
I've split the slide into into several
features and I will try to to do a
finance description of what words what
still needs improvements and what is
missing and I will not tell you about
all the things of amazing bottom the
most important running in my point of
view so the editor has already syntactic
generation but in fact it's not really
syntactic it token-based as a lot of
editors which claim to being syntactic
with an exception for my parents which
is a refuge to show how deep you are in
these things of the parents it's a it's
really interesting feature that in a
savvy i also have and around the corner
is a true syntactic federation with food
yourself
function because we are not using a
library from christian prayer which he
told about this model which is named
parsley and when the rivalry becomes
truly incremental it will be possible to
to be very fast even in an editor there
are good parts in contract law class
which have been stolen from in us I want
to speak about structural edition
comments it's based on parity dot en we
already have almost yes eighty percent
of the current which have been floated
to pure eclipse and good factor but it
is that totally independent of eclipse
have written this as independent project
which happens just to be used by only
CCW frankly we all really have work in
chapter definition when you're on a
closure on a closure of all you just
have to disk the environment to be
available in a running record and if it
is there in the report if it if the
namespace contains enough the van has
already been loaded it will work as
expected and we also have orientation
which is a feature which was
long-awaited from very most users it
currently is very predictable because
it's very simple but it works so now for
some some things we which are already
working but maybe not totally you not as
i would like to the risk odd condition
is contact ragazzi it works correctly
with closure chopped event works it was
each it works for java social engine
revs but there are some embodiments 222
it to work jointly currently it works by
during the full search in
projects class pass so it it's it's you
you you you can be assured that you will
spot the photometer you're searching for
but it's really slow so we'll try some
some more focused heuristics in the
future and program with this is that
closure by being functional promotes
putting the method name first and then
the target so we have little context to
to help the user find which meter he is
really looking for because we don't even
know anything generally about the types
first we have written a direction
currencies table we have documentation /
resort report interaction command I'm
not talking about the report but about
the interaction is a report so we are
the first set of send this piece of code
to the river which we've two evaluations
and the top levels and the whole five we
have documentation over which is around
the corner we have a code outline which
is a just aesthetic view sorry of what
is in your editor and there are two big
missing features yet formatting fool for
the full source code file formatting but
somehow awhile since we have autonation
it's not so bad and we have some
interaction with report emails which are
missing and I'm thinking about the major
expansion comin so maybe we'll do just a
quick demo of focused feature just to
see how it looks like Chris
counterclockwise
I know that I'm not named neuropathy
from so I did have no uncle would make
it but I had already chosen my example
and in the orbit project i will be doing
when a bit basic stuff i will just show
you how i try to at the same time be
user friendly for the newcomers
especially because these newcomers will
come from mainly from eclipse being
already eclipsed users so sweet they
don't have to think oh it's a
phrenologist and it's also a fringe
editor I don't understand what I'm doing
when I typed or perennials during wounds
and swim and I'm not used to so there is
a different mode which does not break
the users have it it's ill it's less
powerful curse so we have a strict mode
which is a mixed free guided model which
will help you have code which is always
correctly stretcher so let took maybe
this function sighs by mass and we will
just be writing it in the different man
and then in the structure in an in a
strict one ok so we've here we are in
the different now so in the different
note when I rewrite this function
what the editor is doing is just
entering what I'm typing nothing the
challenge here was to be able to still
have the correct passing of the source
code even the face of incorrect
incorrect code ok so this was easy what
does it look like in the street much
rice which may be okay then when I when
I hit the clothes ignorant has has been
added
same thing for other kinds of pizza
rolls
okay and maybe some sometimes because
it's easier to read new through a new
expressions I live closing current which
is not on the same time i don't i see no
no problem with that myself but when I i
finished sometimes I run to too quickly
to quickly bring clothes all this
correctly when I know the strict mode
the first time I hit the closing paren I
jump to the concentrate I jump to the
end of the zipper ends expression and I
reckon isn't automatically it's
something which is well known by you max
with no such choice and do not return
having invented anything in is a barrier
so this was due to show you that the
different body is not an impediment for
new users and I want to show you some
under you structural inch increments
from the reserves from the Eclipse and
CCW user base so in fact even on a
teapot
there are a lot of commands which will
work with eruption this command are just
not bummed to regular cheese but you
have to to combine our shortcuts so for
example if I'm not really sure that this
miserly working I really want to try the
sky over the expressions so i can just
use three traditional selection
this you will be able to see which which
keys i am typing so for structural
addition i will just hit the combination
of kids which is well known by several
users within eclipse and then the up
arrow will select the enclosing
expression if i continue with your
camera I CXC inclusion inclusion and
file if I've been to form I just hit the
down arrow and the selection regions if
i run the siblings I could have right
and when I hit the end and go up so now
i am selecting my expression and if i am
in the default mode if I feel something
maybe I don't know see open parenthesis
of course it's a replacement comment but
if I am in the structural condition
then hitting enter we'll just wrap the
expression when it is divided it's just
a matter of risings child expression
over the parents so I hate as rice at
Earth and it gets out of the way
so actually is American structure-based
elation right over maybe one more word
about split joint sometimes its response
resting to two other requires outside
uns because you do know directive an
agile development but then sometimes you
also want to to have them go back so you
can go between two selection and ten the
teller counter clockwise to georgies
fashion and chain for example or you can
do the opposite you can split the
expression okay so back to the set of
features now I will talk about an easy
feature because the project management
feature is some sick which is directly
by by idiots like NT DJ and neck veins
or or eclipse so here's a challenge is
not to try to reinvent the wheel and to
use what is already present so that's
what ha I have done and it's easier to
do multi project work within conductor
price because the class pass is in a
rigid by the difference of eclipse so
when you start new revenue during a
retro racing which is in jars which is
an external jurors orbiting within other
projects which are declared to be
depended upon by your project and that's
it
now something more interesting it's
about interactive depth features its
orbit so we already have a ribbon which
currently is based on the yemeni Turbots
enhancements of the janitors so the
report is is working with plain or java
project pretty well but it is somehow
limited in scope because it first use a
project was charged with the closure
that man or the country bleep rln
library so it forces you to have it it
injects main class which is a repaired
class so it's a it's currently a severe
limitation of the released controller
prevention because by doing sir we
cannot work correctly with other kind of
projects wgp judo GWT eclipse project
development so the development of
control clock right itself and it's also
limited in scope because because really
currently we are cheating we are using
the plain old java to install within
eclipse and its features of accepting
user user commands and so it's just
connected to input output so we don't
have plain text edition what i would
have to tell that to you if I had not
something in my bag and indeed there is
a brand new ipad which is around the
club so if you don't know to contact us
today or tomorrow you won't have you
won't see this but i will show you when
i go to the demon so this is not my work
is based on chess amalric rip and reaper
clients around library which is a new
repair which is intended to to be used
by a by most ideas in the future and
regretfully worked on the porch and the
integration of these clients of what I
vary with in Kentucky rise each wailing
a bird as if you know enclosure it
winning about what enclosure already has
in superior to be sure but for the
people we do not know i will give you
some more detail so basically you you
really be able to connect to any rating
ship to gvm it does not have to be
launched from within eclipse so
currently you you just tell the the the
server and approach and it connects to
it the very interesting thing is that it
will be able to work with any kind of
project we will be entrepreneurial with
with this notion we will not have to
build new rappers for launching
configurations over every new kind of
project which happens to work on the JVM
so this is really really interesting and
it has already a richer set of features
and i'm currently working on protein or
with chess in fact we were sharing the
same code as the editor also we have
closed structural edition code
completion is in progress navigation
commands etc the logs are will be
colorized the history of what web type
that what have been returned back by the
by the server we will have the ability
of course to record previously entered
commands and the camera is a true
multi-language attorney addition you can
go to to the first time if you made a
mistake it's really just a text area
button okay so we'll do a creative all
for showing interactivity it will not be
really interested just to show you how
it will look like in the next release of
conductor price
hello world
so I
I take the project through to to to run
within a new jvm and to load the file
which is selected
ok and here is a Eureka it's taking some
work but it's already working for the
basic use cases so for example I can
call ahead 0 and I'm go to the next line
and if I hit ctrl enter and I now have
an exception because I should have place
namespace to change in a bit ok so
that's it other comments below work of
course so if i change the definition of
hello i can send it back and then
it works again right
oh yes something I haven't I haven't
spoken about in the previous slides is a
namespace browser it's been an
interesting feature and I wouldn't like
you to to miss it it there it's if you
have the outline I've spoken about it
it's a static view of what you have in
the in the editor it's interesting but
here it's a dynamic view of what is
loaded in the river it's organized by
namespaces and you can do some interest
and serve can go have documentation /
you can double-click to go directly to
the definition in the in the editor and
you can find with regular expression
like things for example I know I want to
play with namespaces and I know it
starts with Venice and then I I have a
filtered view of where the function
starting with an s star it's also rose
by fat by searching inside the
documentation okay
so a few more words on other features we
have already integration with the
debugger things to Crystal Graham who
provided the saccade to place break
bones currently just leave a rich is the
classic Eclipse integration devagar
still a bit unstable needs more work but
already working if you want to go step
by step in code so let's talk about the
future so there are some things I'm
working currently by night through the
future the editor me quickly have jumped
to definition for java documentation
over both Jonah and closure hopefully
and sometimes throw some tax base
coloration especially for locals so that
you know that you're overriding some
global or not when you on your right
project management I told about it and
the repair line so George about it in
net there are some futures I think about
when I'm under the show so don't expect
them to to be the next release but
pretty soon I I hope refactoring
features because T crayford has started
an interesting closure refactoring
project it's totally independent of the
ID but it's also reusable in any ID even
you have i've seen some emails
differences but i hope there are only
dev dependencies and beyond this project
i also hope to provide bidirectional
java closure
choice I mean if you're into java de
Toron you gentle name of a metered that
I can there are hooks in Eclipse to to
say a geometer changing and I change the
name ins or relevant closure fights yes
it seems to be possible we'll see and I
also intend to to try to integrate
wizard hat so clever debugging tools
which is very impressive from within
emacs I have hope that it would be also
impressive from within eclipse and there
are some features are you just dreaming
about it because we do not just monkeys
so basically the same as probability
would be the first that is more running
over wat so is currently given as a
feedback by the compiler so for example
helping enforcing co-insurance detect
potential Berg's have people right I
dramatic closure pure but it's not a
hurry for me because there is a change
for there is a closure enclosure project
which may be a game changer in this area
soil I go slow and see what went wrong
what is coming and hopefully use our
suggestions by by leveraging some some
ways to to analyze the habits refer
heuristics and the hat practice is not
to to be a failure in this era as as
have it has been frozen for other
graphically in terms so it will i'll try
to be non invasive ok so now it is not
about features its missile on
miscellaneous set of of things i would
like to to be doing
future I attempt to introduce the
contributor agreement because a project
is beginning to grow and to protect the
projects with Scott itself and also to
protect a little bit my interesting
being the sponsor and still being able
to to manipulate a project as a whole I
will I will best something on what rich
has done for closure so I intend to just
to just copy and paste the closure
contributor agreement and swithin names
so that's in the five switch to semantic
versioning that just for the users
because currently just a conference not
easy to see if there is a risk to break
things by updating CCW started by being
mostly written in jargon it was not
really very interesting so slowly we are
leaning towards more and more CCW post
written enclosure and we are suffering
from not being able to have the same
dynamic interactivity we are offering to
our users so the repair integration will
also be the occasion to to embed a
repair with inside Eclipse so I'm not
yes I will not have to start in eclipse
which is a target of Testament I will
test inside the recusal running Eclipse
and we also intend to open the door to
more contributors Israel deaths all
users devs because currently is not that
easy to to start from scratch with
described as there are lot of stuff that
are not written so I've taken the points
of Technology in this area and also
users we will open a better a bit
site and we of course have in mind how
we could open the plug into users so
that they can provide an experiment with
contributions for enhancing CCW for
example we will probably open the the
closure program so that it can do some
stuff we haven't even thought about yet
okay but I'm speaking about conductor
price in the beginning and you think
it's a solo single person different
right it is not so i will give some
credits credits because we it's
something we share with contributors so
to name just a few Chaz America recently
but also crystal drawn kasemir shot
Stephanie special it's also birds reuse
cut Iraq with enclosure provided some
pieces of code for the cut condition i
bought the purse lease or scott purser
from crystal group which is the building
block of the structural additional i've
been working with a a V on closure osgi
and it's a project which is really
quickly growing and which is trying to
give a real closure and osgi story and
its really interesting and I've changed
recently is the way the dependences I've
done within the multiple the controller
class begins by using it and it's
working pretty well and also the brand
new and wipro library of course so
credits about sharing about reusing and
also about giving back so currently I've
started from scratch the parity dot CLG
which is a portal
nor did not air is pure pleasure it has
few dependencies it's just closure
closure contrib and parsley and
basically is just project with a
dependency on closure so it's really
short library and it can be used outside
eclipse it's already used by closure by
factoring by the way and I'm also
currently working on the closure tremors
and I have had some person which asked
to make it an excellent project and it's
on its way but don't rush to in place
because it's in intermediate state and I
trailer really not happy with how the
closure grammar is rich and currently
it's just happens to work ok so this
light is more for the people which will
provoke the reception presentation from
the internet and now if you are some
Christian please speak slowly so I can
understand them
