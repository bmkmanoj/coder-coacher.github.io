everyone and welcome my presentation for
this lightning talk is the parses right
using closure and closure script to
examine the structure of English
basically a brief summary of work I've
done in the past year to write an app
that I've named Macaulay no not that
Macaulay this Macaulay this is a picture
of James David Macaulay he was professor
of linguistics at the University of
Chicago and one of the leading theorists
of syntax of natural language in the
20th century he passed away in 1999 of a
sudden heart attack at the age of 61 he
was a teacher of mine and it's in his
memory that I've named the app you're
about to see in his memory macaulay your
computer developers so you use the word
syntax in your everyday vocabulary but
syntax when it comes to linguistics and
particularly when it comes to natural
language has a slightly different
meaning it specifically refers to the
study of the rules where by words or
other elements of sentence structure or
combine to form grammatical sentences to
elaborate on that a little bit everyone
knows that words can be classified as
parts of speech the canonical noun verb
adverb adjectives and so on those parts
of speech can be assembled into
structures given the rules of the syntax
of English running a quick example short
example in fact the shortest example in
the king james version of the English
Bible book of John chapter 11 verse 35
two words jesus wept everyone knows
Jesus is a noun wept as a verb well
English has a rule that says that a noun
and a verb can combine to form a
sentence in fact that is the rule right
up there noun + verb equal sentence and
that's just one of a host of different
rules that the syntax of English has to
basically take words and their parts of
speech to be fit together to create
tree-like structures and that's what
Macaulay does but talk a little bit
about the tech behind this in this tech
talk we have an API back end with a web
endpoint that's written enclosure
specifically invoking ring and composure
and also particularly using
the natural language parser that was
written at Stanford University from the
core natural language processing NLP
group as they're called and that's
written in Java and it turns out that
that also plays nice with closure that
takes text as an input and I've written
the app so that the backend API so it
delivers a JSON object is output that
JSON object is then passed through an
HTML front-end involving which written
enclosure script taking that as input
and delivering back javascript as output
is particularly JavaScript written with
the d3 graphics library using our good
friends reagent and fig wheel as part of
the process so they run through this
very quickly taking our example jesus
wept goes through a web back-end that
looks something like this and it
delivers back an ex express excuse me
move too far go ahead an s expression it
looks like that shout out locally turns
out that things like this the N NP and
BBD those are Penn tags or pen part of
speech tags a shout out to the
University of Pennsylvania linguistics
department they created the taxonomy of
36 different parts of speech that this
parser uses so we've got a bit of a
local connection it's used in this app
and you can actually see the constituent
relations that's what the part of the
parentheses the limit so you know what
is what as far as this constituent
arrangement is concerned that as this
question goes into another closure
closure function that delivers a JSON
object like you see below that then goes
as input into the closure script d3
library and the output looks something
like this complete with colors and
drawings and parts of speech and much
easier to be able to read and parse so
that's kind of neither can draw trees
but who cares well actually you should
care it turns out you can do a lot more
than just analyze trees there are
actually some applications that are at
play here for example you can actually
use the trees that are generated in the
colony to more intelligently search for
words and their immediate surrounding
context one cut one example that I could
bring up here among others sentiment
analysis turns out you can actually take
words that you're
searching for look within the search
parameters of other words that Barry
that bear positive or negative sentiment
within that tree be able to compare the
two and be able to analyze that more
broadly another example it turns out you
can actually also use Macaulay or
basically the data delivered back by
Macaulay to help to diagnose the risk
and likelihood of neurodegenerative
diseases there's been research done here
that it turns out that the number of
idea bearing nodes as they're called
which actually are correlated to parts
of speech and the percentage of that for
every 10 words that you speak or read it
turns out has an uncanny correlation to
the likelihood of dementia and
Alzheimer's disease more details and all
of these are in the presentation i gave
last month before the chicago closure
meet up the video is on youtube do a
search for the parse is right closure
for a presentation where i go into this
in much more depth you wanted to look at
the code the code i am happy to report
is online backend API front-end HTML
excuse me front-end HTML and a bulk
processor that takes data for as a text
file delivers it out sentence by
sentence and delivers out trees for each
sentinels and statistics there in now if
talk let's see the app in action sign up
a bit so he looks like this you'll have
a number of buttons and so if you take a
sentence like this and paste it in here
and then parse it out
animation you also have a battery of
statistics here one more example a
little longer one of the irony it is
wrong to say that text is unstructured
when there is a great deal of structure
and text and we do ourselves no favor to
ignore the lessons it can teach us
and we are a time that concludes my
lightning talk thank you very much for
your time and attention good morning
everyone so today I'm going to talk
about a non an ivory to deal with a Java
JDBC so so you might ask this question
why why the Bible India amount of Java
JDBC told attendees in library to deal
with database we have it coming we
already have a lot of neighbors for why
yes that's pretty much so we are we have
been using all of my berries gradually
and then switch from one library to a
non library so the library come up with
is pretty much based based on our
experience and then their pupils who are
trying to solve and end up we come out
up with in your library so really
natural right so let's take a look at a
coat so now so let's take a look at code
and then how we explain why we need
another library and why I'm is neither
is it might be helpful for you as well
so firstly query the database the only
thing we worry about two tins first
wines not query the second thing is in
the parameter fallen for it because your
curry needs to be harmonized so this
library basically need to provide a
macro for use and you can basically
supported a very stream provide a
chlorine and the parameter that's less
only thing you need and then after now
that you will be able to call this
function directly and then by using the
database connection
so let's a single query and then and
also in the paramedic in the Kuiper can
have that type of location this isn't it
becomes a little bit better because the
Lord some of the arsenic types but if
you don't not have you enjoy when the
type doesn't stop from here so it gets
nearly better and I wasn't a type
support a very complex might as well
make you support a ring because in the
case were you need to pass a lease of ID
into a database query as a parameter and
even do now so that one nice thing about
is why is with me sorry you don't need
to kind of dynamic e Jeremy very will
generate the question marking or sequel
stream so Nets you basically is finding
this very go directly to Niseko
statement so and then you can just
passing that re as a parameter and one
nice thing about this one's a lot of
library right now the deal with
parameters they parsing most of them
just create a function that function
will take a arbitrary map button there's
no way you can guarantee the map has met
exactly structure you want so which
caused a lot of problems in our code
base so yeah so by going through this
way there's no way I can mess up with
the parameter because in the feminist
ordered and they will be checked at a
time when the cold distant power so
let's take keep going and then also some
so in the second part is about a result
set and once you you can you can pass
any parameter you can run the query then
you need to deal with the result set so
result said and also you can provide an
optional
so that it can we provide the library
provide a bunch of functions and an egg
if you know the result set with the only
one real partner you can say single and
if in case nip and is not a one record
with mike is written more than one red
corner you were through exception and
also you can say okay I only keep on
Chris ryokan engine to say okay Roseanne
uniquely offers to change a similar to
the first you can ever and also if we
have our very complex in physics energy
needs to handle that lead officer before
it returns you can also provide your own
function over here it can basically it
takes keyword and also function as well
so let's let's fountain this part and
also test so for database I don't like
to write test for theta this query so
112 thing about the libraries you don't
need to write a query test for your
period anymore so you basically just
miss one line of code and your whole
lame space anything in your namespace
any Korean your living space will be you
also need to provide evidence test
database connection function and then
you will get to post user to the
database server and Uncas run and they
can vary find a correctness of the
sequel statement that means you don't
need to write one app called all your c4
gets just tested so then let's come back
to you asked about why we need in this
library because first thing is you get a
compile-time check for a cleric a mental
and also when are passing sequel
statement at all it's basically you pass
and see what's the min is no way you can
make the pass right and for when are
contaminating is evil so obviously no
also testing is so
so if you still not convinced Ness the
10 state one function i got from
alcohol-based as you can see there are
three ginza query and the one simple
statements i don't think any any other
kind of library any any of name
librarian a try to pass a seaborne is no
waiting again is kind of compacts impact
but I where everyone could understand
that very over here because it basically
this listo parameter and the sequel
statement and a you seek or you can give
it to anyone who understands Epona will
be able to provide us even for you so
yeah let's this about a library and then
listener we have a project thanks to
awkward time good morning my name is
Eric shawl I am a software developer
atomic object in Grand Rapids Michigan
and besides drawing sketch notes of
conference talks I also make a lot of
small in browser web apps with closure
script so an in-browser web app is
exactly what it sounds like it's
actually more of a single page
application or client-side application
than what usually goes by that name
these don't have any server backends
they don't talk to anything that will
have any routing or the application any
authentication and they are really quite
simple they're more you I experiments
you board game helpers GPS data
visualizations compact calendars
manufacturing line simulations geometry
sketch pads and for a long time I did
apps like this in d3 which d3 is a great
library but it is not necessarily very
good for managing the state of your
entire application it it keeps a lot of
state and it keeps it in the DOM and it
becomes very difficult to manage that in
the transition between arbitrary states
and so I started looking for a better
alternative paradigm for building the
sort of apps that i tend to build so a
good place to look for alternative ideas
is the Elm programming language it's a
functional reactive programming language
and about a year and a half ago it
introduced a way of rendering HTML pages
and the library that it used did Dom
dipping and patching but it did not use
react j/s instead it used a library
called virtual Dom which is a standalone
JavaScript library that implements the
Dom dipping and patching that you find
in react but without any of the other
stuff that react has there's no
component and the various other things
so the Elm library for doing HTML
implemented that and it introduced what
it referred to as the Elm architecture
they'll market texture is very simple
you have a model which is a centralized
representation of your application State
not unlike home next it is passed to a
pure view function which produces a
virtual Dom tree that virtual Dom tree
is compared to the previous virtual Dom
tree in order to generate a list of
patches to apply to the actual Dom and
then bring it up to speed well you can't
see down at the bottom there is an
action that can get produced at any time
either by user actions or other
processes and that triggers an update to
the model which then kicks off the whole
process again to bring the Dom up to
date with new state so it's a very
simple model allen being a functional
reactive language has signals and since
closure script has for a sink it has
channels which means we have a something
of a stand-in for signals they're not
quite the same but they'll work in this
case so I thought what if I implement
this Elm architecture enclosure script
how do i find that for implementing you
know simple applications so here's a
render function generator this is a
function which takes an element and then
returns a function that takes virtual
Dom trees calculates the diffs the
patches and applies them and then it's
all within a function closure which
keeps track of the state between calls
to the function that it returns Elm uses
a function called fold p which is in
essence a channel
channel form of reduce it takes an
update function initial model and an
input channel of actions and anytime a
new action comes in it passes that
action and the current state of the
model to the update function and
produces a new model which is then put
on the output channel this is an example
of the step function this is an update
function it gets the model in the action
it uses core match to dispatch what to
do given a particular action in this
case the actions are just simple
keywords that they can also be
parameterised and you can do nothing you
can change the model you can trigger
actions that have nothing to do with the
model and they're just side effects and
then your application setup down here at
the bottom is just create a channel for
your actions an initial model create a
channel of model using both feet and
then you can use poor async map function
to turn that channel of models into a
channel of virtual Dom trees and that
gets passed to a render function which
just uses the renderer I should be
earlier underneath to take virtual bomb
trees from that channel and apply the
changes to that element so this has a
few advantages over what I was doing
before in particular it's simple so it's
easy to keep the whole thing in your
head at one time you know what the whole
system is doing its encourages a
bottom-up data driven design just like
Mark talked about on Monday afternoon
it's very good at under renewed history
because all of your application stages
in one place you can even implement a
time traveling it's just a minute like
Elmas demonstrator that works with fig
wheel it can work with deb card with a
little extra work and it's a minimal the
property based testing so I've enjoyed
working with it
it's a lot easier to get up to speed
with an application and get doing what
you really want to be doing instead of
having to monkey around with some water
architecture or library and if you're
interested in the code it's on github
and creatively and be done and that's
all thank
as you said my name is olas de Austin
this is my first time only talk about
cloud orchestration enclosure and you
might wonder what is that and that's
describing your cloud infrastructure is
some kind of code so you can repeat it
and things like that so here's a sample
from a sure how they have their set up
their set up for their there for for
their better machines and all of their
things that's in JSON and then amazon
what you might have seen if you've used
amazon is the my cloud formation which
is I couldn't find a small example of
this so I just made it go the whole
thing and run over so it's very long and
very nested Jason so I needed to do
something like this for my project and I
wanted to be enclosure and also I didn't
want to do the same thing for great for
amazon and then do the same thing Asher
and I want to do the same thing
definitely you know and if sue calorie
can be lazy that you've been to be lazy
too but I'm told he's not really lazy so
so there is a standard fault Oscar which
is a mouthful from train you say it so
topology and arbitration specification
for cloud application so classic of
which is your say so it's a standard
kind of like how you think Ishmael is
standard so here's here's Tosca it's
curly in draft form and it outputs in to
gamble and here's what it looks like and
so I made a closure library for
so this is the task like BMO a lot of
nesting of everything seems to pull and
so I I didn't want to write all this all
the time so I wrote a library called clj
Tosca which is the open-source last week
for my project and we use the fitting
operator so it's very easy to build up
your you're all your properties for all
your things and we can export it to
format your life so there's again what
which is a standard and what we wanted
to pass it into different apps and so I
made it also export to JSON and they'll
like it Eden so here's Eden and I was
talking to Dave out there and he says
well why not transit so I have something
what to do this weekend
so the project is still Jay tosca
unclothed ours and feedback and
contributions is welcome and no lyst oh
and I'm from Austin like I think they've
got cut office my blog is closure geek
the same as my
alright thanks knowing and our next talk
is about coach ours and this is from
Toby Carly good morning thank you I've
got about 70 slide so I'm going to go
really really quickly so I'm gonna talk
to you guys about closure on Toby so
we're going to talk about where we're
close ours is now closed ours is for
better or worse if Lee has become a
critical component in our ecosystem and
so currently there's one administrator
that's me too in day-to-day you know
dealing with issues his administration
deletion requests it's on one box we
have backups of it that's one box
alignment instance currently Alex
Osborne who is the creator of closure
ours he still pays the bills even though
he doesn't do closure anymore he's not
part community more than still putting
the bill for this thing and it works
most of the time right not many
complaints but before we get the next
part of the talk I want to say something
like this isn't doom and gloom right
what I'm going to talk about is the
state it's been in the state it's in
it's been there for a couple years right
and it's still still works right but
things need to improve so let's talk
about where closure needs to go where I
think it needs to go how we can get
there I think we need to make some
changes to make it a robust sustainable
system and I don't mean just the
application itself it needs to be more
robust but we need the organization
around that at people around that
be a sustainable thing so how do we do
that what does that mean well there's a
small potato stuff there's
administration right so be nice if there
was some people that were a backstop to
me to the administration a few weeks ago
I got to see with my kids we ran on a
disk space so Jones was down for five
hours I couldn't do thing about it it'd
be nice we had some help you know fixing
bugs dealing with issues then we have
the watermelon size issues and that's
funding the infrastructure that's
ideally being able to pay for the
infrastructure so Alex's have to and I
would love to have enough money to
contract out some larger pieces to make
it more robust and I don't have time to
go in detail what themselves odd ideas
how we can make it more of a system then
there's the prize-winning pumpkin and
that is having some kind of legal entity
around khlo jars that can deal with a
corporate sponsorship and can make this
thing sustainable and by sustainable I
mean where we actually people that work
on it actually get paid right because
it's such a critical piece that if it
goes down I mean it's worked so far
right it's work well but but as the
community grows that's more more people
to be impacted if this thing goes away
right so how can you help us get there
well fit small potato stuff if you have
time you want to be an administrator I'd
love to talk to you about that if you
want to write code and work on clothes
yours Nelson Morris who was the previous
administrator he knows the system really
really well he's been doing a lot of
work lately on modernizing the code base
using component
so now it's actually much easier to get
into now than it was before the
watermelon stuff you can now give me
money at so I've set up where you can
donate money it goes into a bounty
source account and we can use that me
hosting you can use that if we have
enough to do some contract work it would
be great if we could do corporate
sponsorship stuff but that doesn't
happen yet doesn't that what that's
going to happen until we have a legal
entity around khlo charge of some sort
so the entity the pumpkin in the room
the I don't know how to do this I don't
have time to do this right so that's
where I need help I don't know if this
needs to be a company taking over
closure on a company formed around it
ideally I think it would be a non-profit
I think since his community resource to
be great if it was a non-profit I know
Daniel Solano Gomez are you in the room
so he's done a bunch of work on trying
to get a closure Community Foundation
started a nonprofit that would be a good
fit for this but I don't know where that
is right now and ideally for this to be
sustainable I think that people to work
on I should get paid to work on closures
and I think that it would be great if we
had the resources to pay folks had
worked on the past Nelson Phil hey
Goldberg Alex Osborne's put a ton of
time alex has put a bunch of money into
it be great if they could get
compensated for that somehow this is you
know what I want to do but so if you
have ideas about how to do this I'd love
for you to get involved if you want to
do
that too so if you're not involved
there's the maintainer list you can join
that that's where a sensibly discussions
around clerk will happen and do happen
and if you want to want to contribute
either the code or money there's a
contribute link now in the footer
closures out of work you can put there
and get a ticket to a wiki page which
talks about cover some of what I've
covered today and will also give you a
link into being able to donate money
that's it thank you very much so
greetings my name is Ryan Haney I online
i'm known as yoshi quest that's the
github right there I'll go ahead and say
that straight away because I have like
no issues and stuff like that we really
need help on that thing but I'm just
going to jump straight into this thing
just because so let's say that I'm
assuming here that most of you know what
minecraft is will have at least heard of
it it is a game that's actually written
in Java so as such there's a big modding
community around it and because because
of that I decided why not make it so
that you can modify minecraft enclosure
so let's say that we want to add a block
let's say death block I can't spell
today let's call it a conch block and
we'll give it an edit a block name of
that hmm kanj black
and let's just give it a texture name of
I think like a challenge odd colon and
then it was and then we need to specify
a creative tabs that we can actually get
to the blocking game so let's do
creative tabs flesh look and I think
that's all you really need in order to
create a simple block so from there we
need to go and we need up if you just
run this this won't actually be able to
do anything because we don't have a mod
yet so first of all let's go ahead and
create our mods initialization functions
that we can actually create a mod so
let's say common in it and then we'll
register oh it takes an instance of the
mod and that current events that it
passes this is on top of the minecraft
forge API which is what minecraft uses
so let's register college block and then
give it a give it up ID of college block
because I'm lazy and then after that we
finally go into our core and from here
we just do def mod this is probably my
favorite macro that I've ever written if
mud and we'll call give it the name
space and that conch mod core give it
your mod name we'll just call a conch
mod give it the version number 0 point 0
point 1 and then now we just specify our
common proxy or in other words will it
be run on both the client and server
there's a client proxy thing though I'll
probably have to like write a post about
it later or something it's a bit more in
depth depth than we have time for so
we'll go so we'll make a common proxy of
common / of yoshi quest com
I'm law common / common and nits and i
forgot that i need that but this in
another map and specify that this is the
ended function because there's there's
an it's those pre in its and they're
supposed to knit it's just different
phases assistant so i think that's
pretty much it so once you actually have
your mod ready I want to go into dev /
cons mod you'll want to go into the
other workspace for us and you'll want
to run / Gradle w yes it uses minecraft
forge uses Gradle I didn't have much of
a choice in this much thought / cradle w
run client and now it'll take a little
bit while minecraft forge in combination
with closure ask if you ever heard of
that library which allows closure files
to be compiled and Gradle Italy be used
with closure Asking combination in order
to build the respective files re office
gate the code and a variety of other
things and assuming I didn't screw this
up it should work it could take a little
while exists the first time we run today
but bring it last night a test but yeah
this is Warren see there ok there it
goes now it's compiling and it crashed
oh my gosh darn it what did i do Don oh
it I did I did the wrong thing it was
let me check my test market oh man see I
should have like made it back up or
something box it's blocked texture name
oops so okay see that'll do it and now
it shouldn't take as long to do it this
time because it's already done it once
but yeah this is more of a proof of
concept I suppose it can actually do a
lot more than just adding a simple block
I mean there's like a dozen other things
like custom rendering and BTW data
custom items just see there cuz see now
it's actually running so that's great
there's just a lot of stuff that this
can do it's just that not a lot of
people really know that it exists i
guess so then let's go here contest will
open this up and i'll just show you that
assuming i did things rights in building
blocks yep we have a little college walk
in places there you go as you can see i
just successfully implement a closure in
Minecraft and you can just do whatever
the heck you want from there I guess I
mean and this is just a simple proof of
concept I mean there's a like I said
before there's a lot more things that
this can do and there's a lot more
things that I need to implement as well
like entities GU is a lot of various
other things and all the bugs they need
to fix too so yeah this was just a proof
of concept and show you that it exists
again the github is Yoshi quest for stat
clj that is the API that this is built
on top of and i'll probably post the
