they are not unions and I promise I'll
describe what that means this is my info
if you want to find me on the Internet
so just to get something out of the way
I'm not talking about variance if you've
heard of covariance and contravariance
that's not what this talk is about don't
worry if you haven't I'm also not going
to talk about polymorphism I'm not going
to bore you with Java subclasses and and
interface methods this is a this is
actually a different pattern that we can
that we can use today so there's a bit
of a chicken and egg problem with
variance with teaching variance because
this is a question of what what are they
and why why should we even use them so I
ask for a little bit of patience while I
sort of get from one to the other I
promise you we will get there so here's
the agenda we're gonna start with a
short interim just gonna give you a
taste of what they look like we're gonna
go into a realistic example and see how
you might use them or and why you might
use them we're going to talk about types
for just a little bit how did how to do
this stuff with core.typed and then
we're going to talk about the difference
between closed and open variance and
then if we have time we're going to talk
about how to store this stuff in atomic
so I'm really excited let's go so first
some confessions about Who I am
I'm not actually a list person you will
I was introduced to closure through work
as sort of a viable alternative to Ruby
for work but as far as hobbies go you'll
generally find me in the the Haskell and
ML crowd and variants are actually a
pattern that that come from these
languages and I want to reassure
everyone that I'm not going to try and
shove types down everyone's throat even
though I think types are really super
cool and you should all look into using
them so don't worry so why am I here I'm
here because closure is the first
dynamic language that I've encountered
it's
really flexible to make this work most
other dynamic languages have some really
unfortunate syntax choices and the the
lack of macros make it really kind of
impossible to backport this pattern and
and and discovering this technique and
and working with ambrose and and some
other people to sort of find it was the
moment that that I realized that cloture
could actually work for me I'm a
language developer so I design and build
languages and so this is this is
super-important for that for that genre
of programming so I promise not to go on
about types except for the bit in the
middle instead we're going to focus on
variant values and what they look like
how you use them how you construct them
and we like values in closure there
they're pretty nice no one's gonna come
around and change them and the same goes
for these so here the point is that
they're really really super useful with
or without types and and they're really
really easy to use in closure so let's
let's take a look at what these things
even even look like so they look like
this so no matter how abstract I get
today just remember that all I'm asking
you to do is put some keywords in some
vectors that's it
so variants are tagged data they're data
with a tag and in order to have a
complete implementation of variants you
also have to have a D structuring
mechanism which enclosure we have with
core match which is not actually shipped
with closure I believe it's in
contribute was just a built in and you
didn't have to import anything but but
this is what you got and it works really
nicely so the things to notice here data
and more data here are variable binders
so those are variables were introducing
with those names and and the expressions
afterwards use them and we'll see more
of this in a minute so let's let's
imagine for a second so this is the
example part let's imagine for a second
that we work for a company called good
bookstore
and we're kind of a traditional
bookstore we have you know stores and we
sell books and one day our boss comes to
us and says hey we're going online and
you know this whole web one-point-five
thing we're sort of jumping on this
train and and we say cool so so how are
we going to get books to people well
there's three ways that the user can
choose they can have it shipped to them
they can email it to them as a PDF
because we don't like DRM so we just
send it as an unencrypted PDF or you can
pick it up from your local store right
and for each of these you'll need a
piece of data right you'll need to get
it to someone's house you need their
address to email it to them you need
their email address and to get it from a
store presumably you have some sort of
store ID but you can look up in some
sort of database and get open hours and
address and all sorts of stuff cool so
let's think about how we would model
this right there's there's a couple of
ways but the one that's sort of the most
obvious is Clojure has there's some
really nice Maps so so let's use a map
we got an address we got an email we got
a store ID but this is a little bit of a
lie because really you're only gonna be
using one of these at a time right
you're not gonna have someone who who
wants all three of these things for one
book well you might but those would be
separate orders so really it's gonna
look like this and the keys might be
missing but I see that as equivalent to
them being there and it being nil
because when you when you actually look
it up you're gonna get nil and then I
guess you probably want some way to tell
these apart so you should probably put
some sort of type thing on them and and
and at this point you should be cringing
I am certainly the this kind of problem
is hard and makes my code bad and I
don't like it so okay we got these maps
and let's let's say we store it in our
usual like sequel database that our boss
has told us we have to
is so it guess it looks like this it's
got you know same same deal type address
email store ID and when I see this this
is what I see but let no one say my talk
had no fancy animations so this is bad
there are other ways of doing this in a
relational database but they they come
with their own pain points and this is
sort of the way that that most of our
tools kind of encouraged us to do it so
this is bad for a number of reasons that
you could probably already know and
let's say let's put ourselves in the in
the position of the front end person at
our company who's gonna be like
implementing the the store front right
they're gonna say okay we got this this
delivery item I guess and we're gonna
you have to check its type right and
then we're gonna case off the type and
we're making a little string to tell the
user you know how they're gonna get
their book great and you know if it's a
delivery then we have an address key if
it's digital and we have email key if
it's pickup then then you know we look
it up from the database or something and
grab its address right so we can tell
these are where to go the things I want
you to notice here is that one you have
an explicit type check at the at the top
right you have this explicit like let's
look at the value of this thing and then
and then in the expressions here you
explicitly look up the keys with a
keyword and you sort of trust that
they're there because the contract is
that if it's the delivery than it has an
address key right this makes me sad why
does this make me sad this is really
easy to screw up the contract that I
just described to you that you have to
check the type key and depending on the
value of the type key
no based on I guess documentation which
other Keys are available and then you
have to make sure only to use those keys
right this is hard to keep track of I've
messed this up before when I've worked
with code like this and and I really
don't want to put this in my
documentation it just would make me
really sad to do so I guarantee if you
do this you'll find this beast in your
runtime which which is just bad and and
you know here we forgot to actually
include a type tag at all but really at
some point we run the risk of telling
the user that we're going to be
delivering their book to nil which just
makes us look bad someone will probably
also do this which is equally bad and
someone is liable to do something like
this where they just forget to check the
tag right because it's so inconvenient
to have to check the tag and you know
they know that they're probably gonna
get the right thing and even if it's
just during development where they're
working with like small data sets and
and they get a nullpointerexception
right well what's what's the stack tray
so that no pointer exception gonna look
like and we're enclosure so stack traces
are we kind of don't rely on them anyway
but it's gonna say that it can't look up
address on nil right assuming that
you're fine store doesn't raise or it
finds store is gonna say there is no
such store with ID nil and these are
really hard to debug just they they have
taken me hours you have to suddenly
trace in and you have to like figure out
why it's nil and and then go like oh I
forgot to check the tag when it's not
really obvious that you forgot to check
the tag here because there's no the
you're looking for the lack of something
right so the core problem is that this
map that we decided to use models and
we've got one data structure and we've
got three pieces of data and we put them
all together
that's what maps do they put data
together
but you can also use a map for its
hashing properties but maps with fixed
keys
you just put data together and you
present it so this models and and we've
cheated a little bit because every
single one of these can be nil right and
by doing this we've covered more of the
space than we really wanted to there's a
better way to do this and you may not be
surprised that it's variance so we can
model or directly here's three data
structures and they're all presumably a
delivery or an order a pending order and
we see that each one of them has a tag
that tells you what it is and then
there's the data right so this models
models or directly which is pretty cool
and then when you go to use it you use
this nice match macro and you just get
variables and you just use them and you
don't have to worry that you've
misspelled the key you don't have to
worry that you've used the wrong key
depending on the value of the tag it's
it's all just there for you it's
provided by the destructuring and what's
really cool is that in order to access
the data you are forced to check the tag
and handle all of the cases right and
you're not forced you could you could
like you know do a because we're we're
emulating this with vectors so you could
do an end and grab the thing in index 1
and just grab the data right but that's
inconvenient and that stands out in in
code review and when you're debugging
you'll you'll look at this code and be
like well that's suspicious why am i
doing anything there so this is really
cool and it helped it really helps
prevent bugs so structs is just what I
call maps with fixed keys and and
variants have this nice dual property to
them structs have a single constructor
or you just sort of put everything
together they have multiple destructors
where you take each thing out and they
they're they're really products and the
way they're which of their products is
that for example if val one here had
had two possible values in Val two had
three possible values they done the
whole thing would have six possible
values right because there's six
combinations on the other hand variants
have multiple constructors where you
make one of each thing and they have one
destructor where you just D structure
the whole thing and they model sons
right again if Val one had two possible
values about two had three then
something with tagged one or tagged two
would have five right there's two in the
first case and three in the second so
that's kind of cool I see a lot of code
that that does this that when the
documentation says oh you can pass a
string or a number or a vector and and
each of these things has different
meanings and and they're implicitly
defined in the documentation so you
you'll be given the meaning of what it
means when you pass it a string or when
it returns a string you'll be given a
different meaning etc and these are
unions by the way this is just raw
polymorphism so that's what I mean by
unions you just sort of put any value
wherever you like with variants on the
other hand you have this tag that tells
you semantically what it is so the
meaning is right there in the data
structure in the code just just the
keyword that's it's not that heavy
weight right so it means what it says
but what if you run into problems right
what if somebody gives you something
that has an unexpected tag
what if somebody puts nil in one of
these things and then you get no if you
want these kind of guarantees I'm sorry
to say you need types if you want static
guarantees you have to do static checks
right and so in order to do this you
should use clerk closure core.typed
fantastic library written by Ambrose you
should go follow him on Twitter and use
his library this is not a talk about
core.typed I'm just going to sort of
gloss over some of the
the gritty details but I suggest you go
read his excellent documentation so this
is how you define a very good right eye
and this is a little bit weird so let me
just walk through it so def a leus just
makes a name you're defining the name
though type and then you means Union so
are you just saying it can be any of
these things and each of these vectors
says well it says a couple things so
this is a value type which is a very
powerful feature of core typed and we're
using it here in order to say that in
this in this part of the Union the first
element has to be the value tag one
alright it's a type that only accepts
one value as valid and then and then you
have a string oops and then you have a
string and then you you do the same for
the rest of them and what's really
magical is that when you destructure
this with match most of the time it will
infer the type of the binder all right
so so if you match this and you match
tag one and put a variable name there it
will infer that that variable is a
string based on the fact that the vector
had this type which is really cool and
actually didn't work the first time I
tried this and I complained about it on
Twitter and Ambrose fixed it within like
a month which was I was floored so this
works most of the time and if you're
using core.typed you should use it I
actually really don't like this syntax
it it exposes a lot of weird details and
is just kind of a little cumbersome I
would propose the following macro which
would be so much nicer and you can see
it's just a very very simple syntax
transformation just to say that this is
a variant I added this slide yesterday
after the wonderful talk about Herbert
so you can you can use variants with
Herbert as well this this is a Herbert
schema that you can use to validate Edin
that comes in and you expect to be
variants and you can also use it to
Jenner
generators for your tests if you're
using variance which is pretty fantastic
generators for test check to do property
based testing which is really super
awesome if you ever want a tree if you
ever want a tree then you probably want
a recursive variant and this is where my
sort of language background shows this
is the lambda calculus the untyped
lambda calculus which is if you're not
familiar is just is a programming
language with only three features it's
got lambdas it's got variables and it's
got application and nothing else
no literals no nothing and and you can
see here it's represented as a variant
where the the type of the node is is the
tag and it's got other expressions in
its values all right so this is a nice
core.typed recursive variant type
expression you can see that it's an
application of two expressions a lambda
from a symbol to an expression which is
the body or a variable that has a symbol
in it right and that nice little rec
helper allows you to recursively refer
to your own type so that's cool here's a
nice little evaluator there's a lot of
different ways to evaluate untyped
lambda calculus this is sort of the most
straightforward and you notice I'm doing
a destructor on the app and then a nice
recursion and then a destructor on the
return value the one feature I haven't
talked about of core match here is that
underscore at the bottom which is the
default case so if it doesn't match
anything else we just return it all
right this implementation doesn't eval
under lambda some some implementations
do but if we find the lambda on the
outside we just return it because we
don't know how to evaluate that further
cool and I've alighted the
implementation of subst which is it
actually kind of non-trivial because
there's some naming stuff to do well is
just sort of an example of well it's an
example of the match recur pattern so
you see there's a match and there's a
and what that is is that's a that's a
tree traversal anytime you see match can
recur you're probably traversing over a
tree and if you want to traverse over a
tree this is probably the pattern that
you want to use if this looks incredibly
familiar to you you might be a user of
hiccup or one of the number of libraries
that have adopted its its convention
hiccup uses recursive variants to model
HTML which is a tree right and each node
has a type or a tag and they have values
in them which can be depending on the
thing it can be another expression or it
can be a string by text node and the the
one of my favorite libraries that has
started to use this as insta parse insta
parse if you just sort of create your
parser and run it it will just give you
one of these things just out of the box
and you can be structured with match you
can do whatever so this this isn't a new
a new technique this has been around for
a while it's just hasn't really
necessarily been named or sort of
accepted as a pattern ok so there's
there's one other language that that
does this and it doesn't pretty well and
this is sort of what inspired me to to
take this approach and that's Erlang
Erlang is another dynamic language they
have no types but in case you're not
familiar with Erlang syntax which I
don't expect you to be the Curly's mech
vectors in are lying the lowercase words
or atoms which are like symbols and
uppercase words are very variable names
and this is sort of part of a definition
of a server right that models a library
so you can check out a book you can
return a book you can look up who has a
book or you can list what books you have
checked out or a person has checked out
and here are the things that might
return right you might say okay here's
your book you might say that I've
already checked out your book sorry it
might say that
it'll you might give you an okay here's
your books that you've done and if you
pass it something it doesn't understand
it's just gonna give you an error right
and here's this translated to cloture
which is basically the same thing right
we just have one definition of the match
rather than multiple definitions with
destructuring and and the thing here to
note is that someone else could come
along and they could implement library
Plus which has all of which supports all
of these commands plus another number of
them right and anyone who can interact
with us with this implementation can
interact with that implementation as
well but if they start using the other
implementations custom custom commands
then we're gonna give them an error if
they try to use it with us so given that
how do you talk about what is a message
to the server right it's it's a variant
for sure because it's got some tags and
some data but the keys aren't fixed
they're they're extensible right and
they're extensible with a with a funny
kind of restriction which is that
there's kind of a subtyping relationship
right like the the one with fewer
options is a subtype of the one with
more options and that can be a little
bit hard to deal with but if you're
using these you should always have a
default case if your tag set is
extensible you should always have a
default case that handles an error and
you should be able you should be
expecting that to happen so and here's
the the rest of the return values also
translated so to compare clothes
variants have known tags that's sort of
what we were working with before you
know the tag set and you can you can be
confident you've covered all the cases
as long as everybody plays by the rules
which you can enforce with the type
system you never have to have a default
case right
if you want the guarantees that everyone
is actually playing by the rules you'll
need a type system whereas open variants
your tag set is freely extensible but
you have to have a default case and if
they're a little bit harder to type
because you need subtyping and then you
get into covariance and contravariance
and all sorts of complicated stuff but
they're pretty nice to use in a dynamic
setting where you don't even think about
that so here a couple standard variants
this is a loop variant so the way this
is useful is say you've got our
recursive function right and you want to
sort of defer the controlling of the
recursion to somebody else like say say
you want a different part of the code to
add traces like to print something out
every time that recursive or to limit
the number of recursions our priori if
you just use loop recur you you'd need
to edit the code and add in the log
statements or pass in some kind of flag
that told it what to do and you'd have
to start implementing all those features
in your algorithm which is which sort of
clutters things or instead if your
algorithm instead of recursing just does
a step and then returns a variant
indicating whether it would like to keep
rehearsing or whether it's done great
and and you could pretty trivially write
a little loop recur thing that'd be
structured this and as soon as it got
stopped just returned the thing and when
it gets recur recourses and you could
write several of them that that also add
counters or add debug statements or all
sorts of nifty things it's particularly
particularly useful in language
development where you can where you can
limit the the sort of runtime steps
another thing to get to get some debug
control over it this is a result variant
this is extremely commonly used in type
languages expecially especially but we
can use it too so this is particularly
useful if you have
error cases that are not exceptions
error cases that are they're just sort
of messages to say hey what you tried to
do didn't work so if your function can
fail it's possible that you want to
return one of these and and this and the
fact of returning one of these means
that you can't just go ahead and use the
Val value you have to check the tag
right so so if you want someone to have
to check the error case oops
I returned one of these it's it's really
good for that so if we want to store
this stuff in day Tomic I actually had a
different solution to this and a
co-worker just a week ago came up with
this one that I like a lot so here's the
answer so if you're not familiar with
atomic de Tomic stores things as more or
less vectors of entity attribute value
and transaction and I've alighted the
transaction here but this is sort of how
you do it you each variant value is two
datums to two of these rows and they
have one attribute saying that this is a
variant and this is the kind of variant
that it is i'm presumably you can follow
that to find out which keys are actually
available or which tags are available
and then you have an attribute for the
tag and and this is actually kind of
similar to the non solution we were
doing before with the map except that
the atomic doesn't actually waste any
space when you do this because it
doesn't actually store the the columns
it literally just stores these vectors
so we're restoring it in in constant
space to the number of tags so that's
pretty cool and then you can also
because of each different attributes you
can use the Atomics types differently
for each one so the store can be a ref
where the other things can be a string
and you don't have to do any back flips
to to do polymorphism and atomic cores
you can do with fancy refs but but this
is much more direct and you don't have
to look up another another level
so this is what the schema looks like if
you've never seen a de tommix chemo
before this might be a little
overwhelming I don't worry about it this
all we're doing here is we're defining
we're saying hey there's a thing in our
database called gb order and we've we've
names based our tags by the way this is
the convention and atomic so we've got
this variant called gb order it's a
thing that exists that's what we're
declaring and here we're declaring that
there's an attribute called gb order
delivery which is one of our tags and
with the underscore as you saw in the
talk before the underscore adds a
reverse a reverse relation
so this says add me as an install
attribute on DV part DV so we're
declaring that we're an attribute and
then here we're saying it's here we're
saying add me as one of the variants of
gb order all right and you would repeat
this three times one for each thing it's
a little bit verbose but it has all the
information that you want you can set a
value type oops you can set a value type
it's and they're independent it would be
really nice if if you could enforce that
exactly one of these things was defined
and you can do this with trans actor
functions it just hasn't been done as
far as I know it would be really nice if
that was just sort of there and easy to
use or packaged in some way it'd be
really nice if you could just say this
thing is a variant and here's what kind
of variant it is and and have that as a
first-class element of the schema so
takeaways the first is learn to see
variants everywhere I've seen so much
code that has variants that are begging
to get out so so look for them I eagerly
searched for them especially if you have
something where if you have an old
background you might reach for a shallow
subclass hierarchy with an abstract
class at the top right this is a really
nice
time to use variants friends don't let
friends use a map when a variant will do
teach each other this help stop the
unnecessary and Pease it's it's pretty
sad what especially when and complain
about it right like there's so many
serialization formats that just don't
support this I'm looking at JSON and I'm
looking at yeah mille i'm calling those
two out because there's really no good
way to do it i mean you could do a raise
with strings in them but it's pretty
cumbersome even however is fantastic
this and do it and and trust that when
people see this they will understand
what pattern you're using and if they
don't and if they complain that you you
can send them my way and i will take
care of them this is this is a real
pattern and it comes from a very long
history of of typed functional languages
and we can start using it here so go
back to your job or your hobbies or
whatever and and put this in your code
it will help you so that's all I got
you have any questions here in the front
the question was how how complex can
this new structuring be with the match
macro and it can be I think it can be
arbitrarily nested the the core match
Doc's will will help you out there it's
it's pretty powerful here
yeah yeah it really so the question was
about the extensibility of variants and
about whether whether you can actually
extend the variant list without
modifying their code and that's
absolutely correct and that that's sort
of the the limitation of of open
variants and why a closed variants tend
to be a little bit more reliable but if
you've if in if in their code they've
always handled the default case then
then you can trust that the default case
will be used there even if it's an error
condition so if you're using open
variants you have to kind of be prepared
for that
so the question was converting back to
either JSON or llamo and weather and the
suggestion was that maybe we could just
revert to using type tags that so that's
alright I I would prefer to just use
arrays and strings myself but that's
really up to you I mean these these
serialization formats are unfortunately
just not helping us out at all here so
so you can either have like a tag and a
Content key on an object which I've seen
done it's it's not that great to use but
it gets the job done you can send it
over the wire but you can also just use
arrays and strings there was another oh
yeah oh how multi methods fit into this
picture so multi methods are actually
pretty great and they they go most of
the way so if you're if you have a
function that takes a variant a single
variant as an argument or maybe even two
variants it's it's possible that you
could have used multi methods to solve
the problem as well which allows people
to extend it and all sorts of fun stuff
so they have some advantages the the
problem with multi methods is that they
only cover the case of variances
arguments to functions and they don't
cover returning them from functions or
using them in other kinds of values or
like having a value that is that is the
or of it so that you can D structure
when someone passes you something that
has a symbol in it but but that's all
you can do
there was another question here someone
put their hand down yeah
yeah that's Clojure core match I think
it's in contribute me from wrong but
it's if you start to close your core
match you'll find it all right
oh one more sitting down
so you're talking about Val validating
whether the actual data in the variant
is sort of correct well there's two ways
to do that I mean the the most the the
most solid one is obviously types I will
stop harping on that now all right
but you can also just do a check in the
destruction and that that adds a little
bit of code but you'd have to do that
anyway if you wanted to do that you can
also validate beforehand with a herbert
schema if you've just got data i mean if
you put lambdas or host objects and
these things there's a limit to what you
can do with even but as long as it's
just plain data you're you're golden
