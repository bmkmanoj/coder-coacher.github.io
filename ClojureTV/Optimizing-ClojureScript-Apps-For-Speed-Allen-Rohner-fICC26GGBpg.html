for speed I'm Alan I'm a runner on
Twitter if you feel like following me
founder started called rasterize we do
website performance monitoring and
previously it was founder and CTO of
circle CI
I've been using closure since forever
pre 1o so the talk is not about
optimizing runtime performance of
closure script and it's not about
compiler settings or any of that fun
stuff it's almost entirely about Page
Speed page size and network speed so you
know we're using closure script and omen
or reagent or one of those refrain and
single page apps are great you know we
all we all like to react we all like the
fun things you can do with it you know
makes it easier to build nice you eyes
really Ajax heavy stuff really API heavy
stuff gets a lot nicer it's not all free
though you know there's they're slow
network size you know you have all this
JavaScript and then you serve it to you
know your browser or people on the other
side of the world it has effects so this
is proof you know this is this is
rasterize loaded yesterday on the
conference Wi-Fi you know it's like oh
it's only 200k it took three seconds to
download 200 kilobytes you know we're in
a first world country we have wi-fi's
and it's still slow one eternity later
so there's this kind of this presumption
you know everyone has good internet all
of the time you know like in Derek's
talk yesterday about the state of the
mobile web and the southern Meg blog
post that's 10,000 words you know in
seven Meg's you could put phil books
with that you know everyone has good
internet all the time well not everyone
when you do have internet it's not
always good you know you're at a
conference you're on a plane you're on
mobile you know you're in San Francisco
and of course you don't have it all the
time so well why do we why do we care
about network speed why do we care about
download speed of single page apps so
this is a
startup I'm working with so the green
lines are their page load times and the
blue line is conversion rate for users
whose pages load it that quickly so you
know there's a nice bell curve around
two three seconds but you see there's
this huge you can't see my cursor
there's a giant slope here of conversion
rate drops off dramatically
as you pay to get slower to the point
where the lower people just don't buy so
this is this is a sports media startup
and they paid monthly subscriptions so
it's you know the cost of not converting
somebody is pretty high you say oh well
you know the blue line and green line
look kind of similar but let's look at
the null hypothesis here so if page load
speed didn't matter you would expect a
flat line all the way across right but
instead you see a giant spike so the
cost of not loading your pages quickly
is huge you say oh well Alan that's just
one startup it's anecdotal you know
whatever this is the same slide from
Walmart com so this is millions of
people a year so Walmart has this great
talk if you care about this stuff that
great talk a couple years ago if you
just google Walmart PageSpeed slides
they talked about the process of
improving the website they look median
page load time went from like 10 seconds
to 2 seconds and so they have multiple
charts of how the stuff improves so this
has all kinds of effects where's my
slides it's not working as Steve said
last night okay
so Google reported that speed affects
traffic and repeat traffic Amazon said
that for every hundred milliseconds that
your page loads slower that amazon loses
a hundred of one percent of revenue so
every hundred milliseconds they had a
visible effect and then Walmart had the
slide we just showed about conversion
rate you say okay fine I don't care you
know I'm not I'm not building a
commercial website with closure script
well websites are about side effects you
know every city you have a website on
the Internet presume
you're there to reach people you know
you're running a non-profit you have a
cool technical blog you have your open
source code at some point you want
people to pay attention to the thing
that you're doing and so if you want
them to pay attention speed matters you
know they will they'll lose if they'll
lose attention you know like that xkcd
about to get bored and pull out your
phone and then pull out a slightly
smaller device same thing happens you
know even if it's even if you're not
even if you don't care about conversion
rate YouTube has similar anecdote where
they worked on the page that they have
the site of the the site halved the
speed of the site you know the couple
engineers and they rewrote we reworked
everything and then they published it
and they started looking to analytics
and the average page speed went up like
that's something's weird here and we
have to be missing something and so they
dug through the analytics and then they
finally started grouping the the page
load speed in traffic by region and it
turned out that because they have the
size of the network or because they had
that have the page speed users started
showing up from remote countries that
that weren't previously users so they
had increased users in you know South
America and Siberia because the network
time went from completely unbearable to
just mildly annoying yeah so speed is
transformative so let's go back to my
single page app here and we have this
giant download time and of course you
know so I'm gonna zoom for the rest of
the talk that you're convinced so how do
we how do we fix this right no obviously
we make it faster first part of this
will work through some very basic stuff
and then we'll get to the more
interesting ones but the basic ones need
to be said so first do you really need a
single page app I'm assuming you do
because you know you're not just
following the new hotness but you
actually need react to do the things
react is good at but it's worth getting
out of the way reduce your dependencies
so you know in a normal closure app you
can just have a 300 line project out clj
and nobody
you know your users there's no user
visible effect adding one more
dependency enclosure script app every
single user is going to see or is going
to have to download that code so make
sure you're doing something useful with
it you know don't just add dependencies
because it's fun
more basic stuff the standard HTTP stuff
compression turn it on I I know every I
know everybody knows to do this but like
you have to say it because I've seen a
lot of sites like this year where people
forget to like gzip their gzip stuff
before they put it on Amazon s3
concatenate all your files just to
reduce the number of HTTP requests use
caching for everything and people always
say oh javascript size doesn't matter
everything is cached well not really
mobile browsers have really terrible
caching Mobile Safari has essentially
none if you if the app restarts and you
come back to it there's no persistent
cache Android has a small cache I use a
small cache Firefox had 50 Meg cache
until like a year ago and then chrome
was amazing when it came out with
essentially infinite cache the other
point about this is that caching only
helps repeat visitors so you know again
you want the side-effects reaching the
new users is probably it's arguably more
important than reaching than giving a
good experience to repeat visitors
because you've already convinced the
repeat visitors to show up again you've
already hooked them so the first
impression really matters I'm finally
CDN you know CD and all the things you
know we're in closure so we know all
that
immutable stuff you know so use
immutable URLs use e-tags and then you
know because you're on a single page app
you can even do things like CD on the
root HTML because you know the HTML on
your single page app is pretty boring
it's just load apt is right ok so now
we've got the boring stuff out of the
way
dynamically loading closure script and
modules so this is somewhat adapted from
blog post at a couple months ago closure
script can generate what closure and
closure script can generate modules so
basically you split up your app into
multiple files for most of this I'll be
talking about inner and outer because
it's just a standard easy you split
where outer is like everything on your
site that you don't need to be logged in
for so that's you know typically landing
pages and pricing and like the actual
login page and then inner is like the
actual app you know where presumably you
need a lot more of the closure script to
react stuff so modules are just standard
JavaScript files with a simple
dependency tracking the depends e
Tracking's of the runtime modules when
you at the compile time it's just a file
with JavaScript so closure Google
closure will generate these you can
specify closure script namespaces and
get a good split so you can make sure
you're only serving the closure the code
that you care about to the users at the
appropriate time and then at runtime so
in your actual closure scope files you
can choose which files to show and win
so it starts with so that this is right
here we're looking at closure script
code so this will be in the browser or
whatever so that's stopped at the top
you have a map of module names to file
names and then second block here of
module info those are dependencies so
when you tell Google closure you know I
want this module it will say okay well I
need to make sure that all the other
dependent modules are loaded so we set
you set all of this up and then you can
say in your closure script routing oh
I'm on I'm on an outer so then the outer
modules loaded and then when I click on
this link go load inner and then that
presumably that loads the rest of your
code and then sets the inner module is
loaded and all those dependencies come
in so the big advantage there is you've
now reduced the amount of code that you
need
to the users on the landing page and so
if they never go to the app then you
never need to download the app
dependencies it's a lot more information
I have a lot more sample code and how to
do this I'm an old blog post of mine so
that's great it's a big big win you know
outter it gets 30% smaller okay it's
good but it only got 33% smaller
still still 200k zipped in my exam in my
case you know your results may vary and
remember with the well never ends plane
okay so we still want to go faster what
do we do now well let's try rendering
the server side because we've got you
know at this point we've improved the
HTTP stuff we've we've cut out
unnecessary dependencies and then we're
not serving dependencies to users who
aren't gonna see them so what else can
we do
well server-side rendering so the goal
here is we still have our app we still
have the inner and outer split but you
know on your on your hand on your home
page you probably aren't using too much
fancy you react stuff you're probably
not using core async you're probably not
using all the nice things we have just
because landing pages are typically
boring so our goal here we want to serve
the app we want the landing page to be
fast
and yeah and we want code reuse here you
know it's it's easy to just say oh well
have your react app here and then have a
static HTML over here you know doing
conventional hiccup or whatever but you
know that kind of sucks because you have
you already have your own templates you
already have you want to reuse your code
you know I don't have to port them
across I don't have duplication they
don't want to load a lot okay so one
let's do the stupidest thing that could
possibly work so let's use webdriver
selenium so you know you have your
server and you have we're gonna start as
webdriver instance and that's going to
run Chrome so then when a user shows up
we will make will tell chrome to make a
crust to our server
that's going to serve the single-page
app with app touch a s then the browser
is going to render the our web driver
browser is going to render it then you
grab the HTML source and then you serve
that to the client so this looks kind of
like this so it's here we have Safari is
the client and then they're connecting
to our server then we connect to Chrome
tell chrome to get the page load the
page grab the HTML seven to back so the
advantage of this it works it's you know
it it can actually do something it's
easy to write you know it takes it'll
take you an hour two disadvantages its
complex its heavyweight you know because
now you have to setup selenium you have
to setup you have to install Chrome and
then in deploying in production you have
to say okay here's my jar and I need
selenium and I need Chrome installed and
probably running on Linux so then you
need headless X you know so then you
have to set up X VfB and yeah it's not
fun o debugging this is also fun so if
you have for example if you have a
JavaScript error on your home page when
once you do this the JavaScript error
will show up in chrome it won't show up
in the clients browser because you
didn't serve them that JavaScript so now
you have to say oh I'm going to grab
logs from webdriver and store those
somewhere actually did this for a while
I don't recommend it so let's try again
well ok jdk a8 is out we have national
arm you have JD Nashorn is a JavaScript
engine so let's let float up J us in
there and then call reacts render to
string it sounds like a good plan so it
looks something like this so this is a
this is closure script code I have to
start being careful about this
so it's you know standard ohm stuff
create an app state create a cursor
builder component and then call render
to string on it yeah you don't need that
print one sorry what's a bug in the
slides so the advantages of this
continuing on it doesn't work
nashorn is very unpolished it took me a
couple hours to get print line working
it took me a couple hours to get stack
traces to produce anything useful quarry
sink hasn't been ported or whatever to
Nashorn so you know quarry single
working node and it'll work in browsers
nashorn is neither know nor a browser
and then you know it doesn't have xml
httprequest I'm sure it doesn't have a
lot of other things that either no or
browsers have but finally it's just slow
so after setting up after loading you
know if I
so I ran benchmarks on this and after
loading national run and after eval the
app code and getting it into it into one
state and then calling render to string
where's that go back to that slide so
after setting this up just the final
line there that rendered a string took a
second for my simple Oh map you know so
you have you have all these pain points
and then after that it's still slow so
what can we do you know let's let's try
again
so let's we have node you know node is
another jeaious engine so we do this
render to string thing
careful readers will notice this is the
exact same code which is nice advantages
it's fast it's easy to write today I
tried this a couple months ago and it it
was not fun
but I tried it again last week I was
hastily preparing for this and it
everything just worked now so the the
node closure script support has gotten a
lot easier to use so disadvantages as
it's kind of like selenium but less so
you know so okay deploying to production
you know you have your jar you have no
js' and now okay you know previously I
could just upload my jar run it anew
in an uber jar in a container but now I
need like my closure jar and I need an
ode container or something I don't know
so the same kind of process as earlier
but you know we still have this
complexity there's one more disadvantage
now you're running node in production so
let's try again okay so going back to
the goals we have our own react app we
want server-side rendering we want speed
we want to reuse our templates
well Ohm's written enclosure script we
have CL JC now and you know generating
HTML isn't that hard so how hard can it
be if you guys aren't familiar this is
Jeremy Clarkson he does some silly
things like building a kwatak pickup
trucks on the show Top Gear it's also
famous for punching an employee so how
hard can it be so I wrote a little bit
library called foam I poured it ohm to
closure so trust I don't need to explain
the pun so the way you use this you port
your components to dot CL JC and then
you just do require foam core has ohm
and bra fit so in your so now this so
now this is dot c l-- JC so this is what
used to be an ohm component which what
used to be written in close your script
is now CL Jaycees and use reader
conditionals and so you we have this
foam core namespace that just says as
ohm and it implements all the same
protocols as ohm and similarly with foam
Dom so then you know here's a normal
component you know just and
theoretically you don't need to change
any of your components they all
theoretically work
this provides all the same functions and
provides all the same protocols so how
do we serve how do we do server-side
rendering with this well it looks like
same code is pretty much the same code
as earlier so now this is closure code
now we're creating our app state and our
route cursor and building our component
all in closure and then calling rendered
a string on it
so we have our previous the top example
is the old JavaScript bottom example is
the foam in closure and as you can see
it's almost exactly the same what about
real sorry what about reactive not
really i ported rendered a string so and
you get all of the own protocols so you
get eye on it state get states that
state you know render render state all
of those and then at the bottom actually
I think I have a slide on that we will
get to that okay but advantages it's
fast it takes like one millisecond to
render a page there's no more deployment
complexity you don't have a separate
program you don't have to sub separate
process you don't have node you don't
have webdriver and then actually
surprise this surprised me porting to CL
JC was actually surprisingly useful for
my UI because once you're there your
unit tests can now be run in closure
rather than closure scripts so then you
don't need to spin up a browser you
don't have to deal with node you don't
have to deal with phantom Jas so
actually even if you don't do any of
this other stuff I would recommend
playing with using more CL JC for your
UI you know like if you have actually
pure units in your UI that don't write
to a browser just put that in a seal JC
file and then just use closure test boom
disadvantages moving on
no but seriously I'm pretty proud of it
so that the one disadvantage is you have
to import to see ljc which did it didn't
take me that much time you know I moved
my whole clojurescript app which is five
or it's like five K and took me an
afternoon and that's just the quick and
dirty way where you just condition you
know you do the reader conditional thing
and just no op functions that have
browser side effects so that I can show
you that later if we care but basically
it's the UI code splits into the you
know oh my render stuff and then you
know like for a an Excel and a an AJAX
call it's just a no op with a reader
conditional around it so this foam is
still very early I started working on
this on Thursday
it's a Collins talking yesterday with
talk driven development this is this is
very much dr. Ehrman development the
other disadvantage right now is its
incomplete in the sense of I started
reading the ohm code and there's a lot
more options and things you can do in
there than I realized this right now
it's only the bare minimum to only the
bare minimum supported to get my app
running and and of course the other
thing is it's only now you can probably
copy the idea to to reagent and reframe
and all of those but I haven't looked at
their source code but I assume it's
using I assume they have their own
throwing protocols and their own
functions to shadow so you'd have to
basically just copy the idea of I'm
going to make a closure namespace that
shadows all of the implementations of
the normal closure script okay so
oh this stuff works so foam-core just
you know it's just normal closure it's
just def protocol you know def protocol
I render def protocol I in it state
you know you get quote the same
protocols and the reason you get them is
because I'm it right now I'm assuming
you get the I'm assuming everybody does
require um core as a home and then does
it oh my around here if you if you
actually referred to things by their
global name you know if you required or
if you implemented protocols as own core
/i render that would break for now
monkey-patching is possible I'm just
waiting to see if that's necessary I'd
like to avoid that and answer the
question earlier this is this doesn't
implement react
it doesn't need to because you know
you're not dipping anything on the
server side let's see so then you know
in in the real um Dom you have functions
that return j/s objects that implement
react protocols and rendered a string is
just another react protocol on the
closure sky on the closure side you have
a function with the same name that
returns a def record that implements a
phone protocol called rendered a string
and so then when you call that you get
you get an HTML string that you can just
serve and we can go through that in a
minute
yep
so yeah so it doesn't need to it doesn't
need to implement react it doesn't need
to because we're not diffing but you so
you still get a similar object tree you
know you still get yeah it's not it's
not important let's skip that alright so
in the future this does need more
stabilization you know it's still still
not not quite ready for production but
so far I haven't seen any obstacles for
why it can't go to production needs more
incomplete implementation like I said it
does the bare minimum right now if there
are features that you know home that I
don't use or didn't understand when I
wrote the source code I just just didn't
copy those I haven't looked at what home
next will do it'll probably need to
rewrite this but that's fine because
foam is actually pretty small it's only
a couple hundred lines merging obviously
it's not up to me I'm not proposing that
foam gets merged into ohm and you
probably don't want to merge this code
but there's I'm pretty convinced this is
a good idea and I'm pretty convinced
that's something like it should go into
just because server-side rendering is
such a huge speed advantage oh I didn't
have a slide on that I should have gone
through that but the page load speed
once you get server-side rendering you
can drop from like two seconds to under
under a second so I commonly see 800
millisecond page load times in
production which is a big advantage
I assume this would be there'd be a lot
of questions on this and if there aren't
we can just go look through the source
code if you feel like it
so yeah
I was just trolling but in all honesty
though it's you know if you can if you
can run in one runtime and production
that's better than having to just
because it's fewer things to update and
fewer things to coordinate and you know
how do I get it started and you know you
have now you have to keep up to date on
your patches on both Java security
updates and node security updates so so
yeah it's yeah it's technically more
complex but it's more gist yep yep sorry
yeah yeah sorry I'll try to repeat the
questions so the question was if you're
using closure script libraries don't
they have to be ported to CL JC as well
the answer is yes and no so I recommend
try to you try to get a good split you
know try to separate your code into you
know purely functional stuff and side
effecting and then use reader
conditionals to no op out anything that
touches the browser actually I can let's
see if I can get yeah I can actually go
through my actual source code because I
don't care yeah so for example here I
have this this function that loads oh
yeah okay let's go this way
yeah it's mostly so so this is real code
you know I just oh that doesn't HTTP
call no screw that we're just gonna
comment it out not commented out but
it's it's a no op on the closure side so
as I said right now this is quick and
dirty this is just you know what was the
simplest thing I could do to prove that
this idea works and so you know like
here we have the so this is like login
code you know setting the user so if the
users in mix if the code is running a
mix in JavaScript identify the user with
Mixpanel
and then call it mo update so yeah did
that answer your question
yeah okay right
okay so the question was what if I can
summarize those what happens to the
browser as you're doing the server-side
rendering and are there any races and
what does the event look loop look like
so the first thing it is the server
response is actually very fast so it's
you know the time for an HTTP connect
and then this is like one millisecond to
render so the user won't see a lag you
know they'll just make a request and
come back
how own load ziz I don't know what I
don't want to punt and say it's up to
you but if you want super fast loads
then you just don't load App jeaious at
all on like the home page you know so
user shows up your home page you just
give them static HTML and no JavaScript
and then if they click on you know the
login button or you know if they click
to the point where you have to go into
the actual app then make the event
handler for that click load the rest of
the JavaScript and then you can show
them a spinner or whatever you want so
so on the superfast case you're not
actually loading the page at all but if
you let's say the user just types in you
know your site slash login so that
forces you can do the server-side app
but you know you're gonna have to load
the app to us anyway
so in that case foam will give you react
IDs so in the static HTML you get you
got the react IDs in the classes so then
when it does redraw it knows what to do
and it doesn't have to now you'll still
have to handle the race condition of you
know what about my click handlers I have
to think about that so the you mean the
click handlers will load
yeah you mean you'd have to think about
that yeah that's so the question was I
apply react IDs so I didn't read the
react source see if this is yeah it's
not running in production yet so the
question was how do I handle the react
IDs I just looked at the looked at the
output of running my app and it's just a
simple tree so that you know the
component the root component has you
know an ID of dot zero and then the
first child of that is dot 0 dot 0 and
then the is for everybody else not for
David okay
the the second child of the first
component that's dot 0 dot 1 so it's
it's just a simple tree with the root
node of 0 and then each sibling
increments from 1 and then each child
gets 0 appended to it
so you know the algorithm is just okay
build up my react tree or you know build
up my def record tree recursively walk
it assign IDs and then after that it's
just a normal HTML class so you just
generate those sorry so the questions
are my including the react keys I mean
like the key function and that kind of
thing yeah you can you can easily add
support for that I mean I will it's not
done yet but but yeah it's nothing to
stop anything productive in theory yep
sorry
oh okay so was there a question there or
just okay yeah so it's just saying that
in the future the react IDs are going
away so we don't have to mess with that
for future record I got the Dino on seal
of approval
yeah so the question was basically and
why am I doing this is this for code
reuse and page load speed yeah it was is
also kind of laziness so if we go to see
if I can go back to Emacs oh you know
it's right there where is that okay so
this is the actual actual loading my
home page so as you can see amusing
cebuano and that was another thing I
didn't talk about was I actually ported
it's a blown as well that was easy
though so I didn't so so the question
was you know why not use in live or
something like that and separate the
templates out and the answer was I
didn't really want to you know move all
of the functions everywhere you know so
if you did that you totally couldn't do
that
but you'd have to move all of your own
functions and do a separate thing and
then use in life which I never quite
understood so it was just simpler to
shadow them and not have to move
anything else yeah anything else
all right great thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
