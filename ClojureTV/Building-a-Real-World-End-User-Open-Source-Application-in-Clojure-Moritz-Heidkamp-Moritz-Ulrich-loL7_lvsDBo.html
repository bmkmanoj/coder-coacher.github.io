to tell you about how we built an
open-source real world end user
application enclosure and we're going to
explain what that actually means for us
in a second but first a few words about
us we are working on a software
development services company based in
Cologne Germany called big hood IT and
we have a strong focus on in functional
programming and for example the author
of the chicken-skin compiler Felix
Dinkelman is part of our team and in the
recent years we've started adopting
closure as our main go-to language for
example we've also sponsored and
supported the first German closure
bridge event just two weeks ago
enrolling in so if you want to find more
about us in the services we offer please
visit our website so when you look at
closure conferences and and the talks
presented there you often see either
very technical and detailed talks like
the one we just saw about data structure
implementations for example you also
tend to see people presenting their
favorite library or the library the road
also open source usually you often hear
people talk about enterprise experience
reports like for example the daily mayor
story we had in London I think so people
putting closer to use for real world
applications but usually behind bars
like in corporations and often we are
just that right so there's lots of
philosophical idea and conceptual talk
program language design and all of that
is very good and this is actually the
strong point of the closure community I
think that we try to think about these
details a lot but when we submitted a
talk for for your closure we or when we
wanted to submit one we thought about
what is actually missing what gap could
we fill and the gap we identified was
putting all these things together so
essentially all the things I just
mentioned and then we remembered that we
started this little project earlier that
year which is called paper and that's
what we call as I said a real world
patience oh that's not just the to do
and we see toy example thing it's like a
that actually does something and
something useful it's targeted at
end-user so it's not like Riemann or
something very technical where you
already have to know about the concept
in details is actually focused at or
targeted at office clerks we are
supposed to work with that system and
it's actually an open source application
as opposed to a library so you can get
your hands dirty with the code and you
can look at it as a reference and see
how we put all these ideas and libraries
we always hear about to use so we
actually built the whole thing with
closure in the back end closed script in
the front end so this is what this talk
is going to be about basically we're
going to give you an introduction of how
the code base works so you can take a
look at it
when you're at home you can have some
reference points to go into but but
first let me explain to you a bit what
paper actually does so about the
business domain basically which is just
a short bit and then we're going to go
to the technical details well Dan so
paper is a document management system
and we built this product not for this
presentation specifically but because we
had this problem so we were actually
scratching our own itch when we started
this project we were looking at lots of
available open source document
management systems because we needed one
for the company and our company runs
like 95 percent open source software and
the ones we took a look at they didn't
really fit with our didn't really fill
our needs and were designed horribly and
slow and you get the idea so we thought
why not do it on our own and the main
issue you have are the two issues we
identified for document management
systems on the one hand how do you get
documents into the system so it has to
be has to have lots of input channels to
make it convenient to input your
documents somehow and it has to be
convenient because otherwise you end up
with stacks of paper like that because
nobody can be bothered to actually scan
every document and put it uploaded
through a web form or something like
that so it has to be very very easy
low barrier entry for documents and none
of the existing systems we looked at
actually solved that very well
another reason we didn't want to a
commercial product product a cloud
service is because we want to have it on
premise so this is also something you
could use on your own your own service
and a second problem you have is when
once the documents are in there you have
to get them out again
and some when you actually need them so
you file all your invoices but then you
have to do the text report so you have
to have some efficient mean quick means
to retrieve the documents again so these
are the two main problems so this is
what paper currently looks like it's
still work-in-progress so it's not like
a really stable product or anything yet
it's out there and development takes
place in public and it's already pretty
usable so this is actually the
screenshot I took the other day and of
some demo documents of course and you
can already identify a few basic ideas
like you have a search and the tagging
system pretty obvious I think and you
can actually look at documents in the
system so you don't need a PDF view or
anything and it is all built into the
web client and it's using images for
that so this is what the what the search
interface looks like but this is not
going to be what we are going this is
not going to be a user introduction this
is going to be a developer introduction
so we are going to show you how this
system is built up how the architecture
works and how we actually composed all
these nice libraries we learn about in
these conferences to build a system so
there's going to be a lot of code we
want already and from now on this is the
last picture I think oh no there's
another one so this is a this is the
high-level overview of the system or a
graphical overview maybe as you can see
we've chosen PostgreSQL as a datastore
although the atomic for example would
have been a very nice fit for our data
model because our document contents are
immutable so we never once the document
is in the in the system you can't change
its contents anywhere you're only
allowed to change the metadata which
simplifies a lot of things about it many
document management systems are like a
mix of Google Drive or Google Docs and
and such a system so you could actually
call it more like document archive
system maybe so as you can see this
hostess's our main datastore then we
have like lots of small components in
this monolithic server but these
components are actually quite decoupled
we're going to take a look at that so
you could actually run them in separate
processes eventually that's what we're
aiming for it's not yet possible but it
will be soon then you have in green here
you have multiple interfaces as I said
you want to have various ways to put
documents into the system and we have
this web client we just saw we have an
email interface which can also use from
your scanner if it's capable to do that
and we have virtual printer interfaces
we're going to talk about that and the
blue components are like processors that
actually do something with the documents
you put in there to index them and OCR
them and something like that so that's
the big picture for actually
implementing these components we use the
component library by Stewart Sierra I
think he presented it last year in
Krakow if I remember correctly and so
this is going to be our basis I'm not
going to explain the library itself now
I'm just so we know where to look when
you want to look it up and that means
that we have a central spot where the
whole this picture we just saw is
actually manifested in code so the paper
core namespace contains this map or this
is the system declaration which you and
all the words we just saw in the diagram
you will find here as components again
so this is like your entry point when
you want to navigate around the system
go to paper core and from there you can
easily find all the various parts of the
system so I'm going to start with a very
simple example the the config component
which is necessary like boring necessity
for every application you have to
configure it somehow to start it up and
knows where where services are and
that's something that's usually not
mentioned in in presentations that about
libraries right because that's not
something the problem libraries have so
how did we do it in paper and our config
file is like this so we use a closure
itself as a config language just put in
a map like that with keys for the
various components and you have settings
that you can put in there and the
component and also that config is very
straightforward it looks like this and
the start method actually calls load
file instead of
well it doesn't just read the file it
actually loads it so it works a bit like
Emacs it's at startup evaluates that
file so you can actually put caught in
your config file so you can read
environment variables if you like and
stuff like that so all these things are
possible in the config file it's not
restricted and we and do another trick
here we merge all the settings right
into the component because the component
is empty itself we can just use it as as
the conflict essentially right so these
conflicts are just records and they are
like maps so we can use the component
itself as a config object so once we
have the config in place we can connect
to or we can talk to our database and as
I said it's Postgres for open-source
reasons basically but also because
Postgres has many many features which
are quite convenient and very mature
actually and they're often a bit
underused i think so we try to use lots
of these features which are available in
Postgres but first what do we store in
there we store metadata obviously but we
also store the document contents
themselves so when you put a PDF in it
will be in Postgres too because Postgres
is actually quite good at handling large
blobs like that and then we don't have
to fill it with file systems and all the
inconsistencies rise from that we just
have transactional semantics for for
blob storage we also use its full text
search capability so we don't have to
start up another an elastic search
something like that we could do that of
course but it's very convenient because
it's all good and you just have one
service and you put all these
functionality you get all this for free
we also use it as a communication or
message bus you could say device between
components so that is a way for us to
later separate the process various
processes into a separate system
processes actually we're gonna take a
look at that in a minute and we also use
it as a persistent queue or is it
durable queue because we have like these
files that need to be processed and
there has to be some kind of cue that so
that the processors know what to process
next and we don't have a separate
service for that we just use Postgres -
so how does it first let's take a look
at the schema of course that's what we
need for understanding the whole thing
focus on the middle on the
vertical column so you can see we have
documents relation there consisting of
pages and then there's also a files
relation so there's a split between
documents and files and that is for the
reason that if you have a paper feed
scanner for example you can just put
your whole stack of mail on top it will
scan all the documents and put them all
in a very big PDF and then it can send
it to paper and in the in the paper web
interface you can then separate this
physical file into logical documents so
you can tell it document a goes from
page 1 to page 10 and the next document
bla bla bla so you can separate physical
files into logical documents depending
on the channel that you deliver it into
it so if you just upload a document then
it will be a one-to-one mapping but the
schema allows that and the second thing
you should you should focus on this this
deletions relation which is not really a
business relation it's just the fact
that we can't know about deletions like
we do in the atomic when somebody
retracts effect there's a trace of that
in the database but in Postgres on
relational databases you just delete in
place so we have this separate relation
that just keeps track of these deletions
so that consumers can be notified about
that and the same is for changes in the
inner tables so each table has a
sequence a state sequence number that
will just be increased whenever
something changes in the table when a
new record is written or when an
existing record is changed then we can
easily query for giving all the changes
after that sequence number we see that
later in the front-end part so this is
the database component very
straightforward again we just connect
using our conflict component and we do
use another trick here we just put the
connection pool object into a key called
data source which allows us to use the
component in sales as a JDBC connection
spec so we don't have to unwrap the
component every time we just use the
component immediately and this is going
to look like that so the peabody
namespace is essentially a reacts part
of the JDBC a closure Java JDBC library
but adds some some features and wraps
some things and this is going to just
slightly this to give you an idea how
you can actually
work on the system like when you when
you set it up on your machine how do you
play with it and when you get a wrapper
like that you can just call the go
function to start the system so this is
basically taken from the Stewart
Sierra's component readme is that the
system like that and this will bind the
system bar to the running system and we
can import the the paper DB namespace
and then we can run arbitrary queries on
that using the DB component we just
created right so we can see there's some
topical documents in there we can also
insert a new document for example and in
the bottom you see the states if I was
just talking about so when an observer
knew the current state was 5 then it
will just ask for giving everything
after 5 and then we receive this new
document because it has State 6-6 but
this is of course not how you how we
actually implement the business logic we
have a separate namespace paper model
that implements like the business domain
in a more high-level way for example
there is a query documents function that
allows us to query document using likers
special DSL that we created for for more
convenient queries because we want to
query for for certain tags for example
and doing that with all the joints is
very involved and then we want to query
for tags which are there and not and
stuff like that so all these things are
possible with this little DL which is
actually our protocol for the front-end
and in this case we're searching for
documents with the tag new which have a
title that starts with invoice and that
actually uses the Postgres full-text
search and we get this document metadata
record very shallow we can add tags for
example like that foo and bar to a
document of ID number 2 and then we can
also retrieve the document and that will
give us an aggregate view of the current
state of that document and you can see
there's like The Associated objects are
there too like the pages their
processing status the tags and all the
things so you can work with this object
more conveniently rather than working
with a low-level database interface so
that's how that works
now when a new file enters the system we
have to somehow trigger this whole
cascade of processing and that's
the heart of the system that's why I'm
going to go into details here now for a
bit there's a bit tricky so we have a
very straightforward store fire function
which just inserts the file we want to
store into the database but then it
calls this DB notify function with a
topic basically so files new is it's
announcing that it's inserted and you
fire to the database here and the
notifier function you can see below it
does two things first it takes in a
transactional advisory lock there's a
nice feature of Postgres that's pretty
recent actually and it allows us to have
logical locks they don't actually lock
tables from inserts or anything they're
just advisory as the name says
so when application has to participate
in this locking structure and we use
that to synchronize this transaction so
there's a transaction lock that ends
when the transaction ends it's free 20
transaction ends and at the same time we
or after that we sent a notification
through this vast component and the bus
component is essentially a croasing
publication channel essentially there's
a bit more ends going on there but
that's what we do here so we publish a
core a sync notification here and on the
other end we have processors that listen
for this notification there are three
processors we already saw them one that
extracts pages and metadata from from
documents so far we only support PDF
it's probably going to stay like that
then there's another component listens
for these pages to be which are created
by the page extractor to render them
into two images and then after that is
the OCR a processor which extracts text
from the from the image because
sometimes you have PDFs that have images
with text in them right so you have to
do something like that and this is what
we use for the full text as the basis
for the full text search so and this is
what a processor looks like this is a
bit tricky or much maybe for one slide
but bear with me so we have this
internal I process a protocol which
defines two things or has to define two
things queried how to obtain the next
processable item from the database so
this is our cue
we put on top of Postgres it just
returns the next pending object from the
files table in this case and we have a
process item function that then receives
that item if it's there and has to do
something you can do whatever like
actually but in that case it does the
actual extraction starting an external
process for that we use poplar and then
after it's done it also broadcasts once
such a notification via the the bus
which is called in this case pages in
you obviously right so it's also this
five page extract is also a component so
we implement the lifecycle protocol and
in that protocol we we actually stop
that process or and we tell it what
topic we are interested in so whenever
files new notification appears on the
bus we want to be called that's what
that says actually so let's take a look
at this start function we just saw is
that at the bottom with a start function
we subscribe to the bus so we get a
notification channel that's just a
regular subscription channel from
caressing which is sliding so we don't
want to block somebody notifying us
about something happening we just want
to get this information so we use the
sliding buffer here we get a control
channel too so we can gracefully shut
down this process instantiate this
process of object just for convenience
and then we start this worker threat and
it has to be a threat here because we
start external processes and we have to
wait for them so we can't use a go loop
but that's fine so in that threat just
loops until it drops and it processes
the next item so process next
essentially well immediately calls next
item as you can see a next item first
takes this Advisory block again and that
makes sure that once we receive the
notification and we have taken that lock
we know that the other transaction was
committed so this is just a
synchronization point so that we know we
can actually receive retrieve the
document from the database now and then
we fetch it from the database again you
might wonder why don't we just sent the
whole document through the croasing
channel because we already have it in
hand but obviously we need a persistent
queue anyway and
keeping all these documents in memory
wouldn't would be a waste and it will
also be stupid to block just because we
have too many documents in the queue we
want to shove it right away so that's
why we do the round trip through the
database right and then we have when we
actually obtained an item we process it
check whether there's something on the
control channel to stop us and if it's
if it's not we just run into the loop
again if there was no item we wait on
this notification Channel
so once the store fire function is
executed again then we will be woken up
here and continue with the loop for the
next so the next item to be processed so
in all these processes we saw they
they're based on this component or this
is this implementation basically well as
this is the heart of the application
this is why I'm going into so much
detail here because that's something you
when you look into the code you will
have to understand what that does
okay and with that I'm passing the back
to the other modes I think okay yeah
that is easily the hardest part of the
application the most complicated code so
now we go to something simpler logging
we have to do it every bigger
application and it's a company based
application so Allah Galaga as a company
to we abstracted away with a protocol so
and it's pretty trivial we defined the
log function and takes some arguments
component the log level and the message
bottom shows closure tools logger
implementation for it also very trivial
but as it's a system based application
using using components we should be able
to lock on components so that's how we
want to use it we just want to be able
to call info and one on whatever on
basically every component in our system
and so how can we do that either we
implement a logger interface on every
single component which is pretty
cumbersome and pull state everywhere
we can explicitly define a dependency on
a logger which is also where we annoying
and easy to forget so let's take a
system that wasn't s what it is it's a
map it's a map so we can just write some
code which takes a completed system to
complete a complete application and it's
logging to it which will basically
inject a log R into every single
component how we do that is with the web
of crap logging call it takes a system
and generates and log R with a namespace
keyword so there are no name clashes etc
and that's an implicit dependency on
every component and that's it pretty
easy but nice to have the code is not so
important in this case it's just a
strategy to attack implicit dependency
to a whole system and make it ever
available everywhere some things we have
to be aware of the logger has some
dependencies itself like config and of
course we can't at logger to the config
component itself so there will be a
cyclic dependency so we just exclude
that in the let all components above but
that's not so it's actually pretty
simple but a very nice piece of code and
maybe it's useful for other people as
morbid said L we are how can we get can
we get data into this system what can
you do with a document on your computer
you can print it so we implemented
virtual network printers for the line
printer daemon protocol and to internet
printing protocol LPD is pretty simple
and pretty limited IPP is complicated
but very powerful and we have a complete
IPP implementation on our github already
and IPP will follow soon and those are
tailored to people so it can basically
just accept a document and pull the data
out of it bla bla
so basically paper will appear as a
virtual printer on your network you can
open your printing dialog on OS X or
cups or were nerves and wind every
document into it and it's archived the
code for that is actually so simple
there's no need to show it I would like
to have you but we don't have too much
time the HTTP AP is basically very
simple too I won't show cause either for
that it's just a mutant the back server
we chose it for performance because more
words tested all all common web servers
and he thought and later we saw that
version 2.0 has really nice async
support which maps in very nicely to our
bus system and to casing that was just a
very nice point we had there we use
composer for hooting pretty sure most
people will be familiar with that and
Liberator Philip my assets in the
confluence I think he will enjoy that
nothing special there either so it's
just the usual usual stuff
transit is used so we don't have to
convert or data around to Jason and then
back as our client is with my closure
script too so just what would you expect
the front end as I said its closure
script and ohm and the styling is
gardening and booting is secret away I
will go into and we'll talk a bit about
the data model we used for the client
and a bit about the routing because I
think that's the most interesting part
and getting the data model right is
usually the hardest part when writing
the client oh yeah and we used frequent
process of the client yeah it was really
nice really enjoyable I can recommend it
so the data model recommends a single
state item for the whole application on
the client in the web browser I should
say that we have a map mapping from
document IDs to documents we also do
navigation the routing itself of the
client application in the app state
and we store the text and the sequence
numbers as smooth as mentioned earlier
we used them to synchronize the client
to the server and basically the server
sends down a map with some sequence
numbers for each table the client just
stores it and when the next with the
next HTTP requests it sends them back to
the server again so the server knows if
the client is this has the recent
application state and there's a long
polling channel which we use to pull
changes from the server and wait 20
seconds or so on and left the HTTP
requests day and the server pushes data
down as soon as it gets something also
implemented with caressing and the bus
channel and the bus component as Moritz
mentioned earlier here are nothing so
special here a document in the Upstate
is basically just the x-axis exactly the
same document as on the server that's
just what we got from get documents
people dot model slash documents get
documents it has a title the IDE all
pages and yeah in the pages the DPI key
might be interesting that's a set of the
sizes in which we when do it two pages
so the client can decide for itself if
it wants to show a lower resolution
picture of the page four thumbnails or a
big resolution for full page view yeah
and if the Wender status isn't processed
but failed or something the client can
show and ever image or decide what to do
yeah yeah that's the document routing is
another interesting aspect I saw some
applications on the on github which
always call almost - who would - from
their secretary handlers every time we
tend the route of the application
changes the us do you
me and I find that a bit cumbersome
because every time the world changes the
whole application gets destroyed and we
attached it to the Dom which is which
doesn't map so nicely to the lifecycle
in home which basically has a mount
function which is called as soon as your
UI gets mounted into the dorm one that's
called when is removed and one which is
called when the state changes and what
we did here we moved our human toe out
right into the application state and
from our callbacks which is called from
signature we went the world mattress we
changed that data and that's basically
it so if the human - ouch matches a
document and some numerical ID we just
update our navigation wave which is a
web browser in the end but we could also
just call swap on the atom of the
application state and move and set the
navigation data which causes the
application to get rear-ended and in our
would component we just use code match
to match on that cue and navigation
route and if it's the dashboard we just
render the dashboard if it's a document
with an ID we just went at the document
and I think that's a quite nice solution
on the routing issue in in Rome in the
client okay
actually I'm way too fast so I'm going
back a bit and talk a bit about the
database again we see the when the
status key in the papers which is
basically a key if the the status if the
application already processed this page
it can be processed it can be ever so in
case there was a bad PDF or something or
if the render process just crashed and
it can also be pending so the page isn't
we're not yet what's interesting in this
here is that we have an interest prefix
keyboard
called processing status which actually
maps to a Jane Eyre Posterous
enumeration so it's typesafe and
inserting into the database
most people many people don't use
enumerations in Postgres
and just use strings for the actual
status which is not typesafe and might
cause issues in so many cases as you can
just insert the wrong data and do manual
checks which is annoying and we wrote
some JDBC code to actual map from
namespace keyboards to these
enumerations in Postgres which is very
cool and makes it so much nicer to use
okay I don't have a slide for that which
is a bit unfortunate sorry
not much I can say okay actually I'm so
fast
modes could talk longer there's much
more we can see we have long polling
implemented as a set which just keeps an
HTTP request open to the server and the
server will respond as soon as something
happens on the bus we implemented SMTP
so as everyone knows every application
has to send our receive email we can
receive email so you can just follow out
your latest your latest invoice from
your mail right to the SMTP server of
people so and it will when other
attachments we have zeroconf implemented
as a component for announcing the
printers which is also pretty trivial
but makes it so much more useful as the
printer will just appear on OS X and in
cups and you can just print to it I can
talk a bit about database schema and how
we can generate it so at the start we
just water SQL ourselves which is the
easiest part but we can use so we can
use or free choice of path squares as we
really like to do as much as possible
there so we have it as easy as possible
but it gets rather cumbersome as we have
to
hooks to every table to update the the
state seek and checks and whatever so in
the end we just wrote some code aligning
and tasks which basically takes strings
for the for the from the SQL and some
metadata around that and generates two
hooks echoing so we didn't use any SQL s
expression to SQL lab we and because it
wouldn't map to all the features we
wanted to use and we just kept it simple
and world five functions or so to
generate our schema yeah we also have
authentication and authorization which
isn't released yet we have it in a
branch so I'm not sure if what's
mentioned it the whole application is
work in progress you can use it we use
it ourselves already but it's not
finished not not even a bit and so a
tenth occasionally authorization is
started we just use friend for
authentication and a pluggable protocol
for authorization so we can implement
different strategies for different
different clients in the end for
different users so we can implement a
single user mode which was just HTTP
basic off we can implement simple groups
and it's all plug-in based in the end
okay I think I'm done with that all
these things are available on github
already even the not yet quite released
feature so you can take a look at the
work and progress branches there too at
our repository and we also welcome you
to I hope that this tour de force of the
architecture and the code gave you like
an idea where to start looking when you
when you want to check it out may be
extended or just use it as a reference
when you want to build your own like
real world application you can maybe
take some ideas out of that and we
licensure that a GPL so be aware of that
when you submit pull requests of course
and I think that we still have some
minutes but first thank you very much
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
