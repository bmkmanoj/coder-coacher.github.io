here at your closure in Berlin and this
this is work that I've done at in
Switzerland at EPFL in the context of
the scallop programming languages so
I'll be mostly showing Skala code and
some of the ideas and maybe don't have
obvious analogs and closure but
hopefully the higher-level messages
would still carry through and so the the
title is generative programming in
verification and the focus is on writing
programs that write programs and doing
it in a principled way so Scala is
widely use in industry and it's also
like closure or language language that
runs on the JVM and on JavaScript and
the Scala aims to be a scalable language
in the sense that you can start with
small scripts and gradually evolve them
to large systems and the language makes
it easy to to write domain-specific
languages or languages inside of hosted
by Scala and it uses a functional
programming and object-oriented
programming so here as an example we can
define some matrix class and then have
overload the x and class operation to
operate on on matrices directly and we
can do this with not not much code but
using using some some features of Scala
so while operator overloading there are
some higher order functions hidden in
these dots there we're using these
reasons this type class in Marek here so
there there's a lot of features that
come together just for this small
example and it's quite nice to be able
to then write concise operations on the
only matrix now one question you may ask
is what about performance and the
wishful thinking is that the compiler or
the Java Virtual Machine will make
confess and the hi realities that you
get orders of magnitude slow down and
the reason is that well of course it's
much harder to go from a slow program to
a fast program than from a small program
to a large program and the reason here
is that we have we are paying the price
of abstraction if we look just at this
at this code then we have well this this
type class indirection because we want
the matrix class to be generic in the
element type as long as it's a numeric
type so this is a type class and then we
also have indirection through this array
field well you get these closures and
megamorph across sites because these for
loops the sugar in two for each method
that take closures and finally you even
have a method call indirection just to
get to the the element of the of the
matrix and really what the problem here
is that as the abstraction and
generalization in our programming
languages grow we really need to mind
the gap with the hardware which has a
much lower level of abstraction and so
one way to think about this is that the
general-purpose compressed compiler acts
as a bottleneck between the programmer
and the hardware and what we would want
instead is something more like this
where we can start with high level
representations for example matrix grab
and do optimizations that are specific
to to these domains and then also
generate optimizations and then lowered
the lower the representation to a
racetrack loops do optimizations there
and continue lowering and so forth and
this is a way to really increase the
bandwidth between the programmer and
hardware so this is the story of the
main specific language optimizations and
how do we really build extensible
compilers so we can have this sort of at
the same time control over over how
things are generated but at the same
time have really like the benefit of of
optimizing at each level
all right so it's well-known that any
problem in computer science can be
solved by another level of indirection
in fact there's a second part to this
quote that is less well known which is
accept problems caused by too many
levels of indirection and performance
problems are often such problems caused
by too many levels of interaction but
what we'll do here is actually use
indirection to solve performance
problems too and this brings us to the
idea of staging so in multi stage
programming what you do is that you
split your stages into multiple parts
and to simplify let's just think of two
stages so you have the code generation
stage and it's still a runtime it still
runs to generate the code but it's one
stage with the code generation and the
other stage would be you have the
generated code and so you can you can
think of various ways to to specify
these multi multi stage languages a
common way is to use quotations to say
that you have generated code well in
Scala what we do is that we we drive the
stages by types and this is using this
lightweight modular staging for making
skele so if you have a bare type int
string T it means execute now during
code generation and if you have a type
wrap of int
wrap of string wrap of T it means
generate code to execute later so in
some ways instead of using explicit
syntactic quotations and anti quotations
to represent the stage here we're just
relying on the type system to to to
distinguish the stages and what this
allows is really this idea of
programming generally and running
specialized so that during the first
stage during code generation you can use
the full power of the host language in
this case Scala to really compose these
code fragments and then when you get to
the second stage you just get these
little code fragments that that are
low-level and they're very much
specialized without any of the generic
features and so if we go back to the
matrix example what we do here is that
the matrix itself is it's just um
part it just exists during cogeneration
but the underlying array is a rep of an
array which means it is part of the
generated code and so here the the wrote
the size of the array are represent so
they are also part of the generated code
and then the indices are also relevant
and and just by adding these these read
web types and also saying that we want
to actually have an array in the
generated code then what happens is that
during the first stage we will execute
say a multiplication and kind of
everything that has to do with matrices
will be will just be executed then but
everything that touches the underlying
array will generate code so the way to
think of this is that as a side effect
of executing the the code generator you
get this intermediate representation
that represents the generated code so
just to be more concrete here if we just
do this matrix multiplication then we
get low-level code generated and this is
already 20 times faster than the then
running the generic programming anyway
and it's still far from optimal but this
gives you the idea and so as I said the
the idea is that you you can think of
the code you write in scala as a as a
domain-specific language where you
specify what are the operation so you
specify this interface that says well I
have a println that takes a wrap of any
and wrap of unit that makes it available
and generated code I have a length
method on my string that takes a rubber
string in a wreck event so this is quite
tedious to do but you do it once for
your for your domain and then you also
have the dsl implementations where here
we say that this wrap of T is actually
either a symbol or a constant and each
symbol points to these definitions with
which are these you can think of them as
these nodes and so when we when we
execute just this simple user code here
what we get as a side-effect is this
sort of C of node representation where
we see okay we have the first print
statement
and then we we have somehow this we take
the length of the string and then we
have the second print statement and it
has a dependency with the first one to
track the effect and be able to do
optimizations and so this is all
specified here where you see that print
is actually effect 'fl but taking the
length is not effect 'fl and you can and
here it's furthermore doing
optimizations as it's constructing the
length okay but to make this more
concrete I will actually do a demo to
show you how it works in a setting and
the problem I will implement is this one
of the Shonan challenges for generative
programming so the idea is that you have
a matrix vector product and often you
want to multiply different vectors with
the same matrix so it pays to generate
code that is specialized to a matrix and
so this is what we want to do and we
will I will I will switch now to to see
that so here ISM is a matrix and some
rules are dense some rules are null and
some of our sparse and then this is a
simple matrix vector product not using
any fancy features it's it's normal sky
where I have two nested for loop and I
kind of just add a multiplication into
the appropriate output vector slot and
then I can run it and this is what I get
so if I change this this vector here it
recompiles and it should recombine in
the background and then here I see a
different result now what we want to do
is do cogeneration and for now this is
all done in an interpreter mode so here
I will add the lms framework to do that
and
okay so now if I do this I'm just
printing hello in the generated code and
returning this the same input which is a
wrap of an array event here so if I want
here I can do some computation so for
example you know I can say well this is
5 and then
that's exemplar and then here it's
recompiling but then if I look at the
output it stays the same because this if
statement has been executed during
cogeneration and so if I change the
condition here then I should get the
other here it's now what happens if
instead of using a known a known value
I do V dot length now V is a rep
therefore V dot length is also a rep
therefore X is a rep event therefore
this whole boolean is not known during
cogeneration it becomes a rep of boolean
and that means that this whole if
statement is not something we can
understand during cogeneration so if you
look at the generated code what happens
is that you actually see this statement
in the generated code and the way this
works is that the if syntactic structure
is overloaded for a rep of boolean and
in general this this this way of
deriving whether something is a rep of
not here it's nice because we can really
rely on Scala's type inference to do it
for us locally within a function
so usually you you just annotate your
your your your function parameters and
then things flow and if there's if there
is a mistake that you need to fix the
the type system Alton okay so now to
address the challenge what we want to do
is change well let me first move this
matrix vector products ID of this driver
because I might want to to change it and
so now we don't need this and I will
just yeah move this here into this
method
so if I do this what do you think will
happen so here what we have is that the
matrix vector brought here we have V as
an array of int but we're passing in a
rep of an array of n so if I look at my
console I get a type error which says
well I found a rep and well I I mean I
here sorry I I found a rep a very event
but I need an array event and so what we
really want is that at this level we
want to make this Arab and that means
that while we know what our array is we
don't know what our vector is and that's
that's a way to think about it like
think of the idea the matrix as known
statically during code generation and
the vector is unknown and dynamic only
known in the second stage and so once I
change this there are a few other things
I need to change like in the example I'm
actually I actually want to create an
array in the second stage and then the
other thing is that here I might be
indexing on with the rep so I need to be
a little bit careful here and the way I
do it is that I will just make the
static every available dynamically with
this magic static static data and I
think if I do this this should compile
yes and now if I look at the generated
code what I get is that it unrolled the
first for loop but not the second one
and the reason is that here I have a
range and here by by default it's a rep
of range so if I want I can put rep of
range in both places and then I get just
two nested loops or I can I can put rep
of range in these two places and then I
get a straight line code where where
everything has been now where the loops
are basically part of code generation so
it's doing all these operations one
after the other
now one thing that would be nice is if
we could generate code for the I mean
basically unroll the null or sparse rows
and then keep the dense will keep the
dense rows world
so during code generation we can do
anything we want and so for example I
can see if the matrix row is sparse so I
can do this by scouting and then saying
if the count is less than three then
it's fires and in that case we want to
unroll and in the other case I want to
leave it as a red of range so now if I
do this it runs and then here I can see
that maybe three is a bit too
let's change
so if the number of entries that it's
non zero is less than two yes
let me just
okay I I forgot to actually select the I
here saying that I want one over here oh
I was I was basically counting the whole
whole array okay so if I do this then
yeah that's good so now I have the first
one is rolled and then the rest is
straight line code or I guess it depends
what value I put here if I put three it
might change it a bit yeah so now I have
the rest in Street Franklin okay so as
you see you have very fine control over
the generated code and during code
generation you can really do what you
want
in particular here one thing that's not
so nice is that we've dedicated the code
a little bit just to do this this dis
unrolling so it could be nice if we
could define something like this where I
say unroll if sparse and then this and
in Scala because you can overload the
for each then you can do this as well
I'm not going to go into the details but
this is how it will look to to basically
encapsulate this pattern and then I can
do and probably you would put it in a
library if you are doing this often and
then here it compiles and the code
should stay the same and it does it
stays the same because we've only
changed we haven't really changed the
meaning we've only made it made the
abstraction lighter okay so this was
just to give you an idea of what it's
like to program in this generative
setting where it's really driven by the
types I mean one way to think about it
if you're from familiar with other ways
to do a specialization is that here the
like for example partial evaluation is
that here that we rely on the Scala type
system to do the binding time
propagation and the Scala type checking
does the the binding time checking for
these stages and such
and otherwise another thing that's
that's important is to think that
semantically the code you write you can
start with a version that is just
interpreted and slow and then
progressively turn it into something
that generates code and that is fast so
that's quite a nice pattern all right so
here if we continue we we in this
context of generative programming there
are some patterns that are commonly seen
so one is this idea of deep linguistic
reuse where you can use any feature you
want of the host language during code
generation and not pay the price in the
generated code and you really have the
illusion that you have all this power
and this is particularly useful for an
embedded domain-specific languages where
you can have a very small intermediate
representation or a very low-level
intermediate representation for example
only first order functions and still use
higher-order functions during
cogeneration to to compose these things
and one pattern
I'm particularly fond of is this
interpreter to compiler pattern and yeah
that's that's one that I've I like to
also like I mean I find it nice because
even if you don't use the particular
framework of NMS in Scala it's still a
useful idea to have to to to turn an
interpreter into a compiler and you can
apply it in other settings so the basic
idea is that here we've seen that
staging is a is a process that produces
code and then an interpreter is
something that takes code in an
additional input for that code and
produce a result so this is a very
general definition of an interpreter and
we can even think of a simple regular
expression match sure as an interpreter
so the code would be the regular
expression and the inputs would be the
the district to match against and the
result would be a boolean and now we can
put these two pictures together and get
this staged interpreter
and what we want is that we want the
code to be available during the first
stage but we keep the input to the code
symbolic and then we get this generated
code where we actually give the input to
get the result
so in our regular expression matter
example what we would do is that the
regular expression would be available
and then the input we would make
symbolic by just changing from a string
to our above string and then we will
generate code that is completely
specialized to one regular expression
and only has some statements when it's
dealing with the input and then we can
execute it on an actual input to get the
boolean result so this is the two-stage
process and this idea is well known
since the 70s and the partial evaluation
literature it's one of the few time
where projections so the idea is that by
by specialization you can turn and you
can turn an interpreter on a given
program into a compiled version of this
program and if you if you have a process
that can do this for any given program
then you really have a compiler and
furthermore you can take it to higher
levels so if you have a process that can
do this for any interpreter you have a
compiler generator and so in the context
of staging what is interesting is that
we we do have manual control over this
process so we can really choose what
optimizations we can do so the case
study and tutorial as well with the
sequel engine we mean me and my
colleague chakram with the sequel engine
in five hundred lines of code and we
start with a plain query interpreter and
then just to this process of staging of
adding these web types we turned it into
a compiler and then we can do further
steps where we optimize data structures
and furthermore instead of generating
scalar code we can generate C code and
there also use memory mapping to really
optimize the I mean to avoid any copying
of string when we're reading a CSV file
and just by doing this you we can
outperform
standard database systems even though
these are highly optimized at their
heart the sequel engine is still just an
interpreter so by generating code you
can really be faster just just by
getting rid of all the overhead of
interpretation and so just to give an
idea of how this works so one one idea
is to start first with a sort of generic
support library where we can say okay
you you can process a CSV file and for
each line for each record you want to do
something and so this you can implement
with a few lines of code and Scala and
then you can start at an either higher
level where you say okay you have a
sequel a sequel query and then you can
use any any parser strategy you want so
parser combinators or others to turn
this sequel query into an AST of
relational algebra operator so here
we're doing a print of a project because
we're only selecting the name and then
we're filtering this goes for the word
closed and then here we're scanning from
this data and then you can just
implement an interpreter for that so
it's also it doesn't take much many
lines of code and one one way to read
this is that basically you you're
executing an operator and then this
yield is a is a function from a record
to unit so what you do for each record
so it's clear for example in the filter
case what you do is you recursively
execute the parent so the the operation
inside the filter and then for each
record you get here you just do an if
depending if the predicate is true then
you actually use the record and here I'm
omitting the this eval like how you
evaluate a predicate but it's basically
just another small interpreter okay so
this this is nice because interpreters
are are much more more straightforward
to write in compilers and I mean and
this is how you would do a almost
semantics of what it means to to
interpret these
the sequel queries as these operators
here and so now how do we stage it well
we just add some reps somewhere and the
idea here is that we make the fields
dynamic so unknown during code
generation but the schema is static
still and here we have a few options we
can put we can say we have a rep of an
array which means that we know not we
don't know anything about the array but
in this case we can probably assume that
we because we have the schema we could
actually also do an array of a of a rep
of string instead of a record of an
array of string and this is what we do
in our in our actual code but but here
to simplify we show it this way and both
ways work and they just generate
different shapes of codes like do you
want to have arrays in the generated
code or do you just want to have field
like variable manipulation and so then
when you run a particular user program
we're really specializing this code to
this user program so what happens is
that we get rid of the record
abstraction and we get rid of the schema
indirection
so this is this is a like the intuition
of what goes on here and then on top of
this if we start with the full
interpreter we can still get to this
sort of code because the the the
overhead of interpreting the I mean the
the the actual query is known during
code generation so the whole overhead of
this execution is is taken care of
during code generation and so a few
things that that you can notice in this
code one is this idea of mixed age data
structure where you have an object that
has both parts that are unknown and
parts that are known and that comes up
quite a lot and the other is this idea
of a staging time function where you
have a function of your reading on reps
but it's not the function itself doesn't
exist in the generated code and this is
very common this is a very common
pattern to to then just use these
functions for composition during code
generation and not pay any price okay
so one thing I want to talk about next
is pricing and validation because these
are these are cases where security can
be a concern and so what do you do if
you're generating this low-level code
how do you actually ensure that it
doesn't have any security
vulnerabilities and in terms of parsing
if you look at a high performance
parsers like for example the one that
was originally part of xing and later
nodejs
it's really written in this sort of a
hand optimized sort of low-level state
machine like code so here what you do is
that you have a current state and
depending on the on the characters you
decide how you go to the next state so
it's very low-level it can be very
verbose I mean the for an HTTP parser
it's about 2,000 such lines and of
course that makes it difficult to
maintain difficult to really understand
what's going on at a glance and one one
approach is to use parser Combinator's
and there you can write a parser with an
order of magnitude less code and then
it's fairly easy to change the behavior
as well so here the way to read this is
that a response is the status followed
by headers and then headers are
repetition of headers and then a header
itself has a header name and some
property that is the rest of the line
and so on so it's it's more it's more
understandable and you can generate
low-level Scalla code that is fairly
competitive with Eng seeing with the the
the low-level code on the previous page
and you can also further generate C code
and then it is actually competitive but
then and just to give an idea of how
this works so the parser itself only
exists during staging time it's one of
those staging time abstractions so this
it's a function that only exist during
code generation that takes some rep and
returns some parse result in
continuation passing style that also has
some reps inside so the
the work of of composing these parsers
together like as we do here we're
composing them the law of this work gets
done during cogeneration and then you're
left with low-level work that is just
accessing the input and so on and so at
the end you end up with with code that
is that is a very large but very simple
okay so for performance this works great
and what about security
and in the context of HTTP parsing there
there have been major vulnerabilities
for all all the old owners well all the
well-known HTTP server so annexing and
apache and here i found two bugs that
are related to this to two parsing this
this chunked requests and because they
have to they have to do with an integer
overflowing the size of the of the of
the chunks of and then basically using a
classic buffer flow attack and you can
then execute arbitrary code on a remote
server so it's quite serious so what we
we looked at was to try to do both
generative programming and verification
so the idea is that we generate
low-level C code but we can also
generate annotations that allow standard
tools to then verify that the C code is
correct in some way secure or
functionally correct and the bet is that
by starting at a high level we can
really get rid of the tediousness of
doing this because we have all the
information to generate the right
annotations so in the case of the issued
parser what we did is that we well we
started with about three hundred lines
of scalar code and then just by adding a
few lines of proofs to describe the
annotations which expand to many more
lines and in the C code we are able to
to completely verify that the parser is
free of memory and
a few errands so then that makes it get
that's that's like a guarantee there and
this was not much work in terms of lines
of code I mean I mean you can oh and and
and in other settings the same thing is
possible for functional correctness so
we have a few key studies where we do a
linear algebra library or or like just
simple generic sorting and so on and
just to give an idea of how this works
well one thing that's really useful in
that context is type classes again what
it allows you to do is is define
basically go from from something that is
parametric to something that is generic
where you still know something about
what you're manipulating so for example
here we can add deep equality on some
type T or we can have this way of going
from from a data structure to its
underlying representation in the
generated code and back and we can also
add representation in variant to the to
the code and so just to give an example
in one page we can do this for vector so
a vector would be a pointer and then a
length as well and so we can define
these things and then insensate it and
from this we get a lot of code so I'm
just showing you but the general idea is
that we generate both specification and
this a CSL language so these are the
annotations and also code that allows
you to verify that I mean and also code
for the same thing so here for example
we generate a predicate for what
equality means for vector of it and then
we can generate code that also has this
equality of a vector of any time ensure
that they they match and this is useful
then to do further verification and yeah
so here the we have to also generate all
these loop invariants and so on but it's
from the high level it's quite
straightforward to do and another thing
to note to notice is if I would give you
a chance is that
the representation of the vector of
integers and the vector of vector of
integers just naturally Falls from how
you define these type classes so for a
vector of integers you get an init for
the length and then a pointer for the
element array and the validity ensures
that you can you have you have a valid
range there and then for a vector a
vector of integer you get this sort of
exporting structure where you have a
length for the outer a vector and then
an in star for the array of the inner
length by outer index and then finally
an any star start to get to the actual
element array so this was all this
naturally fell out of the of the type
classes and composes nicely so just to
to to close on this I would with this
work we showed that okay the the success
story of of generative programming in
high-performance computing can also
carry over to safety critical domains
and this is one way we you can do it
with this approach to generate a
verification and the main takeaway is
that it works well when the properties
to vary size fit the spreading staging
time abstractions so as for performance
sometimes you need to change how you
look at your at your problem in order to
to be able to to generate a fast code
okay and so yeah in terms of things to
read further so if you if you're
interested and want to look in more
details I would recommend this paper to
start with my colleague Joe Crump and it
goes it's a functional bird so it's
supposed to be accessible it goes
through how to go from a sequel to C
compiler in 500 lines of code and this
this work has been part of a larger
effort in particular with Stanford where
they use the framework to work on the
main specific languages and big data on
heterogeneous device now okay so and on
this website you can learn more and well
how does this translate to closure so
I'm not sure I hope I hope that one
thing you can take away is that when you
when you try
to to turn an interpreter into into a
compiler that's even a common pattern in
the Lisp community I mean there are
textbook examples and structure
interpretation of computer program or
paradigms of artificial intelligence
programming and there you see that what
they do is that they really start with
the vanilla interpreter and then they be
changed by just omitting code for each
step in a sense deferring the stages and
so staging is a really conceptually a
nice framework to think about this sort
of thing and if you're trying to do more
advanced optimizations it also helps to
think about it in terms of these
multiple stages yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
