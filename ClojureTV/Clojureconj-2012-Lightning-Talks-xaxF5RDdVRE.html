wanted to start working on the clothes
arts project and the first thing I
noticed when
was there was no test suite whatsoever
so and I'm a big fan of tests for my
programs particularly ones that are
acceptance tests that say the user
actually logs in and when they log in
they can view you know their photostream
if it's something that direction towards
this end I've built a couple of
libraries for doing ring interaction and
testing the first one we'll talk about
is called peridot it is basically a port
of rack test if you're familiar with
that from the Ruby community it uses the
thread first macro to simulate an
iterative aren't an imperative
interaction you start first by creating
a session and then you can actually do a
request in this particular case we're
doing a request to a login and actually
passing some parameters keyword
parameters through uses ring mock
underneath so these actually are the
exact keywords that you see in the ring
spec for your requests you've also are
able to do things like follow
redirections if you get a redirect at
that point it parses it out and figures
out what the URL and creates the next
request and such for you this example
does a request follows redirect and then
actual logs in as a user follows a
redirect and then actually looks at the
task has an example has a dot dot dot
there for creating a task and will then
go and actually view the test the task
and this is a little bit beyond what
ring mock itself will do because it will
actually parse out the cookies for you
and keep those around in a cookie jar so
that as you're moving along through the
session you actually stay logged in as
that particular user as part of the what
it what each one of these actions return
is a little hash map hash state state
map there you go it contains the last
response and the request that was used
during that interaction so you can
actually pull those out and test against
those particular values for that point
in the
in your in your interaction I there's
the app and the cookie jar as I have
already mentioned and there's a couple
of extra things they're down at the
bottom for content type and headers
because it's nice to be able to say for
all future requests in this session I
want to use the JSON content type
because I'm actually testing say a JSON
API and so this works this looks
decently well for you know hitting user
or you use hitting a API endpoints but
it doesn't really represent what a user
does whenever they interact with your
application there we have the we've
manually put in where the login URL we
have the parameters wet with the
username and password we've manually put
those in ourselves and there's this
whole HTML view if you do an HTML site
where you also have to place those
particular elements than if you get
those out of sync you've got to go fix
all of your tests if they break and I
prefer something a little bit more what
it looks actually like what a user does
so to that end I built a library called
keratin and this is inspired by a
library called capybara from the Ruby
world here's an example of logging it
with it you start a session you go visit
the actual root page and then you can
tell it to fill in these elements on the
form with the particular login name and
the password and you can tell it to go
press this button and in this case
follow the redirect around this uses in
live underneath to actually parse the
HTML to figure out what the different
nodes are and actually to update them as
you do the the format in the form
interaction since you don't always have
fields particular in this case this
looks at the labels for say the login
looks at the label and then finds the
the text field associated with it to do
the username you don't always have
labels so it also allows you to do
siesta the end live selector syntax to
choose what HTML elements your inner
teen with in addition there's a with
inform that I added up on that slide
that was not on the previous one that
allows you to scope all of the
interactions in the body to that
particular section of the HTML in
addition I like to be able to go through
a portion of the test to do some
interaction with website and then
actually test some of the that I'm
actually getting what I expect and then
continue on so caradin has a selection a
small selection at the moment of test
helpers you wrap them in the has
function and in this case we're actually
checking whatever we go to the root page
did we get a 200 response status and
does it have does the page text actually
have hello world in it so it actually
parses out you know ghost uses in live
and checks through the HTML and gets out
what's in the body and checks the text
for that and then once we've done those
particular tests we can will actually
continue running and will as you see
that I can do a following of a link in
this case to whatever recent would be
this works by hooking into closure test
as through some of the underlying
mechanisms of it I don't have anything
for expectations or midge as I do not
particularly use those ones yet let's
see in the future there's still some
additions that need to be made peridot
for example doesn't really support
nested parameters so it'd be nice to
actually have those go in where if you
have the wrap nested parameters a middle
where it can actually keep those in line
as you would expect that actually might
end up being better off in ring blocks
so if i get when i get to that it might
end up being a patch in that direction
in addition caradin doesn't yet support
all of the different HTML elements i
need to make it understand things about
checkboxes and radio buttons and drop
downs and then just figure out what else
works good for test helpers not on here
is I'd like to eventually have it
ability to say instead of using peridot
in life can you instead use clj
webdriver as part of this session so
that you can actually do javascript you
know testing so that whatever you
actually start you have your HTML page
and you had a little bit of Ajax you
don't have to port you know whatever in
your test suite it is that now has to do
with the Ajax call you can just flip a
switch hopefully there are where they
are on github that's my URL and Twitter
handle or if you want twitter handle if
you want to follow me and if you want to
see some examples of keratin actually in
use if you go check out the closures
test suite there are lots of examples of
it this is actually what the reason I
ended up building these particular tools
for thank you hi I'm Dan Liz reporter I
frequently known on the Internet as a
periodic and I'm someone who until five
or six years ago would have destroyed
myself as primarily a visual artist and
now I like to call myself a programmer
and the reason for that change is
processing so if you haven't heard of it
processing is a programming language
environment that was designed with the
aim of encouraging programming among the
visual arts so it's got a three for
drying API that's sort of similar to
HTML canvas but it has a lot of other
capabilities besides it can do 3d can do
video rendering audio input audio
synthesis it can talk to our jury knows
it can get inputs from connects a whole
bunch of stuff so the knee handy thing
about processing is that under the hood
it's really just in the Java libraries
so that means we can use it in closure
and that's where coal comes in it was
originally started as clj processing by
roland sadowski it was now primarily
maintained by Sam Aaron who gave it the
quill moniker and it's just a wrapper
around processing that makes it a lot
more pleasant to use enclosure than if
we had to do a lot of Java interrupt so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
walk you through creating a pretty
simple cool sketch in the next six and a
half minutes or so what this sketch is
going to do is it's going to implement a
common visual trope among Hollywood
gooeys and game
and other flashing interfaces that don't
really do anything where you have a lot
of spinning circular arc segments nested
inside one or the other so let's get
started I've got my project here that i
just recently created with line new the
only thing i've added to the project at
clj is the quilted patency down here at
the bottom I pre-warned my Swank server
so it is Oh God how do i do that i don't
know how to use my terminal okay that's
still not big enough what's that big
enough okay color is bad I don't know
how to change the color all right um I
really hope you can see if you can't I'm
very sorry it should find me after so
the first thing I'm going to do is
define the one true circle constant tau
I just find it a lot easier to reason
about than 2 pi so the first question we
probably want to ask ourself as
conscientious clojure ians is what sort
of data we're going to need we're going
to need some way of describing the arcs
that we want to draw and this is so like
I said this is not going to be idiomatic
closure code because we're initiating
processing underneath so we're going to
need a place to put this that the draw
loop can find because the draw loop
can't take any arguments so I'm going to
define an atom called arts and it just
contains the empty vector for now and so
now I need a way of making one of my arc
objects so I'm going to define a
function to do that it takes one
argument which is the index this is the
way that it'll be able to set a
different radius free charge that's not
so there are four properties to each arc
it has a position on the unit circle
where it starts as an angular width that
it spans it has a radius and some
angular velocity so the new arc function
just creates a map with all of those
properties and fills them in with some
nice-looking random values that I won't
explain
so there are two fundamental functions
to every quill sketch the first one is
called set up its run once at the
beginning of your sketch and it's a good
place to set up any initial state or
configure things that will be constant
throughout the entirety of your sketch
and the other one is called draw and
this is your main loop this is what
actually draw stuff to the screen it's
called by default 60 times a second so
let's fill in set up there's not much
happening here the only configuration we
do is call smooth to turn on anti soon
make everything nice and pretty and then
15 times over we're just going to make a
new art arc and swap it into the end of
the Ark's Adam so now we're ready to go
into the draw function there's a few
lines happening the few lines here but
only really two basic things going on
this block here just sets up some visual
properties of the sketch we're going to
draw a black background every frame
we're going to turn off filling in
objects so we just get the borders of
the Arts rather than the full pie slice
we're going to make them pure white
stroke make them 10 pixels wide and give
them score caps and so after we finish
doing that we can move on to actually
drawing them so we first by default the
origin is in the top left as you
probably expect if you're familiar with
graphics programming and we're just
going to move that down to the middle
with a translate the translation matrix
is reset every frame so we're not going
we don't have to worry about scooting
off to the bottom right of the frame and
then we just iterate over all of our arc
max for side effects we pull out the
position within radius properties and
then we can just use quills art function
to actually do the drawing it takes six
arguments the first two are the X&amp;amp;Y
positions at the center of the arts
ellipse the next two are the semi-major
and semi minor axis lengths on and we
want circular arc so we're just going to
give it the radius or both of those and
then the last two are the angular
positions to start and stop drawing the
arc so we're going to start at the
position and stop at the sum of the
position and the width so now we have
all the functions we need the last thing
we need to do is actually define a set
and
get off and we do that with the desk
sketch macro so there are three
important keyword arguments to this
macro the first is the size which is
just a two vector defining the width and
the height of the sketches window and
then it needs to know the names of our
setup and draw functions which in this
case are just set up and draw so let me
open up crab so here's a very cramped
for evil let's evaluate everything and
now we have some marks so you might be
asking me I that I told you the arts
would be spinning and they are clearly
not so let's fix that I have a habit of
where I like to separate out the part of
my draw function that actually changes
the state from the part that just does
the drawing and you like to put that in
a function called dick bang so this is
not very much happening here we're just
going to loop through all of our I arcs
and pull out the position and velocity
keys and then we just update the
position to be the sum of the position
of velocity and then once we have the
shifted arcs we just reset the atom to
contain the new ones so we can define
this and go down and call tick at the
beginning or a draw function and
redefine it and you go back and you'll
notice without us having to do anything
the sketch is picked up on our new draw
function and now the arcs are all
spinning this is really cool because it
means we can do a lot of experimentation
basically instantaneously so let's say
we wanted to make the ark sticker just
happens we can make them bright pink Oh
have to redefine and so this is really
great because it allows you to do lots
of experimentation really fast which is
what I found so seductive about
programming in the first place so that
was a little taste of quill if you want
to talk to me more about creating art
with code check out some 3d printed
sculptures I made with quill finally
around later and thanks for listening
good afternoon my name is Hugh Goodman I
worked with Lisp NYC and my day job is
at Brander group we're an amazon web
services company and shockingly we like
to do our software development in lisp
however during the day this is what I'd
really like to do a whole bunch of
nothing one day my wife walked up to me
and asked are you happy and yeah sure
I'm on my own private island I'm very
happy yeah but she said are you really
happy are you like jump up and down
happy and like a typical guy I said well
yeah I'm happy whatever then she said
really how happy are you and this is
when the alarm bells went off in my head
because my wife is a dated junkie she
likes to collect data she likes to
manage data she likes to graph it over
time she likes to do everything you can
think of it it's amazing and what she's
interested now is quantifying happiness
really what she wants to do is track her
happiness over time as well as what
she's doing at the time to see if
there's any correlation and also
long-term trends so really the things
she's looking for now is capturing
contacts have something easy to use that
she can use anywhere and myself my very
simple needs we are however a mixed
mixed couple she has android I have
Android and she has iphone so we're not
gonna be writing any phone apps instead
I'm just going to whip out a simple
little web app how hard can this be and
this when I this is when I started
thinking about it cuz at my day job we
have hundreds of hosts however they're
all being used and personally I have
dozens and I don't really need another
one and there's a lot to owning host for
an initial setup to maintenance security
updates there's some non-trivial amazon
stuff if you do it up there monitoring
and if you have monitoring and then you
get
ages and really I just don't want that
and ultimately the monetary cost is it
doesn't matter to me I just don't want
another host all I want is a simple web
app and this is when I started looking
at Heroku it's really a simple cloud app
platform it's very easy to do you it's
sold as a service so basically you're
close your app is up and running and
basically what you don't do is manage a
whole lot of stuff they're going to be
taking care of host failures data center
problems all things with security as
well as anything that has to happen with
the update as when I fact you've
probably seen in the news last week I
spent almost the entire week just
watching New York City datacenters go up
and down and then three days later when
the gasoline ran out the same thing
happened in New Jersey and yeah I had
apparently plenty of machines to worry
about but Heroku wasn't one of them and
rights doctor for her Brooke who is
actually really easy you just hack out
your closure you update it with get
basically you sent it right up to Heroku
and they will launch it and manage it on
their servers you can then point accom
to it and you're all set Heroku
conveniently runs on Amazon you've
probably heard of ec2 for their virtual
machines everything else I have dozens
of other services which are really nice
s3 is reading recently come out with a
new version where they're charging a
doll I mean a penny a gigabyte and
that's that's really game changer they
also offer databases the queuing service
has saved my bacon more than once and
stuff like this so really for my simple
happiness web app what I want to do is
collect data I went to store data and
then I also want to send out collection
reminders throughout the day with both
both text messages as well as email so
you can get randomized samples this
means a simple web app is suddenly
becoming a little more sophisticated now
you have to deal with the database as
well as either mail server or some sort
of service for dealing with all that and
these are two more services that I do
not want to manage much less two more
hosts and with Amazon Andrew
go we can do that so the dye my time i
bought the calm which is me ometer you
tell all the good ones are taken to the
two when it was up and running was a
total time of four hours and really only
about half of that was involved in the
technology side and it is indeed very
simple I'll ask for is your name the
context that you're doing and then a big
giant button of how happy are you
clearly everybody hears a nine ding once
you entered in some information that
will give you some happiness back will
throw up a little little quote and
actually i think i spent about half the
time looking for quotes seriously it's
not that easy and every other time you
login it's even easier it doesn't need
to know who you are because it has a
cookie and a matter of fact you know if
you have to tell what you're doing you
can just give it a number of boom it
knows the date all this is being stored
in a database actually and works great
on phones as well as tablets etc this is
the code base it's shockingly 54 lines
long this includes the inlined HTML the
everything to deal with the database the
form processing is here too i also put
in something so if you type in test it
doesn't actually store it so i can test
the infrastructure and just see if
things are working and yeah and it's
basically a quick little jetty app the
moral of the story is that the use of
simple services really allows you a lot
of flexibility especially when it comes
to management and total cost of
ownership you know it seriously matters
for me i'd much rather have just a few
deal with a few servers then hundreds of
servers and especially when we have
clients with small needs you know that
might necessarily need a need a server
that that's typically the the problem
people walk in the doors that we need 50
servers usually need one we need a
server sometimes they don't need any
this is where kuroko comes in and yeah
it really does make me very happy
thank you all right so uh yeah thank you
um yes so I I have a Raspberry Pi in my
bag they're really cool the one I have
in my bag is running closure it's great
but I'm not gonna talk about it so if
you are interested in the Raspberry Pi I
want to see one find me I kind of
switched topics of last minute just
because this is where my head is right
now and I'm like fully loaded on frp and
I've reached some crystal of
understanding that I wish to convey so
functional reactive programming it's a
thing I work at a place called low no
cloud where I've been doing a lot of
closure script recently to write
web-based visualization tools for
various cloud tools that we operate so I
once again found myself in the world of
web programming and call back hell and
I've heard things about frp and over the
past few weeks but the help of my
co-workers and a few friends I think
I've reached a light at the end of the
tunnel so I'm gonna try this explanation
on you guys if I'm not doing a good job
maybe I'll just switch back over to
talking about raspberry pi but here we
go so what is frp it is a fundamentally
a programming paradigm or what is a
paradigm well a paradigm is usually
delivered to us in the form of and
implementation which is either some
language or some library or some
combination of language and library if
you look at all the effort p stuff
that's out there to include the papers
in some of which i've scanned and all
the various implementations whether
their languages libraries or frameworks
to key ideas stick out the first is the
notion of a time varying value and i'm
using terminology from my favorite paper
which is the flapjacks paper but they
talk a lot about time varying values
which one way to think about them
enclosure terms as is as reference types
however in closure if you want to know
the value of a reference like you you
are the one responsible for asking the
question the value is not pushed to you
you dereference it with the little you
know at symbol reader macro these time
varying values are reference types the
value of which changes over time
that value is conveyed to consumers as a
stream of changes so time bring values
once you have these time varying values
these streams of changes then you can
work with them in a similar way to
working with sequences enclosure with
the sequence library you have these
streams of events that you can you know
compose or interleave or transpose in
the same way we're used to working with
sequences what this does is allow you to
program with events as if they were
values one of the other themes and a lot
of the papers is this point that's made
that whenever you're working with
callbacks or watches you don't have
types you know a call back as a void
type for those of us in closure it means
we don't have a value it's you know
usually the function that adds a
callback is void it doesn't return
anything and of course callbacks are not
value so what this allows one to do is
work with events as streams of values
and composed in the same way we would
any stream of any value soon there's
tons of stuff again I'm going to go over
it all of the stuff listed except for
flapjacks is either on a platform I can
use for operational reasons is too much
is too little or just sucks so of all of
these I like flapjacks and that's what
I'm going to talk about what does
slapjacks give us so a lot of the frp
solutions claim to give you all kinds of
stuff to you know that help you solve
all kinds of things in the domain you
know this is this is how you build web
apps now we give you a templating line
to go language and graphics stuff
flapjacks just gives us one thing which
is this ability to turn events into
streams of events so that we can work
with them like values and in a browser
there are a couple different flavors of
event there are user events you know Bob
click the button there events that come
from the Dom that you may or may not
have initiated like success of Annie
Jack's call back and in a lot of systems
with events you have scheduled or
periodic events like heartbeats or
refresh the buddy list every minute flat
Jack's gives us tools for working with
all those kinds of events and then again
once their streams there's this general
notion of consumption and generation and
fusion and filtering and so on what
flapjacks
is a general set of tools for doing what
a lot of people who work with events
Noah's wiring you know we talk about
wiring up the mock-up wiring up our
program this is a genuine
general-purpose wiring library for
wiring to other behaviors in the browser
demo time so how's that look look
awesome so we're traveling back in time
oh maybe the full screen is a little too
awesome
how's that yeah all right so what we're
looking at here is the sort of the
Fibonacci or the factorial of browser
event things which is you know we're
going to add some numbers together in a
cool way so you'll you know I can do
this thing where I can tab between these
fields and change the values of the
fields and they get summed up and
printed at the bottom interesting thing
to note if x 0 all these out or some of
them are empty it does the right thing
so there's some ground value for the
bees event sources in this case 0 if I
type in something that you can't be
meaningfully sung like you know some
string nothing blew up so you know at
least this experience is not
unsophisticated it does some amount of
error handling and things happen as i
type what is the code for this well here
it is what we're looking at here do a
little so this is all of the closure
code that drives all the behavior on the
page we just saw I'm going to walk
through each function there are these
five functions and explain the bits of
flapjacks that are relevant to this
closure script the first function is
kind of a helper function called
parsefloat that takes a string and a
default value to return in case that
string can't be parsed as a number so
this is the sort of guard that
percolates a number through the event
streams if there isn't an input in the
text field or if it's a string that
parsefloat doesn't doesn't work with so
that's just that that's just a simple
function there's no event stuff
happening the next thing we do is define
a function called extract number E and
you'll see this when you're working with
flapjacks this convention of the capital
e at the end that's the convention for a
function that returns an event stream
object where an event stream is an
object that's part of the flapjacks API
that represents a stream of events so
here we're creating a stream of events
that's backed by an HTML element with
the ID ID we're using flapjacks is
map which is specialized for mapping
over events and we're mapping over each
event with parsefloat so every time the
HTML elephant element we specify
generates an event like has a new value
we run parsefloat on it and then that
gets applied whoever is consuming the
stream the next thing we do is define
what in flapjacks is that behavior so
things that end in capital e our event
streams things that end in capital B are
called behaviors in flapjacks world
these are those time varying values that
I was talking about and the difference
they have with event streams is they
represent a value even if an event has
not yet been fired so for instance when
I open the page I didn't get any errors
or anything that's because the inputs
are behaviors and I had the ability to
specify a default value so what is the
value of this thing before anybody has
fired an event on it that's what a
behavior is and then finally now that we
have expressed all of the inputs on our
page in terms of behaviors we can start
to compose behaviors and this is the
kind of composition that you just there
are no means of composition no
legitimate saying means of composition
for callbacks or watches so this is
where we start to really reap the
benefits of working with behaviors
because here we're defining a thing
called some B which is a function of one
or more or zero or more behaviors that
allows us to apply a function to the
snapshot values of those behaviors
together and then return another
behavior so we're looking at a system
where we have inputs we lift them up to
this flapjacks behavior level and now we
can define new behaviors expressed in
terms of existing behaviors that are
totally general and not coupled to even
the Dom lastly we have a function
calculate and this is what actually does
all the wiring in and causes things to
happen when we load the page up but it's
a function that takes a target ID placed
up with the sum and some source IDs and
here we map our extract number be over
the source IDs actually I'm going to
flip open the HTML going on here so I
have an onload which calls my closure
script function with the idea of the
thing to put the results and the idea of
the input
and then here are the inputs down here
so this function takes the ids wires
them together and then we're using one
of the few io functions that comes with
flapjacks which is a function called
insert value B which will continue it
continuously update an attribute at an
HTML element of your choosing with a
value given a behavior there's also an
insert value e to do the same thing with
event streams so that's pretty much it I
plinkman out of time for almost two
hours now according that thing so I
guess I'll just stop with spiked heels
time needless to say there's a lot of
fun stuff to do with events and i'm
working on a closure script for it if
you want to talk about it i think it's a
general-purpose evaluation model that
could also work on closure on the JVM
for doing interesting things and thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
