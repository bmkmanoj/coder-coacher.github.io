to be talking about random number
generators and how they relate to
functional programs I'm going to do that
because I think it's interesting and I
could talk about it for its own sake but
also it's become relevant to me at work
as a user and contributor to the test
check library so I'm going to jump right
in so if you if you use the JVM whether
from closure or anywhere else you're
probably familiar with this clash
java.util random this is the the
built-in random number generator you can
use it by passing it a seed to construct
a new generator and then you can ask for
four numbers and it will give you random
looking numbers which is which is what
you expected so that's good however this
is a stateful mutable object and we hate
that but we know we can take imperative
algorithms and translate them into
functional algorithms so how about we
try to rewrite this in a pure functional
immutable style enclosure all right here
we go we're done all we had to do is
switch to the next slide and the code
was written we have a create function
takes a seed and returns an immutable
data structure and then we have a next
int function that'll take that data
structure this time it will return a
pair there'll be a random number and
also a new random number generator which
we need now that we're doing immutable
things that new random number generator
helps us get more numbers if we need
more than one otherwise because it's
immutable and it's a pure function you
just get the same number over and over
again if you just use the same object
okay so let's see how this gets used
starting on line 9 we can we can create
a new random number generator with the
seed it looks like how it's printed on
line 12 we can pass it to the next int
function and we'll get that pair the the
first the left half of the pair is a
random number it's the same number from
line for and then the right half is a
new generator if we call next int with
the same argument we get the exact same
result same number same new generator
and then if we call it with the new
generator instead on line 17 we'll get a
different number different generator and
that number on line 18 happens
the same number as on line 6 so looks
like we've succeeded in reproducing the
same algorithm but in an immutable style
so that's good immutability is good
makes the program more robust this seems
like a clear win however these kinds of
generators actually severely constrict
what kind of programs you can write the
the mutable and the immutable kind have
the same drawbacks but they manifest in
different ways and we will get into that
but for for writing pure functional
programs and composing them in a clean
way what we really need is called a
splittable random number generator and
that's what this talk is going to be
about so this is our basic roadmap we're
going to the toxin two parts will first
talk about split ability how it relates
to program composition will do some
examples talk about definitions there'll
be a longer example from real life with
test check and then the second half of
the talk will be about implementing
splittable random number generators
enclosure I should clarify that case
there's any doubt all of this talk is
going to be about see tible purely
deterministic random number generators
anything that's non deterministic I'm
pretending doesn't exist and i'm also
not addressing cryptographic randomness
at all my talk is not necessarily not
related to that but it's probably not
related ok so first I have the talk
split ability in composition we're going
to start with a an example of a function
that we're going to try to write from
different approaches so here's a
function it's called pair of lazy seeks
this is going to be a a deterministic
function that takes a seed and it's
supposed to return to lazy sequences of
random numbers the the number should be
different between the two sequences they
should look unrelated they should be
fully lazy and they should be
independently lazy so there shouldn't be
any underlying thing tying the two
together where we might worry about
memory leaks at that kind of thing so
there's a few different approaches that
you could try with with a mutable random
number generator will look at one of
them all of them are going to have some
drawbacks
so I think the most naive thing you
could do is write a function that takes
the seed constructs a java.util random
object with that seed on line three and
then use the repeatedly function this is
enclosure core it will take a and return
an infinite lazy sequence of values
produced by calling that function over
and over and over again so in this case
our function simply calls next int on
the closed / java.util random object and
we call repeatedly twice to get two
sequences like we're supposed to so
let's see how this works we can call it
on line one with a seed 42d structure
the the return value into X's and Y's
and then look at the first four numbers
in each sequence the the numbers all
look random they they're different
between the two sequences so so from
this angle it looks like we succeeded
but if we look at it from a different
angle in particular starting on line
seven we we call it the same way same
seed same D structuring and then just
look at the first number in each
sequence the the first number in X's is
negative 1 billion which was the first
number in the exes sequence we saw in
line for but the first number and the
wise is 234 million which is not the
first number we saw on the wise
originally it's actually the second
number from the exes and if you're
familiar with lazy sequences this might
not be surprising we have essentially
two functions that are both referring to
the same stateful object and because of
the laziness which random numbers appear
in which sequence will depend on how you
realize the two sequences so just the
function that we've written is
essentially not deterministic in a
particular kind of way so this is not an
acceptable approach but we can surely if
we write it in pure functional terms it
can't be non deterministic right so we
could just switch to our immutable
random number generator and problems
should go away here's a stab at that we
have a helper function up top that will
take a single random number generator
and return a lazy and infinite lazy
sequence of random numbers so the way
you write this is online for you you
call next int with your generator d
structure that pair that you get back in
to your random number X your new random
number generator and then construct a
list with X and a recursive call to
random numbers using the new random
number generator this works fine you can
actually generate an infinite list of
random numbers this way and then how do
you write pair of lazy seeks you take
your seed you presumably use it to
construct a random number generator
that's the only thing you can do with it
you can pass that to random numbers but
you need a second sequence so you'll
want to call random numbers again and we
don't have anything to call it with you
wouldn't want to call it the same thing
you just get the same sequence what we
really want is the end state of the
random number generator after we're done
generating an infinite number of random
numbers and that kind of thing is not
possible in our universe so we're kind
of stuck there's just no way to write
this so with that I'm going to move to
this slide where we kind of try to
clarify the the space of concepts we're
dealing with the the big realization
i've had is that mutability and split
ability are orthogonal concepts so split
ability is well first i should say what
linear is both of the the random number
generators we've been looking at i'm
going to call linear because all they
can do is generate a logical sequence of
numbers you can never kind of split that
sequence if you need to do two things
that are independent so a splittable
generator augments that functionality
with a split method or function so in
the top left we have linear mutable this
is our java.util random lots of classic
object oriented random number generators
fall in this category the basic API is
you can just ask for a number and you
get another number the immutable version
in the lower left that we looked at
already is will have a function that
returns a pair so it's the only
difference otherwise you're still
getting a sequence of numbers and then
the split of all versions will add a
split function so in the upper right
splittable and mutable we simply add a
method that will mutate the underlying
object you call it on and then return a
new random number generator that should
be independent from the first one and
generate different numbers in the lower
right splittable and immutable we are
going to tweak the API a little bit we
no longer need to return a pair for
next int because we have another way of
getting more random number generators so
we all we need is a Rand end function
that returns a single random number and
then a split function that will take a
generator and return to generators that
should be independent so it's worth
pointing out that the change from
mutable two immutable is a relatively
cosmetic one any given any mutable
random number generator there's some
low-level coding process you can do you
can figure it out to turn it into an
immutable one but going from linear to
splittable is not generally possible
there's no general mechanism for doing
it and as far as i know most of the
research into random number generators
has not been oriented towards split
ability at least not the stuff that has
leaked into popular programming
languages so if you go looking for
random number generators that you can
use in the in your programming language
if you're not in haskell and you're
probably not going to be finding
splittable ones but nevertheless it's
it's crucial for writing larger
functional programs that can be composed
in arbitrary ways maybe have parallel
ism or laziness that kind of thing and
still be fully deterministic okay so
let's look at what how we might
implement this with a splittable
immutable random number generator
actually first I want to clarify that
that in the top right corner the
splittable mutable 1 i'm not going to be
focusing on this much because
immutability is a good thing so while
we're worrying about this stuff we may
as well aim for the bottom right so most
of this talk will be talking about
immutable and splittable generators okay
so writing writing is splittable or
writing our our pair of lazy seeks
function with a splittable generator
online that we have to change random
number stal it'll bit online for we're
now going to call split on the generator
first to get two generators we use one
of them on line five to generate a
number and then we'll construct a list
with the recursive call using the second
generator and then our pair of lazy
seats function is quite easy on online
ten we create a new generator and then
we immediately split it into two and
we'll call random num with each of those
two generators so this this works well
so now I'm going to transition into a
more extended real-life example with
test check so test check is a property
based testing library we use it is you
will describe inputs to possible valid
inputs to your program by writing
generators you can use these generators
to randomly generate lots and lots of
different inputs and then you also write
properties that describe things that
should be true about your program no
matter what input you put in and then
the the test check framework can simply
run tests by generating lots of random
inputs and checking the properties
against them so this will be the basic
example we work with if you're not
familiar with generators this code up
top will not make sense but what it does
is it generates a pair of will call X's
and X where X is is a non-empty list of
numbers and X is one of the numbers in
those lists so you can see some sample
tuples generated starting on line 11
these are all lists with numbers in them
and then next to it a number that we
picked out of the list then we also have
this dubious property we don't have
actually any code to test but we can
still write properties that say things
about about the things we've generated
so this property is called lists don't
have duplicates the way we write it is
on line 2 we use the generator from the
previous slide and weedy structure to
generated value in two x's index and
then we simply count how many times does
the the number X appear in that list and
we assert it must be one on line 6 so
let's don't have duplicates any any item
from the list must be there only once
then we can run this property with test
check we pass it to the quick check
function tell it to run the tests 100
times and it gives us this failure data
because it turns out that lists can have
duplicates in particular on line 2 we
have a list with five numbers and the
number 4 appears in it more than once
actually three times the interesting
thing about test check is that when it
finds a failure it will then look for
smaller and smaller failures it will try
different ways of shrinking the failing
case it found
and return the the eventual smallest one
that it could find by a shrinking
process and and that one is on line 9 we
see another pair the list only has two
elements both of them fours and the
number for next to it that appears in
the list more than once so we're going
to dig into a little bit of how this
shrinking process works this is a
photograph of what's called a shrink
tree the shrink tree is a massive lazy
data structure that that gets generated
with with all your generated and input
and it represents lakhs of different
ways of trying to shrink input and with
this tree the actual shrinking process
is kind of dumb it just does a greedy
walk down the tree trying to find the
smallest thing it can find that still
fails so the way that works in our
particular case is at the root of the
tree we have our original failing input
that pair with five numbers and then it
will look at the children and see if
they can find a child that also fails
all the all of the children are slightly
smaller versions of the original in this
case the first child fails and so we
immediately descend there and ignore the
rest of the children then we look at
that child's children this time we have
to go through four different for
different test cases before we find one
that fails so then we descend there and
ignore the rest of them again we we look
at the children the second child is
failing so we descend down there this is
our pair for four and then at that point
we have to look through all of its
children we notice none of them are
failing and so we stopped at that point
in return for four as the smallest
failing case we could find so this works
pretty well I was using it and for
reasons I won't get into a feature I
wanted to add was the ability to stop
the shrinking process in the middle of
it with some information about where it
had gotten to in the shrink tree and
resume it later on some other machine so
for example if our shrink got down to
this third level and was at this node
assuming I had some path information
about how we got there I'd like to be
able to start this up on another machine
and have it resume from that point which
means I need to write code that will
take the shrink tree and walk directly
directly to that point in the tree
ignoring
all of the other the passing nodes that
the original process looked at so I
wrote this code and a strange thing
happened it walked down the tree got to
this point and it found a passing test
and actually the value that was there in
the original process was now different
the shrink tree was different in this
this new process and this confused me
greatly but it turns out that the the
shrink tree was actually
non-deterministic I I this surprised me
because I thought it was a deterministic
process had nothing to do with
randomness just you know try a few
prescribed waves of shrinking things
there's no reason for it to be non
deterministic but in fact a complex
enough generator actually uses
randomness as it's shrinking this is any
generator that that proceeds in at least
two phases so ours has two phases we
first generate the the list of numbers
and then we use that list to select a
random number from the list so you can
shrink that in two ways you can select
an earlier number from the list or you
can shrink the original list and when
you shrink the original list the test
check will actually randomly choose
another number from that new shrunken
list it does that to make sure that the
as it's shrinking it's always has a
number that's in the list you could
imagine more optimal ways to do that but
that's a little tricky for test check to
figure out with the current API so the
the shrink tree the the lazy tree can
require randomness as it's being
realized and the test check was built
with Java util random so there's one
java.util random object that all of this
tree is depending on and so the
randomness that each node sees will
actually depend on what order you walk
the tree in this wasn't a user facing
bug because tests check itself always
walked the tree in the same way but it
prevented me from adding this feature
and a few other features as well so it
seemed like well if we've got this non
determinism problem we should probably
just switch to an immutable random
number generator but the real problem
and i should say the linear immutable
random number generator would not work
here for the same reason it didn't work
in our pair of lazy seeks function and
so
what we really need is split ability but
because we we value immutability we
decided that the a good solution would
be to do both things at once and while
while we're mucking with this let's
switch to an immutable splittable random
number generator because immutable
immutability will have a lot of other
benefits for test check as well so this
was the the solution we decided but
there's been another problem which is
where do we get one of these it's hard
enough to find an immutable linear
random number generator on the JVM much
less a splittable one so it seemed like
the only way forward was to implement
one ourselves which is a good segue into
the second half of the talk but wrapping
up the first half first we've talked
about linear random number generators
and how they relate to functional
composition how they constrain you to
essentially linearize your entire
program and if you want to use laziness
or parallel ism that might not be
possible or you just don't want to
structure your code that way so if you
try to write general code with a linear
generator either you use a mutable one
and your program might be non
deterministic or you use an immutable
one and you get stuck and can't write
your code at all so splittable random
number generator solve this problem but
they are harder to find and the test
check original implementation was
fragile and difficult to add features to
because it was using a linear generator
okay implementations enclosure so we're
going to look at this from three
different angles you're going to talk
about some naive first attempts then
some better research backed attempts and
then talk about performance so starting
off low quality implementations one
thing you might want to try if you were
approaching this is can we take an
existing linear generator and and
somehow adapt it to be splittable so we
can try this with Java util random for
an example this slide is trying to
explain how Java util random algorithm
works when you call the constructor you
pass a seed in and
what it will do is take that seed and
XOR it with a constant and the return
value there will be the state of the
generator after the constructor finishes
in blue if you call next int it will
take that that current state in blue
multiply it by a constant and then add
another constant 11 and that will be the
new state and then the return value from
the call to next int is taken from the
the top 32 bits of the 48 bit state so
just take those eight hex values convert
them to decimal that's that's the return
value if you if you call next int again
you just do the same three steps
multiply add extract 32 bits so that is
java.util random any linear random
number generator can be viewed as an
infinite sequence of numbers so if
you're thinking abstractly you might say
well there's one way to convert a
sequence into two sequences is by taking
every other element and partitioning it
into sequences this way and there's some
obvious performance questions that jump
out like especially after you start
splitting several times what's that
going to mean but some algorithms will
let you efficiently jump this way in
Java util random is one of them all you
have to do is tweak the constants that
you're using and you'll get a generator
that performs just as fast but logically
is jumping some in amounts so you can
actually write this but java.util random
is not quite an infinite sequence of
numbers because it has a finite state so
it's really a periodic sequence of
numbers the period length is exactly 2
to the 48th the one I'm showing up here
is 2 to the 5th because it fits on the
slide better but it's basically the same
thing so when you split a sequence like
this you end up with two sequences that
are half the length and if you split it
again you end up with four sequences
that are fourth of the length and if you
do this a few more times you end up in a
very sad state for a random number
generator to be in
the actual java.util random is a much
longer period 2 to the 48th but it
actually only takes 48 splits to get to
this point and for a general functional
program 48 splits is not unreasonable
the part of the reason this failed so
drastically is because the the period is
a power of 2 so if this were odd the new
would work differently but you would run
into subtler problems another example of
attempting this kind of thing this is
haskell code don't don't look at it too
too hard up but this is the the built-in
random number generator in haskell it's
been an immutable extensively splittable
generator for I assume decades but right
there on line 5 there's an interesting
comment this is the the split function
so there's no statistical foundation for
this so they tried something that seemed
to work and they put it in there because
there I assume wasn't a lot of good
research at the time and there's been a
lot of problems found with this in
particular when you're using quick check
it's very easy to write simple
generators that will never generate
certain values because of how it uses
split so the lesson here is that that
writing a splittable algorithm
especially trying to bolt it onto a
linear algorithm can be very tricky so
let's talk about more professional ways
to do it there's a paper here on using
cryptographic hashing to to write a
splittable generator so we looked at
this the the two concepts you need to
understand how this works are the first
one is a splitting tree so this is just
viewing the the use of a splittable
generator as a tree so the code on the
left corresponds to the tree on the
right we start with with rng one made
created from the seed that's the root of
our tree when we we call split on it we
get two and three which are the the
child nodes if we generate a number from
rng two will call that X 1 and in the
tree I've colored all the numbers that
we generate blue if you could take r ng
three and split that into four and five
generate X 2 from 4 etc there's a lot of
different shapes of trees you can have
so if you are
using your splittable generator in a
linear kind of way by taking a number
from the left half and then splitting
the right half and continuing down that
way you'll end up with a shape like this
you might have a more balanced shape
probably you'll have something more
irregular in a real program the other
concept we need is a pseudo-random
function so this is just a function
that's fully deterministic when you give
it an input it turned returns something
that looks unrelated but still
deterministic and in particular with
similar inputs you'll still get
unrelated looking outputs this is the
same idea behind a cryptographic hash
function which is actually something you
might use in this case so combining
those together looking at our splitting
tree we noticed that that each generator
in the tree can be described uniquely by
the path that we took to get there the
left and right steps so the root of the
tree has an empty path when we go left
we have zero when we go right we had a
we add a one and we can actually think
about our splittable generator as simply
being the pair of the seed and the path
and when we want to generate a number
from from a particular generator we will
simply pass both of those things to our
random function and if the the random
function is random enough then this
should work because every call we make
will have different inputs and so by
definition of the random function they
should have unrelated random looking
outputs so you might try this enclosure
with a everybody's favorite hash
function sha-1 you can do it with a def
type you have two fields the seed in the
path if you want to generate a random
number on line 6 you will combine the
seed in the path together pass that to
your shot one function you convert the
output if you need to and then to split
on on line 9 you'll construct two new
objects they both get the same seed and
the path will have 0 or 1 added to it
and we have a constructor at the bottom
with the empty path so we wrote it we
assume it works good how can we actually
check if it works good so testing the
quality of random number generators is
an extremely interesting topic if you
haven't read about it or thought about
it i encourage you to it's very kind of
slippery concept just trying to figure
out what your
you're doing in the first place first
you study statistics a lot and then you
get overwhelmed and you start googling
and you find out that there's whole test
Suites open source test Suites on the
internet just for doing this exact thing
it's still useful to know to know some
of the statistics as you're using this
so you you can interpret the output
better we used a test suite called die
harder because it was the easiest to set
up what it does is it will take a
sequence of random numbers and run lots
of different statistical tests on them
and for each test it will output past or
week or fail but that brings up an
interesting question which is that die
harder was oriented toward linear
generators it tests a linear sequence of
numbers but we have a splitter
splittable generator how can we get a
linear sequence of numbers that actually
is meaningful for real life use and when
will tell us something about the quality
I don't think there's any rigorous
approaches to this so what we did was
just picked a few natural seeming linner
linearization 'he's and tried all of
them so for example we have the right
linear approach I have this slide
earlier where we just take numbers from
the left and recurse down the right you
could do that the other way left linear
you could also have an alternating
linearization you go left right left
right etc you might have a balanced
linearization where everything's taken
from the same level instead of eight we
used 18 quintillion so that we could
pretend it was Infinite you you might
also combine the two approaches so how
the linear structure but take batches of
numbers at each step you just
concatenate them together and then you
can do that on the other side as well
and finally we had a more irregular
structured tree based on the Fibonacci
numbers so we just took these seven
linearization Xand tested all of them
and hoped that was meaningful for
real-life use so here the die harder
results die harder will run 114
different tests we're comparing here to
java.util random which did not perform
very well it's it's kind of a known
thing that it's not very good quality it
only just does two pieces of arithmetic
to generate a random
it had six failures and a larger number
of weak results as I understand it it's
statistically inevitable that a test run
will have several weak results even for
purely random numbers so as far as I
know these these results for sha-1 are
actually as good as we could expect so
it seems like we've succeeded in
generating good quality random numbers
however sha-1 takes say thousands i
believe of arithmetic operations to
compute and we're running it every time
we want to generate a number meanwhile
java.util random uses three arithmetic
operations so there's performance
concerns arise here so let's now talk
about other implementations that are
hopefully a little less slow the first
thing you could try is use the previous
algorithm but with a less low hash
function so there are other
cryptographic hash functions you could
try that there might be better the
original paper actually used a hash
function based on three fish because
they said it was more amenable to the
way they were using it performance wise
we also tried a weaker non cryptographic
hash functions so you have to have a
little more worried about quality do
more testing but it might still be good
enough but then there's also this class
on the JVM called splittable random of
all things this was added in Java 8
along with a lot of their streaming
stuff so this is a mutable splittable
random number generator which wasn't
something I had even thought about until
I saw this class but it's a wee you have
the the classic next long function
returns returns along and then you have
a split function mutates the underlying
generator and returns you a new
independent generator so we said that
that going from from mutable two
immutable is relatively cosmetic so we
should be able to do it here so I'm
going to try to describe this algorithm
and then and then show how we can
translate it to closure so the
algorithms based on to what's called
mixing functions which are basically
just random functions the the input size
in
this case is a 64 bit long again I'm
using five bit number because it fits on
the slide but the function represented
here we have the the inputs in the inner
circle and the outputs in the outer
circle when you when you construct a
splittable random object you give it a
seed and that seed is simply set to be
the initial state of the random number
generator so it's a trivial constructor
if you pass 24 to the constructor the
initial state will be 24 then when you
want to generate numbers if you ask for
a number it's going to add a special
special number called gamma to the state
in this case 11 so 24 plus 11 gets us to
3 we pass 3 through the mixing function
and the output is 12 that's our actual
output from the next long function if we
want another number we're going to add
gamma to the state again go to 14 and
then output 29 so we end up bouncing
around the circle in a star like fashion
because gammas an odd number will end up
hitting everything in the circle before
we eventually repeat which again is 18
quintillion numbers so the period there
will be 18 quintillion the probably had
something else to say but I forget oh
and yeah because the because the the
function we're using is a random
function than the the outputs ought to
look unrelated even though the the state
transition is so simple for splitting
those is the interesting part if you
want to split the random number
generator say we construct it with the
seed 24 and we immediately call split
that means our initial state was 24 and
then we're going to add gamma twice to
get to New States and we're going to use
both of them to construct the new
generator the first one we add 11 we get
to three then we run it through our
original mixing function to get 12 and
that will be the initial state of the
new random number generator then we'll
update our state again which takes us to
14 and this time we'll use a different
mixing function called mix gamma will
pass 14 to that outputs 25 mixed gamma
is a special random function that will
always return an odd number because you
you want odd oddness so that you have a
full period
and it also uses some other heuristics
so in this case outputs 25 and that's
going to be the gamma of the new random
number generator so the old one has its
same gamma and it's doubly updated state
the new one takes the the state from the
right and the gamma from the left so you
end up with two generators that have
different gamma values which means
they're represented by different shaped
stars so even if they end up on the same
state at some point though they'll
immediately diverge and continue
returning unrelated looking numbers so
we can we can write this enclosure this
is all the code with the exception of
the two mixing functions which just do
some low-level arithmetic our so we
again have a def type of two fields this
time it's gamma and state after a Rand
long online for we add add gamma to the
state and pass it to the the mixing
function and if we want to split
starting on line 6 we will add gamut to
the state twice to get state 1 in state
2 will use state one with the the
original mixing function to get the new
state for the new generator and state to
with the mixed gamma function to get the
the new gamma for the new generator we
construct the new one on line 11 with
new gamma and new state and then the the
left half of the pair will still be a
new object but it represents the
original object in the mutable version
so it will have the same gamma and it
will use the updated state state 2 so
this works pretty well I can look at
some some crude benchmarks using
criterium this is testing how long does
it take to generate a million numbers
and XOR them all together so remember
java.util random just does three pieces
of arithmetic these mixing functions
each do I think on the order of 10 or 12
operations so having a three to four
times slowdown is not too surprising
this is obviously I mean slowdowns not
the best thing but the upside is that we
get more quality random numbers and we
we have an immutable algorithm we can
use which is beneficial and lots of
other ways we can also compare this to
the the sha-1 implementation which is
severely slower the die harder results
here's the both sha-1 and
and the new generator on the bottom are
just as good i believe the actual number
of weak results is the same as with
sha-1 so it looks as if we've we've got
some significant speed up over the the
cryptographic version but still retained
quality so this is what we ended up
going with 44 tests check and in
performance wise we weren't just
concerned about how the random number
generator performed the real the real
thing to test is how does the typical
test suite perform under the new random
number generator so we'll look at that
in a moment but wrapping up this section
we talked about trying to to write our
own splittable random number generators
from linear generators or other other
tactics and it's not easy but the
professionals have have done some work
here and there are a few different
options we have so that's good coming
back to test check we we added the the
splittable random algorithm that we just
looked at there's an alpha release right
now so you can try it out trying to
measure the the effect on actual test
Suites we we measured test checks own
test suite which is uses a lot of
generators so depending on what you
measure exactly the slowdown might be
ten to twenty percent or ten to fifteen
percent I've also heard various rumors
of other people running it on their own
test Suites and seeing maybe up to fifty
percent slow down so that's it's
definitely something that we're
considering there might be more
performance optimizations we can do or
say other faster options we can provide
but on the other hand having made this
change and especially having now an
immutable generator there's lots of
other things that we can add a lot
easier to test check in particular the
first one we can now easily paralyze the
test runs without sacrificing
determinism which presumably will mean
making them even faster than they were
before we converted the random number
generator and there's also a lot of
other other things that the ways we can
enhance it that are a lot easier now
because of immutability
so all in all it seems like a win this
is my last slide summarizing what we've
talked about splittable random number
generators are crucial for composing
functions functional programs that rely
on pseudo randomness and want to be
deterministic there are existing
algorithms for this even even on the JVM
there's a mutable version that we we
converted to an immutable version and
doing that made mean test check a more
robust library that's all I have thank
