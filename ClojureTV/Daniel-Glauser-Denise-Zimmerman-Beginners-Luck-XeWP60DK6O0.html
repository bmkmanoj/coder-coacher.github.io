thanks for coming back from lunch to
come hear us it's always a little
difficult in the big belly to to come
back and the food so good here alright
let's get started this is beginner's
luck it's our story about learning and
teaching closure so the question comes
up sometimes why do you teach and you
may think it's the act of giving brings
you something and it's this eternal
kindness that you're giving out to the
world and everyone gets along together
and and it's a beautiful place when you
do something like that and there may be
some truth to that but I'd like to
present you with a different reason a
slightly more selfish reason and that's
by by teaching you also learn I can't
tell you how much more I know about
closure just based off the time I've
spent teaching it and you start to fall
into this loop where the teacher helps
the student the student helps the
teacher and you both get a lot better a
lot faster before before you come up
with the idea with you to your boss and
say hey I'd like to bring some
apprentices and interns into this
company you might get a few questions
things like you know a fear that you're
not going to produce enough work now
that you're spending all that time
teaching someone else well we've put
that to the test and what we found is
having this extra pair really does not
slow us down really I don't think
there's much to lose and there's really
typically only something to gain within
certain caveats that will go over but
especially where there's a lot of folks
here looking for that next developer to
join their team the one you make maybe
that right one
so developers out there I'd like to
challenge you your job isn't only to
write code anymore sorry that ship is
somewhat flown I say that developers now
need to know how to mentor and teach
especially senior developers consider
part of the job description I also like
to to hand you the idea that developers
who are learning the ones you are
teaching they don't tend to leave so if
you're having trouble hiring people you
might want to think about why your
employees are leaving so let's jump over
to how I got started I had just enough
exposure to programming that I knew I
wanted to learn so once I had the
opportunity to transition from a small
business owner to a developer I took it
so where did I start well initially i
found a tutor he was an incredible tutor
a lovely guy and a CS masters from
stanford and he helped give me some
direction and context along the way i
think he got me going with learn code
the hard way and he made sure I knew my
tools and then from there I got started
on a computation in algorithms class
through MITx and another software as a
service through berkeley x and i also
started hitting meetups as I grew my
exposure to programming and varying
language I also grew my exposure to the
substantial number of ways to learn
online as well as the varying styles of
teachers and mentors that were out there
eventually I found myself at a closure
meet up and everything seemed to sync up
for me I was intrigued by closures
functional approach and instantly
connected with community so I reached
out to Daniel and asked if he would help
me learn the language and he was eager
to help what was cool is that Daniel and
I both have pretty substantial teaching
and coaching backgrounds and we realized
that if we took things a step further
and analyzed our process that we could
help other closure developers be more
successful
when they embarked on their teaching
adventure one observation that quickly
stood out was that we might all have the
best intentions as mentors and teachers
but not everybody knows what they're
doing so what are some of the successful
are some of the keys to having a
successful session well a successful
session needs to have structure and you
need to find the right match but not
everybody is compatible so what are some
of the things to help you know if you're
compatible for one you might you both
will have equal levels of commitment and
follow through and motivation you'll be
able to recognize one another strengths
and weaknesses and ideally there'll be
an overall compatibility where you can
relate to things outside of programming
and that might not always be the case
but it certainly helps if you can find
common ground and ultimately you want to
just give it a chance so if it doesn't
stick the first time give it a few goes
and don't be afraid to flip things on
their head so if he's asking all the
questions then he might turn things to
me so that I can ask more questions and
then just be sure to remember that this
is a learning experience for both the
student and the teacher so now that you
have a pair what's next well you'll want
to get a grasp of what they might
already know so ask have a look at the
projects that they built or ask them
about any classes that they've completed
and once you're working on problem sets
or projects you'll want to be able to
determine they'll up their level of
understanding knowing their level of
understanding will help shape the
direction of your sessions and makes
goal-setting far easier so this approach
is Bloom's taxonomy Bloom's taxonomy
helps guide the teacher through their
assessment
starting from the bottom or the base the
first skill acquired is basic knowledge
at this level some of the questions you
want to ask your parabola round
remembering vocabulary and recognition
you might point to something specific on
the screen or ask things like what are
the first two pieces when creating a
function next we explore their
comprehension you might ask them to
explain outline or discuss the concepts
you've covered for example what is this
code do and as their comprehension
depends they can take the information
they know and begin to apply it new
situations so you might ask what would
you use to add expressions to elect or
what tools might resolve this problem
now that it's clear that they possess
the foundational levels we now need to
discover if they are able to analyze and
distinguish between different parts when
asking questions to determine your pairs
ability to analyze use words and phrases
such as differences compared separate
classify or a range you might ask
compare the following functions finally
in synthesis and evaluation they can
compile information together in a
different way by combining elements and
a new pattern or by proposing
alternative solutions additionally they
might present or defend opinions by
making judgments about information or
qualifying work based on a set of
criteria the questions that you would
ask will run deepest of this level of
understanding they might be something
like what could we change to improve the
execution time ultimately don't forget
to ask them what their understanding is
and in different contexts there are many
layers to programming try to cover
uncover where they are with each for
instance they may not know closure but
they might have
use emacs in the past or you might even
want to try to discern how well they can
solve an algorithm using pseudocode okay
now that you've established some idea of
your students understanding it's time to
create a structured session using the
backwards design teaching method we
first establish your goal and then
determine what fundamentals are
necessary to build up to that given
endpoints so if I make if there's one
slide you pay attention to the theory I
definitely suggest it's this one it kind
of distills down some of the theory that
Denise just went over into a formula
that we've successfully used to in our
lot of our teaching sessions so you need
to get creative you need to break these
things down into small pieces and get
creative and make comparisons and give
things context along the way it's
important that you also prepare so
preparing your session will set you up
for success I like to think of this one
as one of those televised cooking
segments where the chef has all of their
ingredients nicely laid out before
preparing a dish for their audience just
imagine how lost the viewer would become
if we had to watch the chef scramble all
over their kitchen with their backs to
us while they collected everything they
needed to get started the measuring cups
bowls pans utensils spices parentheses
even worse even worse imagine if
retracing those scattered steps was the
only way that you could make the meal
yourself just remember gathering
ingredients is easy it's the sort of
thing you already do but the key to
getting the most of it's the key to
getting the most out of your session um
so what might you do if you don't have a
goal in mind well don't stress your goal
just becomes teaching the fundamentals
so you can hop onto project euler or
find a good algorithm to solve or maybe
break down a snippet of code and one in
your current projects now it's time to
make sure you have the right environment
yak shaving is it has anyone here ever
yet done any yak shaving
come on everyone here is done yak does
anyone here not know it no not know yak
shaving is all right I'm not going to
tell the whole story but if steph a
involves step B involves step c involves
step DS involves step e and really you
just wanted to do step a that's shaving
a yak and I think we've all probably
done a bit of that here so let's talk
about some of the tools that we use to
get past the Yak shaving and we're going
to be opinionated here you might not
like the opinion and that's okay that's
one of the good things about opinions
but what we found is by being
opinionated in making certain choices
it's made other things down the line a
lot easier so we're going to share those
with you use the terminal based editor
there are great graphical editors out
there doing some really cutting-edge
stuff doing some really neat things and
that's cool if you're going to work solo
but if you're going to work with pairs
there are ways to share screens and work
with graphical editors I haven't seen a
good one yet so if you have a good one I
would love to hear more about it but
until then we suggest using a graphical
editor something like VI something like
Emacs and that's because of the next
point team ox team ox is a great way to
share your screen and both be able to
swap back and forth you can both be at
home have headphones on be talking on
skype or google hangouts or use your
program of choice on the telephone
doesn't really matter but you can be on
in a share team accession together have
your your designer ergonomic keyboard
and they have their set up and it
doesn't matter you're not having to
switch back and forth and also you're
not tied to one physical location and
that can be really freeing what makes
that what can help with that as well our
SSH reverse tunnels so the common these
are the tools I we use at work every day
and the setup we use is we all run a vm
on our laptop you could have windows
Mac Linux it doesn't matter what your
laptop is we all run a linux vm and we
set up an SSH reverse tunnel through it
NEC to node and we have our config set
up as simply as me saying SSH denise
team ox attached suddenly we're working
together here's another opinion if you
have six fingers Emacs is not hard at
all even if you have five fingers it's
not that bad and it's worth knowing in
your life it's a really interesting cool
piece of software it takes a little
while to learn but we feel the benefits
outweigh the costs again on our team at
work and when I'm teaching through the
local user group we all just use Emacs
and the facilities and libraries that
have been built into it for doing
closure development are super slick so
that's an opinion ok so to go back over
it you found someone that's compatible
you know their level of understanding
you've set up your environment you've
established a goal come up with a plan
and now you're going to make a rhythm
and you're going to rinse and repeat
repetition is great for teaching the
other thing that's great for teaching is
getting over the hump and of thinking
maybe this isn't something you can do
just try it what do you have to lose
you'll find that most folks you're
working with are happy to give you
feedback and help you get to be a better
teacher I'm so if it's something you're
interested in looking into there's often
someone who's interested to learn and
again you both get better so let's put
our money where our mouth is let's try
some examples so the thing to remember
in these examples is we are not focusing
on teaching you closure right now most
of the folks in the room probably know
or understand what we're going to go
over in the examples the idea is we're
trying to show you what a structured
teaching session might look like and
think about how the flow works and
imagine yourself doing that sort of
what if you have large amounts of
customer data so large they may not even
fit into memory how could you process
such a thing and how can you get there
we'll break this into three problem sets
starting with problem one first problem
set how do you get values in a map well
you might write a function something
like this there's a function for that
all that Apple commercials where there's
an apps without it I laugh every time
i'm working in closure because every
time I try and do something there's a
function that does it that someone's
written somewhere so there's a get
function that you're all probably
familiar with that can take a map and
take a key in this case a keyword and
look itself up in the look the keyword
up in the map and get you the value back
not too surprising huh well when working
in closure you might notice that there's
often a more succinct way to put
something so you can lose the get and
well it turns out a map itself is a
function that can take a key and look up
that key and return you a value is there
anything wrong with that though well
what if it's nil what if the maps knew
what if the maps know I sure it'll be
fine or not so it'll go boom so what's
more common in code is to use the
keyword as a function if you're using
keywords as your keys in your map use
the keyword as a function and pass it
the map and it's happy to look itself up
and get the value back is there any
problem with that well what if the
keyword is no so if the keyword wasn't
hard coded in there and you actually
passed the keyword in I'm sure it'd be
fine
so that brings us back to our get
function if you pass it nil for a key or
a map it's happy to return the right
thing and not blow up so let's recap get
a value out of a map maps or functions
that take keys and keys are functions
that take naps fairly simple okay but
notice how we structured the lesson we
built up and then we tied it back to the
beginning and summarize the whole thing
let's go to problem set to 0 any
questions on on that I figured you're
all new get problem set to how to
represent an anonymous function what
might you use an anonymous function for
that's a good question so anonymous
functions are often used with another
function called map map takes a function
and applies it or it takes a function
and then takes an element out of the
collection at a time and pops it into
the function and then collects all the
values back and give them gives them to
you so this type of thing is something
you might see with with a map function
the anonymous function part is I don't
need it a standalone function just to do
that it's a one-liner I'll write an
anonymous function here and that's one
application for anonymous functions it's
fairly common in closure so you might
see something back like this but this is
closure isn't there a more succinct way
to to rather glad you asked yes there is
a more succinct way to put that there's
a shorthand notation for anonymous
functions that look something like this
and as you imagine returns you the same
value is that good an offer is there an
easier way to put this well what if it
is just a single function so if what
you're trying to do in the anonymous
function is just a single function you
mean just pass that function simple
so again to recap long high end notation
for anonymous functions or shorthand
notation for anonymous functions or if
the anonymous function is simple enough
just try passing it the function
excellent so again this is not a hard
concept this is not an advanced concepts
but the way you present it to someone
you're working with matters let's do
something a little meteor shall we so
getting to our original question of
processing large data sets so large they
may not fit into memory I'll bet a few
folks have a few clues on this one in
here but but let's lay it out again so
perhaps we have this notation of a
person this notion of a person that we
represent with a map because maps are a
great way to represent key value pairs
attributes of things and this is a
potential for a person we put a couple
attributes in their height and weight
nothing nothing fancy why don't we try
generating a function to creating a
function generator and in person so if
we're going to create a reasonably sized
random person we can use the random
function limit how many digits we go to
with our random numbers that get plugged
in for height and weight and if you're
assuming centimeters and kilograms
because we all use SI these are
reasonable values I'll bet the audience
is asking themselves the same question I
am what if this person is a mutant let's
find out so we'll write a predicate
function for that this takes a person
and looks in the map that is
representing the person and returns true
if they're a mutant again if you're not
as concerned with true/false from your
predicate in this case and you want to
return true thief all see is there a
more succinct way to put this
now you do so again using the previous
lesson about keywords looking themselves
up in a map we can just put a keyword in
there we're not worried about nil
because the keyword is coded straight in
there and we're not passing it into the
function well now we've got this random
person function and we we want
potentially random mutants so we could
make them all mutants that's a first
easy step right any test we had around
this we'd be looking for occasional non
mutants and those would fail but this is
a good first way to get that notion in
the code and it's going to always return
us a tribute but is there a better way
for us to solve this so they're not
always mutants mix it up a little bit
yeah maybe like a flip coin so maybe we
can flip a coin and potentially some
back some of those mutants would come
back as false or people would come back
as non mutants how do we write our flip
coin function well remember randon that
we spoke about a few moments ago that
may come into play to help if we limit
the Brandon's argument down to two it
returns us a bunch of values that look
like this so that can easily be
transformed to truth false by just
testing for the presence of one of those
numbers with a fairly simple function
like this and you get fairly random coin
tosses back to our people generator I'm
sorry now we want to generate a whole
bunch of people we don't want to just
generate one in fact we want to generate
as many people as we might need so this
is a little more complex of a function
let's start by writing a doc string you
all right doc strings right
ok so this describes what we're trying
to do in lays out a plan for how we're
trying to attack the function and then
we're going to just jump right to the
solution and walk through the steps it's
only a couple lines but there's a bit
going on here so let's talk it through
look at our call to generate random
person that does just what we thought
returns us back the map we're going to
use cons to add that on to a sequence of
a recursive call back into ourselves
whoa do you see any issues with that
does that make sense will it ever stop
will it ever stop that's the only other
call only other function call we have in
their lazy seek that's the beauty and
the magic of it it will create a
sequence that doesn't get evaluated
until you take things from it try that
in Ruby so you get back an answer
something like this if you were to take
five from that lazy seek you get five
random folks and yes I ran this it's
true I didn't talk through the results
the random and turns out quite a few of
them are mutants so again I'll bet the
audience is wondering exactly what we
are how do you find all the mutants
so to find all the mutants let's take a
look at that we're going to take in some
people and we want to find all the
mutants how many lines of code you think
this is going to be ten no fifteen we
should probably get an abstract class
with a with a couple traits mixed in
yeah or or it's just a one-liner so the
filter function makes use of that
predicate that we spent some time making
before and we could use the body of the
predicate instead as an anonymous
function there but it kind of fits in
nicely and we just filter it and we get
back if we took five from that other the
other results previously you get back
only mutants and magnet is happy has
found all of them so let's recap the
values in the map anonymous functions
have their uses when you get to the
infinite lazy sequence that's where some
of the magic of closure happens and you
can pour through large amounts of
customer data and we've got a filter
function that works on that and it's
really succinct in and nice so
in closing so teaching is something you
can learn just like programming and it
takes practice and commitment and we are
actively working on these problem sets
and trying to get them up on closure doc
it's very friendly place you github pull
requests you can get more content up
there there's already a lot of good
content up there and some of it could
use some work as well and but we're
trying to find a good place to add these
problem sets that give teachers tools to
allow them to walk through things with
their students and lay it out to to do
some of the prep work for you any
questions
yes
so the question is how does this
training compared to having your student
read a book in coming back and asking
questions and my answer that is yes
they're both good they're all good and
this is helpful having these types of
sessions with your students can help
inspire them and get them going some of
the information that you're picking up
in a book if you're new enough to a
language or programming all together it
can be very abstract and your vocabulary
might not be in a place where it's as
easy where it's easy enough to process
some of that stuff so I think it's
really if you're you're that type of
learner great or you can couple that
with classes or having a mentor or a
teacher so I think both are great yeah
books are great until you hit something
you don't know or don't understand from
the book we're at times like for me I
feel like there were moments where I
thought I understood something and I
didn't and it took communicating that
with someone in order to undersea that I
didn't get it yeah question
say again okay
so the question is the gentleman
mentioned these working with the closure
cones and I'm assuming some some Deb's
on your team that you're trying to train
up enclosure some have very they have
various backgrounds so summer Java
developers some have some closure
experience and just folks are really at
mismatch different levels I say don't
let that stop you and just marry the two
so if you have someone at a higher level
or he can he or she can pull in enough
information without having to have a lot
of questions then they're going to be
able to fly on their own and you might
help more the person that is you know
coming from a language that's more
far-fetched you know you're just going
to have to to marry that but staying on
track with what the katas are you know
someone might just go deeper have those
folks who are ahead of the other foot
other folks teach ya teach the teachers
which is a lot of what we're trying to
get across here yes notion let's take it
to the next level and start to get that
the teacher pipeline going valuable
skill for them too sorry good
um so the question is have we ever tried
the coding dojo I think that's a San
Francisco thing or Bay Area thing
there's a coding dojo group is that what
you're referring to
okay so let me say that to the audience
so the person was asking about the
coding dojos where you have one person
thinking about the problem one person
working on the problem and then one
person helping the more or less
something to that effect that sounds
like a really good idea to I really like
the freedom of our setup by having we
can be anywhere we can roll out of bed
we could get an ID late at night hop on
skype and see someone else is on and
then start working together or have
multiple we can have to try pairs or
quad pairs and if someone has an idea
they roll with it and the others kind of
talk and help and refactor one thing I
didn't mention we didn't mention the
talk but one thing I found with closure
that might be really good for the
gentleman over there working with java
devs is we have a very different
workflow working enclosure than I have
in any other language where at least on
our team nothing gets into master
without two plus ones on the pull
request so we're constantly refactoring
all the time and we're pairing a lot as
well so your pair is job is oftentimes
to really help you refactor all the time
and then when you have more people on it
gets even more fun sometimes and you end
up rewriting the same code three and
four times but what you end up with at
the end is just so much better and that
can be really good for teaching to that
whole refactoring stop
I
hmm
but I do find the roses
one of your slides
but just be myself over minded
so let's repeat it oh it's not good yep
so the comment yes and please answer so
the comment was that we claim that
there's no downside to having an extra
pair on the team and it turns out that
for some folks when they're pairing and
maybe all folks some of the time when
they're pairing it's kind of tiring and
it wears you down to be explaining
things a lot and that does take away
from things so Denise so our Denver team
has four people and I usually pair with
one of the three other people and we're
very verbal about that if my pair is if
it's wearing an explanation and they
need to just feel like they can get in
their groove or whatever I will switch
gears or I'll keep running with code
that I can deal with it it's just about
communicating so I think everyone has
that even if your pair is senior to you
well you've also touched on issue with
introverts versus extroverts and for
your typical extrovert that social
interaction is typically energizing and
for your typical introvert its taxing
doesn't mean that all introverts do not
like social interaction but it is good
to know more about yourself and know
where you're at and also know the other
people on your team and how they like to
work I mean ultimately you're going to
grow your depth of knowledge if you're
teaching so if you can get yourself in a
position where you're exercising that
muscle you really should it's and it's a
skill you have to acquire it and
ultimately if there's not a rhythm
between you and your pair there might be
a lack of compatibility and and there's
things that you have to do to work with
that like like I was saying like flip it
on its head and take another approach
run things differently so that you have
a chance to just yeah also one thing
that we've been doing lately is will
have some pair time and then you've also
had little slices of the
the tickets to work on yourself that are
a little easier to wrap your head around
then like a full fiber a point ticket or
something like that and what um that's a
huge value and that goes back to that
prepare part so sometimes my pair or
someone who's the ticket that I'm
working on they'll take a piece of it
and break it down in a gist and say okay
the men they'll explain that just to me
and say here you go go for it and I'll
keep touching base to say this is where
I'm at I am completely lost on that like
can you explain it and and then if I
need it I get the help and if I don't
I'm plugging away you know and so one
thing to think about are using more
tools like these problem sets if you is
it someone who wants to teach but
doesn't want to pair all day and work
directly with someone building up these
problem sets and working with these
problem sets might be a really good way
to interact with someone else and then
when they get up to the next level maybe
it's slices of a ticket like we're
saying help them get through yes
big red rain wrong many students never
programmed long experience but it's
usually and something like C++
before of course it helps them they
understand what a syntax error
thinking algorithmically so they they
think faster progress than the for
beginners but they often think they're
having
because they expect to know what they're
doing so let me try and see if I can
refer or say that to the audience in the
same way so we have a gem in the
audience who's a university professor
and has taught functional programming to
a wide range of students students with
no programming experience to students
with programming experience but those
students with programming experience
more have things like C++ a more
imperative or object oriented languages
under their belt and don't really know
how to work in the functional paradigm
very well and so what he's found is
those students with programming
experience tend to move faster but have
a perception that they're not and
they're not doing as well where the
newer students don't have this
preconceived notion that they're going
to hit the ground running so they don't
sweat it I get that right and and the
question is have we hit that or
encounter that I mean I personally I
don't have the senior dev experience but
not yet I feel like I'm moving like I
don't feel like I'm stalemated by
projects and when I do I just talked to
my pears yeah I mean I so I've been
running the den of closure the Denver
closure group for we have a two and a
half three time almost okay so we just
have a few more minutes but i'll speak
about this i've been running the Denver
closure group for a while and we've got
to run the gamut on everything from
advanced Macker talks all the way down
to install a thongs just to get pieces
installed on people's computers and get
them up and running Windows is so much
fun and we've tried beginner workshops
we've tried group problems we've tried
all sorts of things I don't necessarily
know we found the bet all the right
formulas for that particular group but
we have encountered a lot of people with
various degrees of experience and we're
starting to get them a lot more folks in
with very little programming experience
which is why what got Denise and I
thinking about this how do we start to
build up materials and facilities for
teaching them so I have found something
slightly similar in that at the folks
with a lot of imperative or Oh
experience find closure very frustrating
at first but the beginners don't find it
as frustrating it doesn't seem unnatural
to them in fact a lot of those folks who
are just coming into it I think it's
great because it's simpler so I
understand i think i understand the
phenomena you're talking about i don't
necessarily have good answers for you
except that we should be in our
universities teaching functional
programming sooner and that that'll help
alleviate some of the problem time we're
out of time thank you very much folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
