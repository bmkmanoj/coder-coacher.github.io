Holly and I work at an LM so that's also
incidentally my Twitter handle so this
is a talk that was proposed under the
fun category so I hope it's fun and it's
also a talk where you can lay back relax
there's not a whole lot of heavy closure
in it but it's it it tends to be heavy
on the music side so that's interesting
to you you will like this so this talk
is mostly about my journey of how I went
about making music be generated by
machines and how that music can be made
more like human music and more melodious
so that said should we listen to some
right away yeah okay so here's the code
that generates or synthesized lays the
synthetic music and this is what it
sounds like
yeah so that was the Machine rendering
piece of transcribed music that I wrote
down so that music is actually a piece
of Carnatic music and I guess I get into
that in just a bit but quickly about why
I do this I've learned to sing for like
15 16 years I perform radley but that's
one of my passions is another one of my
passions is computers so this is a bang
intersection of these two things so I
can be creative and reductive at the
same time a bunch of the papers that I
have to read in order to do what I do
are written in the last five years so it
feels like I'm leading edge research
that feels good I have once you've
dreamy ambitions so I'm going to be in
my room and ask a machine to
meek two hours of music according to my
emotion at the time and the time of the
day and so that's sort of the end game
for me and that music needs to be new so
is that and in my journey I have also
discovered that they're a bunch of these
nice things that can be made into nice
applications and and these are the
byproducts I'll talk a little about that
in the end so this talk is gonna be in
four phases so we have first melody so
we will try to understand melody and try
to dig in fine abstractions that we can
use to model and then synthesize and
generate music the second part is going
to be modeling so we'll take those
abstractions and write them on enclosure
and see what best we can do that and
then synthesis is about taking some
transcribed music or notation and
rendering it in a way that can be close
to a human and generation is about the
Machine creating music by itself when I
started out I thought this would be you
know wait there yeah when we thought
this would when I first started I
thought this would be a linear process
but it's more of a cycle so as we
synthesize and and generate music we
understand things that we need to feed
back into our basic understanding of
melody and then model it again and this
is a cycle so since this audience is
into definitions of the beginning of
talks so here's one for you so what's
interesting about this is that the
definition says something about a music
melody being musically satisfying so
there's a human subjectiveness
to this right so it needs to be vetted
by a human and we'll have to find out
how to model something like that right
and then another part of it that's
curious is a notion of single notes and
there is an implicit notion of notes
being the fundamental unit of
abstraction in music and I questioned
that and I questioned that in the
context of Carnatic music I guess this
would be a good time to give you
a nice 5-minute crash course on Carnatic
music and I'm gonna give you a piece of
music so you can intuitively understand
it instead of me explaining it so here's
some Carnatic music for you
Hey
so you'll notice that it sounds unlike
other Western music it's played on a
violin and was an extemporary piece in
the raga Kalyani I'll get into that soon
but now I'll give you a video of it so
that you can look at it and understand
it even better
right so you notice that there is a main
artist and for the entire context of my
presentation that's the guy I'm gonna
care about and that's the music I'm
going to be looking to synthesize and
generate there's an accompanying
violinist at all points in time there is
a single main percussionist and there is
a drone which is the tanpura
consistently in the background and I
guess this should give you a good idea
of what the concert picture is like but
on a broader sense though Carnatic music
is South Indian classical music so the
earliest Street isin this is was written
in 500 BC and it's called the Bharata is
not yet Shastra so it's like quite old
and even there there are like details of
raga and swaras and gamma cos right so
these abstractions have existed for
quite a while and have evolved the other
thing about Carnatic music it has these
abstractions called draaga's and gamma
comes and these are things that we can
use right so we need we have these
additional constraints now that will
help us create more beautiful music so
that's another reason why this is
interesting in that context it's also
vocal tradition in which they I learned
from my teacher my teacher sings I
repeat after him I mostly don't write
down anything historically nobody has
written down a lot of things so there's
a lot of content a lot of information
that's just intuitive and a lot of this
talk is also going to be uncovering
those intuitions it's also rich in
compositions so in a typical concert
you'll have a bunch of songs that
everyone sort of knows already and there
will be three renditions of them and
there are pockets in the concert for
improvisation and this this is called
Manu Dharma so a lot of the concert
music and the expressions of artists
come out in these areas quickly though
because I might refer to these later
during the talk that's a veena which is
a fretted stringed instrument it's
almost exclusively used for Carnatic
music that's the temporal or the drone
that you saw earlier and the mridangam
is the main percussion instrument so
with that we have a bunch of musical
abstractions
in Carnatic music now that we can model
over things that we already understand
first of which is shooting so this is
the tonic note like as a concert artist
I would pick a single pitch and every
other note that I really would be
relative to this a female artist for
example would pick a higher pitch and
and that pitch or that tonic note can be
any one of the standard frequencies and
that's map that represents that there's
also a concept of laia which embodies
the rhythm concepts I'm just leaving it
here for completeness it's not important
in this talk so just so that you have a
comparative understanding of what these
notes are in Carnatic music here's a
single octave on a piano and these are
the notes in Carnatic music these are
called swarams
right so you have Saregama pathani so
that's how you pronounce them but when
you write them you just write srgm pdn
and you have a bunch of variations with
them right so you have three Riis three
guys three thousand three means and to
Mars this is in Carnatic music right now
that you understand these we then write
them in closure so that's pretty much it
so you have a single neat map of all the
variations of this Forum's written down
and each of them map to an atomic
relative MIDI number right so you have 0
to 11 those are semitones and you have
simple square ins those are the things
that we utter and those are interpreted
in the concept in within the context of
firaga there's Phi's which are your
octaves so I have modeled two octaves up
in two octaves down as five octaves now
we can go on to understand the
abstraction of a raga and here again I'm
going to rely on your intuitive sense of
understanding what this means
the dirt it
where did it
right so that was called copy and ragga
is our flavor right so each luck raga
can be thought of as a flavor or an
emotion right so I can think of the
happy dagger as your sad ragas your
melancholy Crockett or angry or leading
so these are the things that are
embodied in a dagger but more
theoretically raga is composed of
swarams right and there is also a notion
of an ascending rule and a descending
rule these are called the our own Amanda
bharanam and these things need not be
symmetric right so the ascent drill and
the descent you will need not be the
same and they need not even be linear so
you can have jumps so the ascent might
have zero three one two and that's fine
right so that defines a yoga they
classify it in and I'm not going to go
into all that but let me just tell you
there are a lot of them so this is a
single ideon file it has 17,000 lines of
gragas like there are like 5,000 raagas
in all of this and this is just a bunch
of script content but now that we have
built these musical abstractions a layer
on top of whatever you already know
let's use something like overtone and
like see what we can get out from what
we built so far all right so that's me
in the repple so i can look up the eden
map right so that's simple that has a
name this is the our own amalgam our
lists I can also fuzzy search a dagger
and this is important because it's an
ending language fuzzy search so g.o you
la ng annually need to pick up the same
thing right I can talk about the
importance more in a bit but you can
play a scale like that just played the
ascending the descent of the Rockefeller
Harry and here's another raga
so this one's symmetric the previous one
wasn't and then you can place where eyes
and give them durations and play the
middle speed right and so you'll notice
that these are actuals for hours likely
to God three and I've given them names
and the durations you can increase the
speed of course right and then you can
interpret these notes in within the
context of a raga so this is where it
sort of gets interesting
right so this is within the context of
Kalyani or mature Kalyani now if I
change the raga right right so this is
actually a mind-bendingly difficult
exercise for me to do as an artist like
I need to get into that raga understand
it and then render these notes a machine
can just do it so that is a piece of
prescriptive notation right written as a
string with commas representing so this
is what I would write down in my in my
class with my teacher and I can now
render that right so we've got in this
fire and the things I use are fairly
straightforward overtone Leipzig for the
melodies and durations and such and I'm
using a post dresses inbuilt Fuzzy's
extension to build this so the fuzzy
search right needs to use a combination
of sound X and Levenstein because just
Levenstein isn't enough sound X is an
algorithm that tells you how close to
words sound like each other so I need
both of them
so so far though we've played a scale of
firaga we have fuzzy found a lager with
later phrase we've gotten a phrase
within the context of a raga and we have
played some prescriptive notation but
anyone with any experience listen you
cannot agnostic will tell you that that
doesn't sound anything like it right
like if it doesn't even sound anything
close to what you heard before
so this brings us the synthesis right
this is the process of making your
machine sound more closer to how you
would sing but we have little idea by
just listening so let's see them instead
so on top is a mellow graph of me
singing something some singing some
prescriptive notation and the bottom is
the Machine rendering the same
prescriptive notation let's listen to
both of them ok so this is pretty
obvious right you have continuity in in
me and no continuity in the machine yeah
and there's basically no curves or
whatever but if I change the instrument
in like to a sine wave instead of saw
wave it sounds softer and actually if
you take if you consider a longer phrase
it actually sounds closer let's listen
to this
okay now watch the same phrase by the
machine right so if you actually look at
the graphs they actually sound close
look close so there is like there's a
Batman your type shape on the top if you
can see the same thing at the bottom
you'll see that oh they are the same
thing but you'll notice that the machine
is still very square e there are n
transitions from nodes to the other node
like in in my rendition but digging into
that a little bit let's try to
understand what is the difference so
this is just me drawing the Mellow graph
by hand so that I can illustrate
something so this is a prescriptive
notation the first thing is ba like the
first node a plate for two two durations
but it spans three nodes so it spans for
two and seven at the same time and that
is just uttered as a single node right
so that's that's clearly information
that we're losing and I guess that
brings us to another abstraction for us
to understand so these are called gamma
comes in reality I do not understand
these gamma comes as a learner my
teacher just sings I repeat right so
this is a concept that seems to exist in
theory in textbooks in in various
literature pieces but isn't understand
it isn't understood in day-to-day music
so let's understand spiritum let's
listen to something actually so you see
that dip in between the inverted
triangle so that's actually the spiritum
the gyro is a is a gradual ascent let's
listen to that
right so that gradual ascent is also
called a gonca Oh DK actually the
interesting Kamaka because it spans
across multiple notes like four or five
of them computer is just oscillation
between two notes and there are a bunch
of them listed here so this is a book
that actually came out 300 years ago was
written by Supra medic it's called Li
Sangeeta sampradaya professional he
actually has notation and he uses that
in notating his own work but this is not
done on a day to day basis so he has he
has these gamma comes written down and
ways to combine them and multiple gum
comes written down prefixed before each
note but as far as writing these in
software modeling them in software is
concerned and not the first do them so
this guy akka which exists it's it's
built in to run only in Windows there's
a database of phrases which he is
manually made so we like basically write
on every possible trigram of swarams
and then mark the probability of the gum
account existing and all the
possibilities of the comic um and their
probabilities so like around 300-400
probabilities per draaga and that's a
lot of work but the way he malt Samson
is interesting because he has
parentheses and angular brackets they
represent speed and increase in decrease
of pitch and these are the only two
things he uses to control gamma cones
that was interesting to me and I tried
modeling the SSP kind of gamma Coombs
myself so here is more code for you this
so this is an overtone instrument right
and if you note is inside the lead block
there's an energem on the gum and come
in right and that's applied on the sign
oscillator which means that it's an
envelope over frequency now that's not
very common in synthetic music people
usually apply envelopes on amplitude so
I need to shape the frequency curve and
so that's what I'm using so you'll see
in the in spiritum instrument a gyro
instrument so spectrum instrument has F
F L F F F right so that's the shape of
the spiritum curve and then there's the
gyro instrument which is like previous
frequency this frequency except take a
lot of time to do that right so and and
go so and do so in a Welsh curve so that
represents is the shape of this gamma
come and I can infuse them in between
and this is how that sounds this is
before right right and you can see at
the right top there is how I've prefixed
the notes with my own symbols to
represent gamma combs and you'll see
that these dips now exist and the
computer also exists so this is actually
much closer but I chanced upon this
other work by Shri Kumar it's also in
the recent past in 2013 and he has this
theses on this and I read the whole
thing so he represents these movements
between pitches as ideas of four so
instead of a DSR it's basi which is
pitch attacks a strain release and
you'll see that the first one PAH for
example has a list of three arrays three
vectors and you see they have four two
and seven as the first node so this is
exactly the same thing that I drew it by
hand earlier for you and the ASR
notation is that so it's like take two
durations to go from four to two and
then go to seven in two other durations
and stay at four stay at seven for four
of the durations right so that is what
that represents and this is actually
fairly easy to implement so I did and
let's listen to that
so that's exact same phrase of the
prescription tradition earlier let's
listen to the Machine right so that's
the four to seven transition that you
see and it's very neat and it's quite
close to me right and this is so good I
I think you guys should listen to some
more so here's some prescriptive
notation and the Machine gendering it
yeah so at this point I was happy I was
like okay now I have the flavor of
Carnatic music in my machine synthesized
music so I was happy but I knew that
like I have to manually transcribe this
music any piece of music into this
notation to do this and that was painful
and my other aspiration of course was
generation right like having a machine
create the music that's that's where all
the good stuff is so the first thing
that I tried is the regular aimless
wandering musical like algorithmic music
generation technique which is basically
just pick any random swaram but I
already have the abstraction of a raga
right like I can pick any random swaram
of a raga and that's what I did so I can
get ran dint of any swellings that you
pass to it with an ax raga and I have a
simple algorithm to to generate
durations such that after a certain
number of bars your head you hit a
multiple of 16 and that's why I stopped
so let's listen to that a bit
okay I really hope I had I really wish I
had that slider thing naturally being
super useful but you can follow along
the graphs as you listen to the music so
this is actually okay music it sounds
better in some raagas than this one but
you can see that there's a lot of up and
downs there's a lot of jumps and it's
it's it doesn't like although it sounds
in tune and everything it doesn't sound
very musical and at this point I
basically hit a wall and like okay this
doesn't sound musical what do I do like
how do I make this better so I I'm like
basically searching for abstractions
that I can use and a better
understanding of melody that I can use
and I don't have it but also part of the
reason why I don't have it is because I
don't have the data and but Natick music
is actually not in a place where western
music was even ten years ago so if there
isn't a grooveshark was forty-five
equivalent all the music is in like
everyone's personal collections and
there isn't like a common place where
everything is put together so I created
one such things right so I I wanted to
create a musicbrainz equivalent for
Carnatic music and this was basically my
work for the next six months basically
scrape every website that I can and get
the music data that I can get so this
the all these scrapers are on on in the
same repository now I can scrape all
these three websites and some European
has the most musical content I can
scrape all of this in all of three
minutes time from scratch anyway so I
then built a website for myself and my
friends to actually look up this music
actually after all these years we have a
raga dictionary like something that I
thought would have existed until now
already anyway so now I am at a position
where I can say search in my database
look for all ragams like all renditions
in in raga say hi to me like give me 50
of them and download them for me right
so now I have data
then I need to study it right and and
this study of data needs to be in in
signal processing and I'm not good at
that so I used tools so product is
actually something I discovered from
Shri Kumar's paper and that pride is
actually made for speech synthesis and
speech recognition but it seems to work
pretty well for vocal music sonic
visualize is sort of good too but pride
is what I use because it has a nice
autocorrelation algorithm that picks out
the frequency data that I need and it
has a command-line interface so then it
was just that I had to use in canter
read the frequencies off the file and
put them in a graph and so it's an XY
plot and then I have mellow graphs right
so these are the graphs that represent
an entire rendition an entire song or an
entire composition so I started these
for very long times but I can tell you a
few of my observations right away so
first thing is that you'll see a line
through it a constant thing mostly and
that's in like my hypothesis was that
that is the tonic note and similarly on
this one you'll see that there's a line
and there's another line on top which is
usually the next octave in the same
tonic note there's sometimes a line on
the third and the fifth as well it tends
to be prominent and you'll notice some
patterns in Ascension and dissension
depending on the quality of the data but
another way of looking at this data is
to make a histogram of it right so you
take frequencies throw away the data of
a sequencing of notes for the moment and
look at just the histogram which is this
and at this point I was like aha
I see my rigueur here so going with the
hypothesis that the biggest note there
is the tonic note I have my notes so if
that is sir I have rigged AMA pas the PI
is the in between frequency v and then
Danny saw which is the other peak and I
noticed a bunch of other things so first
thing is that in the octave lower
from the primary atonic note you see
there is only one peak which is the
lower fifth and then two three notes on
the higher octave as there's only two
three notes and higher octaves and the
peaks are actually lopsided so you'll
notice that the tonic note has a small
lopsided peak on the left the fifth also
has a loft lopsided peak on the fourth
and this is interesting because I know
that this raga has the fourth very close
to the fifth and now I have that
information right which is great and I
started this a whole bunch as well let
me do a quick walkthrough of these for
you so each row is a different drug on
so Polly on E is what we looked at the
violin rendition though you'll see that
it has a lot of a peak even close to the
tonic note and that's because it's on a
violin and and for some reason he chose
to emphasize that note more look at the
mandolin one though
that's kind of interesting because
mandolin is a fretted instrument that's
used for playing Carnatic music and it's
not it's it's not Orthodox to do so and
you'll see those Peaks as a very thin
peaks and the reason and that's sort of
how you would see a pitch histogram for
a guitar even for example gravity has a
different low up sightedness it has a
lopsided miss on the tonic note on the
right side that's because that
represents that raga and the right
bottom is actually an example of noisy
data and that's the sort of stuff I have
to deal with because the D doesn't clean
yet but that represents of the raga but
that histogram is useless anyway but now
that we have we have studied the data we
need to get the data into the
abstractions that we have already built
right so the abstractions that we have
built our swarams in raagas now how do
we use this information so one way to do
that is take the pictures to Graham
approximate every single frequency to
the nearest MIDI note so from a
continuous list of frequencies now you
have a discrete list of frequencies and
this is accomplished using overtone core
Hertz to MIDI that's convenient
and then I fold the octaves together and
I have a single octave with the
frequency of every note which is what
you have here now this is actually good
but it's not useful to me yet because I
don't have swarams and the reason why I
don't have swarams yet is because I need
to identify the tonic note and all the
other Psalms are related to that but
tonic note identification is still in
the signal processing research phase
right so these are papers in the recent
past where people have actually explored
pitch histograms which told me yes I'm
on the right route and they explore
different ways like isolate the drone
and find the tonic note there or
whatever but from my experience just
pick the highest frequency and that
mostly seems to work so how I do that is
this single function that does it for me
so basically create frequencies
normalize octaves and sort by values and
picks the first one and now if I have
identified the tonic note if you
remember the earlier map that I had
built out the simple swarams to the MIDI
histogram sorry the MIDI relative notes
I just need to do a reverse look-up on
that and I'm cold so I have this right
so I have a histogram of swarams in raga
right so this is abstraction that I have
already built and this is information
that I can use right so I can see that
first 15 then second tonic note next
octave are prominent and all the other
sperm is log are prominent here is
histograms of a few other ragas this is
Mahana italiani so actually mana has
only five notes and you notice that
between the two tonic notes there are
only four so these histograms represent
raagas correctly and now what I can do
is use this probability information and
generate music with that and that's what
I did
right so it's as simple as that it just
bucket them off into probabilities and
then pull the next forum based on those
here's what that sounds like
so there actually doesn't sound very
different from the random one but it
might not different sound sound that
different to you but it is supported to
put things in context what I did was I
believe that along with the ukulele and
so here's what that sounds like right
that sounds nice
Steve said it sounds like an eighties
game or something so that was relatable
and then my friend said I asked my
friend okay what raga do you think it is
in and she said Mohana maybe and then
she was right right so there lies the
concept of like you know subjective
human interpretation of melody and this
is validation like vetted by a human
humans so the meligrove so you can you
can compare and contrast them you might
not see a lot at the first glance but
then if you look at it a little deeper
you'll notice that there are lesser ups
and downs the random thing tends to have
a lot more of them so let's quickly
review the insights that we have had
until now so first thing the tonic note
is prominent right and then the first
and the fifth have sharper Peaks so this
is something I intend like intuitively
understood as a musician and like I just
don't have a lot of gamma comes at saw
and path but now I can actually see that
and model it so that's great is like a
rediscovery moment other notes are blunt
other notes other swarams are blunt
Peaks and probabilities of all swarams
anuraga are not the same that's probably
an important discovery and probabilities
across octaves of the same swarams like
the same swaram and different octaves
actually has different probabilities
what's the next step though the next
step to me was more
the continuity it like what comes after
the other one
excuse me this was quite easy to build
so instead of building a histogram of
the linear frequencies all you need to
do was line them up two at a time and
get frequencies of that and then I can
use this information now we move to move
to a whole new level now though there's
first the prominence of adjacency so
notes that are close to each other have
higher probabilities now so we should
have a lot lesser jumps so that's great
the second part of it is that it now
adheres to the grammar of raga correctly
right so you have our own of the road
and I mention that these need not be
symmetric or even linear so if you have
four eight instead of four five now you
will see in these probabilities that for
eighth probability is a lot higher than
the four five probability which encodes
the rule of a raga so that's great and
now all I need to do is build a lazy
sequence from this probabilities so I
have a stream of music notes that I can
now claim so let's listen to some to
spur on weighted music right - that
sounds spooky I know that's what
everyone in the office also said but it
sounds like music really and I was like
convinced that hey it's Carnatic music
and I can actually see mohanam things in
it and I can see gamma comes and there
are ups and downs that are great and it
sounds more continuous and like my voice
so that's great so the insights really
quick are that swarams close to each
other sound a lot better the rules of
our own um of door now encode encoded
there are gamma comes and this is sort
of the in-between stage where it's not
really good music yet but it's not even
as ignorant as the single probabilities
for him so it kind of sounds a little
worse than the ukulele example
yeah and the next step for me was to
look up Markov chains and like try to do
something more generic and have more
forums in your memory and really quickly
so this is what Wikipedia page says
about the first automated shakes and a
Markov chain so you have one note and
the probability of the next note and you
can find you can continue that line down
to the second order matrix that's the
second order matrix if only it stopped
there yeah that's the second automate
tricks and that's like the three storm
probabilities I can just make that
generic so somebody actually already did
this and made a generic Markov chain
generator so collation basically builds
the probability matrix and generally it
renders them and I have tried this a
whole bunch and it was a disappointing
right so there's three four five six
seven eight nine ten and that's the
number of swarams I'm holding in memory
before I render the next forum and it's
actually not that create like I imagined
that okay I got so much so far with one
and so far with two I imagined that it
would be exponentially better but it's
not actually the graphs actually seem to
be better they more granular there's a
movement but it doesn't sound good at
all
so I guess one conclusion was that maybe
music cannot be a Markov chain and
another defeat and that was that you
know Alice teams will not work - right
and I was really looking forward to like
not doing deep learning on this and then
this really dampened all my heighted
emotions on that yeah so what I did get
though are a couple of very good
byproducts first thing is automatic
transcription say this has not been done
for Carnatic music ever before so I can
take piece of music and in fact the
tonic note and everything from that and
give you actual notation this is
something I can give to my friend and
say hey you can learn this piece of
music here's a notation and they would
be able to do that it's not quite as
good as it needs to be but I'm sure I
can get there soon and that's really
good by-product I think was raga
identification this is a bit of a fad
amongst
Carnatic musicians in the beginning of a
concert like innovating of a song within
the 10 first seconds everyone's like oh
what's that ara and then like the people
who understand it get it fast and there
are also raga identification
competitions and now I'm I'm you know my
machine can participate in it so here's
how I did it this is what I learned from
e-commerce it is basically just do a
goodness-of-fit tests take your
histogram compare it with an incoming
histogram and you'll tell you'll be able
to tell how close they are
right so for example here is in the
middle is momentum against momentum so
you'll see that their chi-square scores
are super less like within 10 ish
kalyani and mohanam are closed to like
10 20s and gravity and mohanam are quite
far away and that's actually the truth
also mononym is actually a child of
Kalyani and his closer and here's a
visual representation of the same thing
so you have gravity versus gravity and
sounds they look similar and Mohan and
gravity look dissimilar what next though
we're from here so first thing is I want
to be able to take all the insights that
I have gained and push them back into
the generation and like use them as
algorithms
I'm trying that I'm getting that second
thing is I want to use all the synthesis
models so the SSP kind of gamma comes
and the passive kind of come comes use
them in the generative music itself and
then I want to experiment with the
rhythm rhythm has a bunch of problems in
the signal processing side still first
thing is you know the rhythms is not
even consistent and then some places
don't have rhythm and then you need to
pull out the rhythm component from the
music so that's difficult another thing
that would take is very father would be
synthesizing human voice just a minute
I'm almost done and another thing I
would do want to try still is deep
learning and here's a philosophical
question that keeps bothering me all the
time
when I listen to music and like okay
this is what the emotion of an artist an
expression of an artist was at that
point in time but if the machine is
doing the same thing is that still music
would you still respect it in
same way for the moment though I believe
you
with a piece of human music which seems
to be better than machines
city needed
bird
and that's how they have thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
