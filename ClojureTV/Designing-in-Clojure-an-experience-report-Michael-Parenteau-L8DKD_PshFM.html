Pento I'm an artist designer and
software engineer it wasn't always a
software engineer you know my background
is as Alex was saying not in programming
but you know today I work at a company
called Rio if I helped where we make
beautiful health care products and we
use closure full-stack front-end in the
backend prior to that I was as Alex was
saying I was at caca TechEd prior yeah I
was actually I started there when it was
relevance and I was there for six years
so you might be familiar with some of
the stuff I see some t-shirts that I
designed out the out in the crowd and I
used to make artwork for the cognate
cast various covers and things like that
and I want to go ahead and just give a
brief you know this is this is this is
my disclaimer for this talk because I
won I wanted to put really really small
text it was probably unreadable just to
you know kind of clarify that I may get
some things wrong some of this is really
about me and my personal growth working
with the closure community for some time
now and also it's also it's just sort of
what I've observed in the community in
the community's growth over the years
and there may be some bird blocks and
there may be some opinions in the early
portion of the talk that are painful but
also I promise it has a happy ending I
was originally introduced to closure and
relevance actually by Erin bedre back in
2010 so I've been working with closure
of you know
or at least closure programmers for
about the last seven years and you know
when I when I first heard about closure
it was primarily like you know to me it
just sounded like a bunch of buzzwords
immutability state functional data I
didn't really know what any of this
stuff meant and why it was important
when I was introduced to closure or you
know programming in general I was just
focused on you know interested in making
software for people and interested in
making it really useful and fun and easy
to use and you know we had and primarily
in the front end you sort of user
experience and my background is in fine
arts not in pewter science I didn't go
to design school I went to school for
art and you know later got into making
websites so that I could pay the bills
and I somewhere along the line
discovered that that I had a real
interest in making tools you know things
that helped people solve problems it
wasn't so much like I being that I come
from fine arts you'd think that it was
fully like I was interested in in just
the aesthetics of things but I actually
I found that I found it really rewarding
to actually work on things that you know
helped people get things done and you
know my first product design process in
doing any of this stuff was basically I
would hang out in Photoshop and you know
hand it off to a developer and then the
developer would go and make it real and
this was really unsatisfying to me
because you know I felt like whatever it
was that I designed never turned out the
way I intended and I didn't have the
context on why and you're right like so
like I led to sort of a disdain for
develop developers led to real
misunderstanding and poor communication
so I decided that I wanted to learn how
to code and you know that to me just met
basic HTML and CSS and and ultimately
what I wanted to do was I wanted to make
real stuff I wasn't happy with you know
essentially working in Photoshop and
then the process stopping there for me I
wanted to actually be able to like touch
it and move it around and and you know
see it come to life and I also wanted to
be more integrated on the team you know
I wanted to understand why things were
changing along the way whether it was
due to constraints or decisions and I
wanted to be a part of the conversation
and be a team member you know I wanted
better communication and wanted better
collaboration and after learning how to
write HTML and CSS to a point where I
was able to you know hand off HTML and
CSS to developers it got better but I
was still handing HTML and CSS off to
developers so you know the you know they
make it dynamic and ready for production
and you know but there were still issues
and things were still changing and I
didn't understand why but you know I at
the time was working at relevance and
basically we were writing rails apps to
talk to closure services back in 2010 we
were you know there wasn't I mean there
was like some server oriented side like
templating and like hiccup and things
like that but it wasn't you know like
primarily what we were doing to like
build applications was writing rails
apps and
you want to get a tomato I loved rails
rails was like I don't know like I was
familiar with HTML and CSS and like ER
be like seemed to make sense and I was
having like you know doing a lot of pair
programming and and and learning more
about modeling data and learning more
about you know you know just the
difference between the server and the
browser and and it was like super
exciting I felt like really productive
and I was like I was like really really
a part of the team now you know like we
were we were sharing code I was in the
codebase you know working in the same
stuff that everybody else was and so it
felt like I was you know equal
first-class citizen in the you know in
the team and and you know and the Ruby
community had all sorts of like tools
that that made sense to me that like
actually like felt like even the stuff
that I was paying attention to had
superpowers like sass and and he liked
templating languages like Hamill I felt
like we're really super lovely and and
then clojurescript happened in in you
know 2012 this this was this you know
this was like I remember actually
hanging out in the in the conference
room at the relevance office and while
everybody was hanging out and like super
super jazzed everybody was just so
pumped we're getting rid of shift
closure script and you know closure is
gonna run in the browser and it's just
amazing and like you know again like I
was I was just getting used to like
hanging on Rails and you know finally
started to feel like I was a part of the
team and everything was groovy and then
you know basically we saw a lot less a
lot less Ruby and a lot less rails and
the excitement was all around closure
script and I didn't actually even like I
didn't know how to how to take advantage
of it I know how to use it I didn't
understand closure I didn't
understand you know I just didn't
understand and and you know we had you
know like clojurescript one was that
wasn't it was a I don't know if you all
remember that project but that was a
that was an attempt to kind of explain
or demystify or help people get ramped
up on closure and even that was still
like way over my head and you know like
like I lost all my tools
I lost sass and I lost templating and I
lost other things that I was just
becoming familiar with and it was like
these were kind of painful times for me
as a as a designer at the you know who
had just kind of you know gotten ramped
up with the with with the team you know
I wear things I liked about you know
Rails was you know like an asset
pipeline and just like how things just
kind of worked and yeah like hiccup
seemed kind of like Hamill like it was
really nice and like you know somewhat
minimal but like man like he's like Sean
was just talking about par inference
like the all those trailing parentheses
and braces and I just like oh you know
basically I I remember I remember
actually working for the first time in
hiccup with Stuart Sierra actually
introduced it to me and we were we were
you know he saw how how bad I was
struggling and and then he says oh man
we gotta get you set up on Emacs and you
know he create created a little index
card for me and a little cheat sheet for
like we have my Emacs going we had slime
and Swank and we get par at it and I'm
like slurping and barfing and and
everything is like like awesome and by
the end of the day I had like put some
icons in an app and made a button and it
was I felt like I didn't really get much
done but
you know I did spend quite a bit of time
emacs
after that but I haven't quite gotten my
config all set up the way I want it so
I'm not a full convert yet so and then
like and then you know and then pedestal
I have happened a little later you know
not too far after closure script one and
and pedestal app was actually like this
like super super exciting thing it was
almost almost as exciting as like as
closure script itself it felt like in
some ways at least from my perspective
looking in it was just this like wow
this is like you know just look at it
look at it in the browser were like what
we can do in the browser with closure is
super super exciting and and and I saw
that I saw the demo and I remember
thinking this is this is really neat and
you know and I remember actually hearing
and this is this is a better way to work
and I'm like cool I was like so you know
what about like sass and what about like
like how are we doing CSS and how are we
like how are we actually building the
application and like how I and other
designer is going to integrate on the
team I was like oh we just used CSS I
just remember feeling like no this isn't
a better way to work not for me in
retrospect it probably was and it was
just foreign to me and I understand that
we all have constraints that we're
dealing with and different concerns
everybody's you know kind of like you
know solving problems at some
prioritized in some prioritized fashion
and and that's you know that's fair but
like you know like I'm on the team and
this is like from where I was sitting it
did not feel more advanced it felt like
it felt like you know kind of like a big
step back and so the communication
started to get more difficult again for
me you know one set of people working on
one thing
and another set of people were
translating it it went I went back to
writing you know basic HTML and CSS
because that's where I was comfortable
and productive so that I could deliver
things to my teammates and then they
would take these things and you know
translate them just like back in the old
days only a couple years prior and you
know there's and when that happens
there's like drift and there's you know
bias and inconsistency things just you
know they change you know like you take
a piece of information and you and you
hand it off to someone else and then
they parse that information and then and
then they you know and there's an
interpreter and then they hand it off to
someone else and it like it kind of goes
down the cycle it's kind of like you
know over the wall telephone and then
you know after pedestal happened I mean
really actually react came and kind of
kind of killed pedestal at that seemed
like you know there were you know now it
was like hey Facebook has this you know
right great engineering support team
that's all the resources in the world to
you know design and ship a virtual DOM
and and and then we ended up with things
like oh man quiescent and reagent and
all sorts of wrappers for react and that
became the thing and then you know devs
helped out and pitched in and were like
yeah let's you know like we've got tools
to like work with SAS and you know it
from like from where I was sitting it
was like watcher scripts or running SAS
locally but if we wanted to really get
things integrated nicely maybe we would
you know use JRuby so that we could JVM
everything because you know SAS was
still a ruby gem it was pre libsass at
the time and it all just felt sort of
wonky still to me but hey you know at
least at least designers were were able
to write in a language that we felt
comfortable with and we you know we had
some productivity instead of just using
plain old CSS again but like it got
better but it wasn't quite there yet
like I still fell
like handing over and translating HTML
and CSS and working in silos and and and
not really fully feeling integrated with
the team I mean I loved my team and and
and you know everybody was great people
and I wouldn't trade it for the world I
actually would I look back and I think
those are some of the greatest times in
my life but you know there was there was
like it was hard it was really
challenging to like figure out how to
how to work you know what's the best way
to work you know like how do we work
together and you know different people
have different concerns of priorities
right yeah that's that's the that's the
that's a that's a theme and even though
we're trying to solve the same problems
to build stuff for people who don't care
about the technology that we're using
really you know we you know it's it's
it's challenge and I felt like a lot of
time the attention was being spent on
developing tech and it was just really
hard to sync up on on the concerns on
common concerns because you know like I
really wanted my tools and the rest of
the dev team really wanted their tools
and we just like right like but but like
all the while we were trying to ship
something for other people that that
don't really care about either of our
tools we have a common goal and like
somewhere along the way it was like okay
you know if I'm gonna hand over if I'm
gonna hand over HTML and CSS CSS if
that's gonna be the deliverable then I'm
gonna use a static site generator and
you know that way I can at least take
advantage of some some tools that felt
comfortable and productive to me and I
got into middleman which it was like so
I'm back in Ruby and I've got sass and
I've got Hamlin I got all the things
that I want and and and all the things
that other designers that I worked with
wanted there was like a community of
people and tools and we had all this
stuff and it was awesome I was able to
prototype you know applications really
quickly spike out the behavior show it
to a customer
and you know and and get the context
together so that like there was a full
sort of communication of what it is that
we're trying to build together and and
and you know then hand that off as a as
a static site and you know I had
partials and layouts and and everything
was great I mean even got into the you
know it was like you know was it you
know the like we were building
components but not you know not like
react components see we were eventually
ultimately building react components but
but like for me I was building like
little modular pieces that are like
looking at a bootstrap or anything else
like that where I could just kind of
like assemble these application ideas
and and it was it was really starting in
a clique you know it was still separate
from the application it still wasn't a
first class citizen I still had I still
had this like code base that I was
maintaining and then like and I would
ship off the HTML to be you know dealt
with and assets to be dealt with and you
know again when we're not sharing code
it feels like like there's a lot of
opportunity for some of that drift to
kind of sneak in again and
inconsistencies start to build up so we
some you know some some some teammates I
see some people here that actually
contributed to this and and there's also
a good friend Alex Frankton that you
know he saw my pain and felt my pain and
was like man we had to figure out how to
how to how to make this work and so we
actually like embedded a middleman
application into the repo so that that
was actually the source of truth for all
of the templates and all of the styles
and it was you know it was again the
first-class citizen in the application
you know we had everything kind of wired
up and working with big wheel and and
you know but but again it was middle man
it was a middle man application like
literally embedded in a closure repo so
you know it to me it felt like winning
it was like it was awesome it was this
like I was productive dads were
productive we were shipping software
that worked
customers were happy with but like you
know it's kind of complicated it's kind
of its kind of weird it's not it's not
fully baked we never actually took it
anywhere you know we've never actually
finished it but it was it was a really
cool sort of approach that did feel like
we were all working together as a team I
like have an incredible amount of
respect for programmers in engineering
even it's like I I don't come from from
there you know and like it started it
started as sort of like this really
awful relationship to me you know where
I just again I never understood why
things were the way they were and why we
couldn't just make it work until I
started programming myself and and you
know and as I struggled people people
came to my aid people helped me out you
know they they helped me become you know
a better programmer and and I could
share what what I wanted to share with
people which was a different perspective
on things you know it wasn't it wasn't
always easy you know I worked you know
really hard to kind of keep up and and I
really really care about like how it is
that we work together so yeah I'm really
grateful
i-i'll aft cognate act after six years
of being at relevance and cognitive tech
to go and work at a product company and
and and that essentially like I actually
ended up leaving and not working in
closure I quit for a year took took some
time off actually ended up working in
just the regular react JavaScript stack
using webpack and react and radix and
and NPM and everything like that and I
actually had a really fantastic time
over there you know and I don't think
that it had anything to do with the fact
that it wasn't closure it's just that it
was like it was different and I I think
that it gave me an opportunity to look
at some more of the fundamentals of
JavaScript and and and kind of what what
everybody was doing in closure
interacting with react and it just
changed my view of things quite a bit
and you know I think I think that I
think that it was a really really great
experience because like it also showed
me that like the JavaScript community
has incredible tools and they it is our
community the JavaScript unity is our
community work even though we're you
know in enclosure land here we
ultimately are like right like we're
hanging out in the browser and like we
could take advantage of these tools and
the thing is is it seems to me like
ultimately it comes back down to people
of different concerns coming together
and working together and there's just a
lot of like really really fantastic
design tools in the JavaScript space so
it it was it was a good experience to me
I think there's a lot that we can you
know we can we can learn and take
advantage of from over there and this is
where I think it was about me maybe and
and not necessarily the devs or the
closure community yeah I think I think
that like maybe in a lot of ways when I
look back at some of my frustrations and
difficult times it was it was actually
more about mine just not understanding
and like not not you know learning is
hard and and when you don't have the
context for you know why it is that
people are making the decisions they're
making it's easy
to jump to some assumptions and and and
start to feel like maybe the wrong
things are being focused on or maybe you
feel like you're being left out I felt
like I was being left out but I wasn't
you know I was actually being embraced
and and and helped every step along the
way and after I like hanging out in the
in JavaScript space it you know and and
and you know it gave me some time to
kind of reflect on all of the
experiences that I had had with such
wonderful people and yeah I decided that
I was going to leave the company that I
had gone to work with and hang out with
some closure to vel purse again and I
got to work on a project with with
cognate echt again as a contracted on I
gave with with David shlonsky and it was
an Arachne app and so you know we were
working the same codebase together I
would design wireframes to communicate
design intent just like you know any any
other thing and you do Photoshop design
or whatever whatever whatever I needed
to do in order to figure out what we
were building and and then I would go
and build the front-end and and we
started thinking about this middleman
approach because we were so productive
and then I decided to ditch it in favor
of just writing rum components and
hiccup and as we did this it was like
really cool because I was I felt
productive I was I was hanging out and
and and making static pickup and able to
sort of stand up the prototypes just
like I was working in middleman or Ruby
or anything else like that but you know
as soon as we started to integrate the
behavior we we realized okay now things
are getting kind of complicated again I
have this like nice clean structure that
represents what it is that we're looking
at in the browser and as soon as it
started to get detangled then there's
all this other additional logic that
gets put in and it's like I didn't have
the context on what it is that we're
making anymore you know it's like I
couldn't I think I was scared to touch
it with that you know like because it's
gonna break
and and and I won't understand why and
that's okay but we're trying to stay
productive together so actually David
you know had had had looked at what we
were doing and he was like yeah you know
he's like I really like looking at this
like nice clean you know markup that you
put together and it is it's like when we
look at this like integration of the two
it starts to get really really messy so
Luke van der Hart created a library
called heat
it's a hiccup in live adapter transforms
and so essentially what we're doing is
you know we headed up going back to the
old way of working with where the way
that we were with HTML and Static
generated sites but with pickup data
structures and I could write these nice
little templates that were just very
easy to read and they were static but
they represented all of the different
states that the application could be
composed of in little tiny components
the little functions and and then you
keep go and grab them and and and apply
transforms to them and you know make
them into a real application but the
soil the logic and is is sitting in one
space that it communicates that really
clearly and then all of the structure
for the for the for the for the
templating is in another space there's
more code but it's like the separation
adds some real interesting clarity to to
the project and we found that to be a
really great way to work because at the
end of the day we created a convention
that we you know have a handshake on in
terms of what it is that we're going to
apply these transforms on is in terms of
selectors and I didn't worry about
whether or not I was going to break up
anymore because I wouldn't touch those
IDs and and I would style everything on
on classes and we everything just kind
of worked and we were really really
productive it was great like I think
that that's like an example of like
design and development working closely
together to make something great to make
something better it's like like when we
figure out how it is that we want to
work with one another and we take the
time to communicate and figure out where
the parts are the friction is
and then and then address it you know
like like we had done it many other ways
whether or not we actually reach an
ultimate solution it's not really the
point it's it's just that we're at the
end of the day again shipping stuff for
people who don't care about the tech
that we're using so you know if we can
have a really great experience doing it
and and and actually deliver then
awesome and you know and in this case of
like actually sharing code together it's
not like you know there's this like
translation that that's taking place you
know it's it's it's we're in the same
space you know having a conversation
with one another which I feel like leads
to just a better work experience leads
to a better product and it's just that
that's that's that's a better way of
working no not I think in retrospect
when when you know when originally and I
was thinking about closure script one it
was a better way of working but who was
it better for it was it was a better way
for that person it wasn't better for me
and if we weren't able to work together
then it's not better for our customer
because again they don't care about our
tech they just want it to work and I
feel like you know in this case this is
a great example of like of kind of like
you know you focusing on the tech as
much as it needs to be focused on in
order for us to get to the next place
and I think that shared code is is is
something that is important you know it
it allows for there to be less drift
because because we're both taking but
like we're all taking responsibility for
it and it also you know I like paired
programming I like working with people
and and having a different sort of set
of skills and having someone else with a
different set of skills and us like
hanging out and learning from each other
I feel like that's
you know there is an opportunity for
everybody to grow so today I work at
redefine off like I said and and we
design and develop enclosure and we have
a design system that you know that the
product shares assets to build products
it's actually in the app it's all
enclosure we use picked up we have
multiple apps we're doing stuff with
mobile and we're you know it's and we
have all these different environments
but it's all in one space and it's and
it's it's actually really really cool
the team is super amazing we work
together we share knowledge it's like
it's it's like the next thing you know
like it's like kind of like going from
you know it's you know it's also a bunch
of people that I worked with their
cognate act and relevance so it's that
you know that to has been really
interesting but it's kind of like it's
everything that I've always wanted is to
actually be able to collaborate with
other people on making something real we
use reframe um next and and and hiccup
and sass and we've got Lips ass now so
everything's really fast we don't have
like all of the perfect workflows right
like there were things that like like
when I looked at middleman and I worked
at an in middleman to like generate a
static site it had these like it was
like really focused and did these set of
things well and it allowed for me to be
able to put together things in a way
that it just felt smarter easier so that
I could deliver things to other people
and again that but that sort of
supported this other workflow that
didn't feel quite right and now working
in enclosure like I feel like I don't
think that I could have I don't think I
could have accomplished what we're
accomplishing today seven years ago or I
mean we'll look obviously couldn't have
because closure script hadn't been
yeah but like still it's like looking
looking like looking back like there's
yes a part of it was me but another part
of it was the community has like grown
in a major major way like we have tools
today that we did not have then and it
is so much better so I'm writing this
design system at reify and and putting
together all of the design components
and like bits and pieces like you know
what icons are in the app or what colors
are in the app and these things are you
know sitting in you know color variables
and SAS files or they're an SVG and you
know I like I got tired of using the web
inspector and then trying to figure out
what file it was at so that I could then
go to the you know the the color
variable and then just this like
feedback loop that was like kind of
crazy workflow and I was like so I just
I need to like I need to push this this
you know style guide forward so that we
can expose these things and they're
always running when the app is running
in development and so I like wrote it
all by hand in like a you know in in a
file and it was it was a lot of work and
and one of the teammates Tom kid he
looks at it he was like whoa he's like
that's crazy work so he created source
munch and source munch basically was
using lumo it's a it's an open source
library that way if I put together its
you know I'll make sure the community
gets to get some of these links or
whatnot from things that I've mentioned
but short story is is that it goes and
reads files and grabs the data from
those files and then you know can do
stuff with it so like we're essentially
taking the data from the sass file and
the variables and then like generating
all of the things that needed to be
generated to create these swatches in
the browser and the same thing with you
know parsing the SVG it has all the icon
data and everything like that and so so
now the templates like really small
instead of like this giant hiccup file
and and it doesn't have to be like
manually edited in order to keep it
to date so that's really cool and again
that's a great example I feel like of a
great collaboration between you know
design and development so in a lot of
ways you know when I when I first
started I didn't understand closure I
didn't like closure
I'd like to closure programmers you know
and I really wanted to work with
everyone really badly
I felt clumsy and sometimes stupid when
working with closure I felt like the
tools weren't made for people like me
and you know over the time this was a
reoccurring theme but you know great
people helped to make great improvements
and actually helped to work with me so
that I could see that it wasn't just me
or you it was like a thing that we share
and you know today I can say that
closure is as good as stack is I've ever
worked it from my perspective it's up
it's like I it's it's awesome you know
like it's getting better all the time I
don't miss rails you know or working in
web pack I mean I don't miss Hamill
hiccups been fun you know I've got some
parentheses management down now you know
even with my unfinished Emacs config I
don't miss Emacs
you know it's not about the role or
responsibility but more about working
together to build something great you
know we share code and we focus on the
intent of what we're building and we
focus on something works how something
works or how it feels you know the tech
is important and it will always need
innovation and improvement but like you
know I know that's you know you hear it
all the time the software's about people
and and then again they don't care about
the tech that we're using like it's
really really awesome to today be
working in closure with closure
developers in all of the files with all
the tools and to be shipping value to
people I mean we are making software for
people who are actually using it and I
get to talk to them through user
interviews and ask them about problems
that they have with their business and
they you know tell me about their
problems and and we design features and
we ship those features and we get and
it's like they're stoked I mean they're
thrilled that we get to pay attention to
things that are going to affect their
lives and make them better and like
we're making beautiful software it's not
just it's not just stuff that works it
works is the base level if you think of
like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs or
whatnot when it's like it's like saying
food is edible we don't we don't think
about I'm not gonna ask you hey would
you like to go and get something edible
for dinner let's not go and get poisoned
you know it's it's it's like it should
work as the base foundation and then we
layer in other things until we figure
out a way to delight and and make things
feel great and that happens on the final
product and it also happens in our tools
and our workflow and our communications
with each other today it doesn't feel
like it's you know over over the wall it
doesn't feel like you know I do this you
do that and you know and we don't ever
have to talk to one another it actually
feels like I can collaborate and have a
really meaningful conversation with my
teammates to again do something that is
not about us so I just wanted to take
the moment to say thanks to some people
at cognate act and and actually
everybody here really has engineers that
are here for moving the ball forward and
including someone like me on the team I
think that yeah I'm really really
grateful for that and I also wanted to
thank some artists out there because I
wouldn't be Who I am without them and
and you know that's that's what I got
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
