about generating generators today so
first a little background if you were
here last year at the conch I gave a
lightning talk called the way to Eden
that was about my Herbert schema
language for Eden maybe you've also seen
the closure west videos if you were
there John Hughes gave a great talk
called testing the hard stuff and
staying sane that was about quick check
and that's especially in Haskell and
Erlang and then read rapers ported quick
checked to closure he gave a talk called
powerful testing with test check and
that was also a closure west we also had
a hackathon and read was nice enough to
help me with some my stuff so first an
overview of this talk I'm going to talk
about Herbert schemas again some of that
might be a repeat four people were here
last year but there's a lot of new
people so I hope you don't mind I'll
give you a very quick in introduction to
property based testing and then we'll
talk about generating generators and how
schemas can play a role that so way to
Eden that was I was inspired by Star
Trek and these were the space hippies in
that episode and in this case they're
having a stand-up meeting I'm talking
about their Eden Project okay so they're
concerned with the data values and
they've invented the extensible data
notation as the way of describing your
closure data and it also worked for
other languages so that's been a big
success but we're still having problems
communicating with the crew of the
enterprise okay so that you can see that
the captain kirk there he looks like QA
guys as you know i can't test without a
spec you know it's just like we don't
really we're not conveying all the
information we need they don't they
don't know how to interpret write the
words make sense but they can't put it
all together so Herbert was an insult
that the space hippies had for Captain
Kirk Herbert was a minor official who
was notorious for his rigid and limited
Limited patterns of thought so I took
that as inspiration for designing my
schema language so now we're talking
about a schema we're talking about the
shape of data the space hippies have
their great ideas so now that they have
a scheme and they can communicate better
with the crew of the enterprise so we're
talking about Herbert schemas the first
thing they're good for is just
documentation this is how I got started
I just wanted a simple notation to keep
track of what I was doing with my own
code you come back to it a few months
later and you say oh what keys where I
use where I using was I using here did I
have nested maps or did I have a vector
there so I developed this notation just
for my own use once I had a notation I
said well if we formalize that then I
could create you know code to actually
validate that my data matched my schema
so of course like typical programmer I
got a little carried away started
writing a bunch of code about about that
made it made a library that that's how
Herbert got started along the way I said
well you know pattern matching is also
kind of useful and I could extract bits
of my data by using the schemas so that
was added and fine finally today we're
going to talk about having a test check
generators generated from schema so
first let's let's review some of the
patterns that that I use in the schema
language all the literals just match
themselves the keywords strings numbers
etc symbols in a schema pattern are
standing for something else and we're
trying to be intuitive so it stands for
an integer and KW for keyword and so on
so you can think of those as mapping to
a predicate that tests is this item that
kind of thing maps really in my
programming I think it's really common
for most people you have you know
literal key words and then you need to
know the type there's a particular type
associated with each of those keywords
so that's how we represent it with a
data map that you know looks similar to
the
You're Expecting vectors the same kind
of thing so inside a vector you could
have literals or you can have you know
other patterns and in this case you know
I have a vector of first item is an
integer second items a keyword and so on
then you can build these things up you
can also use operators and or not and
make more complicated patterns that way
we also in Herbert support quantifiers
so this is like regular expressions you
know the question mark is zero one of
these kind of items star 40 more plus
you know one or more and as a shorthand
you can use those quantifier symbols as
a suffix on some other kind of symbol
and so that's that's just expanded into
the the quantified simple and so here's
an example and in this case you know we
have the key word but it's just the
plain a its value should be an integer
the be with the question mark after it
means that that be keywords optional so
if it's B's there then the value has to
be a symbol or it might not be in my map
at all and sees mapped to a vector of
strings and so then these are three
examples of the kinds of things that
would match that that schema and later
we'll talk about how we could generate
these kind of examples using the same
schema so you don't have to change the
schema we just say now generate me data
so the Herbert API is fairly small
there's a few other things but the main
thing is this conforms ? give it a
pattern and a value and it tells you if
that value conforms to the schema
pattern if you want to make your own
predicates and use it multiple times you
can use conform without the question
mark and a schema that will give you
back a predicate function that you can
use over and over again that's kind of
the real base of the Herbert schema
system then I have an example here so
I'm finding my tests and I want to
conform to this schema
and you can see that the result of
something that does conform is a non nil
value it's a map of all the bindings and
we'll talk about bindings a little bit
later but that schema pattern the first
item in the schema pattern is the bind
symbol colon equals since I started
programming with Pascal so that's my
Hamish Pascal so I'm binding the K the
capital K to the keyword and and when we
do the match that capital K is matched
the keyword colon a alright so now we're
going to talk a little bit property
based testing so my analogy for
comparing property based testing to unit
testing unit testing is somewhat like
having a dart you know one single dart
I'm going to throw it at a big blank
wall and it'll just hit a spot and
that's that's my test property based
testing is a little bit more like having
a dart board up there and a whole bunch
of darts for death row at it and the
second the second way with the dark
board that's that's more fun and by fun
I mean finds more bugs for me to work on
so test thought check is the property
based library that we're going to use so
a few more details on property based
testing we're testing against randomly
generated inputs and we're going to use
a universally quantified property and we
can see a typical example here we say
for all n which are generated from
integers we want to say that the square
of n is greater than the original end
and that sounds about right but it's not
exactly right is it ok so we can we can
see this in a fail on 0 and when we get
a fail or a failure with a quick check
it tells it tells us not only what the
failure it found but it also try to
shrink the failure case to the smallest
possible case that it can think of that
helps you a lot with debugging because
if you get a small test case you can
usually figure out what's going on if
you have a large randomly generated data
structure and something's wrong you know
your test fails
you're not sure what part of it to look
at so it's a great feature that you can
shrink to the smallest test case now I I
have a little bit different way of
looking at these properties I also you
know the typical way to do it was with
for all as a universally quantified
property but I you know equivalently you
can think of it as a predicate that
holds across all your generated data and
I kind of like the predicate approach
because I'm often just writing
predicates for myself you're using them
in preconditions using them in asserts
that sort of thing and it caps lates
what I think I know about my data and
then Herbert also will will create those
predicates for you so when you're
writing your predicates there's a couple
of things you might think about the
simplest thing is just that you know I
do get a good value right so sometimes
you know that's that's a good property
just to start with I'm not throwing I'm
getting a result but then if you can it
be nice to have something that narrows
narrows it down or as a stronger
property one way to do that is to think
about having some kind of round trip
consistency so if you have maybe some
complimentary functions you might encode
your data a certain way and then decode
it and you want to see that you get the
same thing back or you might have some
other transformations that are
reversible you want to see that you get
the same same value back another way to
think about your predicate is to create
a predicate that uses some kind of
Oracle or known good implementation
maybe you have a system that you but you
already trust and you're working on a
new system that's going to be a lot
faster but you want to make sure you
still get the same answer so you can
compare your your new answer to your old
answer make sure they're the same so
that's another kind of predicates they
might might want to right now when you
do find a failure may go back to when
we're shrinking the failures if you fat
if you find a failure case that's a
great candidate for making a unit test
all right you'll make a regression test
save that save that case and make sure
you don't bump into it again because you
know the property based testing
randomly found that but that that's like
gold let's hold on to that one and put
it into your test suite now a few more
details getting into the properties the
basic macro that you want to use is for
all and that kind of lets you do let
style bindings so in in this first case
you know the a and the B are both
integers and our property what we're
trying to say is that the sum of a and B
is always greater than or equal to the
integer a and that you know that sounds
plausible but then when you think about
a little bit more but maybe that's not
right okay so most of my examples here
are done to be properties that aren't
then a hold across all the generated
data so be happen to be negative right
then that that proposition will fail and
quick check will tell you you think
about these negative numbers so quick
check is the driver that will actually
go and take your property and generate
all the tests and report the results
back to you so this is the full syntax
quick check you can give it a number of
trials that you want it to attempt then
you give it a property and typically
your property some kind of for all
statement and this is another you know
property that sounds plausible that the
the square of an integer well let me let
me back up a little bit in this case I'm
using a generator that's strictly
positive integer and so square of a
strictly positive integer is greater
than the original integer and that's not
quite true of course because strictly
positive means something that's not zero
but is some positive number and it's
shrunk immediately to simplest case of
one all right the end of your one is not
not greater than square of one the
there's a little bit something to be
careful with when you're looking at the
generators that test out check provides
so in this case the S pause in tats
strictly positive integer that that
starts at you know one and up
and but usually enclosure there's
there's also another generator called
pause int which starts at zero but
usually enclosure pause doesn't include
zero so there's a bug out there maybe
the names might change a little bit to
conform more to the way we do things
enclosure but for now you have to notice
the difference between the yes at the
beginning that's strictly positive
alright so we're going to get into more
of the details here but before I do that
I'm that I'm going to be talking about
generators and combinators and that
reminds me another Star Trek episode you
might remember this one the changeling
there was a the backstory is that there
is an Old Earth space probe that had
somehow merged with a super powerful
alien technology and the enterprise had
discovered this probe out in space and
eventually it comes to threaten the
enterprise and in fact might wipe out
all of humanity so does anybody remember
what the name of that probe was people
people think okay yeah the movie was
vedra but this is the original Trek
episode okay the changeling so I'm older
than a lot of people here so I remember
saying this as a kid no it was called
monat if you do you remember and so the
Star Trek definition of monad is a super
powerful alien technology that doesn't
work well with primitive biological
units okay so yeah yeah okay i hope the
haskell gods will forgive me for that
cheap joke but basically you don't have
to know about monads to appreciate test
check if you do know about monads you
know it you'll see some things that are
familiar but there's kind of monads
under the hood but you don't have to
study them although they are good to
learn and i'm i am going to learn some
haskell this year that's on my bucket
list so i'll be getting into monads more
later
myself so now let's let's go to
generators Combinator's so these
generators come with tests not check
they're actually quite a bit more but
the simple kind just generate scalars so
you can think of your integers and
strings keywords that sort of thing
return just returns an actual value that
you happen to have a hold of choose can
choose among integers you can give it a
range there are also generators for
collections and there some other the
next line generators the one of lets you
choose among several other generators so
now we're creating new generators by
modifying or taking advantage of other
generators and I'm not I don't have time
to go into all those but you know it is
worth learning and look looking through
tests check seeing all the generators
you have available there f map and bind
are really interesting generators and
we'll talk a little bit more about them
but so f map lets you apply you apply
your custom function to the result of a
generator so as each item comes out it
runs through your function and creates a
new value bind takes it another level
and creates a new generator from the
results of another generator and we'll
see that in a minute and there are a
couple of new generators in recent
versions of tests suck check that
haven't had too much time to play with
yet but recursive gen looks like it's
going to be useful for me for defining
recursive data structures and shuffle
will give me different combinations of
values out of a collection and actually
I can use that in my implementation of
it later so when we're talking about
things like buying and we're generating
generators from generators we have to
kind of it's for especially for new
closure programmers if you're not used
to higher-order functions this might
take you a little while to think about
you're adding a
mentioned here to to the kind of work
we're doing but it's really valuable and
powerful so you know take a little time
to learn how to use bind and get your
head around what it means to bind one
generator to another generator so we're
we're generating values from the first
generator taking those into a function
that is a return a new generator and
then we'll use that generator to give us
the actual values that we want okay so
there's an example from the test thought
jet well I guess there's an example page
on the test i'll check get a cross or
talking about taking effect you want to
return a vector and an element from that
vector a vector of ants sorry a vector
events and then randomly choose one of
those values out of that so you think
about that for a minute and the obvious
way to do that with the generators is
this expression so would NSA let me let
me work kind of inside out so at the end
of the first line you can see we say we
want a vector events ok so we generate
those entz and test dot jackals you know
naturally start with a small vector and
then grow to longer vectors we're going
to modify that by saying we don't want
the empty vector so we say not empty on
that generator and that will exclude the
empty vector so now we're taking bind
taking the result of this vector of in
feeding it into a function so this
anonymous function but inside that is
just another generator expression and
you can see that given a vector of ins
will first as the first element of our
tuple will return that vector as gen
return just literally returns what we
gave it and we'll say Jen elements
elements takes one of our elements out
of some collection so that will hand you
back theta values that look like this
and you can see the you know a small
case of
first one is just give me a vector of
two and two so we'll just choose 2 and
so on the third one gets a little longer
and we're picking the minus 5 so that's
fine that works great and it's worth
learning all those generators to do that
now I want to bring in our Herbert
schemas we're coming back to the scheme
as we started with so this is the
expression for taking a Herbert schema
to do the same sort of thing and all
walk you a bit through that so the HD
generator just says turn my schema into
a generator and the description of the
schema directly says I have the first
element is going to be a binding so I'm
in a bind whatever I find is my first
element to this capital v and i'll use
that that letter later or that local by
name later the actual element there
should be it plus a vector one or more
in okay which is what we did before and
then the second element in this tuple
that we're returning is something the in
operator on the original vector okay so
now the idea here and the goal is that
the Herbert schema is closer to your
data representation so you can kind of
still have your mind in what is my data
look like we have a pattern that is you
know written in the same kind of form as
the data we want to generate okay and so
what I'm what I'm trying to accomplish
here is that you know my generators make
it easier for you to think about your
data and just generate the data without
having to go through a lot of effort on
the Combinator's okay and then a couple
of other kinds of schema representations
that might be easier to use for creating
your generators in this case we have a
couple of optional keywords
and when we get optional keywords you
can think okay we're generating now some
of our data will have possibly the colon
a it might not it might have the colon
be or it might have neither of them and
you can see some examples is kind of
data we generate from that so this to me
is a simpler data representation that
schema there captures what I'm expecting
my day to look like in the simpler
format than if you write out the longer
expression using the typical test
thought check generators and because
it's it's a data representation that
we're working off of instead of just
using our code now the code code is
great for doing more complicated
examples and you'll need those
generators if you have lots of cross
constraints within your data but for a
lot of simple things I recommend that
you take a look at house how we can
generate generators from schemas another
great example here is just using regular
expressions so if i have a string that's
going to match this kind of a fubar
pattern but you can see all these
variations here that the regular
expression gives me and similarly for
the you know the name of the keyword i
might want to use a regular expression
on that i use a lot of regular
expressions in my schemas just making
sure like maybe a word to be capitalized
or i don't want any punctuation
characters in a certain field that sort
of thing and you know I I admit regular
expressions are complicated so we're
we're complicating our whole
representation here but there's probably
a good reason that for that you know
regular expressions are probably the
most successful dsl you know in history
they're very useful and it's very nice
to have them part of my schema language
here and it's great for generators I
want to thank Gary Frederick's at the
hackathon at closure West gave me the
regular expression generator and that's
been really useful saved me a lot of
time
alright the other feature we have in
Herbert scheme is using bindings and we
saw this before so bindings are useful
when you're doing the pattern matching
but they're also useful in the generator
that you know some some of the values
you want to generate might be based on
the previous values that you've seen in
a certain data structure so in this case
we're saying we want to bind the symbol
low to an integer that is you know
between 09 and we want want to bind hi
to something between 10 and 99 and will
package those up into a vector and then
for the rest of our data we just want to
generate one or more integers that are
in that range so I don't think I talked
about it before but for all the kind of
numeric types their parameter I you can
parameterize them by low and high
numbers to establish a range so then you
can see this this makes it kind of a
little bit easier than doing the bind
and the F maps that you might have to do
if you're writing things out by hand and
you can see the data that we generate
here okay so we talked a little bit
about properties before now I want to
talk about how i get a property from
schema this is the code i use to define
a property and as i said before that I
usually think of a property as a
predicate and a generator so I'm going
to take my schema create a generator and
run my predicate over all the values
that that generator returns and I expect
that always to succeed or return a true
value so you can see how I hook in to
test that check I just call the four
all-star version of the property
generator with my predicate and my
schema and some cases you might have a
predicate that takes more than one
argument and so then you would
give give it a schema for each of those
arguments will generate multiple
generators okay so anyway this to me
this kind of fits into the closure way
of doing higher-order functions if you
think about how map-works you you map
takes some kind of function argument and
then a bunch of other you know
collections so the generators here are
standing in for those collections then
Herbert check is my wrapper over a quick
check and it's the same idea typically
i'm going to have one predicate and one
schema and I want that schema turned
into a generator and then I'm going to
run that predicate for so many trials
and you know the hope is that that
predicate always succeeds but if it
fails then I will find you know test a
quick check will give me back this
smallest failure case so I have an
example here where I'm creating you know
vector events I said in star so that's
zero or more inch and my predicate was
that the count of that is always
positive but of course that's a mistake
right because the empty vector has a 0
count so probably I meant to have a
different schema there i meant in plus
but that's the kind of thing your your
schema is probably didn't be more
complicated in your vector your
predicates that would be a little more
complicated but we'll go in and generate
the data and find your failure cases all
right so this this function is one that
has given me hours of enjoyment the idea
here is when I was working my way to
create all these generators I'm
generating data from from schemas I had
the scheme and I already had the pattern
matching or the way of confirming that
some given data matches my schema so
really what I want to do is say that
that my the predicate i generate from my
schema always succeeds over all the data
i generate from my gender
alright and so that's kind of there in
the middle I call the check on my
conforming predicates and my schema I'm
going to generate lots of data and you
know these days now all all those
generated data all satisfy the prep the
predicate just like they're supposed to
but when i first got going you i was
finding lots of lots of bugs okay so
there you can see this is calling is
there towards the bottom third line from
the bottom is is the closure test test
the main macro for getting a test and if
it fails if the result is not true then
it will report the air and I want to
report the smallest failure case alright
so that's kept me pretty busy I want to
say I'm going to summarize what we
talked about and the first thing is that
schemas from the herbert schemas are
eaten data descriptions written in Eden
ok so I'm going to describe your Eden
data i'm using Eden to do it so all your
other tools that might manipulate
closure data structures can also create
these schemas the test dot check
properties I think of as a predicate
plus a generator ok so that's that's
fits into my scheme nicely because
Herbert conform with the schema will
give me a predicate and generator with a
schema will give me a generator so now
Herbert can help you on both sides of
your properties maybe your maybe the
data for your input is complicated and
you want to write a complicated
expression using the generator the test
let's check generators and Combinator's
that's great but maybe your output your
result has to fit a certain schema so
you could make the predicate on that
side or maybe
as part of your generator it's easy
enough to take bits and pieces of that
generator and use a Herbert schema to
express that it might be simpler but
then you have to call some other
generators the Herbert generators are
just you know regular tests not check
generators so they can play with all the
other Combinator's that you have an test
stop check and so I hope you can take
advantage of Herbert schemas and use
them in your testing now of course this
is software the still under development
and there are a few issues so I have a
couple minutes here I'm going to just
give you some warnings there's not that
probably you're not going to run into
these cases but if you do just so you
know I'm still working on it and I'll
take bug reports and I will fix things
the first thing in my generator there
are some limitations with negation so a
simple case like not 42 or not any of
the simple types I can generate a
generator for that without a problem but
if the generator is a complex generator
that maybe I don't know enough about in
the second case here I say not and in
and positive and that that right now
that's in the throw to throw what I call
a lazy programmer error because I
haven't quite handled that case yet but
you can see the third case works fine
and that's that's obviously the
equivalent if you think about it in
logical terms so what I need to do is
get some rewrite rules in there so I can
handle more cases but the truth is most
of my schemas I hardly ever use
conjunction right conjunction is saying
I want my one item to match essentially
multiple predicate or when I'm
generating a conjunction says I want to
generate a whole bunch of values from
one generator and then a whole bunch of
values from another generator and return
just the intersection of those values so
you can see down below if it's a simple
thing like a conjunction of in and not
42 that's no problem I can compile that
into a such that expression and
just generate a bunch of in sand check
that it's 42 that works fine but the
second example is harder you know
generating strings that start with food
and generating other strings that start
with bar or that end with bar and really
what I want to succeed I wanted things
that that are both both those properties
hold right now that doesn't compile into
a very good test check generator what
will happen is such that will try so
many times and then give up right if you
think about what such that is filtering
out some bad values you don't want to
come back from your generator so it's
unlikely that we're did it ever succeed
with that one and you know a smarter
programmer might have realized that you
could combine those regular expressions
and get just one regular expression that
would do the job and then everything
would work the final case i'm saying i
want a generator that returns either
satisfying the first generator which is
and even and odd okay or 42 now and even
and odd i know that's not going to work
just semantically i have an idea in my
head even nod numbers you never overlap
all right but when i'm automatically
generating the generator i'm going to
generate something that says okay
generate me a bunch of odd numbers and
then check that they're even and so such
that will eventually say hey I give up
it's not it's not working I'm not
finding anything and that that throws an
error when it gives up okay what I think
I want and i'll talk to read raper a
little bit later about this well i think
i want is I want that generator to give
up but not throw an error I wanted just
to be kind of a void generator and give
me a chance if I have something like you
know a one of wrapped around that I can
just ignore that bad generator and say
you know this expression should generate
42 and then I'd be happy ok so those are
the kinds of things that I'm still
working on for the most part I don't
think you'll even run into those I'm
just
you know warning you that they're on the
generator side there's a few limitations
all of these examples I listed here work
fine for pattern matching okay so I i
started with pattern matching and then I
said let's generate for all those
patterns you know you might have been
better if I had thought about generating
from the beginning only only allowing
patterns that I knew how to generate but
you know that ship has sailed a little
bit although we might we might change
and just say don't do this some some
patterns are too hard to generate okay
and then on my to-do list I had not
looked too much at performance I did get
one performance bug and we fix that that
was a case where someone had lots of
optional keys and I was originally
generating a generator that was a big
list of generators all the subsets of
those you know with or without those
keyed generators and that turned out
just to be too slow so I came up with
another implementation that that
performs better on those big maps with
lots of optional keys I have an issue
right now with nested binding generators
so that's if one if I do a binding and
then use that binding as part of another
generator that's doing its own binding
ok so the if the bindings nested my
generators doesn't work right now you
can have as many bindings that are
independent as you want those all work
but I have to do a little work to get
the nesting right and again I don't have
too many you know the reason this is
still a bug is because I don't have too
many nested generators and my schemas
that I've been testing against but you
could you could bump into that the big
thing I want to do soon is provide a way
to do extensible generators let you
bring your generators into the Herbert
you know schema generator family and I
need to provide a protocol and maybe
some utility functions so you can get
your custom generators that you write
could play with Herbert I want to do the
cognate cog detect transit types transit
is
kind of an expansion of Eden with lots
of other types and I'll probably do that
as a separate project to avoid
dependencies and then the pie in the sky
idea it would be nice if we had a way to
debug generators and visualize the
output like what part of my output comes
from what part of my generator or in the
case when I'm doing Herbert schemas you
know some sub part of my schema
generated this or maybe failed to match
and or you know the generator blew up or
something and it would help when
debugging to identify the sub part of
that schema or generator that was an
issue right now if something goes wrong
you'll get a deep air in the test dot
check generator world and and it doesn't
really give you a clue as to how to fix
it so you go back and got to spend a lot
of time kind of staring at your
generator Combinator expression or your
Herbert schema and I think we can do
better on that but that might take
awhile okay before we finish I want to
say thanks richa he gave us Eden format
and he's had a few other good ideas so I
really encouraged him to keep going he's
doing a great job Eric Norman gave me a
square peg he's open source parser and
that's been really helpful from the
beginning of Herbert read Draper to test
out check and helped me at the hackathon
and I think he's been really responsive
so I appreciate that Gary Frederick's
gave me a regular expression generator
and he has a project test Chuck that's
worth looking at where he's
experimenting with other other
generators they might be useful to you
Zack telemon's collection check was a
really useful reading and that caught an
important bug that you may have heard
about but you can check that out and the
trek core com gave me some star trek
photos so if you're interested in
Herbert it's open source you can reach
it on github their minor Herbert and my
original slide was
from the star trek to the wrath of khan
that was the genesis twice alright thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
