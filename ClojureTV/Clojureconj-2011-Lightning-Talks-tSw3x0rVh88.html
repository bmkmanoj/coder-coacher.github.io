time for the most exciting parts and a
lightning Thomas this is where we get to
actually get a chance to see what people
have been doing that may have done
something actually maybe over the last
24 hour 48 hours and go to really cool
things that have been happening recently
we have I think for lightning talks Rose
afternoon the first one up is Alex the
works of musical work with me relevance
has the most excellent mohawk on the
planet but I think might kind of thing
dead animals dead animals fed amaha so
all right a Love Machine I like ideas I
like ideas because they're there's
something that we kind of borrowed share
a relationship with humans can use ideas
what ideas can also use humans one way
they did not have to be using a human is
that 90 have to take up residence in
your mind you can burrow in and hang out
there for years and years and another
way that an idea in the music Uman is
that we communicate them to each other
and in that matter the ideas are using
us as replicators for themselves I'd
like to talk to you about one of my
ideas which is on cyclic time a long
time ago I had a problem where I had to
write in a scheduling mechanism I think
that there's probably a lot of people in
the room had to do this but sick like
time is a problem it solves a lot of
problems or it's an idea that solves a
lot of problems right it allows you to
do scheduling this allows you to do
calendaring application but it allows
you to do billing there's applications
for this idea of a cyclic time and it's
an idea what if you can pull it out and
create it abstractly you can start
building things for solving all these
problems on top of that
so like to do a little bit of an
audience participation session real
quick just by show of hands who here has
ever had to deal with a scheduling
problem all right great now who here
looked at cron said man I really don't
want to use that because it looks ugly
all right of those who said you know I'm
going to do something different than
Krong I'm gonna do something better than
prom who succeeded ok good I'm right
there with you about seven years ago I
had via you know I wanted to beat this
problem and I surrendered oh about a
couple months ago gentlemen Dane talent
differed who I work with was talking
about this idea of cyclic time with me
and I was reading my ideas about cyclic
time when I first tried to solve as a
problem I didn't have a good solution
and I think a lot of the reason I didn't
come to the right solutions i didn't
have the right tools when we started
thinking about it again I've been
educated in closure I was able to start
using the tools the closure provides to
buy them to this problem and I came up
with something that it's an interesting
idea I haven't been putting it into
production i haven't used
anger but it's a scratch that's looking
for an inch when I'm thinking about
cyclic time I like to talk about it in
these kinds of terms time is a single
dimension it's uncountably infinite
there are apparently many infinitely
many instance in time and that's not
useful we can work with an uncountably
infinite set of time and the final
quality of time that I like to think
about when I'm working with this problem
is that we tend to break the time in two
ranges ranges between one instant and
another instant in time this is useful
this is a used way too abstract / units
of time such as you know seconds minutes
hours years millennia they're all just
points between one and seven another
incident I'm so when I was wanting to
work with its time and when I was
discussing in the idea of Alan there's
really only two things and I want to be
concerned with when I'm trying to
conceive of cyclic time periods to range
between two instance and if we agree
about a convention for expressing a
period of time in my library I'm
convention of a vector that has a start
point at an end point that's it and the
idea of cycles which are repetitive
periods you think of cycles as being a
generator that would create multiple
periods that are self similar and the
real problem was time I think is in
these cycles because most cycles are
pretty simple right seconds are uniform
no second is different from another
second in terms of the actual span of
time it's it's tracing out this holds
true all the way up through weeks but we
start getting the months let's get
really kind of fuzzy there an Aston
special case if we're talking about
months the way the humans talk about
ones because you know februari has 28
days each month has a very slightly
different duration and that makes it a
little bit complex
but there's a nice little cheap new it's
called using Java util calendar which
handles all the aligning forth and that
basically what I did is it built up this
idea of cycles and periods on top of job
you till calendar and I know it's not
easy there's not a lot to it right now I
think the main points are one function
we call it I call periods and you handed
a keyword saying what do you want the
sixth cycle period debate and it will
return you and if you lazy sequence of
periods just these vectors of two
incidents such that they don't tell
nicely and it starts with the instant
you call function by default bigger ah
but it generates this infinite sequence
and now you have a signal generator and
the other I think important tool here is
found in cycling in this example I would
like you to indulge me and pretend that
November was bound to a vector that
included the first instead of the month
of November in the last instant of the
months in November and what a fountain
cycle does is it breaks down that blocks
of November into another of another
series of periods at the resolution of
days we've now got a sequence of all the
days in november represented using
periods and we can start doing
computation based on what days are
important the example I use in the
readme for this library is to try and
generate all of the try closure meetings
that relevance holds at relevance
headquarters they occur on the third
wednesday of every single months at six
pm and the way that i basically go
through this process is decomposed a
month in the days i have some predicate
functions so that examine whether our
today is Wednesday so we filter all the
days down to only the one facing but the
third one out of their finds all the
hours in that bag pluck out 6pm and now
we've got the period for when try
closure meeting is going to occur I
think this is a useful way to think
about recurring cyclic time but it's
also an immature idea i haven't spent a
whole lot of time working on but these
are these are the kind of tools i had
used to build up to this point one of
them is retrieving our concepts of what
are natural boundaries you can use their
there many many milliseconds out there
that are not cleanly on the boundary of
you know the incident when we change
from tuesday to wednesday for example
it's useful to be able to find these cut
points and to specified periods relative
to any arbitrary millisecond within that
period we have predicate for testing
human names for things like you know the
wednesday and some week or is this month
july and sorry and we can in the library
consume either dates or lungs
interchangeably be conventionally being
that we basically shoved Long's in two
days or hold the mill seconds all things
and that's basically my you know i just
want to introduce this concept you're
thinking about it i'd like to invite you
to play with when I mean I had it on
github and add it's also pushed out to
go jars so if you're interested you
could add it to projects and start
playing with it if you'd like to work
the work submitted full requests or
report issues on the library be very
appreciative of it but finally the last
thing I'd like to invite you to do is to
go digging through your old ideas in the
past particularly you know if you've had
a problem in the past that's defeated
you you surrender to and use what you've
learned working with closure to try
playing with it again think about what
kind of new solutions you can find by
using the school box the closure
in my particular case the idea of lazy
sequences was incredibly useful for
tackling this problem and I think that
if you revisit some of your old problems
you might also find some really good
solutions in the closure toolbox that
help you solve those problems thank you
so next up we have a really interesting
treat there is a new thing that has
entered the world's the name of immunity
and I anyways there has been some really
interesting work in recently done and
just tying together application servers
and new ways of deploying your closure
code and actually allow you to interrupt
with with other not closure code and I
think there's a whole bunch of really
cool stuff like they happen here and
kind of Mary enclosure and legacy code
and things like that so I'm gonna gym
take it further I'm talk to use out of
you all right and you all right so I
mean an application server close your up
sir I'm sure that right that some of you
possibly so let's try to allay some of
those peers because we are new to the
community let me introduce myself I'm do
crossly Toby Crawley we work red hat we
are corps commanders on torque box which
is you have 94 bucks torque boxes in
Africa
poor Ruby both torque box and mutant are
enabled by the jboss ASM java
application server now so application
server basically means middle with been
aware is this is the accidental
complexity it's all the software you
build or configure or use that doesn't
have anything to do with the problem
domain that the application you're
trying to build is trying to solve so an
application server done well is
basically a clean-shaven yet and that's
what we're trying to do it is very easy
to do an application server for late and
we have failed if we do that so even
though I just said that clean-shaven yak
what does that mean what is an
outpatient server it is perfectly
correct to think of jboss at just as you
would get your tomcat so just as you
would use line again to bring up getting
to run your ring based application you
do the exact same thing with jboss an
addition to that and get other services
we it's an integrated all of the ten
solution we provide an addition to the
web messaging caching messaging through
morning to JMS vendors view Cashman
cooing Venice van which is a key value
store data grid all kind of easily
replicated service clustering would get
into all the standard things that you
would expect to see in the e word so to
get all the advantages of those
mrs. traditionally you've had to a
simple big pile of annotated John
classes in XML so quarter box was
written in response to that to say none
of that we do all Ruby where you know
we've talked about wrapping as an
overloaded term we are we are wrapping
with mattes we are opinionated wrapping
we're not just exposing those Java
services via JRuby we are adopting that
policy are embracing that notion of
configuration convention over
configuration and JRuby basically
enables us to be the fastest platform
for any kind of moving web app
development that's out there in Google
for torque box benchmarks to see that
their stuff so they seem just replace a
job in x11 ruby in yamhill over various
that are done for you come on so none of
that you're interested in when we talk
about John Ruby's Oh Bartlett's into the
closure torque box inspired the idea of
a mutant so essentially it's a DSL to
describe the middleware that your
application would be
yourself in its new spa solution
definition so far we've only been doing
this for a couple of months and so far
we have web and core messaging stuff
implemented because we're an app server
typically deployed locations to it so
you want some isolation we have that
work in we're trying to make it all
installable runnable deployables using
aligning and both plug-in so here's a
quick example you're just writing your
project as you normally would in monagan
but when you deploy it to youth is
looking for a top level and you can see
LJ file here's an example of how we
might there's a messaging and web
namespace here's how we're starting just
starting up to you and we are mapping a
handler to receive messages that are
posted at you and I'm going to pause for
a moment I'll interview stay in your
mind the name of that function in
England so this is Ruby to vote you know
we do Pete Jones all right so ringing
out here's there we support any kind of
remakes web framework that there is this
is a symbol help and we're we're just
going to publish to our work view any
composite data structure we'd like it
just has to be understand
for by whoever's going to receive it on
the other end if it's another close
draft right which is printing that's up
there and you associate that handle with
a particular web context just your
typical way you would do that with Jenny
so that's what we have working now but
we also have a vision for the future
because we're kind of a big loss is
embracing this notion of polyglot in
other words you use the best ring work
available on the JV and regardless of
what application it's written it so a
lot of people have expertise in using
Ruby on on website we will let them do
that there are great analytics packages
enclosure we like to allow them to
easily exchanged messages between both
of those producers and consumers
currently we do that using a JSON and
cuddly but we'd love to do the Ruby side
of those tack base here all nations have
the bridge talked about yesterday the
birth of that so in a language messaging
you know uniform flow you always want
the same way integrated stack and I
building up
time and we get a very simple horizontal
scale and just Facebook jboss was built
in clustering capabilities to where you
automatically just by using a different
command line option you get an automatic
load balancing across a cluster of the
mutants of the consumers of those
messages that you might be putting on
whatever JMS destination 0 so we are new
we love the hell for all open source
either way help us build it or kind of
homeless in a direction that makes sense
for your organization pre notes best
place to to contact us contact once the
mutant or that's basically all
our job so the next set of presenters
any guys who draw a mother the trick
hipster these guys are lists of stirs
you said sometimes fast and I'm going to
make your brain explode so these guys
thoughts that closure was cool what they
want to do something cooler and so Alan
and Johnny go talk to you about girl is
so put your hands is familiar with
something called the Arduino oh ok so
for the two people that haven't seen
it's a microcontroller microcontroller
like many lives with capabilities
similar to many other microcontrollers
like protect or other things and
microcontroller means really small
computer effectively the differentiator
this thing is that they're cheap of the
cheapest one you can get is about ten
dollars for a kit the other thing about
them is they have easily accessible I oh
so if you were trying to do any kind of
i/o between your computer and say your
toaster there's not like a USB nous
devons going to do that for you that's
like you figuring out the USB thingy and
let go nuts your Dino has rows of pins
plug wires in you can programmatically
turn those things off with registers so
it's a great little platform for doing
prototyping devices that you know do
physical or electrical interactions with
bangs there's a huge hobby community or
these things people are you know making
their own garage door openers and you
know alarm clocks and all kinds of other
really mission-critical useful things so
I got to do this thing a couple years
ago and you know I bought all the gear
and then it was on a shelf or more years
and hold about recently because I wanted
to make some Cylon lights for my
pumpkins around Halloween so which is
something you can totally do and it's
pretty straightforward but here's the
pickle you can't do it in lips and I
think we all know is you know people who
are just obsessed with less than sort of
can look at other things be like yeah i
really miss lives it's kind of cool you
can do this thing but it's not list so I
had this idea to write a list run on the
Arduino so I could do the same kind of
interactive real-time development on a
microcontroller that I'm used to a
closure reptile I wasn't sure if it was
possible but I started anyway and you
know list from the bottom if you haven't
done it I implemented it I think this
Paul Graham talks about like the there's
like these two things that are high
ground sea on one end and Lisbon the
other it's actually really cool exercise
to kind of start at one end and then you
kind of wade through the morass then you
kind of get close to list side and like
you can start to see the sky again and
then and you have listened so if you
have an ignorant list I really recommend
it press the rationale for doing it
conspicuously on the closure or website
with the rationale rich says you know I
needed it for a functional programming
all these things and then I need a lid
with like no further justification so
this truth is self-evident just go nuts
doesn't matter who's the problem solved
after you have a drink your own is real
problem
so without further ado John's going to
do a little demo here quick tech specs
and highlights so this thing has 2k
Abraham that's almost 15 tweets worth of
information why should let's go first
cause functions all these things that we
don't love and thanks in John's help it
all kind of works I told him about this
idea and the morning after right so I
got my 10 emails between the hours of
midnight and 5am ok he's done a lot with
figuring out how exactly these ideas and
after Laurel things like reading specs
and data sheets he's kind of the wizard
between how it actually initial my
initial pass was was garbage was
collected oh no makeup John and comes in
around and people will interact with
this thing at the rubber micro works so
as things are in and say destroy the
source code right now but it's going in
we wrote some make tasks that building
flash the Arduino
I'm running us on a duodenal at home
because unlike the USB to serial think
about our other one you know well you
know actually is real pain to doing so
watch
it got really big yesterday when I
included in the Layla
tomorrow so everyone I or tonight I got
some zero output we basically got a
rebel now you can see the top and
defined all those symbols too grim cells
those are special and numerous don't
have to type anything we're going to
show you some exciting things
so
no GC either yet so we can't type in
very much
getting her ready
sale s XB we get our and yeah alright so
real slow
a separate or fourth b5 sleep 100
register
now like look it's not sleeping on a
millisecond silouette so slow but it
should be pointing let's be slow
it do you have a trampoline okay so
that's going to overflow eventually oh
absolutely way after we're done so it
wasn't yes oh okay set the whole thing
four bytes for symbols which means if
your symbols or four characters are
fewer they're just the characters
literally in a row except when we set
the hybrid on the fourth character to
one so that you know you're looking at a
four-character symbol for up to six
characters you can use any characters a
to z and any non azz character that
automatically become underscore condense
down to five bits and sort of crammed
into the four bytes and then
decompressed at the other end so you
home in capital letters lowercase
letters too big
oh so excited to small things at one is
that the IBM 704 which is the first
thing John McCarthy need Brussels fit
let's go on at about 32 k of rain so ha
the other thing is since this is a very
simple list implementation we were very
humble guys we called it goober list you
can go before it will pop up it's on the
github next big thing is GC so you
haven't jobs come on down you so thanks
everybody
Chris danger areas so our next lightning
talk presenter is I think a machine i'm
not sure if he actually sleeps or not he
has been just just sending out my race
for us all to to use noir pinot and now
something just recently for sequel and I
let's tell you a little more about all
right yeah so I'm Chris Granger like you
said and I recently started working on a
project that required a lot of sea water
and one of the things that I had done
previously when I written frameworks
actually impeach because I wrote an aura
and as I did that I realized hey you
know all rooms are kind of cool they
seem nice but it turns out that our m's
and the long run end up actually being
kind of problematic you end up fighting
against them you end up nearest do more
than their abstraction allows you to do
and so what I wanted to do was work with
a really nice abstraction for sequel on
closure and so this is kind of what
formally define a database can everyone
see that out of curiosity can you define
a database you know I give a set of
really simple helpers to create sort of
these maps that represent your database
inventions right and under the covers
here I wanted to make sure that you
don't have to think about some things
that you would otherwise have to think
about if you were using just straight
Java JDBC things like connection pool as
an example right you know one of the
things that I didn't realize when I
started using jdbc was that I was going
to have to manage that connection
explicitly so this uses the library
called c-3po that does all that
connection pooling for you so you just
start writing queries I am which you can
see here is I have a thing called def
entity this
something's max directly to a table more
or less but allows you to specify you
know some properties of these things you
can do interesting things them later so
for example I have a query here where I
want to select you know all my users
with their addresses since I've defined
a relationship between my entities I can
do that on the backend korma is simply
you know running out of joint it's not
doing anything particularly special here
for the most part it's just writing out
the joint so that you don't have to so
this isn't an ORM in the large hibernate
sense where it's doing all this crazy
magic on the backend for the most part
it's just helping you write queries more
efficiently right at the end is just
writing very simple sequel I think the
advantage or rather the power of karma
though it's not so much in just the
abstraction I think it's nice to be able
to write in you know succinctly and
cleanly clearly but i think the real
power of korma comes to the fact that
much like like Haskell log is entirely
composable right you can in this case
instead of using the Select macaron you
select star and then start building up a
query and then you add more to the query
and then you add more sleep all you're
doing here is actually manipulating a
map and what coeur MO really is if you
want to break it down into its
constituent pieces there's actually a
sequel generation engine right and then
a nice way of writing out the maps that
go to it that's all it is now when you
start thinking of libraries in that way
where you always have sort of this one
thing that can take basically any
arbitrary map that you create for it and
then generates equal out of it this
allows you to literally completely
replace my syntax that's syntax my API I
provide if you could you know you don't
like to select right some other thing
that creates you know a map that
represents a select query you wouldn't
actually have to rewrite all that simple
generations that so this enables you to
actually add decorah and interesting
ways so I provide a relatively simple
set of relationships but you could
imagine actually creating a property or
method rather or function for deaf
entity that creates all the
relationships for just a chain let's say
you're constantly using one entity and
you want you know some thing that's what
eight levels nested right you don't want
to constantly write those joins out as a
matter of fact you may do that all the
time so you don't want to write you know
like I've done here where your writings
essentially functions to add that each
time you could actually add it to format
itself you could go up here right and in
your def entity say you know chained
address to state to whatever else you
may have to zip code to blah blah blah
and then cormac and then you know you
could then use that in width symbol and
enable yourself to essentially write out
all those joints for you so it's a
really extensible way of dealing with
Seto in general another thing that I
wanted to make sure was that it was
flexible in a way that wasn't annoying
right so hi everything has gotten a lot
lot better over the years but i remember
the first few versions it was like pages
and pages and pages of xml files where
you had to configure everything while
you do need to do that at some times
right you shouldn't always there's value
and the things that ruby-on-rails
presented which is you know this notion
of convention over
customization but you need to be able to
sort of get out of it you need to so for
example I used to work on a massive
project that had a wine database for
literally millions upon millions of
lines and everything you could ever want
to know about them but that database was
built up over many years by many
different companies and so we had a lion
table and underscore wines an underscore
underscore wanted to write we had all
these weird sort of names and none of
the keys would match and so another
thing that I wanted to make sure when I
reforma there was built for real-world
stuff right I don't make assumptions and
when I do make assumptions you can
override them and that's that's I think
an important part of being really useful
in this space so I mean there's there's
lots of interesting things here it's
actually really small so if you want to
see how you might write a sequel
generating engine that runs off a Maps
take a look at the take a look at the
source yeah I don't want to think of any
more time so if you have any questions
yeah new your your joins all in one
swipe where you like condemn hybrid you
do a cascade oh so like the first layer
and then do the second level of
interaction blazing or you know on
demand you yeah do that or now so by
default mine it has many relationship
right because that can be a
multiplicative set as you go down you
don't want to do that all really in one
query most of the time you want to do it
lazily like you said my husband he does
exactly that and you could write very
very similar things that do that there's
a notion of a post query essentially
over you say oh do this with the iden
you know the primary key to this other
thing makes it easy actually to add if
you don't like what I can even add more
complex ways of doing
well not a ton right now and I'm sure
there are bugs in it because i only use
a few databases i have not tested
against a lot of them so once people
start using it i'll start stuffing that
out now to be to be clear though it does
use jdbc on the back end right so some
of that is handled purely by jdbc
somebody who's done this row longer than
I have and I don't have to you know I
know they're correct just like
parameterize queries as an example right
all about to make sure it's safe I don't
want to touch that I should also mention
you can actually like get this simple
out of this and do stuff with it if you
want so you don't actually have to use
to execute you don't even like that you
could you're working in another project
you could actually use closure to
generate your queries for that other
project in a different language and then
the other questions all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
