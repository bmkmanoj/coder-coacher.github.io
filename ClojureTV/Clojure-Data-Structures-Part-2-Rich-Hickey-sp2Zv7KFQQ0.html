their collections as I mentioned before
all the collections are immutable that
means that nothing in them can change
and of course the first thing first pang
you usually get when you're faced with
that sentence and you think about
closure is well what if I need to change
part of it will I have to copy the whole
thing and the answer there is no in
addition to being immutable closure
collections are persistent and
persistence means that under the hood
they're implemented in a way such that
when you want to create a modified
version of a collection that can be done
and still meet all of the performance
guarantees of the collection in
particular it means that most of the
modifications are constant or near
constant time for hash maps and vectors
and logarithmic time for trees so it's
not a full copy it's not anything
remotely near that so typically when we
want a collection that's just like
another collection but slightly changed
we get a new value and it shares a lot
of structure with the old value and it
can do that because neither of the two
values can ever be changed so you can
share quite freely and that's what that
whole other paragraph says I mean it it
allows the efficient creation of
modified versions because everything is
immutable it's inherently thread-safe
you can freely without thinking twice
reference any of the closure data
structures from multiple threads and
nothing bad can happen to you it simply
cannot happen to you because they they
cannot change in addition that's
wickedly efficient to do that to work
that way because a lot of the data
structures internally are also not not
just promising immutability to the user
but actually actually are immutable in
the
implementation the java compiler and the
hotspot runtime can optimize them quite
extensively so they're they're pretty
fast
the second big part about the
collections as I started to talk about
before is that they're represented by
abstractions that means that you can't
get too attached to the relationship
between a particular collection as
described here and a particular
implementation of it for instance you
know I'll talk about maps a lot there
are a lot of different kinds of maps in
closure there are tree maps array maps
structure maps hashmaps all of which
provide the same interface and can be
manipulated the same way but have
different behavioral characteristics
mostly in performance or sort ability so
that's it that's a big deal it means
that when you write code to an
abstraction either to the list
abstraction the sequence abstraction the
map abstraction of the vector
abstraction that code will work with
anything that implements that
abstraction but if you write code that
works with a tree map it works with a
sorted map without any change and it
will work with future maps that I
haven't thought over that you may need
to write in order to do something
specific for a particular application
that's a big deal that's a big deal
because there's a lot of syntax built-in
to closure that makes it convenient to
talk about and interact with these data
structures that is decoupled from their
particular implementations
all right so collections form a
hierarchy there is a route to all the
closure collections it's called I
persistent collection and it defines
three functions which are reflected in
the three functions you see here every
collection can respond to account which
is account of how many items are in it
that number can be 0
in addition as you'll see here count of
nil is defined in fact many operations
are defined on nil as opposed to
throwing a nullpointerexception
it ends up it might take you a little
while to see the utility of that you'd
say oh I'd prefer to know I had nothing
but there are lots of cases where your
code can be significantly smaller if you
leverage that value and as long as you
know how that's going to behave you can
you can use it so you just have to
accept it I've decided that's a good
idea
and and I know and understand how it
works and then you can use it or be
careful of it whichever you know
whichever you you may consider but it's
not inherently wrong for count of nil to
not fail in some way it has a defined
behavior the next guy is conch Co NJ if
you haven't programmed in list you won't
necessarily recognize the pun associated
with that and the name closure in
general which is a substitution of j4s
but it ends up pecans is a classic Lisp
function and it meant to add something
to the front end of a list and what I've
done is created an abstraction of that
so that and I've called it something
different so people wouldn't get
confused cons and it does have a word
behind it which is conjoined and that's
very much what it means it means to add
a thing to something else the cool thing
about defining something like cons at
the top level of this hierarchy means
that you have an abstract way to add
something to any kind of collection it's
the same function conjoined now of
course it doesn't really add something
to a collection because we said you
can't change any collections what it
does is it returns a new version of the
collection with what the thing added
where it goes depends on the kind of
collection lists Wilkin join at the
front vectors will conjoin at the end
maps will can join by adding that key
value to the map so why don't we look at
that a little bit so we've seen how to
do the three kinds of literals one of
the tricks with literal lists is they
must be quoted because we saw how if we
say ABC in a list the compiler is going
to try to interpret the first thing in
the list as an operation and to treat
the entire list as a call so we have to
find a right we've defined it before as
one I think it's still one but one still
isn't a function and so this is still
not a valid function call so if we want
to talk about a list without evaluating
it without the compiler treating it as a
function call we have to quote it in
general you'll be doing not very much of
this it used to be the case in Lisp you
had to do a lot of quoted lists because
lists lists were your only data
structure so when you wanted to have a
list of values that wasn't interpreted
or evaluated you had to quote it now I
would prefer vectors in most cases but I
just want to show you what conjoin does
in these three cases so this is a list
of what's going to guild when we press
ENTER maybe see a one two three
ABC okay nothing is a value we're
quoting the list the list when it was
read was a list of three symbols so when
we quote it we get a list of three
symbols none of the contents of the list
are evaluated it's not just a quoted
list it's not just a none evaluated list
you know it's not just saying suppressed
the evaluation of the list it's saying
suppressed evaluation of the entire form
so we have a list of ABC so if we
conjure onto that punched always takes
the collection first and we're gonna put
a let's call it X we're gonna put a
keyword on saying a couple of things
first of all all of the data structures
are heterogeneous that means that they
can hold a variety of types they're not
locked down to a particular types of
this list so far only has symbols in it
but I could add numbers to it or other
objects or really anything I want so
we're gonna conjoin the keyword X to
this list and the quest it's a list that
goes at the front I probably should have
put that list in something let's put it
in LST so now LST is that list of ABC
and I can easily say conjoin to list X
again should be the same result but the
big point here is that nothing has
happened to LST in this process okay
when you say conjoin you get a new list
the other list is sitting around intact
it ends up lists are implemented as
singly linked lists right and conjoin
conjoins on the front so it creates a
new node and has the rest pointer of
that node point to the existing list
which means that the the tail of this
list is exactly the same list as LST how
can we find that out with what you've
seen already
what do we want to know what whoops what
we wanted that was identical we want to
make our call right but we don't want
this whole list what part of it do we
want the rest of the lessons we haven't
talked about sequences we want the rest
of the list which would be not the first
thing but the things after it so is the
rest of this list the same as what now
this isn't just the same as is it the
same value this is the same as is it the
same object and ends up it is so the
tail of this thing is list and it can be
because since neither could be changed
they can share structure so it's not
like the whole list is copied in fact
none of the list is copied one new node
linked singly linked list node which is
a two slot data structure is created
with X in it and the rest of it points
to the other so that's how persistence
is done for lists it's pretty easy to
understand and that's very traditional
Lisp and it's a very valuable thing
sharing structure like that and having
it be persistent but now let's move to
something a little bit more interesting
let's get a vector in play so we have
our vector back ok this is a vector of
three numbers similarly we can conjoin
onto back and we'll add four as I said
before that goes at the end
unlike lists where there's a simple way
for me to describe how it works which is
that's a singly linked list and the node
points to the rest of the thing
persistent vectors are extremely tricky
and it's it took me a long time to come
up with efficient implementations of
persistent vectors and hash tables
they're extremely rare things like you
won't see them anywhere else but they're
and a very important part of closure
working the way it does because once you
have them you can write programs that do
what real programs do it which is need
to look things up in near constant time
most programs I've written have needed
hash tables I don't see how you can
really do without that but having it be
persistent is particularly powerful
which means you can incrementally modify
hash tables unmake undo and redo stacks
of hash tables and vectors so this
vector is intact as we see we didn't
change the original but there won't be
any identical trick with this there is
shared structure underneath the hood but
the structure of a persistent vector is
is a is a complex thing we could talk
for an hour about just by itself it is a
it actually does use a tree under the
hood with the 32 Way branching strategy
based around hash tries trees they're
called so you have to take my word for
it that it's efficient and it is
efficient it's not quite constant time
it's actually log 32 to the end but log
32 is an extremely narrowing factor in
other words log 32 of whatever a million
is not very much and a four billion is
only six not even five and a half
no.66 so as a branching factor it's so
small you can almost read it like a
constant factor so vectors and hash
tables have near what I call near
constant lookup characteristics you can
treat them like you treat vectors and
hash tables in languages you're familiar
with except they have this miraculous
property which is that they're immutable
and persistent in particular like
changing one thing at the end also has
that near constant time property
alright that's back to any question on
vectors one of the neat things about a
vector is unlike a list getting at the
last thing in a list is expensive it's a
linear time thing to go all the way
through and certainly vectors you have a
presumption that getting at any piece of
it is efficient and that is the case
getting at any part the first second
third not just the end you know it's not
just at the end you're adding to both
ends are are fast finally we have map
let's we'll put in something
typically with maps we don't use punch
very much we use associate a SS SC much
more often because we usually are
talking about the keys and values
independently but it ends up the cons is
defined on maps and it's defined as
adding a map to a map
so we can cons onto em another map just
like that again this is not something
you do that often but it's there mostly
to keep things uniform in addition you
can con John map entries onto maps and
that will work so when you sequence
through a map you get a sequence of map
entries which are like key value pairs
and those can be conjured onto a map as
well well now you're seeing the hash
nature of the literal Maps
okay so literal maps are hash maps which
means they don't have predictable
printing or iteration or sequencing
order because they're hashed internally
sure is oh no I didn't look at that this
commas in my map I didn't write them
when I put it in did I and yet here they
are commas are whitespace they don't
mean anything you can put them in the
middle of your data structures if you
like if they help you read them go for
it typically I find myself not writing
them very much but appreciating the fact
that they print like this yeah
especially you know key value key value
is pretty straightforward but if you had
a map that was a number number number
number it can it can be tricky to see
how it gets delimited without them but
by all means feel free to use it and yes
commas are whitespace
so we started to talk about sorted map
let's let's make one you have to use a
function call to get a sorted map but it
takes as arguments
the same key-value key value as the
literal does now the trick here is that
it's going to be sorted by key and so
that will print out in order now and
print it out in order to so let's go
back to the conch call and we'll do SM
as the target the same two other guys
which we saw us scramble around in the
hashmap
that won't happen here the sorted map
will maintain sort order sorted maps can
be created by default they presume the
keys are implement comparable which is a
Java interface for things that can be
compared to each other
but you can supply a sorted map with a
comparator in which case that will be
used to compare the items and that way
you can get things sorted by internal
keys or in reverse order yes so what if
it what if the value was already there
is the question what if M already had a
B which it does and I'm gonna say B is 5
and yeah it will replace the value
that's already there all right so kanji
onto a map means associating those keys
with those values and associate is a
replacing thing of course nothing has
really happened to SM B is still 2 there
but in this continent and this new value
we created by conjugates 2 things
together the value that's been added is
the one that wins ok
all right we talked a little bit ahead
well that's so that's conjugal lists
goes at the front vectors goes at the
end maps associates the key in values of
the conch thing into the original guy
the other big function supported by all
collections is seek short for sequence
what this does is based around the
collection type it returns something
that implements the sequence interface
okay that's different from the
collection itself being a sequence some
collections are sequences like lists are
sequences other collections like vectors
are not sequences they're sequential but
they're not the same thing as a sequence
and maps pretty much don't even look at
all like sequences but no matter what
kind of collection you have you can call
seek on it and get something that is a
sequence that lets you see the contents
of the collection in a sequential manner
so let's just look at that we have our
three guys now if we seek what I call
the first time LST
we get that one of the interesting
things about secon lists is that lists
are their own sequence
that's not true of the other collection
types you can get a sequence of the
items in the vector and you'll notice
how these sequences are printing they
print like what lists right back is that
and see prints that way so when you see
parentheses delimited lists it doesn't
mean anything more than it's a sequence
when it prints because sequences and oh
I want to and what's the sequence of the
map and you see the little pairs in
there it's a sequence of those things or
map entries but that syntax you see
there is not readable in other words I
can't I can't type in a1 I don't have
anything useful happen okay that's just
a printing thing and that's a an
asymmetry in printing and reading but it
doesn't matter because usually you print
maps like that which is a readable thing
all right we saw a little bit about
lists their collections as I showed or
approved before they implement I seek
directly ones when we ask for the seek
of a list we got itself because it
doesn't need to do any work it directly
implements the sequencing interface
count is state a one that's an
interesting property so a real list
which you either can create using quote
or by saying list and passing the items
is a data structure that maintains the
count efficiently that's not typical of
singly linked lists where usually you
know you have to you have to go through
and count them all so usually it's it's
Big O and cons puts it at the front as
we saw
so lists creates one list star creates a
list given individual items and another
list and puts those items at the front
you want to see that now it said seek
there didn't it so I'm gonna put in a
vector at the end because the vector can
be turned into a seek and so it connects
the first guys to the last guy the last
guy must be a sequence or something that
can turn into a sequence what's the
difference between that and apply list
apply let's say apply list and it's it's
a common operation but we haven't talked
about apply without in advance it's kind
of a thing peak for lists peak is the
same as first but peak and pop a part of
a stack protocol that's supported by
both lists and vectors which is kind of
really neat let's try it
we peek it one two three we get the
first guy we pop we get the rest of
course there's first and rest for this
but if you were using a list as a stack
this would be more intuitive to read
than using first and rest that way but
the cool thing is these work on vectors
what do you think this returns come on
one three three three why because that's
the that's the the open end on a vector
right that's what we can push stuff onto
when we conscious stuff on it goes on
the end but also cool is that so you can
treat lists the stacks on the front end
and vectors as stacks on the back end
what's the difference the iteration
order of both is the same right we saw
seek oh do we do seek get vectors yeah
we did right it doesn't go three two one
right it goes one two three so these are
different characteristics you can take
advantage of fact that you can treat
both as stacks the vectors have the same
relative to its stack which is on one
end it enumerates from the other end
whereas lists will push and pop from the
same end in a numerator on and the nice
thing is you can switch between these
two in an algorithm that use the stacks
and not have to change anything if
you've used peek and pop
first of what we haven't talked about
first yet but what do you think I hope I
hope it's one I think the first thing in
1 2 3 right because first manipulates
the sequence of items in the vector and
the sequence as we saw is 1 2 3 ok first
is about sequences and we could talk
about that so let's just skip quickly
what is the sequence a sequence is
something that supports only two
functions the first is first which
returns the first thing in the sequence
the second function is rest which
returns the rest of the things in the
sequence really only other things to
know are the fact that if there's no
more things rest returns nil in
particular it does not return that it
doesn't empty out the collection it's a
sequence on it and when there's no more
things there's no more sequence so when
there's nothing more rest returns nil in
addition first and rest are defined for
nil what do you think they'll return the
only reasonable thing and again take my
word for it this is better than them
throwing exceptions
ok so let's dig into vectors a little
bit there collections I say that only to
imply they support count seek and what
conch right well the three main
functions count is Big O one one of the
neat things about vectors is they
support our seek what do you think that
does
oops our seek one two three okay
it doesn't reverse the items in the back
there the vector is what it was but it
also can provide this sequence in a
hurry this reverse order sequence
whereas reversing a list takes all the
time it takes to touch every item you
boys getting a reverse version of a
sequence of a vector it's constant time
that's something that you could leverage
in your programs and you're aware of it
we've saw a literal constructor for
vectors with the square brackets in
addition there is a function called
vector and there's a functional way to
create all of these things because
you're not going to create them well
from literals a lot of times you're
going to have data or construct data and
then need to make a vector from it and
it just takes a list of the items and it
makes a vector out of them
here now we start seeing a portion of
the interface of associative things it
ends up that a vector is associative
much the same way a map is write what
are the keys of the vector the indexes
write the indices in a vector are the
keys and so because of that closure
unifies that so that you can manipulate
vectors and maps similarly by treating a
vector as a map of numbers to values so
you can call a sock on a vector one of
the things that's important is that the
index be in bounds right a sock takes an
associative thing and it associates a
key with a value okay so we can use it
on a vector because the vector is an
associative thing like associated item
number one which is the second item
because we count from zero
with five it's a cool property of
vectors that and of course the key has
to be in range I said that we said we
can go 13 here and boom index out of
bounds right we can't create gaps in our
vector but we can do one interesting
thing and useful thing with vectors
which is where is three index three zero
based in this vector nowhere is it it's
it's after it's outside but it's outside
by how much it's just one after this is
okay okay so you can associate to the
just at the end of a vector in order to
grow it why would you do this well again
depending on the algorithm you using you
may want to you know not care whether
it's a map or a vector and if people
know that you're doing that they know
that could grow it by passing in
incrementing numbers so it's a powerful
and useful thing to be able to do so you
can associate with the an index that's
that is equal to the length of the
vector and it will add to the vector by
doing that okay
get get is the associative call it
returns the value at the vector at that
index but like the associative interface
the associative interface says if you
call gat and the key is not found
you get nil and sure enough these that
key is out of range I get know that keys
in range I get the value and is similar
it takes a vector and an index but
Anthes just four vectors and constant
time integer indexed things it happens
to also work for Java arrays for
instance and strings it even works on
sequences but the main thing main point
about it
here is there's get there's ents Anthes
the guy to use if you want to do index
checking if you'd rather get an
exception then then Nils and again
depending on the kind of algorithm using
sometimes you don't you just want to
know is it arranged yes or no which case
is returning nil is fine other times you
really want to make sure you don't
accidentally go outside and get get Nils
that you know by accident these are like
I said near constant time operations so
vectors are fast peak and pop we talked
about already right they work on the end
of the vector popping an empty vector
throws an exception that's important to
know and the other cool thing about
vectors is that they support really fast
sub vector operations
so given a vector and a start inclusive
and endpoint exclusive indexes you'll
get a sub vector its share structure
structure with the original vector this
vector could be enormous this thing is a
constant time instantaneous operation
sub vector returns a little structure
that implements the interface of vector
but leaves all the data in the original
vector so copies nothing a vector UPS of
a string well a string isn't a vector a
string nothing good it's not a vector
string is not a vector a quote well you
want a vector of the characters in the
string
if you wanted strings have substring and
you know some other efficient things
they already do this efficiently so I
don't know if there's a tremendous
advantage but that's how you do it we
haven't talked about a player while
vector will MIT will put a string the
whole string into the vector as one
element because the string is a value so
you first have to take the string apart
into its constituent characters then
you're gonna have a list of things and
apply it takes a function and takes that
list of things and makes it as if it's
the argument list to the function call
let's jump in ahead a little bit so it's
an important thing to remember that you
have extremely fast sub vector and you
can take advantage that you can almost
use vectors as if they were you know
like you can do windowing things
extremely quickly with no copying and
you wouldn't get I wouldn't hesitate at
all to do that like if you had ten
million things they needed a you know a
thousand item window you could sub back
and move up by one by one by one by one
by one that would be lightning to do and
the resulting subvectors is a vector it
implements the complete interface of
vector so it's a good example the fact
that it shares the structure but that
also implies there's at least two
implementations of vector under the hood
right because there's the real vector
and the sub vector thing is obviously
some different type that does the shared
structure and mapping through to this
other thing you don't need to know or
care a sub vector is as good as a vector
in every respect okay last we have Maps
don't open I have to wrap it up for now
Maps implement this interface I
persistent map and there are many
implementations of maps there are two
and I have to fix that because there are
more than two provided but the two main
kinds are hashed maps and sorted maps
hash maps are going to call hashcode and
equals on the keys hashcode and equals
are defined for all the closure types
correctly you can use other Java types
you know subject to the quality of their
hashcode and equals as I said before
sorted Maps you can either have keys
that implement comparable which most
Java data structures do and all the
closure primitive things do like strings
and key words and symbols support
comparable or you can pass in a
comparator to sorted map by this guy
here will take a comparator and then the
key values in which case the comparator
is used hash maps are way faster lookup
log 32 the end verses sorted maps which
are a red-black tree which is balanced
but has Big O log and access which is
still very fast and there are plenty of
functional languages that only get by
with regular red black tree associative
data structures but in you know in the
real world I think you simply have to
have hash tables and closure provides
them story maps are sorted otherwise
they pretty much are identical sorted
maps also support are seek reverse
sequencing which makes no sense for hash
marks because that's when I'm still
promised to order the keys anyway in
sequencing and so what is the mapping
logically a map is a function of a key
that returns a value right and a map is
a storage of those relationships between
keys and values
you can use nil as the key you can use
nil as a value just be careful in that
some of the functions for getting the
values and maps return nil if they're
not found so if you're gonna put Nils in
a map you have to be aware of that and
there are ways to interact with the map
so that you can find out whether there's
actually something there or you're
getting the nil that was there or there
was nothing there
you can distinguish that so there are
three constructor functions again we saw
that the curly brace literal you know
that the reader reads will return a hash
map or something that will eventually
turn into a hash map very small ones
actually have other implementations
there are lots of map implementations
under the hood what you really care
about is whether it's hashed or sorted
because those are the two performance
differences sorted map will create a
sorted map as we saw and sorted that by
takes the comparison comparator
associate and it does what we saw
already for vectors it's going to take
an existing map and it's going to return
a new map of the same basic type either
hashed or sorted where that key is
mapped to that value if it was already
there this mapping will be the new
mapping and then in the returned value
won't ever affect the existing that and
now it's not documented here but a so
she takes arbitrary number of key value
pairs so we can try it let's see do we
slow down we have enemies who can
associate with em and you can see why
this would be
no I edit it when I needed it like when
I had everything it's really convenient
and you can see why this is more
commonly used no more well a social with
key and value but not arbitrary numbers
of keys and values yeah but you can see
why this is preferred to conch because
you don't have to create a map out of
the other guys and this is the normal
way you interact you add things to maps
and of course we're not really changing
the map so every time I say add or said
or you know I don't really mean it I'm
saying it gives the effect of that but
you do have to get used to the fact that
you have to catch the return value of
this this doesn't actually change the
thing but I did choose cons a social and
dystocia for a reason rather than put
you know set because they don't actually
change the thing so I'm trying to help
encourage you to think about the fact
that it doesn't really add something so
the thing that you're passing it gives
you a new value where the thing has been
conjoined or associated so thus the
names you get used to it pretty quick I
think associate and dissociate dis Yoshi
it goes the other way it'll be the same
map without that key in it right so so
we know M has a and B still look it's
not changed at all and all this mucking
around and we can take out the B key we
can also try and take out something
that's not there no problem this is a
map without e okay right there's a map
without it didn't have E but it doesn't
have it now so that satisfies the
requirement in addition this now takes
multiple values so we can empty it out
that way
I mean it's still there but we can get a
value with the others taken out same get
as before we saw four associative you
know arrays or associative so they
support get Maps also support get same
rules get the key if it's not there
return nil
also not in the docks here is the fact
that get takes a third value which is
what to return if it's not there so
let's uh let's make a new map MN which
has a nil in it
so we look at a man we see a is 1 B is
nil switch means if we were to get be
from an MN well
is it there that's the same whoops sorry
about that that's the same result I
would have gotten if I said this and C
isn't in there so how do we tell what's
going on there's a couple of ways one is
there as a function called contains
which looks for the key no C in there B
yes that's one way so we can just look
for the key but of course if we were
trying to get the value we'd have to
call contains and then get into steps
so get takes the third argument which is
returning this thing if if it's not
there
so I'm saying get from them and see and
if it's not there return this value of
not found so now I have a safe way to
get things that might be null because I
can distinguish this see now I get a nil
out it wasn't not found it was found and
its value was nil so this is a way to
interact with maps where you might be
storing nil on purpose and you can't
then use nil as a way to see whether or
not something was there
you can pass any value you want it's the
third value and that's what will come
back it's also a nice way to do a seed
value if you're going to start up with
with an empty map and you want the first
value to be one you can instead of
having like put it in there in advance
you can say get where if not found value
is 1 which means the first value you get
will always be 1 even if there was no
entry then you could add something
through or to multiply it by something
and then put it back in no special case
is required so that can be useful and
then there's a bunch of other functions
find will return the map entry so you'll
get the key value pair out if it's there
otherwise you'll get nil that's another
way to go in looking for things so if I
just said to find in MN see I get nil
there's nothing there but if I try I
keep hitting that key but if I try to
find B I'll get the key value pair B and
no oh that's weird that's a pretty no
that's a bug that's not a readable thing
anyway but I'd like that to print no ok
so that's fine
select I'm not going to talk about right
now Keeney and Val if I have one of
these map entries I can get at the
pieces of it using key and Val usually
you will end up using those if you've
turned the map into a sequence then you
can use the sequence will be a sequence
of map entries and you can use key in
Val to get at the pieces of that map
entry that's returned
does that make sense so we we did seek
well let's just do again we did seek a
been before
right and had these pears in it so the
first of this is a pair right okey
it's a map entry and if you want to see
what's the key of that thing we can do
that
similarly Val will return the valve part
of a map entry like that okay
there's also keys and vows which returns
a sequence of the keys of a map or a
sequence of the Val's
in the map so we go back to this and if
we say give me I don't need to say
anymore if I say keys of em it's a and B
and if I say Val's of them it's 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
and those are sequences they are more
efficient than mapping key over seek of
em or Val over seek of em so you want to
use them when that's what that's what
you want merge will combine Maps an
arbitrary set of maps into one
last one in wins okay so it starts with
a1 b2 then emerges in b4 c3 then emerges
in a5 cons will only put one thing on
cons can also deal with map entries
merge takes an arbitrary set of maps and
they all have to be maps but they're a
little bit similar
I definitely say prefer merge cons cons
yeah
conscious for code that really doesn't
want to know it's manipulating maps it
wants to manipulate data structures
really generically if you're going to be
using it on maps it's probably because
your motor data structure you want to
work with maps and lists and vectors
without knowing you would use cons all
the time for vectors and lists but not
from apps so much what does it map did I
skip over no it's not here
that's in nuts and sequences and finally
there's merge with which takes a
function and they will be used to
arbitrate conflicts so as you go through
here now instead of having be for
replace B 2 4 will be added to 2
similarly rather than have a 5 replace a
1 5 will be added to 1 whoops Oh where's
with done I need to say that I know
she'd just figure out what I want so uh
so you can see that's that's pretty cool
and you can do arbitrary functions that
way like if you were trying to combine
these in you want you know a set a set
of each thing you could you could merge
with list and you'll get lists at each K
so that's pretty powerful I'm tiny
and I think we'll wrap it up here any
questions about these these are like the
really core things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
