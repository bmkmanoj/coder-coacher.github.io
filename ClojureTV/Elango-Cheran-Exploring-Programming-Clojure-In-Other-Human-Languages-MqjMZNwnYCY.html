and I'm here to talk to you today about
programming enclosure and languages
other than English so being at a closure
conference and talking about other
languages it's good to take a step back
and talk about languages in general so
language is more than just a good medium
in which we communicate it's also
something that shapes who and how we
interact with the world so if I
understand what you're saying I'll be
able to communicate and interact with
you and if I don't understand what
you're saying then I'm much less likely
to do so but language and so in some
ways it creates a soft border around the
world in which we can operate so if
you're in Canada then you it's good to
know which areas speak English and which
speak French because if you're an
English speaker you might be able to get
by in Montreal but Quebec City might be
a difference so a story but language
also embed certain cultural values and
it shapes some of the ideas that we have
so one example is the metaphor in
English between time and money so some
of the words that we use to describe
money are also the words that we use to
describe time so we can gain time and
lose time but we can also save time and
waste time and so when those words exist
they they shape the thoughts that we
form and when those words don't exist
then some of those ideas are less likely
to be formed after India got its
independence in 1956 they decided to
redraw the the boundaries of the states
and to end that you chose language is
something that was more significant and
meaningful to do so but language also
shapes our identity and our social bonds
so throughout history there have been
large scale movements in which language
played an important role so for example
during the Reformation some of Martin
Luther's theses were that the religious
texts and religious services should be
in the local vernacular or the local
language and that was also important
because it reflects the power dynamics
at the time but for any sort of large
scale movement to have to occur you the
message needs to get out to a large
portion of the people and so that's
often in a form in which it's it's less
likely to be something formal in the
domain of a small view and more likely
to be something that's in the common
vernacular or the local dialect or slang
and so language is also something that
can can test as well as cross boundaries
so a lot of nation states were formed
after the decline of Western empires in
the mid 20th century and in those new
nation states that were formed you had
two or more groups speaking different
languages being artificially put
together and that resulted in a lot of
tensions but inversely language is also
something that can connect us if you
have people speaking the same language
even across large distances then then we
have diasporic communities that are
formed so there's an english-speaking
diet for a Chinese speaking diaspora and
even at the most weakened diaspora
but even though I'll use certain
analogies in this talk ultimately
there's no perfect good analogy here
even with the terms I've already
mentioned language identity and state
they obviously means something to us in
closure but those relationships don't
exist in the real world and vice versa
so the way that language can shape
identity in the real world will make no
sense in the closure context so the
original problem I set out to to solve
is to do basic language processing for
the thummell language which is spoken in
southern India northeastern sri lanka as
well as Singapore Malaysia and other
countries throughout the Indian Ocean
for English this is a lot simpler
there's a one-to-one mapping between a
letter and a character and thummell a
lot of letters are required to character
code points to be formed as well as the
the code the unicode specification for
demo is based on how you write not the
phonemes or the sounds which is what the
grammar is based on so just as a quick
example with the letters ich kann coup
ich is a consonant you can think of it
like the letter K cause like an ich and
aa and qu is like an ich canoe and you
can see the representation for ich and
unicode is a character as well as this
dot character which doesn't have any
semantic meaning and obviously when you
sort based on the Unicode code points
then it's not going to be an alphabetic
order but took a slight diversion I was
reading a scala book and it was talking
about how the Scala compiler can
understand Unicode so you can write your
identifiers in any language and so I
thought well closure and scholars
similar languages so let me try this out
in closure so here I have death and I
used the Greek letter for pi and then I
have an approximation for pi and now I
can use this Greek letter pi just as I
would any other binding so I thought
well functions are values and let me do
this for functions and we use some words
so I said def you do take Def be do drop
and now I can use ear to Nvidia just
like I can use take and drop so then I
thought how far can I go with this so
obviously if I were to say def Daniel if
I'm going to get an exception and the
reason why is because it is a special
form so it doesn't result to a Mac a
value just like macros so what we need
now is something that happens after the
read but before the evaluate stage of
the read evaluate print loop or repple
and that's where macros coming so I
won't talk about how to write macros I'm
probably not the best person do it and
they're already great resources talks
books workshops even in the closure
context so what I will do is just
explain the motivation in the
progression of the code as well as I'll
just say for you can think of a macro as
a special function that takes code
blocks as input and gives code blocks as
output so here we have a macro is called
init and it takes in code blocks and it
wraps them up into a sequence called
body and its output is an if form and it
takes the sequences and body and
unpackage --is them into the if form so
now so that's basically like a pass
through macro and now wherever we use if
we can now say you know instead so we
can say Yin Yin is PI positive and if so
return the string pi is positive and
that's what we get so now for all our
values and including functions we can
say def def def and for everything else
we can say def macro def macro and we
can basically translate the entire
language now closure will encourage us
to realize there's a lot of code
repetition and if and if there's any
code repetition or any sort of pattern
there's always a way to refactor this
since we have deaths and def macros a
function will not do in turn in order to
refactor so we have to use a macro so if
we were to create a macro called
translate function it
an old name and a new name this is what
we would get it would spit out a deaf
form and then we can use translate
function take you to translate function
drop video and so this isn't a whole lot
of code savings but if we do the same
for deaf macro forms we get translate
form if in a translate form and mudroom
and this is a lot more clean and concise
now if you notice there's still some
code repetition so there's still a way
that we can refactor what we've done but
in order to do that it's very closure II
of us to take a step back and think
about what the underlying data is and
once we understand that then you can
write the appropriate functions and/or
macros and here what we have is
basically a simple map we have names
that we're translating from and we have
names of we're translating to and those
are symbols and so these are clearly key
value pairs and that's a map so what we
need to do is we need to take those
macros that we've created and we need to
convert them so that they take symbols
as input and so if we do that then we
translate form becomes translate form
symbol and translate sorry it translate
function becomes translate function
simple translate form becomes translate
form symbol so now that we have these
helper macros we still need some main
macros to call them that take the
original symbol map as the input and
calls these helper macros and this is
what we get so you can see that the
symbol map comes in and then for every
key value entry pair in the map it calls
the helper macro and and spits out the
appropriate forms and so now that we
have these main macros all we need to do
is call them and we're done so what you
get is you get code that's entirely in a
different language and this is running
at the you know and that was at the
repple so demo ok so here's here's the
namespace where you have the macros and
here you have the symbol map and so here
is a namespace that it was just sort of
a proof of concept like how far can I
take this and this is some basic
language processing functions for
thummell written entirely in thummell so
it's you know adding suffixes and
anchoring plurals
and so let's plural so plural the word
Panama is plural and will plural eyes
the word modem and mutter means tree and
we get mud and run so door day means
strings of string two letters 32 you lit
the whole and will use the word when I
come so when I come is the formal word
for hello so when I come and we get a
sequence which is ba na ich ha in and
those are the letters according to the
language in that word so explain later
how I did that but looking back the code
that we just wrote is entirely code that
I'm just calling user level for lack of
a better word but basically it's code
that didn't have to recompile the the
compiler or the reader I mean this is
just code just like any other code and
part of this is because closure is very
well designed and it has a very coherent
design and changes to the language are
carefully done so that they're mainly
additions and are very rarely backwards
and compatible but more fundamentally so
long as we continue to write code in the
data structures of the language then
macros will still be there and so long
as macros are there this code will still
work but there's actually nothing that's
inherently specific to closure here this
has always been possible in Lisp which
means that there is probably somebody
out there already programming entirely
in Common Lisp entirely in Klingon but
I don't know Klingon so I just never
knew about it but it also helps that
closure and clojurescript in their
target run times the JVM as well as
JavaScript I'll support Unicode and so I
was using CLG X as a very helpful way to
take one code base and compile
simultaneously to the JVM into
JavaScript but once reader conditionals
come out in closure 1:7 very soon then
that will supersede CFG X but you still
need full full stack support so even
though the first version and Unicode
came out in the early 90s and even
though Mac OS 10 and Windows added
support in like 2000 2001
you still need fonts you still need
applications supporting all of this so
actually when I started to on this
library I shoveled it and I shelled it
for nine months because I couldn't find
a proper editor to handle the text and I
only came back because I eventually
found aqua max now with the only editor
I could find and nine months is a lot
longer than the amount of time it took
to actually write this code so but now
we have this ability to write code
entirely in a different language and so
this can be a huge boon for people who
speak a different language as the first
language not English and another way to
think about this is to think about your
perspective so think about how easy it
was to learn programming and how old you
were
think about how easy it was and how old
you were when you learned a foreign
language and now imagine if you had to
learn programming entirely in that
foreign language and this is exactly
what a lot of people around the world
have to do there's a lot of talk lately
about coding becoming the new literacy
for the 21st century
and there are a lot of efforts to teach
coding to kids like code.org
but if those efforts are serious about
applying that idea in a global context
then we need to think about and it's
going to be very difficult if we think
entirely in the english context or if
we're not thinking about this at all but
if proning programming becomes more
accessible because as in other people's
languages then we'll have more
programmers and we'll actually have more
closure programmers which is if closure
is the language that they're learning
but I think that even the task of
learning programming
become easier and so here's a riddle
which some of you already know the
answer to but what do you get when you
take a list and you add a turtle and you
subtract a pair of parentheses and the
answer is logo and so logo is the first
language that I learned I love the class
I decided to write a program in basic
right after that and from that
experience I almost gave up entirely on
programming I think there's something to
be said about the mental model for
functional programming the regularity of
syntax and the horrors of place-based
programming but with the library there
still is some kinks so there's still the
bootstrapping problem if in any
namespace that you want to use that's
translated forms Union you still need to
sort of import them either to require or
namespace literals are not handled so
that would actually need to go a little
lower level and the target run times are
entirely in English so when if you have
stock traces that abstraction will leak
but to explain how I solved the parsing
problem when you represent about all the
ephemeral letters of strings it turns
out some of them are prefixes of another
and so then that lends itself to a
prefix tree also known as a try and so
basically a try is a tree where
sequences are represented as paths from
the root to a leaf node so here this tri
has k a k a k u into it we add a T in a
th now you can also attach a value to
resequenced and then it becomes
associative like a map and so this would
be an example of how I would parse
string into letters and how I would
parse a string into its constituent
phonemes or a word into its constituent
phonemes but again every language has
its own specific set of characteristics
that need to be supported and the word
for that might be harder for some
languages than others and if you're
dealing with American English then your
job is the easiest but if we'd start
speaking and if we can start writing
code entirely in different languages
with this fragment the code base so for
example if all the people who program in
Ruby entirely and job entirely in
Japanese start programming in closure
entirely in Japanese or of all the
people who speak Chinese start
programming in closure in Chinese you
know what we have a fragment
user base we had these different
communities and the answer is yes but
that's true for any dimension of
diversity but rather I think there's
there's something there's something to
be said if within a subgroup if we reach
out to other subgroups and we can learn
grow share and interact so for example
as it turns out there's a lot of
evidence to show that ancient thummell
and ancient Japanese in terms of in
terms of lexically grammatically
archaeological and culturally were were
very strongly connected 2500 years ago
so to the extent that these languages
haven't diverged over two and a half
millennia there's something that
Japanese and related languages could be
an inspiration for tamil language
processing in terms of phonology and
grammar similarly in the first
millennium millennium the public Kings
took over writing scripts that became
the writing scripts for South East Asian
languages as well as single E's in sri
lanka and so time would be a good
example to look for how to do lexical
parsing in some ways closure has taken a
lot of good ideas from other languages
and synthesized them so obviously
there's a lot from common list but there
are also some good ideas from Haskell
and go and other languages and some
things that are uniquely hope closure
have travelled out and permeated the
programming sphere so a year ago Google
released voluntarily demographics on its
employees so on in terms of gender and
in terms of ethnicity and this sparked a
wider conversation about diversity in
Silicon Valley and in the tech industry
in general and this is an important
conversation to have and even though
there's a lot of room for improvement I
would imagine that Google is above
average as relative to its peers now
there are efforts on the grassroots like
rails bridge and closure bridge
following in rails bridges footsteps in
order to foster a safe space to help
people especially in underrepresented
groups on a basis of gender or race or
sexual orientation and they're doing
great work but if we think about it in
the in the global scale this this
message that we're trying to get out is
is still just in the english-speaking
world but those dimensions of diversity
exist outside of that in the larger
world and if we want those messages to
to be transmitted to the larger context
then we have to put it in the language
that people are speaking so I think that
programming in other languages can help
in that regard and I'm really excited
and optimistic that that closure can be
an instrumental tool in that so I just
like to give thanks to Google for being
a great employer and for supporting open
source asking and Steve for great input
and for being awesome just the closure
community and rails bridge enclosure
bridge Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
