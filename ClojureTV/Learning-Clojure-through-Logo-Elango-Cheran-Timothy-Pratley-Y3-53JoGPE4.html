our talk is entitled learning closure
through logo and just as a disclaimer
this talk presents our personal views
but they're not necessarily reflective
of those of our employers so this talk
will be about three main ideas the first
is why is logo a compelling learning
environment the second is how does logo
relate to closure and the third is how
can closure expand its potential
audience in ways that might be
surprising so at its most basic logo is
a programming language to control an
object that we call a turtle and the
turtle is represented by a triangle
although sometimes it might be pictured
as a turtle itself you send movements to
the turtle like forward back left right
telling it where to go and the turtle
carries a pen and when the pen is down
and the turtle moves it draws line
thanks so you can kiss you commands like
this
so right 30 and we're telling the turtle
to turn right by 30 degrees forward 50
so we're telling the the turtle to move
forward by 50 units less 60 telling the
turtle to turn left or counterclockwise
60 degrees forward 50 back 100 and so
now we've drawn a little lambda so the
syntax for logo looks something like
this so this is a function that says
draw stop sign so we're drawing a stop
sign now it turns out that logo was
actually a lisp so you can see that
there's a lot of similarity the
functions always in first position
there's a very simple syntax that's
regular and there's nested expressions
so if we go back to the logo syntax we
can look at it and think of it as Lisp
without the parentheses now as it turns
out what's old is new so logo was a few
decades old but it's very popular right
now and teaching kids but in a graphical
form so this is scratch it's a desktop
application where you drag blocks of
code and you snap them together and you
move a sprite which isn't in this case
as a cat but instead of a turtle it's a
cat but it's the same concept and as
applications move towards the web then
they they typically use a library called
block Li which is a JavaScript library
created at Google for creating these
kinds of graphical coding environments
so you'll see block Li used in co.org
and you might even see physical toys
that have a connected app with a coding
environment and those those connected
apps will also use block Li but here you
can see the logo origin because we're
moving a character using spatial
commands as lispers we can see these
code blocks and think of them as list
forms everything between two parenthesis
and if you use pair edit mode or some
other structural editing environment
then the then the act of snapping these
blocks together zan nesting blocks
inside other blocks is a lot like some
of the functionality that we already use
so there's an irony in all of it
which is that here we are today we're
using wisp as an easy effective way to
teach kids how to program and then when
they grow up they go off into the world
of curly braces and semicolons perhaps
and that's how they learn to program and
here we are we're at a cloture
conference so we've come back to Lisp
because there's this unrivaled power of
macros and there's the simplicity so all
of this begs the question if the same
thing is very good for beginners and
it's also very good for advanced users
then why do we avoid it in between so I
want to tell you a story about how I
learned programming so the very first
language I used was was basic and that's
because I was playing video games in
elementary school on the Commodore 64
and and I knew that the Commodore 64 had
basic and I had a basic compiler so I
thought it would be really great to do
more interesting things but as I quickly
found out it was really hard to do
anything of interest and so then I
thought is this is basic but I can't do
anything it must be me I don't know how
to do this and I gave up on programming
and for whatever reason the next year I
was 11 years old in middle school and
there was a class on logo that I decided
to take and it was just so much fun I
was drawing things that I want to draw
and then they taught us how to do
functions so that we could do even more
interesting things and even recursion
and it was just like just so
exhilarating that it renewed my interest
in programming so now I want to tell you
about how I learn closure so this was
six years ago in 2011 and at that time I
wasn't clear to me what the good
resources were to learn and in what
orders I mean there's tutorials and
websites and books but it wasn't clear
what a good progression was but once I
did get started it was a little bit odd
for me to get started with the the
environment because everything was a
pretty command line base at that time
but I went through their materials
learning about seeks and data structures
and and the core functions
and it felt a little bit abstract with
all the examples but that was okay
but I think the one thing that I likened
the learning experience to was how I
learned command-line utilities in UNIX
you have a bunch of small simple
well well-crafted tools working on a
common abstraction so it could be
command-line tools on on streams or
really well defined functions operating
on the seek abstraction but when you're
trying to perform a particular task you
think maybe there's this function that's
perfect for what I'm trying to do but
you won't know it until you know it so I
felt like blurring experience was
sometimes making some progress and then
kind of bashing my head against the wall
not understanding something and then
overcoming that obstacle and repeating
so I thought there has to be there has
to be a better way I mean this can't be
as good as it gets
so after knowing that logo is a lisp I
thought why not implement that in in
closure so that led me to creating the
closure turtle library and so as the
name suggests one of the first
objectives was to implement logo
enclosure but another ejective was to
use logo somehow to make learning
closure easier so to give you an example
of what that looks like let's start off
by drawing one of the simplest shapes a
square so we'll go forward forward 30
will make a right turn so right 90 and
then we'll go forward again right
forward right forward right and we have
our square okay so that was a little
repetitive so let's simplify that
so here we'll say repeat four times do
forward 30 right 90 and we have our
square again okay so now let's create an
octagon or a stop sign shape it takes
two turns to make a full 90 degrees so
each turn will be 45 and it has eight
sides so here we'll repeat 8:00 to 4:30
right 45 and we have our octagon okay
now let's give that a name so we'll say
death an octagon repeat a forward 30
right 90 and
if we call our octagon we get it we get
it back so now we can say octagon okay
so we know how to repeat we know how to
turn so let's see what happens if we
repeat calling our octagon and turning a
little bit after each turn so we repeat
twelve times doing our octagon and then
turning right thirty and we get this
spirograph looking pattern okay so let's
change the color and do that again okay
so let's go back and see what we can do
when we start to mix in a little bit of
a little bit more closure or gradually
so we'll go back to our simple octagon
and if we know the length of an octagon
then we can start to draw things around
the octagon so don't worry about the
code to define the size of an octagon
but what we'll do now is we'll pick the
pen up we'll move forward by the size of
an octagon we'll put the pen down and
we'll draw an octagon so now we have one
on top of another and we'll do it again
pen up forward and down octagon okay so
now let's views range and map to create
a column of octagons
so first what we'll do is we'll define a
function that draws an octagon at a
particular height or y-coordinate
then we'll define the heights or the
y-coordinates that we want to draw these
up and now we have a function that draws
the Octagon in a particular y coordinate
we have our Y coordinates and we just
need to map the function onto Y
coordinates and we get our full column
okay so now let's cover the whole canvas
instead of worrying about pen up and pen
down well you set X Y to teleport the
turtle
so first what we'll do is we'll use the
for function to create the collection of
XY coordinates we want to draw our
octagon zap next we'll generalize our
octagon drawing function to take an XY
coordinate and to make things
interesting we'll make the color random
and now that we have our new function
and we have our XY coordinates all we
need to do is map them so now we've
tiled the plane and we have random
colors so if we do it again the colors
will start to change so why is logo
interesting logo is an environment
that's simple interactive and visual and
all of those aspects are important for a
beginning learning environment and logo
is all three of those logos also often
taught in an exploration based
environment so oftentimes in a classroom
setting you'll see a picture shown up on
the board and say here's what we're
trying to draw can you draw it and there
might be hints but you're not taught to
do things and what that does is it gives
the learner a sense it requires a
learner to interact with the environment
and manipulate the environment so it
gives a sense of self-discovery and
excitement and you start to wonder what
else can I do but ultimately it gives a
sense of empowerment because you're in
control of what you learn and how you
learn it and logo was envisioned as more
than just a turtle on a 2d screen the
turtle was also thought to be envisioned
to be manifest as a an actual robot
because interactive interactivity means
more than just one sense it's more than
just our sight seeing what's output
there's also the sense of sound in the
sense of touch and interactivity also
means more than just output we're more
that it's more than just telling giving
commands and watching the output come
out if we have a physical robot it might
be able to sense a barrier and respond
to it and turn around by having a
physical object
it makes things real for us it's
tangible it's relatable and it's
connected to our reality it's not this
abstract concept on the screen but here
too what's old is new so there are lots
of toys coming out where they're either
robots or cars and they have a connected
app component where you have graphical
blocks to to write your code and
control and control those toys but you
can see that graphical environment is
very much based on blockly and those
robots are very much the same old turtle
and there's micro bit which is a
breadboard that you can use with
connected to an app and you can code up
different things that you build around
it and here's an example of an electric
guitar
so all these benefits of logo are not a
fluke it's not a happy coincidence but
it's ashli by design so logo was created
by Seymour Papert
and he was a researcher in education in
computer science and so for him his
goals with logo first and foremost were
interactivity and exploration and that's
based on his theory of knowledge which
is that when we have new information we
absorb that into systems that in our
mind and and those that to make sense of
that new information and that is
knowledge but he believed that he went
further and he said that that knowledge
too for it to make sense it has to
relate to the existing knowledge so in
other words we there's new things out
there and if we take that new
information we can only really absorb it
if we can relate it to what we already
know so he believed that knowledge
acquisition happens best when we can
make those relationships but he also
believed that knowledge acquisition
happens best when we were put in control
of our own learning so he didn't just
design logo as a means to teach
programming he also designed it as a as
an exemplary way to demonstrate his
theories so if you're interested in any
of these topics or even if you're
interested in teaching closure I highly
recommend reading his book Mindstorms
which talks about history all of his
theories at depth so we'd like to just
stress that we're not the first people
to implement logo enclosure
there's certainly prior art Niroula
Akaya had a blog post talking about this
there are other projects on github that
do this we're certainly not the first to
implement logo in the browser
there's JavaScript implementations and
there are other learning environments
that even if they're not they're
transitioning to the web but we have a
different focus with what we're doing we
believe that there are two things we're
trying to do we're trying to blur the
lines between logo and closure and we're
also trying to blur the
between what's considered turtle and was
considered programming so I have a boat
claim to me and that is that I believe
closure is the best first programming
language for everyone I have some stuff
to show you that I hope will convince
you as well but I didn't believe this
last year so last year my friend Nathan
came up to me and he was he said to me
I'm ready to you close her a try
I've even installed Emacs and I was like
that's awesome closure is so cool
first we need to do some setup so just
go ahead and install Java get line
adjourn I want you to run this command
to create a project please and add these
dependencies into your project file
start a ripple okay press ctrl K Medici
and he was like what is all this
I just want to learn closure I don't
care about any of that stuff he didn't
like it
and those Nathan's one of the best
coders I know like he's really
experienced but there's a barrier here
and it's easy for us to forget about
this or dismiss it because we're
familiar with our tools they're just
mundane to us but for a complete
beginner is the difference between can
and cannot so it's a big deal for people
but the good news is that all that kind
of changed thanks to self hosted closure
script all you need to close code
closure is a web browser and that's a
huge deal so I've been talking with
Elango about his ideas about teaching
closure through logo and we thought well
what if we could marry a closure script
rebel with his turtle library and the
result was power turtle this is our
website URL down the bottom here and
I'll just quickly show you what it looks
like so
thank you up the top here we have some
lessons which just really gently
introduce you to what you're able to do
in this world which as you've seen is
you know forward right all those sorts
of things and just encourages you to use
them in different contexts and start
building up how to draw patterns and
that sort of thing
pretty soon we get onto defining a
function it's just a very basic function
that combines your existing commands
into a new command and then again it's
just more practice with that in
different contexts and so forth there
are are they're more advanced lessons
which we'll come back to in a moment but
what I really want to show you now is
just what's capable with with power
Turtles so don't worry too much about
the code in these examples it's really
just showing you what's possible if you
you know push it to its limits so we all
know that logo is great for doing things
like geometric shapes and there's a
whole lot of things you can do with that
one what I think is a neat little
addition is you can actually put your
steps into a button hopefully you saw
that I just added a button to my UI here
by just calling this function and now
I've got my own little thing I can just
click and I feel this is nice because
you can build up your own drawing
program using logo and we have multiple
canvases so you don't just have to stick
with logo you can work in this rust or
world and a raster is just a essentially
it's a monitor you can set pixels on you
can draw horizontal lines vertical lines
and it I think it's a nice way to teach
sequences you can come up with some
interesting patterns like the American
flag and you can imagine how how there's
a pattern behind that if you really want
to push it to the limits you can create
Conway's Game of Life in this little
rasta world
I'll quickly show you the quill canvas
which quill is a more fully featured
drawing system it has ellipses and all
those primitives but you can also do
animation is very powerful so I won't go
into it here
this chart canvas is here because very
naturally when we're teaching closure we
fall back to math and so I think it's
nice to be able to do things like plot a
range of numbers or plot a function so
that there is a visual representation of
the math that's going on as well and of
course you can plot data sets as well
and and please note like we're just
calling chart here with some numbers
like it's really basic you don't need to
know about charting my favorite is the
HTML canvas because you can edit the
page itself I think that's kind of fun
you can do obviously headings you can do
input boxes you can do lists you can do
anything
HTML includes which which means you can
do SVG you can do buttons so you can
make these little widgets and games or
whatever so you know it's just up to
your imagination if you really want to
you can embed other canvases in your
canvas which is kind of fun so the key
point I want to make here is that you
can do all of this without any setup
like you don't know you don't need to
know anything about the JVM you don't
need to know about dependencies you
don't need an editor you don't need to
know about namespaces you don't need to
know about referring symbols you're just
using the commands so I think this is
great for people like Nathan because he
can get to use closure without investing
his time in the tools and obviously I
think it's great for beginners who just
can't deal with the tools so I promise
to show you the lessons and let's have a
quick look at those I just want to show
you that there
they're just slides at the top here and
they just all have a different theme
some use different canvases but there
there's some stuff here and what we're
aiming for is we want a progression
right we want people to start out
learning about function calls just
getting comfortable with how to do that
how to combine functions into new
functions and then move on to repeating
functions creating sequences using those
sequences modifying those sequences and
always building cool stuff like in the
canvases and like what we really want is
for them to continually move on to more
advanced things so they slowly transcend
logo into interesting things all
enclosure so one thing that we've
noticed in our experience is that when
learners get to functions and especially
if higher-order functions are included
it becomes an inflection point in their
learning curve and things start to
become harder and some people have
difficulty so maybe we were so excited
about functional program we start
talking about things like functions or
values but what we've seen is that
problems occur when we start to explain
things before learners have had a chance
to internalize those concepts so at
least from our experience we believe
that what works best is if you can show
a concept first and encourage practice
before you attempt to explain so for
example if we just show them here's your
P and inside repeat you you give it a
block of commands then and you show to
them they'll just get it we talked about
higher-order functions or functions and
in this example from blockly games shows
just that so here we have a repeat block
and inside it we have the commands that
are being executed and it's just
intuitive you don't even need to say
what's going on for them to get it but
the inverse can be true too if we try to
explain things too early it can really
disrupt the flow of learning so this
progression becomes really important
at least in my experience I've seen
books and other materials where macros
get introduced as early as midway
through instead of left as an advanced
topic towards the end and my belief is
that you can you don't have to write a
macro you don't have to learn how to
write a macro in order to use it and
appreciate it and I've seen other
examples where the list function or the
vector function or the cons function
gets hot perhaps really on but in my
experience I don't use those as often as
I use other functions except for perhaps
when I'm writing a custom macro or I'm
trying to transpose nested data or I'm
perhaps creating my own custom lazy seek
so if pepper were here and he and he saw
that we're trying to teach functional
programming you know through through
logo he would say this is great it's
visual it's interactive and this is all
necessary but it's not sufficient like
you there's there's more that you need
to do you'd say all this new information
that you're teaching you have to make
sure that when you teach it it has to
relate to what the the learners already
know so let's look at closure and logo
so logo is a simple environment with a
small set of primitives and that really
allows learners to internalize it easily
so likewise we think that we can teach
closure by starting with a small set of
primitives so when we look at closure
verse logo we see that it's you know
it's easy to learn everything in logo
because there's not that much to learn
and it's pretty easy to teach it's hard
to do it wrong but with closure it has a
larger core so the ordering of those
concepts matters a lot more so perhaps
you have a lesson in mind that you'd
like to teach for yourself and the good
news is that lessons are just text files
they are mocked down they're really easy
to edit and you know we realize that we
want our lessons to cater to most
beginners but beginners come from
different backgrounds they might be from
school they might be from University
might be from other fields and you know
maybe they speak French and they need a
translation so it was really important
for
us that you can create your own lessons
really easily and if you want to just
deliver your lesson you can actually
just append your markdown file URL if
you're hosting it somewhere and it will
load up in power turtle and you can
start using it we would really love it
if you would send us the markdown and
then we can put it in the lesson index
and everyone can benefit from it
here's a piece of feedback I received
about the existing lessons
it was quite astounding how Noah went
off on his own tangent to draw his own
patterns about half way through the
lesson and this is exactly what I'd
hoped for
you know lessons are a guide but you can
do whatever you want and the emphasis
here is on self discovery
I think lessons are most interesting
when they kind of give us a challenge
can you draw this thing and then they
maybe provide a concept to get you there
so getting started with our turtle is
easy but there's an even bigger barrier
for most people who want to learn
closure which is they have to learn a
foreign language first so I'm currently
learning Korean and I can tell you wow
it's like really tough to learn a
language it's it's a big deal it takes a
lot of work and my friend alex is from
korea and i asked him how did you learn
programming and he said well first I
learned English then I went to an
Australian University and now I work at
Microsoft I mean sounds so easy right
but we I mean we all know there's a
decade of dedication that is involved in
that but only 5% of the world speaks
English and 20% if you include
bilinguals so most people when they want
to learn programming they're getting
started experiences awesome programming
is really cool but go learn English
first I happen to know that Elango had
translated closure to Tamil and so I
thought well I wonder if we can do that
for PAL turtle and of course we can so
here's just a small example of showing
you a Korean Ford a German write a
thamel ford french ride
Chinese forward and of course you can
use all of closures functions like map
and range in this example you probably
want to stick to one language this is
very polyglot programming right here but
yeah it all just works so you can code
closure in your language poly food
closure I'm pretty sure closure is a
French word right so it's kind of weird
but Elango and I get this common
response to programming in another
language which is they're gonna have to
learn English anyway so why bother and
there's a point I want to make here
which is that translations are just
great I mean they're really useful
you know geometry it was translated from
Greek you know astronomy it was
translated from Latin
I'm Stein German Marie Curie did all the
work in French they're just plain useful
translations are great and they're super
easy to do in closure so just why not
doing this is Lange goes library it
works great with closure
it relies on macros that write macros
which doesn't work in closure scripts so
we made something that works in both and
we call it closure by another name or
c-band for short it consists of a
plug-in that you can use to wrap your
own libraries or other people's
libraries and see ban itself is a
collection of translations of closure
core to other spoken languages the
translations themselves are just text
files so they're very easy to work with
so let's get everyone in the world
learning closure this will be great
right what could go wrong
probably nothing this did go wrong this
didn't work out so well for me my I got
this email dear Tim Eric cannot read
property call of undefined not sure what
I'm doing love mom
so there's still some friction here we
need to smooth out and you know I'd
really like to replace this with
something more helpful in the future so
perhaps you're interested in building
something like power turtle yourself and
so I want to give you some pointers on
how to do that if you have a blog or a
website you should definitely use clips
all you have to do is include a script
in your page and it will find any code
blocks that you already have in your
page and replace them with this
interactive repple users really
appreciate this I get way more traffic
to my blog site when I use it so you
should definitely use it for power
turtle we use replumb because it gives
you more control it takes a bit more
effort to set up but we like the
customization so that really brings us
back to learning closure through logo
the logo closure connection is a steady
progression from beginner to advanced
self hosted closure script makes it easy
to get started translations make it
accessible to the wider world it's fun
and you're in control and that's why I
believe that closure is the very best
first language for everyone so here's a
short list of all the people whose
advice tools libraries compilers and
language have made it possible for us to
do all the things that we've done so
here are some links to some of the
libraries and projects that we've
mentioned and here's our contact
information so we love it if you have
any comments suggestions or
contributions if we have some time then
we're happy to answer some questions
okay
okay great so let me try to read
summarize so there was a lot of
compliments and thank you very much
and you said that you're actually using
this in the field I guess to kind of
summarize some of the comments I think
it's about how do we transition from
something that's stateful because logo
you have state there's a lot of side
effects when you're drawing and how can
we transition students towards more data
processing and getting them to the you
seeks and the other functional
constructs and I and I think that's a
that's a good observation and a good
comment and something that we've thought
about too we've heard suggestions that
it should be stateless and that's the
true functional way when I was reading
Mindstorms pepper talks about he talks
about the sin tenacity or it's sin tonic
learning that you have this model that
you can kind of relate to as a learner
and apply it to the domain that you're
trying to to work in so in this sense
the turtle is kind of a reflection for a
lot of students of themselves they are
individuals they move in the environment
so when you're saying okay I need to
move I need to turn right 30 and move
forward and then back and then turn less
and so they kind of mimic what they know
from their own experience and they apply
it to turtle and so there's this
intuitiveness because we moving through
the world
it's a stateful process right once we
move somewhere we're there it's not a
stateless thing so I think there's some
value at least for starting off but I
think the the goal then would be to do a
very careful a very careful transition
towards more functional concepts and I
think there there are definitely a lots
of ways that we can explore that
yeah I totally agree with what you're
saying and I just wanted to point out
that in a Legos library and in this
website you can actually do that with
there's a call called execute Terrell
commands and you can give it a data
structure and it all works I yeah the
total record like so
turtles are defined as a record and in
it actually keeps it keeps track of the
commands that have been given to it
