start okay I work for this company
called world singles well singles is a
dating and matchmaking company that
operates online personals websites for
various communities from all over the
world today I'm here to talk about our
experience with honey SQL I will start
with what is honey SQL and why we use it
at world singles and then i will show
you step by step and SQL examples and
finally i will share how we use honey
SQL in our application including graph
menu setup and how we handle filters
joints and hide shirts what is honey SQL
it was created by justin kramer and with
honey SQL everything is built on top of
closure maps representing SQL queries
this select from where single threat
will produce a closure map with select
from where keywords like this then it
can be formally to khoobi statement in
string using the SQL formal function
since it is a closure map the odor of
select from where in this example
doesn't matter this will be the same as
this one on the right both will produce
the same curry later I will use the fact
that it is a closure map i will also
contradict myself saying that the order
does matter in our implementation
another thing i would like to mention is
that you are responsible for responsible
for correctness of your curious as you
are with string version of courage
statement all column names and table
names must be correct or your database
will throw an exception also if your
career with the wrong semantics is
executable it will return wrong data so
why honey SQL like any other web
applications we have hundreds of queries
to our database kruis we know exactly
how they look like such as select
everything about the particular user
last time this user was online people
who they send message to +
but what about those we don't know how
the curious looked like a compile-time
so this is the project i started working
about two years ago called hubble scope
hubble scope is a data visualization
tool for admins it is entirely
customizable at runtime the duration of
data can be as long as 15 years it is a
line graph with maximum of eight lines
you can draw up to 30 graphs / single
request it also has total of 17 filters
per line for every graph X accesses
always dates and y axis can be either
count or dollar amount or percent like
this it can have more than one y axis
for dollar amount for example and for
each line selection you can add an
average line which is the straight
dashed line in yellow in this image for
some lines that are too hard to read
compared to the other line with the
shared y axis a multi failure can be
added to the line creating a separate y
axis so that it will help you to see the
subtle difference in values how the
scope was and still written in
coldfusion javascript mysql as a
database and we use high chairs for
graphing after the first version of
Hubble scope was up and running however
I saw some issues there are lots of
string concatenation lots of similar
logics mostly due to filters and it
quickly became an unrealistic human
facing language and imagine even
enclosure matching string mixed with
business logics would be very hard to
follow and scale and difficult to focus
on semantics of curries not to mention
occasional missing whitespace which
could cause in my scale mysql exception
meanwhile our requirements were growing
and so we needed something that we can
eliminate as much duplicate code as
possible and easy to add and modify and
allow
to focus on semantics of the curries
instead of concatenating strings and
maybe separate business logics from
curious as much as possible so I started
coding enclosure replacing server-side
ColdFusion code in fall 2012 shortly
after we started using honey SQL as a
result close your code grew tremendously
computing almost everything possibly
computed in the back end so how did I do
this let's create a function called
weaving you first I create sorry first
we acquire honey SQL decor and honey SQL
helpers by the way I will go over just a
few syntax in this talk once you see
those examples other syntax should be
easy to apply mostly in the same manner
suppose you are interested in the date
and the dollar amount columns in the
transaction table notice the column
names and table names are both keywords
the names must match with the database
schema using the single thread this
example will produce select transaction
date and amount from the transaction
table to compute total revenue you can
call SQL code function with the sum
aggregation also as a keyword which will
be applied to the amount column this
becomes select transaction date and some
amount from transaction instead of using
SQL call function it can also be written
in this format that is keyword which
search with the percent aggregation
function dot column name for this
presentation I'm going to use SQL code
function for consistency since our graph
needs x and y values let's call the date
column as x and the amount column as y
also called the table areas as t the
format for alias column 0 table name is
a vector of two keywords the first item
is column or table name involved by
alias name the graph will have a start
date let's add where condition with a
vector of three items an operator
and a value here we are adding
transaction data is greater than equal
to a value January first of this year we
also have the end date so let's set
another vector to the where condition
and say transaction date is less than
tomorrow this vector will add end to the
where condition for you you could also
parameterize dates using SQL problem
function and send parameters in the
vector argument and SQL format call in
the order of parameter appearances or
you could use a bindable parameter using
a keyword that starts with a question
mark you can also directly use voice
without using parameters in order to
aggregate y value by day let's call the
date aggregate on the transaction date
column so that we can group by the x and
order by X so that data in the result
set is in the ascending order by date
you can also use the having function in
this example total revenue with
transaction method equals people you
could also use in operator and start a
single threat to create an STD curry
doing so will make the curry more
complex for our example will remove
having a function and nested query for
simplicity and refactor select function
instead we will create a function called
select X Y with X and Y argument X is
always date column and aggregated by
date function it is ensure that each
record set has x and y values to be
translated into a graph later so select
is replaced with select XY function next
we'd like to refactor start and end date
logic we create a function called where
dates this is to ensure that the dates
are aggregated in the same manner for
any line in any graph so now we're
condition is replaced with a date
function and since for our purpose it's
always grouped by X order by x and then
format it to a string version of curry
so we factor them into group order form
and function
like this and so we finally have our
revenue function ready the function will
produce a string select the date of
transaction date as X some of amount as
Y from transaction as T where date is
greater than equal to start date and end
date is less than end date group by X
order by X let's create a new query to
compute total revenue account the only
thing that you need to change from our
last example is y value that is count of
transaction ID considering those
differences we create a map called
revenue map each key represent type of
revenue and each value contains y value
back to a revenue function we now have a
new argument called revenue type and you
can get Y value in the let binding if
you pass total count as a revenue type
then York we will select count of
transaction ID now let's create another
query by adding new keyword new keyboard
has a value that is a map of why and
where keywords y value it's someone
moment and where value is is new column
equals 21 going back to a revenue
function again the first thing to do is
get why and where condition from revenue
map give a ravine you type then now we
are going to use cone single threat to
test if we're condition is true d cone
single thread takes the set of test
expression at the end the phone if the
test expression is true d then form will
be evaluated otherwise it will test the
next expression it doesn't help they're
like cond similarly adding another
Ravino type is easy like you can see SQL
call function can be nested in this
example total refund revenue types y
value is absolute value of sum of amount
in order to execute constructed curry we
require your closure Java JDBC it is a
closure rapper library for J
dc-based access to database to execute a
query simply call the library's clearly
function with argument where the first
argument is your database and the second
argument is a complete curry statement
for us that's generated by honey SQL our
database is my mysql so honey SQL lets
you create queries with quoting simply
by adding quoting and mysql keywords to
SQL form and function now I'm going to
show you how we set up the user
interface dynamically we have total of
116 menu criteria at the moment in my
SQL namespace we have 16 functions which
constructs hundred six Chris whose data
source is MySQL we define menu as a
vector of maps each map represents a
criteria such as total profiles to
create a menu in user interface we only
pass keys you I knees such as ID
category line name tooltip and so on if
you want to add remove or modify menu
criteria you only need to edit this map
using the same map this highlighted keys
are only ones needed in backend for
computation their ID sauce function
function keys and default y-axis so how
do we compute theta pick up from the
previous section is that we created
revenue function and the revenue map
which has revenue type keys each given
you type key has a value Y and where as
optional using this information we
cannot assign function is revenue and
function keys is total for ID one as in
total revenue for example so give an ID
from you I we can obtain function and
the key to construct and run a query at
runtime what we are trying to do is call
the function with a function keys what
about filters
filters has two parts one before you
construct a query to when you construct
the curry what does that mean we have 12
generic filters can be applied to almost
every criteria such as site site group
country gender age local and so on we
also have five categories specific
filters for example for the ravine your
category membership package payment
method promo code for the screening
category we have admin ID to identify
who screen the folder for example before
constructing a curry there are three
things need to be done one clean up
filters to apply business logic three
generate string to display filter
description in the graph why do we want
to clean filters we'd like to leave only
filters we need inquiry in other words
if we don't need to filter in SQL
statement we want to remove it for
example country code is a string in our
application an empty string means all
countries what does this mean inquiry it
means we don't want to filter by a
country so we move this filter from the
list and it's done in a different name
space called filters why in a different
name space because namespace to
construct the query which is MySQL knows
only two table structures if you pass
the country filter with an empty string
or nail it will try too much where
country is equal to an empty string this
means that if default value changes you
only need to make a change in the
filters namespace not in MySQL another
filter that needs to be removed is a
filter that isn't associated for the
correct criteria say you select admin
screen in category and the promo code
filter is selected which is for the
revenue category we don't care about the
promo code for this criteria so we
remove it so clean up means keep only
filters needed in the career another
thing we do in the filters namespace is
to apply business logics related to
filters for example we have priorities
amongst site group to draw multiple
graphs site group to
filter for a single line and site to
filter for single line depending on
their values we either remove modify or
add filters to generate data for a graph
we intend to draw another example is
mutually exclusive filters even though
it is enforced in you I so that one of
them is true we do this in the back end
as well as you know if both are true
there will be no data which we don't
want depending on business logic we
remove modify or add filter and prepare
for building accruing another thing we
do in the filter namespace is to
generate a spring / string to display
filter name if necessary and its value
for example if we display USA then you
know it that is a country filter but if
we display eligible Greeks calm then we
don't know if it's a site or site group
because it can be also a site group name
same for age if we just display age we
wouldn't know if it's a mean age or max
age most filters in data is an ID so we
also need to convert them into something
meaningful to user by using look up
going back to a revenue function example
now we would like to add the function
called add filters which will work for
any function to generate a career when
you fill the data by a certain column
you need to make sure that the column
exists in one of the tables in your QE
if it doesn't then you have to join the
table which has the column you want to
filter with um so i define hear
something called tables what it is is
that each key is table name and each
table has a table as a vector format so
that you can use it in a from or join
function in with an SQL and each table
has also columns that I need to draw a
graph so why I do this is
that this is the only place i have to
look up to draw a graph so it tells me
all tables i need to draw a graph and
all columns i need to draw a graph for
each table and so the joining process is
usually it's a manual process that you
have to manually look your SQL statement
and see if it's not there then I have to
join and then I thought myself maybe I
can let closure do the job for me so
once i define this tables then i have a
bunch of functions that does the joining
process for me so one of them is called
table as so what it does is you give SQL
map and table name now to break the
table in the table as a keyword and then
it will return a table alias name so in
in the code I will never have to
remember what the table alias name was
and similarly I have this function it's
called SQL to column so it takes SQL map
and then call them look up what it does
is first look for the column in from
table and if it's there then it will
return the column that you're looking
for from the front table and if it
doesn't then it will look forward join
tables and to see if one of the joint
tables has the column that you're
looking for then it will return it if
now then it returns now you can do this
because SQL map is a culture map imagine
if this was a string it would be very
hard to do and using this function you
can create a bunch of functions like
this one site ID column so it takes SQL
map and then we it returns site ID
column to either join on or filter by
and so now once you know how to get the
column you are looking for then it's
time to actually filter going back to
add filters function
we are going to take a look at the
filtering process on how it works and
one of the example is at fill at site
group IDs function so the first thing it
does is to see if site IDs that's a
vector if it's not empty then in the if
let I was I would try to find a site ID
column if it finds it then I simply
Marge rare condition such as site ID
column is in sight IDs as vector and if
it doesn't find a site the site ID
column in SQL map then you first have to
join a table in this case it's a user
table and then you Marge rare condition
so then there's another case that one
column could mean more than I'm sorry
one concept means more than one column
in a table what I mean by that is that
for example like in a message table a
user camp can be a recipient user or
sent sender user when viewing a profile
a user can be a viewed user or viewer
user full profile view function and I
have a map with type of curious as keys
and each have associated user ID column
so when you are trying to create unique
viewed users then your user ID column
you want to join on viewed user ID and
since this ql is a closure map in honey
SQL and until you format I'm simply
associating user ID column to the SQL
before calling up filter function so
that I can join on on the correct user
ID I'm sorry correct user ID column
during filtering process it will first
look to see if there is user ID column
exist and if not check from from table
fall by joint
as we did before so now you can safely
call add filters in any function but i
have to say with this implementation the
order does matter to make it work as
intended so the last item i'm going to
talk about is how to manipulate high
chairs in the back end hi church is an
interactive JavaScript chart recall
their requirements that Hubble scopes
graph can have more than one y-axis
depending on user selection and data in
high Church the graph is expressed as a
JSON format and I thought to myself what
if I could compute everything I can and
I passed a graph of JSON format back to
the front end and thanks to closure
dated of JSON library this was easily
done and let's put together things we
discussed so far from the front and this
is the function to return a graph object
in JSON format given start date end date
and line criteria first we clean filters
as we talked and then we use p map to
compute data by generating a career with
honey SQL up to this point the pipe line
represents lines in the graph the last
operation in the pipeline is a graph
function this is in High Church
namespace the graph function can be a
def multi if you have more than one tool
to graph and user can choose which kind
of graph you they want to draw at
runtime but for our purpose it's only
with high Church so I'm simply calling
graph function here so enclosure a graph
is just a map with y axis and that is a
list of y axis and the series that is a
vector of lines as maps you can also add
title to the graph if you would like but
the most important part is that y axis
in each line in series must exist in one
y exceeds
and the data that you computed using
honey SQL will be applied to data in
each line in series so you were simply
passing a graph object or map from from
the back end to the front end and in
JavaScript you simply assign grafted y
axis into high charts y axis and
similarly you can assign series to High
Church series and y axis has obviously
the most important thing is ID and other
attributes are like minimum value
maximum value and for our purpose we
need a multiplier and so on to compute y
axis and to compute all y axis we have
to iterate each data in series so we
start with empty vectors for y axis and
series that's our initial state and the
first thing you just push the line and
then y axis associated with that line
but the second time you either use the
existing y axis or you have to add the
new y axis depending on the data so
along the way I ask this question does
this use default y axis or does this
need a new y axis or does this need to
walk with a multiplier so I walk through
and then a few of the function that I
can show is like new y axis ? function
which returns true or false to say if
the data requires new y axis or not and
another function is y axis max ID which
will return
i D of y axis that has max value amongst
old y axis and y axis next ID would
return next idea to assign given the
current y axis another thing i would
like to mention is high church uses JS
epic time what is jay's epic time it is
a JavaScript date-time stamp in
milliseconds since January first
nineteen seventy enclosure it is
java.lang long datatype and it can be
done easily by using clj time course
shielded time the core aside from y-axis
computation another thing we do is add
long dashed line for average line you
can also catch a style key and study in
string into a line did I just say a sock
I'm sorry associate another thing i did
i did not too long ago was adding
exploit line to the graph i computed all
sundays from start to end date and
mapped with date for sundays and color
it's easy to create a manipulator
closure data structure converted into
json string and the very last thing our
extensibility honey SQL can be extended
and i've done two things two years ago
both of which are no longer necessary
One is using extend protocol to sk out
at the back dick to table and column
names as I said before this can be done
by just adding courting and mysql
keywords when you format another thing
was adding a function handler this is
for in operator I believe this is
straightforward the very last thing I
would like to mention is a Hubble scopes
other features um creating you you I
dynamically constructing a curry and
drawing a graph or made possibly by
closure honey a skewer and and
highcharts all of which are data-driven
it worked seamlessly we were able to add
another feature
and let her use a save a graph we store
a graph as a data structure in MongoDB
in a JSON format it was easy for us to
retrieve the graph through closure honey
SQL and highchairs again we were also
able to add in a large system which
allows user to set a threshold to align
and send them a notification since alert
cron job is run every four hours and not
every 24 hours we tweak the Select XY
function and we saw earlier that was
easy to do in conclusion I would like to
say that Hubble scope became one of our
success stories using closure and highly
skilled at war singles and a special
thank you to this was my very first
public speaking thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
