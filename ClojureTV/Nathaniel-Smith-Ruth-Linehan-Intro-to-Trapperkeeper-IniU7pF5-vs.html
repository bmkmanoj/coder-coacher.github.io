and this is nathaniel smith we're both
back end services developers at puppet
labs which is an IT automation and
configuration company here in Portland
we're here to talk to you about trapper
keeper which is a service framework that
we wrote and use at puppet labs I'm
going to give or we'll both give a brief
introduction and overview and then
Nathaniel is going to talk about Trapper
Keeper RPC which is a library that he
wrote so what in fact is trapper keeper
and as I said trapper keeper is a
service framework for long running
applications so service framework is a
pretty generic term and I'll go into a
bit more detail of what we mean by that
in a minute but really it's just a
binder for modular bits of code it's
written in closure we're at pleasure
West obviously so hopefully it's written
in closure and it's the basis for all of
our back-end services development and
puppet labs it's also open source you
can check out its github repository in
the puppet labs namespace we've had some
great community contributions recently
at Dillon as one it's been great to see
and we'd love to see more people
contribute to it and check it out so
last year at closure west in San
Francisco I think puppet DB witches are
a service for storing puppet related
data was called out as one of the most I
think it was called out is one of the
most in deployed closure applications so
we at puppet labs have had a lot of
success with closure starting with
puppet DB and we wanted to expand that
more two more products to more services
and so in doing that we wanted to take
the lessons that we learn from puppet DB
and be able to kind of extract them out
and reuse some of those things so we
wanted to make sure we weren't
reinventing the wheel with every single
application we had and that we could
easily reuse code across
are different products so in the past
year we've released several more closure
products built on trapper keeper and we
moved puppet DB to be now using Trapper
Keeper so these include puppet server
which is also open source it's our
puppet master written enclosure and a
number of our commercial products are
now written in closer so um more
specifically what's a service framework
what does it give us um one thing is as
I've mentioned we really wanted it for
code generalization and component reuse
being able to take one piece of code
like what is used to set up a web server
and use it across multiple different
products frequently so we call these
things services these bits of code that
we have and they're the reason that we
want a service rather than just a
library of functions that we can use in
different places is that typically a
service is something that has to manage
state and with that comes it usually has
a life cycle so something has to happen
when the service is initialized
something is that I'm going to happen
when it's when it started and when it's
shut down and so with each of those
those stages of the application we need
to manage some state and do it in the
consistent way and typically our
services have dependencies between
themselves or amongst themselves and so
we want to make sure that we have
managed those dependencies that there
and that were starting and stopping the
application in a way that all of those
dependencies will work together and we
won't break anything
so why Trapper Keeper there are a bunch
of other frameworks that do similar
things as this we were a lot of what
I've talked about is really influenced
by Stuart Sierra's closure reloaded
framework or pattern and so you know
this is pretty similar to things like
component and jig there's also things
like a mutant we've borrowed some from
osgi as well so there's there's a number
of other things in this space that that
do something similar and for us the real
reason why we wrote our own thing was
that we ship on-premise software which
means that the service framework that we
use is part of the shipping application
it's something that our users are going
to be interacting with and so first of
all it needs to be lightweight we
because of the way that we package and
ship things we can't be easily shipping
something like jboss we also don't
always need a web server in the specific
application we're shipping some things
need a web server some don't we don't
always want to be showing up and we want
our users to be able to configure it
easily once they've installed it they
shouldn't need to know closure in order
to tune it so a lot of our users most of
our users are system administrators who
don't really have experience with
closure and don't really want to learn
it to have to tune puppet enterprise our
puppet so Trapper Keeper provides a lot
of features for being able to configure
it very easily from config files so some
specific features of Trapper Keeper
other than kind of what I laid out for
you know what we consider a service
framework are the ability to turn
services on and off just via a config
file after we've actually deployed or be
able to swap out which implementation of
a service is use is used via a config
file and we also sometimes want to be
able to run multiple web applications on
a single web server so for demo purposes
or for setting up a test environment our
users might want to just kind of deploy
everything on one node and test it out
and then to actually have an environment
a production environment they want to
split these applications out onto
multiple notes for performance and that
can be achieved with just some changes
to config file we also really want
wanted unified logging and configuration
so Trapper Keeper sets a blogging system
for you using log back and all services
can be configured in the same way just
by changing around the log back file XML
file and as well configuration we and
handling config files so we want to be
able to not have to kind of rewrite how
we do config files for every single
service we want that to be consistent
across all of our applications so
Trapper Keeper also has some existing
services that anyone can use um there's
a config service which is built into the
main Trapper Keeper library and that's
used for parsing config files there's a
web server service and this is outside
of the main trap paper library it's
something you can use if you want and
that allows you to easily add a ring
handler or servlet to easily set up a
web application we also have built in an
end rapel service which is really useful
for debugging and what we'll talk about
in a little while is the RPC server
service which nathaniel rip so to
illustrate a little bit more some of
these features of Trapper Keeper we're
going to be using a demo application
that we wrote you can check out the code
at puppet labs Trapper Keeper demo on
github it runs a web server with a ring
application which responds now to a
caller in the URL in different languages
so it's a just pretty simple demo
application with cats because cats are
great so this is what kind of the core
functions of our application look like
we have a cat say which is an ASCII cat
and then
a French meow an Englishman meow a
Japanese meow which pull in from a
database kind of how to say meow in that
language and respond with you know meow
and whatever the caller is from the URL
so let's talk about what makes up a
service the first thing that you have
for a service is a protocol that
specifies the the API contract that that
service is going to have and you have
the functions that implement that
protocol you have the life cycle of the
service again what happens when it's
initialized when it started when it
stopped you have the config for that
service typically what it pulls in from
a config file as well as the config that
says what service is to actually run and
then you have a service context which is
a way for a service to store an access
state rather than having it be globally
defined so each service has its own
context which means that you're not
having this kind of global state
everywhere so protocols define an API
contract and you can have any number of
implementations of that contract and
then Trapper Keeper allows you to
through a config file select different
implementations of that contract of that
protocol at runtime so for us are a
protocol defining our meow service is
just a single function and that takes a
collar so the first implementation of
Romeo service and it is an English meow
service so we're going to have multiple
implementations of our meow service in
different languages of meowing this is a
really contrived example you probably
wouldn't write a service that is is
saying how to me how as a cat but just
for the purposes of this this talk but a
better example might be as i talked
about our web server service
we have a jetty 9 implementation of it
and we have a jetty 7 implementation of
it and you can easily use either of
those by just changing a config file we
could also conceivably have a tomcat
implementation of a web server service
we don't yet but there's no reason why
not to so long as it fulfilled that
contract specified in the protocol so in
this example you can see we have our
redefine as a with the trapper keeper
def service a meow English service it
implements the meow service protocol it
has an init function which gets from the
config a database path and it
associate's that into the service
context for use by other functions and
then it has so then it has a meow
function so this is its implementation
of that meow specified in the protocol
and in this case it's using the English
mail function another implementation is
the French meow service which is a
similar thing it specifies an init so
this is one of the lifecycle functions
which can be optin optionally define
that for the service or not and then
again you have the me how function in
this case the French meal so services
typically have dependencies on each
other this is what our web service looks
like this is what is actually calling
that meow function and adding it to a
ring handler to make a web application
and you'll see here that that a list
right below the meow web service def
service is list the config service which
we use get in config from that and the
web server service and then the meow
service itself so this is how we specify
service dependencies and what we're
actually using is we use prismatic graph
library which is part of a prismatic
plumbing to build out a graph of the
service dependencies and then we call
those in order so you'll see here we
have specified uninit and a start for
this function and because this function
depends on the config service and then
the web server service and the meow
service all the the in its for each of
those other services will be called
before the in it for this service and
the same with the start so that's where
how we're able to handle the life cycle
well and make sure that our application
starts up and shuts down correctly and I
should say and we don't have the stop
implemented here and you don't have to
the service doesn't have to implement
every single part of the life cycle but
then stop gets called in the reverse
order of dependencies and I'm not sure I
said this but the syntax there for
specifying what are the service
dependencies is prismatic graphs
destructuring syntax so this route as
mentioned a number of times the
configuration is really important in a
trapper keeper app it's how you decide
what services are going to be included
when you start up a chopper keeper
process when you start up at jbm and it
also decides what are the configurations
of your various services like host names
and ports and file paths and database
information things like that so we kinda
have this notion of those two different
kinds of config files we've got
bootstrap files Curtis list of services
and we've got configuration files so for
the configuration files and we support a
number of different formats we've kind
of standardized on this forum are called
Hoch on which I was very you know
suspicious of this at first it was new
and shiny which are usually terrible
things but it's actually wonderful it's
a superset of JSON it adds human
friendly features like comments and just
in general has been a really great
config format for us so all of our
trapper keeper services are configured
in hook on but you can use JSON edn good
ol ini files properties files and we
recently had a community contribution to
support y mo so what a trapper keeper
does is you can either when you start up
a trapper keeper application either
pointed at a single config file or a
directory full of config files and so
these files are going to look something
like this they're going to be a series
of keys and maps of actual config
information and so all of these various
keys will be sloped up from whatever
config files Trapper Keeper finds and
then merge into one big config map that
you can then pull into your service
using the configuration service so here
you see we've got some global config
which is setting up some logging the
actual loggin config we just rely on log
back XML files and after that a web
server config so here you are defining
one web server we could be defining
multiple but here we're just defining 12
house are awesome meowing API and then
finally it config stanza for the actual
mail service so in this case our only
config information is what I like to
call the web scale me 0 DB which is just
a flat file that has mappings from
language to how you save me out on that
language as we said this is a pretty
contrived example but the idea here is
to show how to kind of do database
connection at a higher level and then
store that kind of state in a context as
opposed to in a global or you know
reconnecting from more core logic code
so this is the other config file that I
mentioned this is a bootstrap file so
this file is what actually decides what
services get picked up and then loaded
into your Trapper Keeper app the order
is totally relevant here the actual load
order for these services the order in
which in it and starts are called that's
all decided on by the dependencies
between your services so these look like
kind of there in order but they're no
they're not it can be it can be anything
so the syntax here is a fully qualified
path to the the symbol that can
contains a reified Trapper Keeper
service so here you'll see we're loading
our meow web service that's the one that
Ruth just showed you it adds a ring
handler to a running a jetty web server
in order to do that we need the jetty
service we're choosing to use j9 here
and then there's also a web browsing
service we're not going to go into that
but that just adds a little bit of
abstraction on top of the jetty server
itself so that you can do URL routing
directly to services in useful ways and
then finally down at the bottom here's
what we're actually picking what meow
implementation we want so here we're
going to go with Japanese but we could
also activate English or French so one
important distinction to note here is
that when we're defining a service this
kind of two ways to think about it
there's the name of the protocol for
meow service it's just meow service and
then there's the name of the actual an
actual reified implementation so in this
file we're always referring to a
specific implementation but elsewhere
inside of Trapper Keeper we're usually
just referring to the protocol which we
also call the service ID because we
don't usually care in at runtime what
service what what implementation you've
actually loaded that's that's irrelevant
it's literally an implementation detail
we just care about the surface I do so
in the bootstrap file that's when you
will have to pay attention to what your
symbols are actually called so here you
see an invocation of line run so if
you're in a trapper keeper project your
main function is set to a main provided
by chopper keeper which does all of the
happy service magic for you and you can
see we're specifying that config file
can victim and a bootstrap file so
you'll note with the logging here things
happen in the order that we expect first
we initialize our kind of core business
logic service mail service we see that
it's happening in English then the web
servers come up and then the mia web
service which will add handlers to that
web service and then finally at the end
of all that we we get some logging that
we can go hit our API and get some some
cat talk so there thursday in action so
if i go back and edit my bootstrap
config and comment out the line for
english meow uncomment line for french
meow we get cat french instead so
without any change to the code
we've got this different behavior coming
out of our our service our application
rather so with testing we definitely
recommend writing all of your actual
business logic and just normal closure
functions that maybe except a database
handle that's stored in a context and
then you know passed into your business
logic but the idea is that you're going
to be unit testing a lot of that stuff
but it's also a really good idea to do a
general integration testing on your
Trapper Keeper applications so it would
be really tedious if to do that you were
starting up and killing a whole JVM just
to swap out services or things like that
moreover when you're debugging you don't
want to have to do that so hyper keeper
provides some great helper utilities in
the form of macros to programmatically
start and stop chopra keeper
applications from your test code you can
just have a list of service symbols that
you pass in as opposed to a flat file
and you can just write configuration and
just as a pure closure map and then
manipulate that as needed so there's an
example of the kind of integration test
you know I might write so what this is
doing is the normal closure test and
what I want to do here is test the
behavior of each implementation of meow
service so I start by making these pairs
of sound to service symbol and I'm going
to loop over this pairs I'm going to
start a trapper keeper app each time
with the different services so in this
instance I'm only starting at my appt
with the mail service I'm not testing
Jodie here I'm just testing our army out
logic so you'll know the without with
config macro provided by trapper keeper
the first argument is a symbol to which
the Trapper Keeper app will actually be
bound in the body of your test and
you'll use that to get various bits of
information out of the running Trapper
Keeper application the next argument is
a list of service symbols in this case
it's wherever we are in our loop after
that we have our configuration map here
we're only starting up one service so I
only pass a config with the stanza for
mail service I could specify a different
path to
a different database or something if I
wanted and then finally I get a
reference to the service via the app
symbol that we just made you'll note
that that keyword colon mail service
that's what I refer to as the service I
do you earlier subset we find the
reified service in a running Trapper
Keeper app and then finally I actually
just just called the meow function so I
refer to that meow function that's just
a regular closer closure function that I
pull in and when i call it i pass it
that reified service as its first
argument so this is just like calling a
protocol function with any reified thing
that's that's definitely what we're
doing under the hood so I'd loop through
each of those i make sure i get back the
sound that I expect and we're all good
so if you want to get started and write
your own a trapper keeper application or
you just want to explore Trapper Keeper
a little bit more we have a line Trapper
Keeper template so all you have to do is
write line is type line new Trapper
Keeper and then a name and this will set
up for you a fully working stubbed
application which sets up a sample web
server with routing and it has a little
test suite it's similar to our trapper
keeper demo application that we've used
in fact that was sort of the basis for
this demo added some stuff but it's a
nice way to see how you could set up
your own web application using trapper
keeper and sort of see how dependencies
between Trapper Keeper services work it
also provides some repple utilities for
you and so this is something that's
pretty heavily influenced by again
Stuart Sierra's closure related workflow
and in fact if you look in the line
template and what it gives you in dev
users at clj you notice a lot of
similarities to what he kind of
published in his blog post so this gives
you the ability to start and stop and
inspect Trapper Keeper applications from
the repple and to do hot code reloading
so that you don't have to when you make
some changes to your code you don't have
to restart the entire JVM you can see
those changes much faster
so this is what happens in the repple if
we want to start up our demo application
we just call go which calls the in it
and start functions of the service life
cycles and so you'll see here that were
initializing our meow service and
Japanese and start up the whole
application and we also have a some nice
utility functions for printing out the
context so that's the service context it
where so in this case we've stored for
the meow service the kind of database
flat file which just has the how to say
meow in French and English and Japanese
so imagine between that slide in this
slide I've gone and changed some things
I've gone and added the Unicode Japanese
for the logging and then I just called
reset and that restarted my Trapper
Keeper application without having to
shut down the JVM so as could pretty
quickly see what actually changed there
and then I can just call stop to shut
down my Trapper to keep your application
so that's kind of a general introduction
to trapper keeper um I'm going to pass
it over to Nate and he's gonna show off
the Trapper Keeper RPC library he wrote
well so I'm one of the original kind of
kind of dreams of chopper keeper was
this notion that we can make these
really useful decisions about
infrastructure without actually changing
any code we can just do these things
from config files so one of it one of
the things that you get with this kind
of consistent protocol different
implementations as you can have an
implementation of the service that for
all intents and purposes looks like
local code could functions you're just
calling in whatever process you've just
started but is actually using say like
HTTP under the hood to call out to some
other Trapper Keeper service somewhere
else on different host and then getting
results back and you could swap out kind
of this local in this remote
implementation as desired so the example
that we're going to look through here is
taking our meow by the sir
and we're going to offload the
computational overhead of actually
meowing which if it's as hard as you
know most cats make any action to seem
that's pretty hard so we're going to
we're going to run our actual mail
service on a different JVM but we're
going to keep our HTTP server on the JVM
well I guess they're all new on another
day BM and so to make this easy i wrote
this library that provides a couple of
things to automate a lot of that so the
trapper keeper RPC library it provides
to two things it provides an actual
Trapper Keeper service that starts up an
RPC server so this server just it's
currently just http-based and you
configure it by saying like here's where
my code lives and then it knows how to
when it gets a request for an RPC call
look up the definition for that code
call it and then ship the result back
the library also provides a macro for
automatically generating an RPC ified
implementation of an existing Trapper
Keeper service so if you've already
defined one service you can use this
macro to just transparently and
automatically get a remote version that
you can then included in bootstrap CFG
all these examples are over just plain
HTTP but the library fully supports
https and you can it use a certificate
whitelisting to manage the inter-service
communication and you can have a
different wait list per service that you
expose from a given jetty so it's a
pretty fine grained authentication model
so here's an example of using the deaf
remote service macro so this is the same
protocol up top that we saw earlier the
meow service protocol and so we can
create the remote version by Conda tough
remote service macro with a service
symbol again this is what you refer to
you from a bootstrap CFG and then
whatever service protocol you want to
use to generate your new implementation
and then a list of functions we're not
doing anything interesting here we only
have one function to to you know RPC if
I but we could also pass options here in
this form
we're not doing this example options
like function retrying in timeout and
stuff like that so on the Trapper Keeper
application that's going to act as the
RPC server we'd have a configuration
like this so we're still just setting up
one web server but now it's called RPC
and it's running on a different port and
then down on the RPC config block we
list out the services that we're going
to expose in this case it's just a meow
service we tell trapper we tell the RPC
service how to actually find the code
you want to call there's no automatic
discovery here and so this is like the
programmer has to go and say you know in
the config file this is exactly where
the protocol is defined that I want you
to use to call functions as the RPC
server on the Trapper Keeper application
that's going to act as the RPC client we
have a pretty much the same we have the
exact same shape of the config but here
we don't care about namespaces because
all of our code will be executed
remotely we instead care about what
endpoint to use so here we're just
referring to the end point that we just
configured the jetty in the server to
listen to so this is what our bootstrap
that CFG looks like for the the TCAP
that's acting as the client so we're
still starting up jetty because we're
going to accept HTTP calls and we're so
we're including Army our web service as
well but down at the bottom you'll know
that I've added a new service symbol
here I've added the remote meow service
so on the client side I no longer care
what language things are going to come
back in because that's up to the RPC
server to decide what I'm going to do is
I'm going to call the exact same code
I'm not going to change my code at all
but Trapper Keeper this implementation
is going to ship my call over the wire
for me over on the server and we're just
starting up the bare minimum to run RPC
server a subsidy RPC server service a
jetty and here we actually pick what
what concrete miao language we want so
here we're going to pick romantic French
on the on the server so I'm going to
actually do a quick demo
which is you know not the best idea in
the world but I'm going to go for it so
first what I'll do is a start up a kind
of stand-alone all-in-one Trapper Keeper
app so there's no RPC here and these
little scripts here all these are I'll
cat one real fast these are just
invocations of line run so the scripts
aren't aren't doing anything special
there's just line run pointing at
different bootstrap and config files so
I'll run the standalone one first ignore
the line noise from line line line noise
hahahahaha all right we'll do some
curling as cats like to do okay so
you'll see and we've started up all of
our services our service said bonjour to
us that's cool and now we're listening
at localhost 8080 so will curl that sure
enough we get back I'm yeah so that's
everything is normal you see over here
on the in the log output we see handling
requests for for caller world and then
we see meowing in French so that's the
HTTP API server accepting a request and
then our actual core service doing some
meowing so now what I'm gonna do instead
is run an RPC client Trapper Keeper
application in this window here and over
here I'm going to run a server
so you'll note on the client side we
don't we no longer see the bonjour of
initial as the mail service anymore all
the only email service we have on that
side is just that that thin remote call
proper implementation whereas ever on
the server side we see at the bottom of
the log here we're actually sitting at
the mail service so let's go back up
here will curl again we get the exact
same result back but now we see in the
client application there's that web
request and then over in the server
application the actual meowing is
happening there so now we can mean we
can keep the web server Trapper Keeper
application up and running we could have
we could we can now we only have to
worry about starting and stopping the
kind of server JVM to swap
implementations which is a nice bonus
and like I said we're now able to
distribute that computational load
across different hosts kill these off
cool so we don't have to use my backup
bootleg screenshots that I made just in
case I officer I only selected one
window
so some of the features that we're
working on right now for this library is
instead of us are already using a
persistent HTTP client for each of these
services to make their RPC calls we're
working instead on actual persistent
connections so what we're going to try
to do and this isn't done yet I don't
know if this will be viable work we're
looking at using SSL / WebSockets so
that an RPC client service can just open
a persistent connection to a server and
just send function calls down the wire
and I'll note we're actually using a
message pack in transit as I
serialization format which is worked out
really well for us we want to add metric
reporting so every time you make an RPC
call you get some data back but how long
it took stuff like that and then some of
the things we want to add to the
detriment service macro I'm in terms of
what it supports and the clients that
are things like i mentioned function
we're trying retrying and some kind of
transparent load balancing we don't know
the best way to architect that just yet
so that's all I have on the RPC library
like I said we demoed this just because
we think it's an interesting thing but
that you can now do given this kind of
split protocol and implementation
paradigm there are definitely other
closure RPC libraries out there this
isn't really intended to replace those
this is an adaptation of the RPC model
to trapper keeper specifically so if
your if your fish shaky about why we
didn't use some RPC library or another
just shake that fist right at me and
tell me why I should use it and we might
totally use it under the hood the
important thing for us is this really
nice Trapper Keeper interface and macro
interface to doing this kind of stuff so
that's all we've got if you want to
learn more about Trapper Keeper we have
really wonderful and extensive
documentation up on a github wiki so you
can check that out there the meow
service demo that we use throughout
that's also up on github as Ruth
mentioned so you can go / crown at that
and so you see what we were doing and
the RPC library also is is open source
on to the puppet labs namespace as well
we who use Trapper Keeper hangout on
freenode so come say hello we're really
excited for people to use this framework
and contribute
so yeah come say hi thanks very much
they may have any questions at all not
sure how much time we have yeah so the
question was do you have any support for
dynamically reloading configs in the
lifecycle functions as far as i know
that is not a feature that exists right
now but it is definitely a useful
feature but yeah it's not one that we
currently support yeah
yeah yeah so the question is um do you
have to use line or can you actually
like make a jar and then and run that
with Java absolutely so that's how we
deploy all of our stuff so you know one
of the things that we do with Trapper
Keepers we write services that are
delivered on premise and so we just we
just compile jars and then we ship those
directly to customers and then yeah
those are just run against Java so yeah
we definitely support that we're just
using line for development yeah
so the question is um does the bootstrap
file influence what gets compiled that's
a great question it doesn't say all the
all the services are going to get going
to get compiled for sure yeah the
bootstrap file is just use at runtime by
by a trapper keeper yeah we don't do any
kind of optimization like that yeah yeah
so i'm pretty sure that falls under the
kind of optional dependency kind of like
the question is what happens if one
specific implementation just needs
something that the other informations
don't is that kind of what you're asking
here you know that's not a case that
really comes up that much for us I don't
have a great answer do you have any I
guess I would say to that probably um
you could put that into the config file
and you know other implementations
wouldn't use it but the implementation
that does need it can use it be probably
my answer yeah one picture we're working
on is optional dependencies so I guess
what you could do is you know to say you
know there's this server or this this
dependency that I that this one
implementation has is optional for the
other ones and then model it that way
but that's that's one of those features
were currently working anything else
cool thank you all so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
