closure because obviously if you're here
you obviously think it's a good idea
probably so I'm not going to go through
the reasons why we picked closure and
why we thought it would be valuable for
our business instead what I want to talk
about here is the steps that I felt like
were valuable for me to go through and
for our team as we were implementing
closure and as we were training the rest
of the developers in our office so
really this is gonna focus on not so
much that very first person saying yes
let's try a small project let's try unit
tests you know let's try a deployment
task really what I want to focus on here
is after you get that first other person
in your office who says all right let's
give it a shot
what are you gonna do so that at the end
of that project they want to continue to
use it because I really think like if if
most people they go on YouTube they
watch through the videos about closure
they've read about closure usually they
have some good ideas that oh this is a
very powerful language that can give us
a lot of value but when they get started
it's it's hard to stick with it I think
because it does have a steep learning
curve and so I really think once you've
got that first person to say yes let's
try it in our office that period of a
week or a month or the first six months
is absolutely critical to whether or not
you're going to continue using it at
least those are my conclusions so I want
to know first how many of you use
closure professionally right now okay so
more than half I would say maybe 60% now
how many of you want to use it
professionally the other half about
right so and well what and don't already
do it right yeah that would be it so now
the real question is how many of you
feel ready that if Monday someone came
to you and said all right we're gonna
use closure
can you teach the rest of the team how
many of you would feel ready to do that
Monday a much smaller percentage right
maybe only 10 15 percent now that's
exactly where I was when I came to conch
two years ago
and when I came to cons I was like wow
closure is so cool this is such a fun
language but it's also very very
powerful but I only kind of knew it
pretty well like I knew it well enough
to go through Coty's
I knew it well enough to sit at the
repple and be able to solve most simple
problems but there was actually a point
at which I was I was pairing with the
co-worker of mine and he said oh we're
gonna do this new little thing do you
think closure would be a good choice for
it and I kind of froze for a second
because I didn't know it that well I
think I think it is but I'm not entirely
sure and I was nervous about it and I
really i wuold at the point I was like
well let's just you know let's just do
it in c-sharp because that's what we
know and we'll carry on and like at that
moment it really hit me you know like
wow I'm really not ready to be the
person that could introduce this at my
work like I really need to put more work
and more dedication and time in to the
point where I could have confidently
said yeah I know exactly this is the
right choice and I can explain to you
exactly why it's the right choice and I
have a good idea how to get from zero to
60 so what I did then was that was kind
of a wake-up call and it's funny because
I'm sure the co-workers gonna watch this
video easy but I don't remember that at
all because it was you know a two
sentence exchange we had for five
minutes but that really stuck out to me
that I wasn't ready myself to introduce
it and so what I decided to do was said
well I'm gonna get really good at it so
I spent a bunch of time learning closure
I spent a bunch of time I went through
sicp the computer science book and over
about 400 hours of working in closure
working through all the exercises and
sicp
and then also I taught a number of
meetups in closure so I started to get
to the place where I was actually
teaching others because I find that as a
very useful way to learn so then finally
I guess about a year ago we needed to do
a new project and it had to work either
on the JVM or it had to be Ruby or it
had to be no js' and at the time we're a
dotnet shop one guy knew Ruby we kind of
knew JavaScript but not very well
and one guy knew Scala one guy knew Java
and I knew closure and there was just
three of us we're gonna do this for
together and at that point in time I was
like you know what I actually no closure
well enough that I could actually feel
confident teaching the other the two of
you enough to get we could get from zero
to 60 and we could actually implement
this and I've done a lot of work on I've
done a lot of preparation and I've
taught a lot of other people already so
that was kind of a no-brainer they said
oh that's okay once you can do it it's
great and and you can see the relief in
their faces because it was like the one
guys like I don't really want to have to
be the point person the other guys I
don't wanna have to be the point person
so we we sat down and month one we
knocked out prototyping closure and it
was very successful it did exactly what
it needed to do anymore and then at the
end of that month and this is where I
consider it to be a success story
because I don't think just developing
something in closure for a month it's
really a success story
but the success story is at the end of
that month they wanted to keep using it
and the both of them who had never seen
it before
a month later said yeah actually I
prefer this to Ruby I prefer this to
Java I prefer this to JavaScript let's
keep using it and that was the success
and then we we worked on that product
the second one for for a couple of
months and it was it was very successful
I think we ended up stopping to work on
other business priorities and then a
couple months ago where we had merged
and now there's nine of us on the team
and we had to do another very quick
prototype and both of them were like we
should do in closure like they
remembered how fun it was they
remembered how powerful it was and so
they were like convincing the other
people all guys we should use closure we
did it last time it was really
successful let's do it again and now
recently we we need to do another JVM
project and we as a group got together
and the nine people said you know what
for the JVM we really want to use
closure now all nine people are on board
all nine people think it's a good idea
so for a technical stack change I mean a
massive one moving from C sharp and and
Windows development to now closure on
the JVM is a huge change and I've seen a
bunch of changes like this that were
successful and then I've also seen a
bunch that we're really not successful
so this to me was very successful like
we showed it to people we got them
interested they started working hard on
it and then they
to continue using it so what I think
what I wanted to talk about now is what
I consider the things that made that
first month successful and and really
even the first week because after the
first week on we started on Monday said
we're gonna time box it for a week we'll
see how this goes with closure and if
it's if it's going really rough like we
you know we could muddle through with
rails right we could probably do with
rails and even after the end of that
first week the vote was let's keep doing
it it's fun we think it's powerful let's
keep keep with it so I have really like
five things that I feel like made us
successful just in that first week where
it was like it's a success story where
they wanted to continue to use it so
really the the first suggestion and and
it's kind of a non-standard one and
probably not what you would expect I
would say is I really think it was the
fact that I had a lot of empathy for
them when we started this project now if
I was listening to be like empathy what
on earth does that have to do with
closure it is it is not technical at all
it's a sociological thing but but really
if you can put yourself in the shoes of
the other two guys and like I would I
thought of it from this point of view is
like well what really intimidates me and
I'm kind of in you know if they say in
the adapter sanction where there's like
there's the 25% of most people who are
like really early adopters there's about
50 percent who kind of go with the herd
and there's about 25% who want to
continue to use the same thing until
they absolutely have to change I'm kind
of in that 25 percent I want to keep
learning new things and adopting new
technologies but so I was thinking well
what would intimidate me it probably
would be something like sales it'd
probably be a marketing cold calls to
clients child care these things would
intimidate me right if if my job if I
went in on Monday my boss said all right
Steve four days a week I need you to do
childcare for the other developers I
would kind of feel short-changed i what
what like I I'm not good at that I don't
like that like that's that's not why I
was hired and I would I would feel
really and probably a little bit hostile
right I'd say like wow I've spent my
whole career becoming an excellent
software engineer why do you want me to
do childcare
that's not what I was hired for that's
not where my skills lie and the thing is
I I'm absolutely convinced there are a
number of developers who feel the exact
same way about learning a new
programming language that they they
would consider that the most
intimidating thing they can do with
their job would be to learn a new
programming language and while they I
mean I've heard the arguments I'm sure
you've heard it too it's like well I've
spent my whole career becoming an
excellent Java developer I know Java
backwards and forwards all the libraries
all the ins and outs I don't want to
throw that away or I've spent my entire
career being an excellent ruby developer
why would I want to throw those skills
away to just learn a new language and
there's that fear there and there's I
think there's that fear that all those
skills that they spent learning are now
gonna be useless and and are not gonna
carry over in any way now I would say if
you if you know closure there's probably
a good chance you know another language
too and so you probably realized that
that a lot of those skills are gonna
carry over if you're an excellent Java
developer you probably already know
maybe six of ten or seven of ten of the
really major concepts you need to be a
good closure developer but if you only
know Java or you and only know Ruby or
rather even if you're just afraid you
probably don't realize that and you
probably don't realize how intimidating
that that seems and so if if you get
that first person to say yes and even if
they're a really early adopter they're
already willing to be super
uncomfortable to kind of meet you in the
middle right like they're already
compromising to say I'm willing to take
all the skills I know and be instead of
being the like the master on this
project I'm gonna be the learner and so
they're already coming to a place where
they're gonna be very uncomfortable and
I think having empathy for that and for
that position that they've put
themselves in and the trust that they've
put in you is extraordinarily important
and it the thing is I led with empathy I
have other more concrete suggestions but
that one I think actually if you have a
strong sense of empathy for the people
you're working with and like compassion
for the fact that they've come to that
midpoint it's gonna affect every single
decision you make along the way so so
that's that's step one right have
empathy for the people the next thing is
I would say because now concretely
you have to teach these people and
really I think you've got day one are
they gonna turn away on day one and then
week one those two are extremely that's
at the time frame I think where most
people are gonna say let's just go back
to Ruby let's just go back to c-sharp we
know that and I think that there's three
major things you should probably show or
teach in just that first day I would say
the first thing would be you want to
teach the repple and the repple workflow
and specifically the repple workflow of
being able to go into your editor and
evaluate a single s-expression I think
that one thing not only is completely
unusual and and really can't be had many
other languages but it's going to give
them the tools they need to be able to
teach themselves a lot of the other
concepts because if you can quickly look
at that 1s expression you can evaluate
it and you can see what it does when you
could do anything you could learn every
other piece of thing about closure just
from that one little tool and it's
something that on day one they need to
learn that's a learning tool right there
I'd say the second thing would be the
fact that closure has world-class unit
testing now it's not a cultural thing to
do a lot of unit testing in closure but
if you're coming from JavaScript if
you're coming from Ruby or if you're
coming from Java they're probably coming
from a really strong unit testing
culture and being able to very quickly
on day one you know hour one say here's
how you do a unit test look how crazy
easy it is that's a huge deal and I
think that's gonna that's gonna sell
people right off the bat be like oh wait
the thing I'm comfortable with a unit
testing culture where I'm building up
these unit tests and executing them look
how easy it is I can very very quickly
do that and then the other thing which
is a bit unusual is something like
prismatic schema because if you're
coming from Ruby or Java you're used to
being able to define that data structure
and being able to see what it looks like
if you have that single representation
of it I think something like prismatic
schema it doesn't hurt your code in any
way it's actually quite valuable but
it's also a quick way you can say look
you want to define a data structure just
do it like this and not only that while
you're in there I would show them the
dependent typing kind of 8020 value rule
where you could say all right not only
can I say I have a string for a person's
name but every time it goes into a
function every time it comes out in a
unit test it has to be capitalized or
every time I have a number here it has
to be an odd number like that's that's
crazy not only you're defining your
shape but you're also
the contents that's very very powerful
and something that they wouldn't
wouldn't see anywhere else really so of
those three things we just check out the
repple show them the unit tests and show
them something like schema for a run
time-dependent typing highly valuable
the thing I would not focus on on day
one or week one or really even month one
is look how terse closure can be and
let's play like closure golf and try to
do this this amazing amount of logic in
the smallest number of characters that I
think is that's like advanced and that's
something that really is stylistic like
it doesn't affect the code quality
really it doesn't affect the fact that
the code is tested or that it's bug free
it really is kind of a stylistic thing
that I think once you get comfortable
with how terse it can be you can write
very small and very easy to read code if
you know how to read it so that's one
thing I would say like save that for
later like it's more fun and I found it
really more fun when learning closure to
kind of play with the brevity play with
the really strongly functional parts
that let you write really turists code
once I was learning it and once I was a
little bit farther down the road that
was kind of fun to discover on my own if
somebody had been shoving it down my
throat early I would have just gotten
confused and frustrated and then what I
probably also wouldn't focus on and I
made this mistake was core async on day
one is a bit much and you know I was
excited because I'm like oh look at this
look at all the cool things like all the
cool things and the core async it's fun
and and that was just one concept too
many I think and it's if you have a code
base that has that needs those kinds of
that parallelism fantastic and you can
introduce it on you know week two but
day one week one I would say let's just
focus on the basics let's focus on the
unit testing and the rebel and getting
that down pat really quickly so so
that's it so now I've got the next thing
I would say is you need to be ready to
compromise yes no there's no slides I'm
scrolling through my thing so the other
thing is I think you should be ready to
compromise on everything and and by that
I would say when I say everything it's
with an asterisk everything that doesn't
affect like production code quality
so one of the things that I think is
important to be able to compromise on is
like what editors you use and like
whether or not you're going to be using
what shortcuts you're using and whether
or not you're using pair programming or
not like those are three things right
off the bat that can make or break the
difference between how comfortable
someone feels as they're learning it and
I actually specifically for shortcuts so
we this was a mistake
I think we made which is we used Emacs
and we use Emacs with evil mode and
that's that's a big pill to swallow on
day one and I remember on day two I was
like there this is this is not gonna
work like we gotta come up with
something better and I ended up going
through and changing all the Emacs in
evil mode shortcuts so that they matched
what we had in visual studio and that
was fantastic
Oh once we did that everything worked
just fine because and and I could see
like if somebody told me that about your
that's ridiculous why would you do that
but really the reason I did that was so
that that's just one less thing they
have to worry about like I don't want
people to have to think like oh where do
I find a file oh how do i how do I
evaluate this function or like how do I
look up a definition or how do I see
Doc's those things I don't want those to
be things people are thinking about like
I want them to be focusing on just
writing code being productive and
working at the repple and something
that's as simple as a shortcut does it
affect code quality in no way does it
does Emacs versus cursive affect code
quality not at all and it's something
that I should be willing to compromise
on if I want that this actually to
succeed is an endeavor another thing
really was pair programming that's
something that a lot of times people
find very uncomfortable and a lot of
times on both sides if you're the
trainer or if the learner it can be very
uncomfortable to do pair programming but
those first I think the first week we
did four hours in the morning I would do
it the one guy and four hours in the
afternoon with the other guy and we just
paired back and forth and it I think
made a huge difference just for them to
feel productive like we're gonna get
things done they would come up with
questions in the four hours and then in
the next four hours they would get them
answered so it's very quick very small
feedback loop and it let them I think
feel a lot more empowered so if you're
compromising on everything I think you
should also try to make everything easy
and I would say like again they should
not have to think about the basics the
fun
mentals they should not have to think
about like how to get friend working
with ring and composure for example
which was something that I was
struggling with at the time and they
were just so confused because like the
guys at the time they're thinking like
how do I make a function how do I get
you know how do I deal with immutability
and I'm like alright if I've got this
ring route and it works - it was way too
much for them this is I end up having to
just do it myself and I think building
up those foundational parts at least
knowing how to do them before you start
a project like this is extraordinarily
helpful there was a couple of sections
specifically I was struggling with like
composure ring and friend and getting it
working with OAuth and so for me that
first week that was the first time I'd
ever done that and I had these guys
asking me all these questions so if I
had had a better idea before I got
started on that project exactly how I'd
have gotten through it it made it a lot
easier a couple things that bit me I
think was I didn't really understand how
to deploy closure despite the fact that
I spent all this time working on it I'd
never actually really deployed it
anywhere and seen it in any kind of a
production environment so that was a big
thing that I was struggling with that
first week while also we were trying to
learn the language itself using Emacs I
really should have knowing my audience
and having empathy for them I what I
should have done was say hey we use
visual studio all the time why don't we
just use cursive with visual studio
keybindings because that is the most
comfortable most closest thing they
would have to you know the visual
debugger that the project view on the
side and just the explorable GUI menus
it's perfect for that and if you're you
really used to an IDE and you're the
group you're working with is used to an
ID go with an IDE even if it's less
comfortable for you like I really should
have been willing to compromise on that
and say let's just use cursive and what
in the end we ended up doing that anyway
it was just there was like three or four
weeks of churn of Emacs doesn't quite
working the way I expect and then
finally it's like let's just use closure
or cursive and it was a huge success
because of that another thing that I
think was really valuable was we're
providing a style guide really early on
just to say like so you don't have to
think about where how do you format my
code here's a style guide we can come to
a better style guide later but it just
here's my recommendation we'll just
start with
and then in the future we could change
so we're gonna have empathy right we're
gonna energize on the high value things
really really early and then also you as
the person who's bringing that needs to
be ready to compromise on anything
that'll make it easier for them the next
thing I think you really need to be
willing to do is to separate your ego
from closure and that that's strange
because you said like well I've oh my my
egos not tied up with closure you may
think so until the very first time
someone says this sucks I hate closure
it's so much easier in Ruby and then
suddenly you're like what no quarters
right you're dumb and you're getting to
an argument with somebody and you're
like whoa why did I get to an argument
with somebody like it the truth of the
matter is for their skill level and Ruby
and for their skill level in closure it
would have been easier in Ruby for them
that's truth they're just telling me how
they feel why would I get angry at them
for that now the fact of the matter is
if they were equally skilled in both
perhaps closure would come out on top in
a lot of circumstances I think it would
but like you need to be willing to hear
criticism about closure the language and
you need to be willing to hear criticism
about how things are not working right
how everything is your fault because if
we weren't we weren't using closure we
wouldn't have this problem and just let
it roll off and like I think that's a
really hard part is to say I want to
introduce something because really your
your reputation is kind of tied to it
right if you suggest to wait let's use a
new language let's use a new stack your
reputation to some extent it's gonna be
tied to it if it's really successful
you'll look good if it's really if it
doesn't go well you'll look poor but the
same sense the language itself that you
didn't write it right like we're just
using it as a tool I'm a few people in
the audience probably wrote it but for
the most of us we're just using it as a
tool and we need to be willing to accept
that you know what sometimes it's not
perfect and sometimes it doesn't work in
every circumstance the way that you
would want and that's okay and a friend
of mine really the guy that was on the
team it was it's a good thing that he
was on a team or we're because he had
showed me this exact same thing a couple
years ago when I would here now working
on a ruby project was like my first Ruby
project I was like 10 days in I had no
idea
I was doing and and something went
really badly and with one of the gems I
still don't have any idea what was wrong
with it and I didn't know what bundler
was I didn't know what gem lock files
were and I was completely out of my
depth and I had to change a library
because a version conflict and I said
alright well like I spent like hours and
hours and hours fighting with this thing
and I was so mad at some point and then
and finally like it came was like
something was like a zip library that it
did be renamed and now this is the wrong
version and so find out what to the dude
that was just like kind of how I only
serious I think this is your fault like
if we were to use a groovy I wouldn't
have this problem and rather than him
just be like what you're you don't know
anything got Ruby it's your fault like
if you were more skilled you wouldn't
have this problem instead he was really
gracious he just said oh you know what
like let me come help you out with it
like oh yeah it can be really
frustrating to use Ruby gems sure yeah
let's let me sit down with you and work
it out together and and like just seeing
him deal with that and like the flack
that like I was kind of kind of kidding
but I kind of wanted to see how he would
react he was very gracious and like that
really led me to trust him further in in
the work that we were working on so that
that idea if somebody is struggling with
something if somebody's complaining if
somebody is you know bashing it or
bad-mouthing the language and the
tooling or the way that you've set it up
I think it's really important to say
like yep sometimes it really is
frustrating and sometimes it really
doesn't work the way you'd expect and
let me come help you out or maybe they
don't have a legitimate problem maybe
they're just kind of frustrated in
general and need to vent okay cool what
yeah you're right that is frustrating
and just listen hear them out and let
them let them get through that so so
okay so we're gonna the last thing I
think is important is really that you
should probably be prepared before you
suggest that you could implement closure
as a project at your work and there was
a number of things that I wasn't
prepared for and really surprised me
that first week because I just really
had never actually deployed closure code
before so I really didn't even I didn't
even know how to really make a jar said
never really is Java before so I was
very confused about some of the
fundamental basics of the language that
I would have seen had I even deployed a
very simple you know even a hello world
web application I would have seen that
and that really was a due diligence due
diligence I should
have done so I really recommend like if
you're gonna do something like this I've
heard like sometimes people give advice
I think that says like well if you're
nervous about something or if you think
you might not know enough you know just
put yourself out there and you and just
figure it out and just go for it I think
that advice is valid and has its it has
its place but I also really don't think
that if if you've never really seen an
application deployed before if there's a
lot of things that if you try to think
like okay if I was gonna do it at my job
today
something something magic and then I
think it would work if you don't know
really that all the steps that you would
go through to build that application or
exactly how it would fit in take some
time to research those things usually
they're not very expensive but I think
it really would be it's kind of
dishonest to say like oh I'm ready to
implement closure I'm ready to teach
everyone well if you if you don't really
know and you don't really even have
opinions on some subjects so so really
those were the things that I think made
it very very successful or is like I
tried to have empathy for the two of
them and I think it showed through
because in every decision we made it was
very much trying to how can I make this
as easy for you as possible
how can we get obstacles out of your way
so that you can be productive and learn
it very quickly and early early on in
that first week we were energizing a lot
on those high-value concepts energizing
on the repple the unit testing and the
defendant typing and then really the the
fact that we were like I was trying to
be really ready to compromise on
anything and like anything that didn't
have to do with code quality fine we'll
compromise on it because it's more
important that they feel comfortable and
they are quickly able to get to be
productive than it is that I'm
comfortable like really if I'm
introducing it like I should be the most
uncomfortable person in the room I think
because I'm trying to do everything I
can to compromise for them and then also
I'm gonna be uncomfortable because I
need to separate my ego from closure I
need to separate my ego from the fact
that you know sometimes it really is
frustrating and sometimes things don't
make sense and sometimes the Arabs don't
make sense and that's gonna be okay and
I need to be willing to go there and
help them and hear that and not take
offense because it's very obvious if
somebody's complaining about closure
it's very hard to fake not being
offended you have to really just think
it's just is what it is let me come help
you and then also I need to be prepared
before I start these kinds of projects
in the future and between those five
things I think those really made the
huge difference for us being able to
take a project that in otherwise I think
I kind of suspect like if we hadn't done
those things as well what would have
happened would have been and I'd seen
this happen before with other languages
we'd get in there and we putter around
for a week and within the first week
people would be like no way we're going
back to what we know because we're just
gonna spend all this time thrashing
around no you're not gonna you're not
even helping us you're just being a jerk
it's like they need to be able to trust
the person who's leading that and they
do who would trust they're gonna get
what they need so I think this was very
successful when we adopted it there
we're still using it today we're able to
build our prototype very quickly and and
technically closure is excellent like I
think it's it's best-in-class for what
it does and so we were able to build
that very very quickly they were able to
learn it but also what I think the value
is is at the end they wanted to continue
using it they weren't using it because
they felt like they had to they actually
were able to recognize this is probably
the best choice for organization and
then also so much so that a year later
they wanted to continue use it and
continue to convince other people in the
office to use it so I think that's a
very powerful thing so in my office
we're still using closure today we use
it for I think it's the go tube now when
we ever we need to build something on
the JVM it's the go-to and I think right
now anytime we need to build anything in
Linux it's really the go-to so it's
either our normal net stack or closure
at this point I'm curious like does
anybody have any questions about this
yeah
I would say it was the tools initially
especially when we're using evil and
Emacs because the one guy didn't even
know vim and he was like but I want to
use it anyway it sounds cool it's really
fun and it's just it was a lot of churn
those first couple of weeks trying to
figure out just the tooling the language
I think they picked it up pretty quickly
actually and it's in this in a lot of
ways a lot of the concepts are very
simple and they can carry over from
things you already know so it's mostly
syntactical I think is that was the new
part for them that's a good point
um what we did was in the we went
through Coty's in the morning usually
and we didn't do it every morning and
they were they were always chomping at
the bit to do features but like we did
caught us a lot and so through those I
think they just kind of organically
defeat the like the different features
came out we didn't really follow like a
set a set program for like the basics I
think that the two of them are pretty
precocious and so there felt like they
were willing to just read through a lot
of the docs and just keep reading
through things on their own so I didn't
really provide any specific learning
material yes
the one guy well I think he's like 15 to
20 years and the other guy had five to
seven so and then of the nine that we'd
build the project a couple months ago it
was all the way from like a new co-op
all the way up to like 15 20 years so
yes okay yeah we it was a very much in
line with our existing domain so onto
that part first it and so that everyone
was very comfortable with the domain
already and it was a full stack web
application which we had some experience
building before but not a huge amount
necessarily and it was especially
unusual in this case because we were we
were deploying it on sort of a Heroku
competitor that IBM was building so it
was part of the the thing was to
showcase that so it was it did that as
well but then we also we explored a
bunch of concepts we're able to I feel
like because of closure we're actually
able to explore some concepts it would
have been very difficult otherwise
specifically we explored an event
sourcing architecture we were able to
say you like prop Phila
an event store full of events and then
have read databases populating off of
that because it had to be
extraordinarily high volume we did not
we just used we used JavaScript because
I didn't know and there's a good reason
where if I've been better prepared we
would have used closure script but
because I wasn't very well prepared on
it we're like let's just use JavaScript
so yeah yes
well okay so we we were doing primarily
c-sharp and we when we started using
this foreclosure we built the
applications and then built the
prototypes and the applications and then
when we went back to our c-sharp
application we were like we wouldn't use
f-sharp so we ended up which f-sharp is
is kind of like on the other side of the
typing chasm but it's very similar in a
lot of ways and it has the immutability
it has it's very functional and so we I
think most of us are using f-sharp where
we find it appropriate now for our
legacy application yes
yeah so that first person on board like
how to get that very first person to say
yes
I think is really the most important
thing is building trust and like it was
very easy I think for these guys we had
to write it wasn't it didn't it wasn't a
trust thing at all it was you have to
make something that works in this this
heroku like environment one way or the
other
and so we had to pick a new stack but I
really think in the cases where I've
seen it in the past it's it's sort of
finding like that one other person who's
gonna kind of be an ally with you and
usually in my case I find that like I
talked about the 25% of the early
adopters usually one of those early
adopters if you can find them
you say hey look at this cool thing it's
really neat and over time you could
probably find someone who'll say oh yes
let's give it a shot for this little
sliver somewhere or this little
deployment app or something and yeah
like how to get how to get them so yeses
of large topic but that's desert that
would be my my first pass on it yes
it's good advice anyone else yes sir so
at the time we were working for IBM and
my office has since been acquired by
another organization and we at the time
IBM was a very large company so there
wasn't really anybody who was curious
what we were using or doing I don't
think or or if there was they they never
asked so we didn't tell and at the time
that my organization is is very
self-organizing and democratic and so it
was at that in this in this instance it
really didn't have to convince anybody
at all it was if the developers think
it's the best choice then that's what we
use and if it if it meets the needs of
the business than it meets the needs of
the business I think in other other
places where I've seen it's it's really
it's a trust thing as well I think is
it's a case of building up that trust
with the people who are trying to drive
that idea forward yes sir
Ted cast keyword yeah so the the
question I guess was that can't cast
keyword too I seek or just any any
arcane error right
it didn't happen as much as I would have
thought and I think a really heavily
repple workflow is what prevented a lot
of that now I'm it can always absolutely
could happen somewhere else but I really
think that was a big thing that went and
it was it was really easy I think when
you're building it up out of these small
pieces and you're testing them in
isolation through the repple and and
with a strong unit testing culture it I
don't think we ever saw a problem that
took us more than a few minutes to fix
but that being said I think something
like prismatic schema really helps with
preventing the machinist of the closure
data structures where you can just say I
changed the data structure and you don't
necessarily know and now you're getting
back something different from what you
expected we ended up using that I
believe later on and it made a big
difference in preventing that those
sorts of errors I think so
any other questions okay so and actually
to answer to your point a little bit if
for that first part I ended up writing
up this story as well as I've got like
six other times of stories I've heard
about changing technical stacks and
whether or not they were successful or
not and then also a lot of my
recommendations for how to get that
first person to say yes I just wrote
that up into an e-book called convincing
coworkers so that's on lean pub if
you're interested in that is a lot more
information about getting that first
person to say yes and also how to do the
follow through that I covered in this
talk so thank you very much if anybody
else has any questions
