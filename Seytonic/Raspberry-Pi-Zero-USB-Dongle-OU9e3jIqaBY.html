to be looking at how you can turn a
Raspberry Pi 0 into a computer on a USB
stick something you'll be able to just
plug into your PC log into and use just
like as if it were a separate computer
there are several compute sticks already
out there that you can buy though
they're pretty pricy for what they are
so here I'm going to show you how you
can make something real similar for 5
percent of the price so let's get to it
right after this mult we know is an
open-source arduino based bad USB you
can use it to inject keystrokes at
lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper anything you
can do with the keyboard and 50 minutes
of your time molds we know can do in a
matter of seconds to find out more see
the IndieGoGo link in the description so
the idea and files for this projects
come from node if you have some really
cool stuff so I'll have his channel
links below I highly recommend it so
this is the resulting product the PI is
screwed in on the top and the slide out
USB ports allows you to connect it to
your PC where you can SSH into it as if
it were an Ethernet USB device or have a
VNC server running on it so you can
control it via a regular desktop
interface if you have a PI 0 W you could
just plug it into any power source and
have it connect to your wireless network
taking off the PI reveals the USB slider
mechanism and for pogo pins these make
contact with the Gould's pads on the
bottom of the PI positive negative data
plus and data - well Tony does this
allow you to power the PI but also tap
into the USB port here hence allowing
you to SSH into it although since you're
using the USB port for data you can't
use it for anything else however when
you want to use your PI 0 for something
else just unscrew it and get done the PI
0 itself is left unsalted both the PI 0
and the PI 0 W both have the same pad
placement on the bottom so you can ha
swap them out no problem in order to
make this you will need a PI 0 some pogo
pins wire USB breakout board and 2.5
nuts screws oh and a 3d printer to print
the case my pogo pins were slightly too
long and thick so I had to make the case
slightly thicker and the holes for the
pogo pins wider nodes github for the
files is linked below first step was to
strip the Y's and solder them to the
poker pins
pretty easy however I'd really highly
suggest if you're going to do this
yourself use smaller gauge wire as
stripping wire like this
is a nightmare i position-wise with some
blue tech and then just went over it
with some hot glue I found that using
hot glue straight off would just leave
the wise kind of bent and then you won't
be able to move them around afterwards
once the glue had set so I found this
was the best way so it's really quite
important you solder the correct Pogo
pin to the correct pads on the breakup
board here so if we look at the bottom
of a PI zero I'll show you what stuff is
so pp 1 is your 5 volts PP 6 is ground
PP 22 I believe is USB data + + PP 23 is
- so it should be labeled on your
breakout boards so you'll know what's
connect where right so once you've got
this all glued in and wired up there is
some assembly to do so if you've printed
all the STL files down in the
description you have 4 thingies you need
to take the one that looks like this
sorry about the different color long
story just slip this kind of bar thing
into the hole like so and then put that
onto the breakup board sorry I done a
better descriptions for these and it
should resemble a sliding mechanism it's
a good idea to put some hot glue on the
top here to stop the breakup board from
coming out as that could make things not
work then there's this top kind of cover
and that just prevents everything from
falling out just kind of put that on top
try not to disturb the pogo pins and
that's almost done next you just need
your PI zero and that'll go on top like
this with the camera connector facing
towards the USB port and then just screw
that in with some well screws and that's
em 2.5 or M 2 seems to be the correct
size and that's pretty much it in terms
of hardware and next is just the
software SSH into it and creating VNC
server ok so I'll run through this part
pretty quickly as I have covered it in a
previous video you need to flash the
raspbian image onto a micro SD card and
then open up the boots partition and
then you're going to want to open the
command line text documents in notepad
plus plus and then between root
wait and quiet you want to add this bit
of code here I'll put this in the
description but just make sure the
formatting is correct with one space on
either side of that I'll put that in the
description and then you want to open
config dot txt and then right at the
bottom you want to add this line of code
it won't already be there and of course
put this bit in the description just
make sure that you haven't added
anything else apart from just that and
then finally you're going to want to
open a blank notepad plus plus file and
just straight away without putting
anything into it just go to save as
buh-buh-buh-buh save it into the Bhoots
partition as I feel make this smaller if
I can it's not letting me whatever save
it as SSH and as all types so just press
save and that'll just create a file
called SSH with no extension nothing in
it's just an empty file called SSH and
that's all enable SSH on boots as by
default it is not enabled and then once
you've done that you can close it up
unplug your micro sd card and put it in
your bi and then you can just plug it in
it might take a couple minutes to set
itself up because it's it's first boot
so just let it do its thing and then
we'll hop over to the computer then just
open up your favorite SSH clients
connect to raspberry pi dot local on
port 22 give it a few seconds and then a
warning should come up warning you of
impending doom yet they go click yes to
simply accept your fate and then after a
few seconds you should be in the
username is PI and the password is
raspberry default I do suggest you
change those that default password of
course
and there you go so I'll leave a link in
the description to a video where I've
done this kind of thing before and I'll
show you how to share your internet
connection with the PI zero so if you do
need an internet connection to do
whatever you is you want to do do see
the description now to use the pi with
the desktop like interface you need to
install the
see server it already comes with Rosman
so you need to check it's up to date so
it's good to do sue apps gets updates
first I didn't do that in this video
that you should do that really and then
secondly run this command I've done here
and after that's all run it after its
run its course you should be good
next type in sudo razz pie config and
then you come to this you need to go
into interfacing options and then go to
VNC and simply enable it then with your
favorite VNC viewer I'm using VNC viewer
just connected Raspberry Pi local and
just let it do that
and then of course the username and
passwords will be exactly the same as
before with username PI and password
raspberry and there you go you've got
your desktop like interface I'm sure you
can do a few things to up the quality
but in essence there you go speaking of
raspberry PI's I often do giveaways on
Twitter and Instagram which I sometimes
don't even announce on YouTube so you
should probably follow me on Twitter and
Instagram
other than that remember to like the
video if you liked it subscribe if you
haven't already if you want to chat I
also have a discord server which will be
linked down below so yep thanks for
watching and stay tuned for more hacking
