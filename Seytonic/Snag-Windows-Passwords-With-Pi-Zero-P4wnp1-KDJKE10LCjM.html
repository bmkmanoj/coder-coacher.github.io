at how you can snag Windows password
hashes from a locked machine with
nothing but 2 pi 0 so let's get to it
right after this mulder we know is the
arduino based bad USB you can use it to
inject keystrokes at lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's desktop
wallpaper to find out more see the link
in the video description so this cool
hack uses pwned PI which I've covered in
a previous video made by MAME 82 it's a
framework which makes possible all kinds
of attacks with a Raspberry Pi 0 from
running ducky scripts to initiating a
covert hid backdoor it does a lot if
you're interested in learning more about
it I've done another video on the topic
so see the link in the description for
that so here I'm just going to be
looking at the windows lock pick a
feature once configured and plugged into
a locks machine it'll boot and grab the
password hash then proceeds to try and
crack it if it manages to crack the hash
this will then just type it in and lock
you in and there you go however keep in
mind this is a PI 0 after all performing
a very weak dictionary attack so there's
a high chance that I won't be able to
crack it in which case you'll have to
crack yourself on something a bit more
powerful than a PI more on that later
so there's a pretty good description of
how this all works in the github page
linked below though essentially pwned PI
spoofs in R&amp;amp;D is network device and
redirects traffic to itself using
responder also linked in the description
it tries to force authentication and
instills the hashes in the process
however as the attack is network based
unfortunately you can't grab straight up
ntlm hashes but rather net ntlm v2 which
are salted via the computer's username
among a few other things so no rainbow
table or hash table attack as possible
I'm afraid by the way if you're confused
about what a hash or a salt even is then
I've made a video on exactly that
subject so go and watch that and come
back it's linked below ok so now for
setup there's a few ways to do this the
PI 0 needs to receive both power and to
have internet connectivity so for the
sake of simplicity I highly recommend
getting one of these USB to Ethernet
adapters there are only a couple of
dollars off eBay and they work great
especially when pairs we brought these
micro USB OTG adapters which are equally
as cheap however there are headless
setup options available
see the github for those however they
were kind of a hit and miss with me
sometimes they'd work other
times not so I'm avoiding those in this
video though you're welcome to give them
a go so since I've made a video covering
Sutter before I won't be covering it
here I'll have my previous video linked
below so once you've got pwned PI
installed you'll need to configure it if
it supplies here W it'll spawn a Wi-Fi
hotspot which you can connect to
alternatively you can plug it straight
into a Windows machine and SSH into it
too via the following IP by the way I'd
recommend using PI 0 W with pone PI just
because of the extra features you can
take advantage of namely the coverts hid
backdoor which I talked about in my
previous video ok so once you're in
you're going to need to configure it
which is pretty easy so just CD into the
pone highfather and then open up set up
dot config scroll all the way to the
bottom and you'll find the payload
selection so you can want to comment out
the network only payload which is going
to be the one that's selected by default
and then uncomment Windows 10 underscore
pick locker and then make sure to save
and back out of that and the next step
you're only going to have to do if
you're using a keyboard layout other
than us English because keyboard layouts
can vary per language so pun pi needs to
know which one you're using so open up
the payloads folder and then go into
Windows 10 underscore pick Locker and
then scroll through there and you'll
find a language selection so you can
change that from us to whatever cube or
language it is you're using see the
github for a list though I'm gonna be
using GB now you're ready making sure of
course use the second micro USB port
plug it in is to take a few seconds to
boot up though when it's done cracking
it will simply type the password out
pretty quickly rather straightforward
though you don't have to wait for it to
crack the password if you don't want
after all if there's a high chance you
won't be able to so once you get three
blinks on the led it means you have the
hash stored locally so you're safe to
remove it to retrieve and cracked hash
later so let's say there's a password
that you want to crack offline on
something a bit more powerful than just
a PI zero in order to do that unplug the
PI then SSH into it's using your
preferred method in the poem PI folder
there'll be a collected folder inside
that you'll find your hash file this
contains everything you need to crack
the hash as well as the hash itself so
copy the contents of that and save it in
a txt file on your cracking machine next
you'll need to download hash Katz it's
pretty much the best GPU cracker as far
as I know so download the binaries
save it somewhere hash cat is command
line based so navigate to its folder in
CMD and I'm going to be running this
command the - M 5600 - tells hash cats
that this is a net ntlm V - hash hash
txt contains the hash I saved that in
the same folder as the exe and - a 3
tells it to a mask attack aka a brute
force here I'm defining the key space as
the 8 lowercase characters with the
question elves though you can mix and
match this to whatever or use a
dictionary attack if you like the hash
cath website is pretty good at
documenting all of this so by running
that it'll try and crack the hash how
long it takes depends on the key space
as well as help helpful your GPU is I've
got 10 80s this attack will only take a
few minutes at most
though if you want to do something a bit
more thorough on something less powerful
it could take a lot longer fast-forward
a few minutes and a plaintext password
has been found and printed out so I
think that's about it this is a pretty
cool feature of pone pine I highly
suggest you check out its github page if
there's any more features of pone pi you
want me to take a look at do let me know
in the comments other than that thanks
for watching guys remember to like this
video if you liked it subscribe if you
haven't already follow me on the
Twitter's and the instagrams and stay
tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
