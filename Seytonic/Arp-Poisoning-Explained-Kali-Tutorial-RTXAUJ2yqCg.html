to insect communications across a
network this allows you to sniff any
traffic going between the targets and
the internet if sensitive information
such as credit card details or passwords
are sent unencrypted then the targets
going to have a very bad day before I
show you how to do this it's best to
understand exactly how this works and
what's ARP is every computer connected
to a network has an ARP table up
standing for address resolution protocol
this table pretty much just links IP
addresses with their corresponding MAC
address so when you want to communicate
with a certain IP address your computer
will know which MAC address to send it
to in Linux you can see your ARP table
by typing up in Windows it's up - a here
you can only see my Reuters IP address
and MAC address that's because ARP
tables are built as you go only other
devices on the network you've
communicated with so far will show up so
say if I wanted to ping my laptop which
has this IP address my computer would
check the ARP table only to finds that
there's no corresponding entry remember
you can only communicate with the
devices you know the MAC address for so
my computer will send out a message to
everyone on the network simply asking if
anyone has the MAC address for my laptop
once a device on the network replies the
ping can go on as usual because now my
computer knows both the IP address and
MAC address so if I try and ping this it
will work because there are ProQuest's
only take a fraction of a second so now
if I were to go and check the ARP table
again you can see it's got both my
router and my laptop we can even see
these are pre quests in action using
wireshark so if I ping my laptop and
then go and check Y shark you'll see
that - the ARP request has been sent
it's the first one is it broadcast it to
everyone it says who has the laptop tell
me and then someone has another device
on the network has responded I have it
here's the MAC address for it so now
that my computer has both the MAC
address and IP address it can go ahead
and do that ping but this is where the
funny business comes in what if we could
send a load of our presses to a target
telling them that the Reuters MAC
address has changed and instead of
sending all its communications to the
real Rooter we can tell it to send all
those communications to us instead that
way we'd be able to see everything that
goes between the Rooter
and the victim so actually doing the ARP
spoofing up poising whatever you want to
call it itself is actually pretty
straightforward and easy I'm going to be
demoing this on the climbing machine I
suggest you do the same simply because
it has all the tools you'll need already
pre-installed I have heard of some
routers some setups which do block art
poisoning
however those are mostly in corporate
environments so if you're doing this on
a home network then you should be okay
though I've only got one Reuter so I can
only speak for myself so firstly you're
going to want to set up IP forwarding on
your Kali Linux machine so you can do
that just by typing echo 1 and then you
can just copy the rest of that and press
Enter and next you're going to want to
know your default gateway or the IP
address of your router so you can find
that out by typing IP routes so mine
would be 192.168.1.254 though yours is
probably going to be a bit different and
next you're going to want to know the
interface on which you're going to form
this attack so you can type ifconfig and
it's probably going to be the first one
since I'm using a wired connection it's
either 0 but if yours on wireless it's
going to be WLAN some another so next to
actually get this going you type ARP
spoof - I the interface you're using
which is s0 for me and then - T and your
target so for me that's going to be
192.168.1.2 so we'll just double check
that and yes that's it and then - R and
then your host so that would be our
default gateway so one I two point six
eight point one point two five four and
then press Enter so now it just proceeds
to send a load of unrequested ARP
responses to that particular victim
telling it that the MAC address of the
route has changed and instead of being
what it was it's actually our MAC
address so you can see it keeps on
sending them because if we stop sending
them then eventually that computer is
going to figure out hey wait seconds
that's not the actual MAC address and
it's going to go back to using the real
MAC address so what you have to remember
is that all these packets all the
information all the communication does
actually get to the route in the end
what happens is that it just goes
through us
so we can for man in the middle attacks
we can sniff this information we can
change it and do all kinds of things so
probably the easiest way to sniff all
this information that's going through us
is using wireshark so why shark comes
pre-installed in kali linux so you need
to go is to applications sniffing and
then Wireshark it gives you an error but
then you just need to select f0 or
whatever interface you're using so then
it will display a load of what looks
like random gibberish so this is all the
communications that going through us
from the target but also everything that
we're sending off to the incident as
well and not only to the insect anything
else on the network so it can be
interesting just to look through this
and see what you can find and figure out
what's communicating with what however
let's say for example I want to sniff
traffic that I'm doing with satanic calm
so I can add a display filter and since
I know the IP address or state on accom
I can just add that in as IP dots dress
equals and then the IP address will say
time to calm so this is going to show
all the information that goes to and
from say Telecom so I've got my victim
laptop here and as I load a say Telecom
page you can see it sends a load of
things to the IP address ball so I
receive a load of stuff back so here I'm
going to right click one of those HTTP
requests go to follow an N HTTP stream
and in the red you can see everything
that I'm sending to the site and in blue
you can see everything that I'm
receiving so the red is a request the
blue is the response and you see the
blue there's a load of CSS a load of
HTML so in this example there's nothing
really malicious you can do with this
information
apart from well maybe if that cookie at
the top was my actual cookie in which
case you could probably just copy it and
then login to my user accounts from my
website it isn't by the way so you can
forget about that but the important
thing here is say for example there was
a form on the website and you had to
enter your username and password to log
in if that website wasn't using HTTPS
then you'd be able to see the username
the passwords the cookies everything and
you'd be able to log in as that user and
steal their credentials though it's
important to remember if they are using
SSL HTTPS
then you're not going to be able to do
that if you try and follow an HTTP
stream it's just going to look like a
load of gibberish and there's no chance
you're going to be able to decipher any
of it so if you have any questions feel
free to leave them down in the comments
or better yet to join my discord server
link is in the description we already
have somewhat of a community going so
thanks for watching be sure to follow me
on twitter i'm at say tonic i've
launched a patreon in little past few
days so i'd just like to take a moment
to thank everyone who's pledged to
support me there the support has been
overwhelming remember to like this video
and subscribe if you haven't already so
yeah i'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
