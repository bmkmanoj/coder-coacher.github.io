costing less than $10 is an awesome
addition to any simulation gamer setup
forget about using your mouse to look
around in armor or war thunder this
thing checks your motion in six axes
allowing you to physically control
camera movements giving you way more
emotion in your games so let's look at
how to make it right after this multi we
know is the Arduino based bad USB inject
keystrokes at lightning speed gain a
shell change someone's desktop wallpaper
with the elite version simply store and
select between up to 16 different
scripts on a micro SD card to find out
more see the link in the video
description I was pretty surprised when
I came across this to find out just how
many games this is compatible with the
list is really rather expansive there
are actual products that do the same
thing as what I'm going to show you here
today though they can get pretty pricey
so making one for ten dollars is a real
no-brainer so how does this actually
work well it uses three infrared LEDs
attached to one side of your headset and
an IR camera that's it's pretty much the
camera ignores visible light and instead
only picks up the infrared light given
off by the LEDs by doing some quick
maths software can work out which way
you're pointing where you are in 3d
space just based off of the LEDs
positioning then this information is
translated into ingame camera movements
so in order to make this you will need
three sfh for 85p infrared LEDs you can
find them on eBay I'll have some links
down below next a 5 ohm resistor which I
don't actually end up using here though
you really should I'll talk more about
that later
you'll also need some wire a ps3 eye
camera and you'll also need a floppy
disk additionally you will need a frame
on which to put your LEDs I have a 3d
printer so I'll be using that here if
you want to print the same one as me
I'll leave those files down below though
you could use a piece of cardboard bend
some strong wire into shape pretty much
anything will do as long as you end up
with something that resembles this
configuration don't worry about the
exact measurements for now we can adjust
those later so obviously our LEDs need
powering there are two options here
firstly you could battery power them
which results in a much more elegant
solution however in this video I'll be
powering the LEDs via USB just because
it's easiest these LEDs are rated for
1.5 volts each so to use a USB ports for
supply you need to put them in series
like so with the five ohm resistor
somewhere in the circuit I couldn't find
the five ohm resistor so I'll be
skipping that and overpowering the LEDs
somewhat however if you want to use this
often then do make sure to use a
resistor as the LEDs won't last as long
if you do off a voltage them so then
just go ahead and solder everything
together I suggest using really thin
wire as it means you won't have to worry
about cable management and Lee as much
also something to note on my LEDs the
longer leg actually represents the
negative terminal something I discovered
half an hour into wondering why the darn
things weren't working also if you don't
have a soldering iron not worry these
jumper wires exists such that you can
just connect up the LEDs though the end
product won't look nearly as nice and it
may fall apart over time once done you
should have something that resembles
this just a few LEDs digsy chained
together though you should have a
resistor in there somewhere though as I
mentioned I don't
after which you just attach the LEDs
onto your structure by means of hot glue
tape just whatever you have to hand
really one LED per arm is good then
you'll be left with two ends of wire
coming off your structure your positive
and negative for this step you will need
a sacrificial USB cable any cable will
do as long as it has a USB male
connector on one end so splice your
cable you'll find this four wires inside
it's the black and red wires we care
about here so it can all the other two
and just expose the black and red
next up solder the red wire to positive
and your black to your negative after
which I would recommend isolating those
two wires with electrical tape as to
avoid bad things all that's left to do
here is plug it into your PC and hope
you haven't screwed up the wiring enough
to blow up your USB port of course you
won't be able to see the LEDs because
they're infrared however your phone's
front-facing camera probably can so to
test everything is working just have a
look through your phone's camera if
there's light then everything's good
lastly just attach your LED clip thing
onto the side of your headsets I just
used tape though velcro or cable ties
would be perfect here in hindsight best
attach the clip to the left side of your
headset that way you won't have a wire
coming off each side of your head
LEDs done with the next port of call is
the PlayStation Eye camera there are a
few modifications we're gonna have to do
here so head on over to ebay and pick up
a play
station.i camera I got my in secondhand
for just I think it was three four
pounds however it gets slightly tricky
here so there's two types of camera both
types have an IR filter which we want to
remove and replace with a visible light
filter though one type has a removable
IR filter the other has its IR filter
sandwiched in between two lenses and so
just isn't removable with the non
removable one you get pretty faint
lights from your LEDs so it's not as
great however both types will work
though the one with the removable filter
is better you can tell which is which
via the front lens perhaps ask the eBay
seller for a close-up picture if you
can't tell whether it's a good one or a
bad one though do note I ended up with a
bad on here which is the one I'm going
to be working with and it works
absolutely fine just not as great as the
good one
also I'm told whichever psi camera you
ended up going with you're going to need
to open it up there are screws hidden
under rubber thingies on the back after
you've got through those you're going to
need to pried the back casing off this
takes some doing and you might mangle
the plastic just little like I did
though eventually it does pop off next
there's some more screws after which the
whole PCB will just come out leaving the
lens behind in the housing at this point
if you ended up with the better camera
there is an extra step you're going to
need to do since I don't have that
camera I can't show you how to remove
the IR filter but I'll leave a link down
in the description to a video that shows
you how to do just that though remember
only do that step if you ended up with
the better camera next is where that
floppy disc comes in handy you will need
to do this for both types of camera mind
you you see floppy disks have visible
lights blocking properties so we're
going to want to open up our floppy disk
and find the actual floppy part and cut
a piece off it and stick it right here
in the lens housing just cut a bit down
to size so it fits nice and snug
next just reverse the hole taking apart
the camera process ie put it back
together and then just find a decent
place to put your camera and the
hardware side of things is pretty much
done right so of course we need to get
drivers for that PlayStation camera in
this case we're going to be using CLI
I'll link their sites down in the
description there are free versions of
the driver available though they sell
copies for only $2.99 each so since it's
so cheap and we're saving quite a lot of
money here I decided to just pay the
$2.99 and support the development though
like I said there are free versions
available of CLI if you want search for
them
once that's done all that's left to
download and install is open track I'll
link it below this is what actually does
all of the tracking once you've opened
the open track you'll need to put your
headset on and plug it in then it's
happened a hammer icon to the side point
tracker and select psi camera then tap
start it's HAP on that hammer icon again
and slide the threshold to the left only
till the three LEDs from your headset
are showing there shouldn't be a need to
mess with any of the other settings
early next click model and input your
clip measurements if you made your own
after which tap calibrate and move your
head around randomly for a bit though
try to only pitch in your then close
that to go to options and select bind
sensor here just put in any key
combinations this will make it real easy
to reset the camera to the center
position in case the clip moves or
anything when you're playing and then
everything is completely done finally
many games will work without further
configuration however you might have to
check up on individual games here and
playing warthunder
the recording came ups little zoomed in
for some reason however it really works
great there was basically no lag as far
as I could tell after a while of playing
you kind of forget you're even wearing
the thing and just start moving your
head to look around and stink tively
without really thinking about it
you can further configure it for
sensitivity and such but that's up to
you so thanks for watching guys I hope
you enjoyed this video it took a hell of
a long time to make so do slap that like
button if you enjoyed it remember to
follow me on Twitter and Instagram and
now I'm actually starting snapchat so do
add me on there together behind the
scenes sneak peek of what's coming up
next week and just why I'm doing in
general see ya thanks for watching and
stay tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
