you're probably wondering where I've
been why haven't I put anything else
anyway you're probably a bit confused
well I've moved to University so I
haven't had time for much of anything
the past few weeks I've been moving in
and getting used to the whole uni thing
see ya my apologies for new content I
did have a few other things planned for
this video I was gonna do like a room
talks have got a new office as well as
my university accommodation trying to
segment the two though something's wrong
my camera is kind of screwing up right
now
so that's been postpones bit on hold
that will be coming at some point I
promise you that and my normal videos
the project videos will be resuming of
course so if you do like those which I'm
hoping some of you do they will be
coming back so don't worry I have done a
couple of live streams recently however
I never scheduled them so if you do want
to watch my live streams you will have
to turn notifications on so you'll get
to pop up whenever I do them anyway
mainly this video is and I'm not dead
heads up though anyway for the rest of
this video I want to do a kind of
experiment I think while I'm going to be
kind of inconsistent with the project
videos so they are coming so worried
that I will be inconsistent there's no
doubt about that
it'd probably be a good idea to maybe
start something regular like a podcast
or a new segment so I'm considering
starting a podcast with space on we have
some pretty cool ideas for it so we
filmed kind of five minutes segment for
the rest of this video
it's very amateurish we didn't plan any
of it
I just called space on up on this chord
and said hey let's talk about a news
topic for the next five minutes see how
it goes so if we do continue this we're
gonna get better this is only the
beginning so as long as it's not
completely terrible I think that would
be a major positive so you guys are
obviously familiar with me if you're not
with space Sun he's gonna introduce
himself you probably know me from speed
yeah I do
different projects really same on github
so yeah you can you can find me on
github and Twitter at spacer so we've
got quite a few good ideas for this this
podcast we're going to be talking about
news topics each week or bi-weekly or
however often we do this we've also got
a bunch of guests we're planning on
bringing on so we've got people that
started their own companies or
- cybersecurity we've got people that
have that are actually famous for
hacking into things are the famous
youtubers so it should be quite good
okay so you might have seen recently in
the news that self defense may soon
expand to include cyber attacks while in
the u.s. at least two members of the US
House of Representatives recently
introduced a law bill that would allow
hacking victims to seek revenge and hack
the hackers who hacked them the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act would be amended to
make limited retaliatory strikes against
cyber bad guys legal in America for the
first time so essentially this would
allow hacked organizations to go outside
of their own networks identify who hacks
them and hack them back destroy any data
that had been stolen
so space on what do you think of this
potential law it could I see the point
where companies with one dead however I
see a lot of things that are not in this
law so there could be cases where people
maybe hate the wrong people are they
they just want to seek revenge even
though there wasn't really a limits well
I think it's a horrendous idea because
like you just said it says nothing about
the burden of proof you needs to go
around hacking your enemies like do I
need actual logs to say space unpacked
me or could I just say oh well space hon
joked about hacking me once and now like
I load my craps gone missing yes
something like that although do my stuff
have been leaked and therefore I think
it's space hon I'm gonna hire someone to
screw with him is that how it's gonna
work do you need actual evidence I know
I just think it could turn the whole
internet in some kind of Wild West and
if you have evidence
can you just say okay that's enough of
evidence for me I go with it or do you
have to I don't know I don't know it let
the lawyer check that or something get
get to court and and they have to decide
before you can make your steps you know
I think lawyers are gonna get very rich
from this if it goes through yeah very
rich like if you think about it right
now you've got white hat hacking groups
are those white hats gonna kind of turn
into vigilantes or like hitmen
potentially because if this becomes a
legitimate thing
then all those white hats still white
hurts
do you have to invent a new hats because
they're not black hat since they're not
doing anything illegal they're following
the law in this case
I'm interested as to the color of this
new hat I think that's the most
important takeaway from this though what
one other thing that I was thinking
about is would this be limited to
hacking over networks or could you
actually physically break into a data
center to try and retrieve or wipe
stolen data I mean and where does it end
at this atonic do they think he hacked
me I just got a fly over there get this
computer rip all this hard drive don't
make home ok so you can't you can't
cause wait I've got my self-destructing
SSD so like you're screwed
yeah we're just going to say oh wait
Lincoln scription SSDs wait I have to go
back a minute fly back and and take
their this way I don't know this whole
thing doesn't though there are some
caveats to this act it would apply to US
soil only so if someone hacked you from
Russia or the UK or France or Germany or
wherever it would not be legal it
wouldn't fly so does that kind of render
this whole law useless but use American
VPN or something so they hmm
victim things oh it's another American I
gonna hit back but then it's actually
Russian but I suppose you'd trace
through that VPN and use five in Russia
so I mean you won't even get to that
point probably I mean that's probably
the VPN but just the I mean even if
someone is let's say one American is
hacking another another American but
they go through a Chinese well it
probably won't be China they if they
have funny laws on that but let's say
let's say if it's a I don't know a
French proxy you know the America the
American who's trying to trace that and
hacked the other American
is gonna you know kind of hit this
French proxy and just kind of be a dead
stop
so does that that kind of renders the
whole thing pointless right
most of these heck attacks are done of
proxies VPNs I'd say in anyway all
basically yeah if anybody has any sense
let's be honest I don't I don't I don't
see really the reason in this law I
don't see the extra use of its you know
I think it could give this podcast a
whole load more materials to talk about
so when it goes wrong so I I am in full
favor of this law this law has my
complete backing just for that reason if
you're from the u.s. go talk to your
representative or senator or whatever
you have and tell them to support this
yep it's discussion more content I
approve
one other thing to mention is that the
retaliatory party would be financially
liable for any damages to innocent
people and systems along the way so
whether that changes anything I'd I'm
not quite sure that kind of just seems
to be a footnote here maybe there will
be a lot of interesting discussions
Congress or something so yeah what do
you guys think of this proposal this
potential law let us know down in the
comments
your guys's input would be pretty
interesting here because I think this is
gonna be rather controversial anyway
guys that's all we filmed for this
episodes though it's not really nepo
sewed since in actual episodes would be
quite a bit longer though that's a taste
of what you can expect I guess we're
still we've never done a podcast before
so if this if it sounded a bit crappy
then let us know down in the comments
and we'll do what we can to improve yeah
if you like this video like the idea
there remember to hit that like button
if you have any questions do let me know
down in the comments thanks for watching
and stay tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
