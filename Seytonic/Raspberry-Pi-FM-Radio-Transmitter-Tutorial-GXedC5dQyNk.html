around the Raspberry Pi zero and a piece
of wire we're going to be turning the PI
zero into a radio transmitter something
you'll be able to tune in to on any FM
radio and also of course a new camera so
let me know what you think of the
quality Ania fancy-pants camera angles
so let's get right into it right after
these words mult we know is an
open-source arduino based bad USB you
can use it to inject keystrokes at
lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper
anything you can do with the keyboard
and 50 minutes of your time mods we new
can do in a matter of seconds to find
out more see the IndieGoGo link in the
description so before we start it's
worth noting that you should check your
local laws regarding whether you can
even do this in the first place and on
which frequencies since I'm only going
to be demonstrating this for a few
seconds I'm not too bothered once you've
got your PI the first thing you will
need to do is make an antenna a 15
centimeter strip or solid core wire will
do fine so you could use a standard jump
wire if that's all you have to hand so
in this case the software we're going to
be using utilizes GPIO pin 4 that's for
long from that square connector which is
on the end of the microSD card connector
as you can see I'm using I think they're
called helping hands to keep everything
in place while I'm soldiering it just
holds everything in place it makes my
life so much easier so if you do solder
and regularly I'd really suggest you
pick some up so there you go a nice
clean solder joints may be a bit too
much solder but whatsoever it will do so
I'll just go ahead and snip the remnants
off there so as far as hardware goes
you're pretty much done the next steps
take place on the pie itself so go ahead
and flash a new copy of raspbian onto a
micro SD cards and then go ahead and
open up a terminal window on the
relatively pie itself whether that's
with the keyboard on the monitor that's
fine here I'm plugging it directly into
my computer itself and then ssh into it
let me know if you want me to do a video
on that by the way so for the software
side of things we're going to using FM a
transmitter
I'll go ahead and download it on my PI
in just a sec though for now I thought
it would just be important to state that
it supports WAV files natively that's
dots WAV and if you want to use mp3
files on this you're going to have to go
through some of these steps I tried
going through them a little owls on my
PI and it did end up working in the end
and in bother trying to fix
is not that too important to me you can
always just convert your mp3 files to
wav format so the link to this page will
of course be in the description you're
going to want to go ahead and click
clonal downloads right click download
zip and copy link address just three
asset on a clipboard so once you've got
a thermal up on the pie I'm just going
to go ahead and create a new folder pair
of thing and let's just call it radio
and primitive radio okay so we're going
to want to go ahead and download that
project so if we just do double you get
and then the zip file okay so once it's
downloaded it's called muscles or zip so
we can just do unzip masters or zip and
it will unzip that and put it in the
land folder for us so our CD into FM
transmitter so next we just need to
paste in a few commands to compile the
projects so those commands are available
on the github as you can see there the
first fly in sudo apt-get blah blah blah
and then make soldier spaces in and then
we should be good to go each of the
clones might take a couple of minutes
but that's absolutely normal
so now we're pretty much good to go I'll
just go ahead and clear the terminal
here so to open a file and start
transmitting all you're going to need to
do is type sudo stop / FM transmitter -
f and then the frequency I'll just put
an XF and Alex we'll come back to that
in just a second and then - are and the
file name
I'll just put file name as a placeholder
for now so when it comes to choosing a
frequency to transmit on we're going to
want to find frequency which really
isn't in use obviously if you're going
to do this for prolonged periods you
want to want to check your laws however
I'm only going to be doing it for a few
seconds so I'm not too worried so you
could just use a regular radio to find
the frequency with which isn't in use or
you could use one B's which is a TV
tuner it also allows you to receive dab
digital audio broadcasting but more
importantly for us FM frequency
modulation so this is going to allow us
to scan the airwaves
find a frequency which really isn't in
use and will transmit on that so expect
to see more office on this channel I
haven't really got into SDR that much as
of yet however I bought an up converter
that I haven't really put to use yet so
I really want to get inside
like hello the fun so this piece of
software is called HD SDR it's allows us
to scan all the different FM frequencies
and listen in to what's going on and
whatever so this what you're seeing here
goes from 95 megahertz to 97 megahertz
so we can see all the different radio
stations within this frequency range
Sarah it looks like there's only really
one there's a few other ones which might
be radio stations so if we just
listening to the random noise here you
can hear the sound of the universe I
guess if we go to the radio station it's
only springs into life not full radio
station to creatively call some of
better quality than others so if we see
what else is going on I don't know what
these Peaks are but they're not radio
stations they're something else
who knows so if we go along a bit
there's a few more radio stations and
let's just try and find somewhere which
is a little less crowded
let's go along okay this looks good so
there's really not much going on here
let's choose this here 103 points three
because there's well nothing in nothing
here and there's nothing around it so
we're unlikely to interfere with
anything and even if we do only be for
about 10 seconds or something because
that's how long we'll have to transmit
for and to only to the people within a
few meters of me because this Raspberry
Pi Bruni's on that powerful so we should
run into any problems there right so
you'll notice I'm filming the spits on
my camera because for some reason HD SDR
just doesn't like to be recorded it'll
go all laggy and just horrible but
anyway so this is the final part so here
as you remember from earlier
I've got pseudo - FM transmitter - F and
in the frequency in this case 103.3 - R
and then folding to be transmitting in
this case Keck dot web
however I do think this comes preloaded
with the Souls theme tuning its star
scores that web both over here we're
going to be using the national anthem of
Karastan so let's go and do
that if I pan over to the to FDR HD FDR
okay so if all goes well when I press
ENTER you should see this bands that I'm
kind of looking at just light up so
let's give it a go
alright we are in action let's just turn
the volume up okay it's a bit noisy
let's see what we can do to sort out
okay well it works which guess is
supremely good quality for how small the
rotary players and how low-power is
that's just so you can see that is
working and just kind of jumping up and
down to the beach and all the guessing
this is the past information here that's
going up so let's see if I can get it
working on my radio to my windup radio
which I don't see why it wouldn't work
but let's get it goes going just a lot
of it let's see I'll turn lights on here
and let's line us up see I'll just wine
us up and turn the computer volume off
let's see if we can get this going
looking so I test this earlier and the
range isn't that great it will just
about cover my house apart from that
it's all you know fall off and drop off
pretty quickly so yeah as well actually
a pretty fun projects and if you know
someone that listens on certain bands
you could kind of mess with them I
suppose however you know you'd want to
check out the legality of that I take no
responsibility for your actions of
course but yeah oh yeah one other thing
as you can see it's Jam coming down now
let's turn up and yes I go over to the
console terminal and through controls
edge to shut everything down to close
the program you'll see that everything
here just stops and fairway so silence
you can even set this thing up so it
would start transmitting on startup so
why is that useful well if you plug in a
micro USB to USB cable and then into a
power bank and then you can have it on
the side here and you'd have essentially
a possible really
station so that's pretty cool if you
were to gesture to apply some hot glue
to the bottom of it so pretty messy but
oh well and um just hold it for a few
seconds and you have a portable radio
station put this in your backpack
wherever you go and broadcast to the
world I guess well to everyone within
your vicinity at least so thanks for
watching guys so one quick announcements
before I sign off is that I now have a
subreddit so if you have any questions
about this video or any of my other
videos head over to the subreddit a
subreddit name is C topia the link is
going to be in the description down
below because the discord is good to
interact with people we talk on voice
chats and it's gathon however it's not
really great for answering people's
questions because things get buried the
chat moves so fast it's impossible to
keep up with and I get the same question
a million times one for Twitter and the
YouTube comments so it's just best if
everything's centralized in one location
if you've got a question about this
video or something related to this video
there will be a post up on the subreddit
specifically relating to this video if
you have any questions just go in there
see if anyone else has asked it and
there you go if they haven't just post a
comment and I'll answer it don't create
a new post just about this video because
there's already going to be one there
but yeah thanks for watching remember to
like this video if you haven't liked it
subscribe follow me on Twitter
I'm apse a clinic and stay tuned for
more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
