offering and probably their most
intriguing yet it's a pen testing device
of course but more of a Swiss Army knife
in terms of what it can do rather than a
single purpose system like the rubber
duckie or the Wi-Fi pineapple my initial
prediction is after watching the teaser
trailer we're actually pretty accurate
so without further ado let's unbox and
take a first look at the Bosch money so
firstly of course full disclosure this
was sent to me by heck 5 however with no
strings attached
so the Bosch money comes in a signature
hack 5 packaging and if we have a look
inside
we'll see it comes with QuickStart
guides a short USB extension cable and
the Bosch Bunny itself in an static
packaging which is a good sign of course
so if we zoom in and take a closer look
at the bunny itself you'll see it has a
standard USB 2.0 connector a 3-way
switch for selecting between different
scripts you might have stored on this
thing and an RGB status LED and it all
comes in a very plain USB housing
because you want to remain incognito
with this device for obvious reasons so
if we compare it to a rubber ducky
you'll see that the size difference is
quite blatant it's much bigger much
larger however there are good reasons
that's which I'll get to in a bit so
they do include a USB extension cable
because this might not fit into tight
spaces so with this it will so what kind
of brush Bonnie even do well while it
doesn't replace each of the rubber ducky
of a land turtle directory it kind of
takes cues from both of them it has all
of the functionality of the rubber ducky
however with much faster storage so you
can export rate files from a target
computer much more quickly the only
downside being that the bunny isn't as
incognito as the rubber ducky is you
could even use bunny as just a mass
storage device by itself so if anybody
becomes suspicious just flick it into
programming modes plug it in and just
pretend it's a vintage USB stick or
something where the bunny takes cubes
from the landfill it's us to connect as
a USB to Ethernet adapter giving you an
easy access points into the network and
even allowing you to perform man in the
middle attacks between the network and
the computer you're plugged into I'm
hoping at some points will get some kind
of poison sup implementation now that
would be really cool
the bunny takes about five seconds to
boots once plugged in so that's
understandable given as a whole Linux
system running on this thing
by putting it into programming modes
you're able to gain a shallow net via a
serial connection allowing you full
access into its inner workings so one of
the switch positions is to set up the
other two are programmable so you'll be
able to download premade scripts
customize them and drop them into the
corresponding folder at the time of
recording the library of Bash Bunny
scripts is yet to go live once it does
I'll make a video on my favorite
payloads and sure exactly what the bunny
can do however this has just been a
quick overview video on the bash bunny I
really wanted to get something out
released a my full review and other
videos on it I yet to come if you're
interested in finding out more about the
bunny I suggest subscribing to hack 5
and watching my latest video which is a
quite in-depth half an hour look at it
and if you're interested in picking up a
bunny I'll leave the hat shop link in
the video description so thanks for
watching if you liked the video remember
to hit that like button subscribe if you
haven't already follow me on Twitter I'm
at say tonic and stay tuned for more
hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
