execute ducky scripts stored on a
microSD card with an Arduino pro micro
if you haven't watched the video yet I
suggest you do link is in the
description because I assume you already
have that knowledge in this video so in
this video I'm going to show you how to
store many ducky scripts on a single
micro SD card and switch between them
easily using dip switches then I'll show
you how to make this way more possible
for a life use and everything I'm using
here is really cheap so links to buy all
these components are in the description
so in the last video I showed you the
scripts I'd written which would just
execute the single ducky script script
txt from a micro SD card but in this
video we're going to be using one of
these this is a dip switch it's
essentially just a set of switches on a
single module so I can plug it into my
bread boards connect all the pins on one
side to ground and the other set of pins
2 6 7 8 and 9 on the Arduino so now I
have four switches which can be
triggered independently of one another
so these are what we're going to be
using to switch between all the
different ducky scripts given that
switches are either on or off
their states of binary so by combining
the states of the different switches we
can achieve up to 2 to the power 4 which
is 16 different combinations so in this
example we'll be able to switch between
up to 16 different scripts so we can
modify the scripts I showed you in the
last video by adding a block of code
here and changing the default file name
where it says SD to open to dip so of
course all this code is going to be in
the description so this declares pins 6
7 8 &amp;amp; 9 as switches and here it will
check to see if each of those pins are
either on or off if they're on it will
add a 1 to the dip string if they're off
it will add 0 to the dip string and then
it will add txt on the end and then it
will execute the file will open the file
that has the corresponding file name so
here I have 16 files with all the
possible switch combinations if for
instance I only have this last switch on
then file 0 0 0 1 dot txt will be
executed however if I have all the
switches on then file 1 1 1 1 dot X T
will be executed etc so in order to make
this thing a little more portable I'm
going to be starting off with an Arduino
pro micro without the headers so it's a
lot more sleek and then I'm going to be
using an OTG adapter that I covered in a
video so this is going to allow us to
plug it straight into a computer without
the need for another cable and then with
the micro SD card reader that's probably
going to go here and I'm going to D
solder these headers of course so it'll
be a little sleeker and then these dip
switches since they're going to be going
well for of the pins are going to be
going on six seven eight and nine I'm
probably going to be Sol during those
here and then of course spending the
other pins and connecting those to
ground so when it's all put together it
should be fairly sleek and portable so
yeah let's go do that so firstly i d--
soldered the headers on the micro SD
module which was not a pleasant
experience and then i shortened half the
pins on the dip switch just so it would
be easier to solder on a piece of wire
so this is going to be able to connect
all those pins to ground quite easily so
then I just sold it everything together
and this is what I came up with I didn't
bother film the process because it was
very tedious very fiddly any probably
one's been old see much but yeah I've
hot glued the two boards together and
it's slightly off-center to allow more
room for these wires here in hindsight
if I were to do this again I'd probably
use thin wires these were all I had so
it just made everything a whole lot
fiddly and yeah I'd probably lay this
out a bit better but apart from that I
think it turned out really well
so yeah this isn't the sort of thing
you're going to be able to leave in a
car park and just hope song picks off
the ground and plugs into their computer
if you're going around a load of
computers it could be release well I
think you could have like a reverse
shell with this I can get it yet rust
shell with that you could have Windows
still when it's long run hashes with
that you could have steel cookies with
that and you've got 16 different options
so I just think it makes everything a
bit more versatile you've got your micro
sd here that's great so yeah so thanks
for watching guys if you have any
questions be sure to leave them in the
comment section down below and I'll get
back to you remember to follow me on
Twitter I'm at say tonic like and
subscribe and stay tuned for more
