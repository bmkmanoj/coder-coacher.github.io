better address the elephant in the room
meld we know has gone absolutely insane
over the last few days so thank you for
everyone who's backed it or even just
shared the page we've surpassed 500
percent of our initial goal in under a
week which is crazy if you don't know
what I'm talking about this amount we
know calm to find out so I ordered this
a couple of months ago I was about to
ask for a refund because it was taking
so long but it just suddenly arrives
so it's an Ethernet USB adapter and it
only cost me a couple of dollars from
China it's limited to only 10 megabits
per second but that's going to be
absolutely fine for what we're going to
be doing with it my plan is to attach it
to a Raspberry Pi 0 as well as attaching
a male USB ports to PI so it will give a
similar configuration soul and circle
swings like the Lancers will you should
be able to use this to gain an entry
points to a target network however in
this bills the USB plug will be for
power only so plugging it into a
computer for learning to get you power
you won't be sniffing data to a computer
or anything well not in this build
anyway as always I'll leave a link in
the description to this Internet's USB
adapter in case you want to recreate
this project in this video I'm going to
be trying a different format usually
I'll build whatever it is and then film
the video giving a step-by-step guide
however this time you'll be following me
throughout the whole build
so you'll be seeing my sort process as I
go so let me know what you think about
this down in the comments so if you've
been watching my videos well you'll know
I'm not just going to stick this flight
box on the PI and use adapter cables to
plug in that would be horrific I want to
connect it to my PI as directly as
possible so that means taking it apart
and seeing how I can do that so if you
look on the underside of the PI you can
see there's a load of gold pads and
these are quite useful these ones here
PP 22 n PP 23 are actually data lines
for the USB ports that's just underneath
those and over here P P 1 and P P 6 are
positive and negative lines that you can
use to power the PI so that's going to
come in handy so if we have a look at
the adapter again you can see that
there's 4 wires coming from it so those
4 wives are going to include the
positive negative and 2 data lines so I
need to figure out which of those is
which so I can connect it directly to
those gold pads that we saw on the PI
just a second ago so its standard
practice for the red wire to be positive
the black wire to be negative the green
to be data plus and the white to be data
- however on cheap Chinese products like
this you just can't be sure so it's best
so you don't mess anything up however
one thing I can be sure of is the order
of lines on the plug itself so if I
check for continuity between each of the
terminals on the plug and the device
itself then I can figure out which is
which so by trying each of the lines I
figured out that they were following
best practices and each of the colors
was what I thought it was so now I know
what's worse I can just go ahead and do
sold all those wires so the idea is that
I'm going to take that adapt to the hot
glue it to the bottom of the pie and
then solder up the corresponding
terminals from the pie to the adapter so
it should act just like it would be if
it was plugged into that micro USB port
directly so now that the whole Ethernet
side of things sorted out I kind of know
how I'm going to do it I'm going to turn
my attention to how I'm actually going
to power the device so the idea is
there's going to be a actual USB port a
male USB port on the bottom of the pie
and then you can just plug the pie
straight into a computer or into a power
socket or whatever it might be so I
thought I'd probably just use the plug
that came with the adapter so I'm going
to cut that up and strip it and then
connect it up so I'm probably going to
hot glue it to the pie on the end here
ish but firstly I need to deal with
those green and white wires so as you
can see I've cut them up a bit and I'm
going to put some heat shrink tubing
over the top just to make sure they
don't touch anything they shouldn't and
I may have ever so slightly burnt the
USB plug in the process so then I tinned
a few of the pads ready for solder and
on the power connector so the top one
I'm doing now is the five volt input and
the pv6 just below it is for ground as
you can see here the solder ended up
looking a bit dodgy but that was just
because my soldering iron was on to
lowest setting though I fixed that
off-camera after that I went ahead and
hot glued the power connector on to the
Raspberry Pi itself and then just kept
it seated in place while the glue dried
after stripping the red and black wires
with my teeth I proceeded to just cut
them down a bit and get them in place
ready to solder them onto those pads
then using a bit of sticky tape to keep
the Y's in place I just soldered the red
and black wires onto the corresponding
pads so at this point I thought it would
just be best to plug it in and see if
even and powers up so I plugged it in
and lo and behold the lights light up so
I'm going to take that as a yes so now
it's time to connect up the adapter
itself so I'm going to use black green
white and red wire
to connect up the corresponding
terminals here to the rods big pie so
just like I did before I'm going to pin
some pads but this time it's the data
positive and data negative lines and
then I sold it on the corresponding
green and white wires although my
handles in the way the whole time so
there's not really any usable footage of
that so next i soldered the positive and
negative wires for the adapter itself so
that means that the two red wires are
actually connected to each other as well
as to the pads and the same goes for the
two black wires after all that folding I
figured I might as well cover everything
with some hot glue to make sure none of
the wires would be accidentally pulled
off and cause problems so then I just
added some more hot glue and held down
the adapter on the PI until the glue
headsets after that I cut down stripped
the remaining wires and use some sort of
tape to hold them in place while I
solder them on and now hardware wise
everything is pretty much finished
you've got the USB plug on the right
hand side for your power inputs and the
ethernet sockets on the left to access
the network so to test out I plugged in
the ethernet cable and connected the USB
end to a power source I checked my route
of settings and thankfully have been
detected and assigned an IP address and
here I'm able to ping it and it works
just fine
however this was when I ran into
problems I was using ROS bein the Linux
distribution specifically made for the
Raspberry Pi which doesn't have SSH
enabled by default so I wasn't able to
actually SSH into the Raspberry Pi 0 at
all and since the only USB ports has
been taken up I couldn't plug in a
keyboard or a mouse or anything to get
it working so a quick fix I found was to
take the micro SD card out of the PI and
plug it into a specifically Linux
computer and then there'll be two
volumes there'll be a boot volume and
it'll be the main volume with the whole
filesystem so you want to open up that
file system and navigate to EG c /r c
dot local and then above the line exit
zero you want to add the following line
and this will enable SSH on oops so the
reason you have to use Linux is that I
put it in my Windows machine however it
only picks up the boots partition it
pick up the other partition however I'm
sure you can get that working it just
require a bit more work although I
haven't looked into that because this
works for me
so once you've ssh into the Raspberry Pi
you're free to configure it however you
like this is a simple script I've
written I haven't put too much thought
into it but you get the general idea all
it does here is every ten seconds it
will try to initiate a reverse shell to
the IP 192.168.1.1 port 1 2 3 4
obviously if you want to use this in a
real life scenario you'd be using in
public IP rather than a local IP here
however you get the general point and
you could add this to start up to have
it run and to just keep on cycling every
10 seconds to try and connect and once
it does connects back to you you will
have an entry point into the whole
network so that's it for this video if
you have any questions feel free to ask
down in the comments or better yet
during my discord server link in the
description so that we have a solid
community that's been going strong for a
cup of weeks now remember to Like and
subscribe if you haven't already and
also follow me on Twitter I'm at say
tonic so yeah I'll see you in the next
