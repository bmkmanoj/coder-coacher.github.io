managed to make an Arduino Pro micro
which executes Stucky scripts for my
micro SD card it can be easier to use so
here in part 1 I'll be covering how to
set it up an hour to use it and in part
2 I'll be showing you how to make it a
little sleeker by fixing it to a single
chip and how to use dip switches along
with it so you can easily switch between
dozens if not hundreds of different
ducky scripts on the same micro SD card
so let's get right into it so I'll
demonstrate it with this reverse shell
scripts are written link is in the
description so all I've done on the
script by the way all I need to do is
save the scripts on to the micro SD card
named scripts txt next put the micro SD
card into the reader plug it into the
computer and it works
no reprogramming of the Arduino needed
for each script just load a new script
onto the micro SD card and you're good
to go
in terms of hardware it uses an Arduino
Pro micro a micro SD breakout module and
a micro SD card and if you jump wise all
together costing barely $4 links to each
are in the description down below so in
order to set it up you'll need to go to
my website link is in the description
click the github project link and then
click clone or download and then
download zip once the zip is downloaded
you will need to open it up and save the
folder that's in there locally and then
open that folder and side there will be
another folder then you'll need to open
the quino micro SD arduino file and then
once that has opened up just make sure
your settings are correct and upload it
to your arduino pro micro so this script
is an interpreter i've written which
takes ducky scripts from a micro SD card
reads it and execute it sequentially
meaning theoretically Nomex script size
though there are some considerations
you'll have to take more on that later
next you need to connect your Arduino to
your breakout module so connect the pins
as shown here on the modules section
those are names of the pins on my module
however the names of the pins on your
module might differ slightly but they
should be vaguely similar then you'll
need to format your micro SD card to
fat32 finally just save your ducky
scripts onto your microSD cards name
script txt and then your sets pretty
much just plug it back into the module
and you're good to go now one last thing
I really recommend reading there keep in
mind section on the github page because
there are a few docker script features
which aren't yet implemented and there's
a couple of other things which you
should take into account so in part two
I'll be covering how to use dip switches
to switch
hundreds of different scripts you could
store on just one micro SD card as well
as how to mates think a little more
portable so you definitely won't want to
miss that remember to subscribe and
follow me on Twitter I'm at say tonic so
thanks for watching guys stay tuned for
more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
