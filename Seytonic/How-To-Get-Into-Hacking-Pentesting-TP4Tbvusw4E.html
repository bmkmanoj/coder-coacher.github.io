most requested video a lot of you guys
seem to be really interested in
quote-unquote hacking but just don't
know where to start so bear in mind I am
by no means an expert just think of me
as a fellow traveler giving you a nudge
in the right direction remember this is
a video showing you how to get into
hacking not how to become a lead tax or
I'm sure that we people who disagree
with this advice or there may be things
I've forgotten so just leave your
comments down below so firstly you're
going to need to know a programming
language not because you're going to be
programming all the time
but because you need to know how to
understand code for example if your pen
testing website and you get hold of the
source code for that site if you can't
read PHP to find its vulnerabilities
then you're screwed some good languages
to look at just starting out our PHP and
Python SQL is also good to know for
those SQL injections there are tons of
programming stores out there so there's
no lack of resources secondly there's
networking you need to know ports IP
addresses what MAC addresses what up
tables are etc there's a lot of random
stuff that comes in handy here if you're
new to this I suggest following elearn
security syllabus on networking you
don't need to buy their course just
follow their publicly available syllabus
once you've got the basics down look
into port scanning and art poisoning
this will help solidify your knowledge
once you have some networking and
programming down I recommend looking at
over the wire war games specifically
natus it's a series of levels where the
goal is to find the password of the next
level using your website a key knowledge
it's a lot of fun
but can be quite challenging then
there's Linux is what you'll probably be
using 90% of the time so you really need
to get used to it
I recommend downloading Kali VM image
from offensive security and using vmware
then just screw around with it a bit do
some exploring after which i suggest
learning how to use terminal and then
bash scripting for which there are
literally loads of resources online once
you find your feet you should try some
over the wire war games this time
bandits I really enjoyed these they put
your Linux skills to the test
like natus each levels objective is to
find the password for the next level but
this time using Linux magic also it's
very important to follow people and
organizations that do hacking related
things that you're interested in so
channels such as hack 5 and Samy Kamkar
Goods and here you could also subscribe
to me as well as follow me on Twitter
I'm at say tonic then there's probably
the most important skill which if you
don't possess then
is kind of no hope for you this is of
course googling your questions for every
problem you come across they've probably
been half a million people to have the
same problem as you so the solution will
probably be out there on the interwebs
for you to find if you rely on Reddit
and Stack Overflow to solve every single
problem you have then you're only going
to slow yourself down though do post on
those sites if your questions are more
esoteric in terms of hardware what
equipments you need well just a computer
really that you can install VMware on if
your computer can't handle VMware then
install Kylie onto a dedicated drive
there's no need to go out and spend
loads of money when you're just starting
off sure there's tools and gadgets that
can help you out but you don't need them
right away so those were the absolute
basics everything else is just building
upon what you already know what you
learn next is up to you and depends on
what you're interested in
I found wireless security interesting so
I looked at that I learned how to use
air crack since I already knew the
basics of networking internal usage
learning wireless security was mostly
easy though I should stress don't
blindly use tools look at how they
actually function and at least
understand what they're doing in the
background for you if you want to
actually make this a career and get a
job at some point then I've been told
offensive Security's OS CP is a great
start I'll probably be doing it early
next year so those were my general
thoughts on the topic there's no
absolute path to learning this stuff but
that's generally how I started out so
thanks for watching guys let me know
what you think was the gameplay in the
background too distracting I didn't
really want to have just a black
background by itself so I wanted to put
something there so yeah did you find
this advice useful do you have any
suggestions let me know in the comments
also don't forget to Like subscribe and
stay tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
