be showing you how you can turn an
ordinary USB stick into something a
little more sinister this little hack
will easily trick people into opening
any program or script to your stores on
just an ordinary USB flash drive so
let's get to it
right after this mal do we know is the
Arduino based bad USB inject keystrokes
at lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's deaths at wallpaper with the
elite version simply store and select
between up to 16 different scripts on a
micro SD card to find out more see the
link in the video description so let's
look at how this works so the victim
here will plug in an innocent-looking
USB Drive wondering what's on it upon
opening the drive you'll see a single
file that looks more or less like a
folder without thinking twice the victim
will double-click on that folder instead
of opening up a folder up opens a file
or any executable you've set it to open
and yes you can store that Exe file on
the USB stick itself you might be
wondering where it's towards more on
that in a sec so how is this done well
if we go back to the USB sticks
directory you notice that folder really
isn't a folder at all but rather
shortcuts denoted by the fact that it
says shortcuts here though most people
probably won't realize that so this
shortcut actually points to a file or
program that we've got in a hidden
folder also on this USB stick if we go
to view and select hidden items you'll
see this folder secret by opening that
this is our payload which in this case
is a pretty harmless bat file that
bromine's this could be an executable
this could be pretty much anything so by
opening this shortcut we are actually
opening this cyber nuke by proxy what
makes this trick even more convincing is
the folder icon on the shortcut windows
actually allows you to change the icon
on shortcuts with the precursor that
there's a small little shortcuts
identifier in the corner so with this
little hack it might be hard to trick
more seasoned computer people but for
the noobs and I'd say just people in
general you'll probably get them just
fine with this most people will probably
just see the folder icon it and assume
it's a folder 1 in what size they'll
just open it even if they do spot the
small shortcuts identifier they probably
won't even know what it means or if they
do shortcuts generally aren't associated
with threats so setting this whole thing
up is incredibly simple just plug in any
old USB Drive you want
and I'm gonna format mine just to make
sure it's squeaky-clean so firstly with
the drive open you're going to want to
create a folder to put your payload in
so just go to new folder just call it
whatever and go with the secret and then
right click it go to properties and
check hidden and tap ok so when your
victim opens this up they're not going
to see the folder at all unless they
have show hidden items enabled which
we're going to need to do in order to
deal with it so just open this up and
then drag in your payload in this case
I'm just going to use my Asst I have a
nuke from earlier that you could put in
an executable pretty much anything so
then go back to the drive and right
click new and go to shortcuts so in the
location just go to browse and select
your payload and there you go up next
and then put in anything a good enticing
name would be best to encourage people
to click it so I'm going to put free
food and now when we double tap this
it's opens the payload however it's not
very hidden at all it's kind of shows a
bat file icon here so right click go to
properties and then select shortcuts and
go to change icon ok on that and then
I'm going to select the folder icon
because it's the most inconspicuous ok
apply and then ok and now it just looks
like a normal folder of course we've got
show hidden items enabled that's why it
still shows the secret folder for us so
if I go to view uncheck that as it is
unchecked by default then you've just
got free food
so when you double click that you get
your payload and now you're free to just
go and plug it into pretty much any
Windows computer if that wasn't
blatantly obvious this will only work on
windows so bear that in mind and yeah it
works straight off the bat the folder
icon and the shortcuts all carry over so
everything here works so thanks for
watching guys I hope you enjoyed today's

always stay tuned for more hacking
