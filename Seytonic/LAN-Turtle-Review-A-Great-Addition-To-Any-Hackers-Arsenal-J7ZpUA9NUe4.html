just a USB Ethernet adapter but
something more sinister is going on here
in actual fact the turtle is a sysadmin
zwarst nightmare it can be directly
connected to a victim network via the
Ethernet port and then to a victim
computer or other power source after
which it will run a pre-programmed
module there's modules for spoof DNS
queries get a meterpreter shell tunnel
into the network there's a lot to choose
from having no hack five branding and
appearing in different from any other
USB Ethernet adapter makes it very
covert to non leet folk this would just
be a thing along other things plugs into
a computer being me I decided to open it
up and see what's inside two screws
later and Marin there's not much here
apart from a reset button just in case
you screw things up interestingly the
land has Lawrence the same chip as the
Arduino yen however given the yen is
more expensive there's not much point in
trying to get that to work here apart
from that I'm not going to pretend I
know much of what's going on here so
let's move on sat up was super simple
the land Tesla comes with an information
card which was all I needed to get it up
and running if you buy a part of the
hack five fuels kit you'll also get a
manual which contains new friendly
guides to the turtle's basic operation
this also came in handy as you'll see in
a sec after SS aging into the land
tassel you'll be presented with a basic
interface where you can change some
settings as well as download and
configure modules modules are how you
get stuff done they are small programs
which run on the turtle allowing you to
perform a variety of tasks modules are
easily downloaded there are about 20 to
choose from they're open source and I'm
sure you could write one yourself if
you're up to it
modules are also easy to setup simply
navigate to the config file and input
the parameters each of the modules are
well documented online though this was
when I realized the interface doesn't
like numpad for some reason and yes none
lock was on though here I configured a
DNS spoof all traffic to say tonic com
should be redirected to localhost then I
enabled the module DNS spoof and replug
the turtle and it works well kind of as
I discovered here my ISP blocks DNS
spoofing by default however this isn't a
limitation of the land tehsil I used
this example to get across the points
that this is not at all for newbies you
can't just use the land heads will
blindly and expect to get up you need to
be clever up the scripts use and
implement them properly in
opportunity after the DNS poof the land
turtle started acting weird
it wouldn't connect to LAN turtlecom and
attempts to configure modules were met
with errors googling the errors yielded
no results so I think this is an
isolated issue switching computers and
trying to toggle different options had
no effect so I consulted the manual like
it said I open the device and held the
reset button down for 3 seconds while
plugging it in I then went to its web
interface and uploaded the firmware I
found online
after a few restarts it's sprung into
life I'm not quite sure why this
happened maybe the DNS spoofing being
blocked had something to do it but it's
good to know what hard reset is quite
straightforward and to be honest if
you're the target market for this
spending five minutes to reflash some
firmware really shouldn't spook you
besides the irritant resurface after I
did the exact same thing for a second
time something to note is that the land
turtle doesn't have to be connected to a
computer to be of use here I have the
land turtle connect to a power bank
which should provide me about 48 hours
of juice so here I have the LANs whole
set up to provide remote access to the
network is connected to via Open VPN
making possible a remote pentest
all in all the land turtle is an
interesting tool there isn't anything to
compare it to as I really couldn't find
any alternatives that being said you
could probably hack together something
similar with the Raspberry Pi but that's
a project for another day so should you
buy one at $50 well if you're an actual
pen tester then I think the answer is an
obvious yes I really can't see any
downsides in that situation it's
discrete and feature full but if you're
hobbyist then the latter there's quite
blatantly more of a luxury than a
necessity as you're probably not going
to be using it to pen test however it
does have other uses too I'm mainly
going to be using mine to SSH into my
home network from wherever that way I
don't have to have my computer on all
the time so in conclusion the land
turtle is a great addition to any
arsenal the teething issues I face
really wouldn't put me off getting on so
thanks for watching guys for full
disclosure hack 5 did provides the land
turtle as a review copy but with no
strings attached
I think I've succeeded in giving in an
honest review so remember to like this
video if you liked it share and
subscribe if you haven't already follow
me on Twitter I'm at say tonic and stay
tuned for more hacking videos in
particular I'm going to be doing a
head-to-head of the Wi-Fi pineapple
tetra versus the Nano so you definitely
won't want to miss that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
