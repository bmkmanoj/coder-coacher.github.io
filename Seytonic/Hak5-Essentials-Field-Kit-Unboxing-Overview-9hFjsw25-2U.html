unboxing an overview of the hack five
fields gets so full disclosure this was
sent to me by the guys over at 5s and
very appreciative that though it said to
me with no strings attached
so yeah I'll put a link in the
description if you want to get your
hands on one of these so let's get right
into it so firstly we have the hack five
fill kits essentials of operation guide
so this is really useful I've read
through some of this already it's
essentially covers the setup and basic
operation of the lanter to Wi-Fi
pineapple Nano and the Rob lucky that
you get in this kit it's not a cheaply
thrown-together Chinese translation the
edge you put four times this which is
great to see also you get your stickers
which is the main thing many stickers
lots of stickers no shortage of stickers
that's great next let's look at the LAN
turtle so I haven't got around to using
this yet however the idea is you'll plug
victims Ethernet cable into this end and
then the other end into battery pack
mains or the victims computer and then
you're going to be able to tunnel into
this so this can act as a VPN and then
you'll be able to see and do everything
on the network that anyone else would so
that's awesome you can also plug it in
when it's plugged into a computer you
can easily get shells in computer so
that's great to see I will do a full
review of it of course when I get around
to using it so next is you must do
rubber ducky which I'm sure everyone on
this channel is familiar with by now
this is the real thing it comes with a
128 megabytes micro SD cards that's
already in there
it's very incognito no one's going to
suspect it's anything malicious once
it's plugged in so essentially this will
run a whole host of commands via
keyboard it'll pretend to be keyboards
and then plug into computer it can about
commands prompt and it will well you can
program it to delete stuff install stuff
give you access by different methods so
that's great definitely going to be
doing a video on this oh yeah and also
this will be relevant to the rubber
ducky you get a micro SD to USB adapter
it's what it's meant to come with a
little piece of string that attaches it
in here however I yanked it out of my
computer to
so the peas string broke off however
that's not too big a deal I'd probably
just store it as it is like this anyway
cuz it's quite compact so it's nice to
the included wine the kit and next you
get this so it is a full size USB to
micro USB adapter it's that'll calming
useful because you'll be able to plug it
into Android devices so I think hak5
recently did a video where they cracked
and fourth digit Android pincode with
this so if you want to check that out
just give it a quick search and you'll
find it I haven't tried that out myself
but I'm sure it will at some point so oh
yeah and with each of these devices
you're going to get a quick nice little
cards which details how to use it so for
the rubber duckie
it's quite easy to use the robe lucky so
everything you need to know is
essentially on this the land turtle
you've got your basic set up guide
though I'd refer to the book and of
course the main thing in here the thing
that were most looking forward to is the
Wi-Fi pineapple nano so this device has
two wireless cards in it so it allows
you to perform rogue access point
attacks man-in-the-middle attacks really
easily so that's great it comes with two
antennas here this only works on 2.4
gigahertz networks they also sent me a
Wi-Fi pineapple texture which I'll be
doing a comparison with this at some
point so the whole idea about this is it
makes it really easy it comes with a web
interface so there's no messing around
with a terminal when using this it's
easy to use and for a beginner it will
make things a whole lot easier but for
professional pen tester it will just
make your workflow and your life in
general a whole lot simpler so that's
awesome
oh and you've got the card flat of
course basic set up and then you've got
this for it
which is a USB splitter so the idea is
you plug this into here go in and then
you plug these
two USB sockets into your laptop so it
can get more power more juice to the
pineapple man oh that fortunately for my
laptop I've only got one port on either
side so this isn't going to be too much
help for me and of course you get the
whole kind of banking thing up and of
itself which has a load of space for
extra stuff you could put a battery pack
in here to power your devices and as you
saw at the beginning my layout I had
which was the devices here and then I
put a load more stuff in here so yeah
this has been my unboxing and overview
of the hack 5 filter kit if you want to
get your hands on one of these link will
be in the description down below
