quote-unquote Wi-Fi jana's or to use the
proper term D authors they're good fun
and actually quite interesting they'll
kick everyone or specific people off a
given Wi-Fi network if you want to find
out how to make one yourself for under
five dollars see the links in the video
description otherwise in this video I'm
going to be looking at how they actually
work and how the difference to real
Wi-Fi jammers so let's get to it right
after this mulled reno is the arduino
based bad USB you can use it to inject
keystrokes at lightning speed gain a
shell change someone's desktop wallpaper
to find out more see the link in the
video description so Wi-Fi jammers are
actually quite different from Wi-Fi the
authors though you'll probably have
noticed in previous videos I use the
term jammer entitles to describe at the
author as a word Guildford doesn't
really mean much to most people though
jammers and the authors essentially both
have the same effect you can't use your
Wi-Fi so a jammer
is a device essentially just tries to be
the loudest voice in the room times 10
it's all transmitted a load of nonsense
on the same frequency as what it's
trying to jam the surrendering any
communication between two legitimate
devices fruitless they just won't be
able to hear each other kind of like
someone playing Sonicare a Kinect on you
when you're just trying to watch your
favorite anime not all day Janna's are
pretty hard to come by you can't really
use a normal computer or Wi-Fi card as a
jammer you need specialist equipment
which will usually involve buying from a
sketchy looking website the authors are
really quite different they don't spew
nonsense at all they're not trying to
get in the way just by being allowed
quite the opposite really
so no sanic here adi offer could be a
laptop a cheaper module like this pretty
much any Wi-Fi chip that supports packet
injection so no specialist equipment
needed just some software really so how
do they work well the authors take
advantage of the fact that waif line of
itself is really badly designed now what
do I mean by that well let's go back to
basics why do we have passwords on our
Wi-Fi
well so you can stop people from
hitchhiking on your connection right yes
but also to stop people from snooping on
your data an unencrypted Network needs
all its data open to unscrupulous people
to spy on however even if your Wi-Fi is
secured with a password and therefore
encrypted only the data is encrypted so
your credit card information may be
secure but
something else to worry about management
frames management frames were used to
communicate basic tasks between a client
and an access point management frames
handled stuff like joining and leaving
the network the problem here is that
management frames are almost never
encrypted even if you're using wpa2 so
this allows us someone else on the
outside say for example pesky cheapo
Wi-Fi chip to send out to load of these
management frames in particular the
authentication frames these frames are
used to terminate a connection so you
just send out a load of these deal
frames to the clients pretending to be
the access point and the clients will
just be like oh ok and then disconnect
so your thing like I said means no
specialist equipment only a Wi-Fi chip
capable of packet injection there's a
good chance the computer you're watching
this on could perform a dual attack with
the right software and drivers so the
authentication attacks are really a lot
more targeted than jamming jamming
essentially will just block everything
within a given radius whilst a deaaath
attack can be targeted to affect just a
certain access point or even just an
individual client on a certain access
point now you're probably asking
yourself why don't we just encrypt some
management frames doesn't solve
everything right yes yes it would and
it's been done it's called a to 2011 W
it even exists it specifically protects
your sent occation frames perfect but
for some reason no one seems to use it
and when I say no one I mean
manufacturers the companies that make
your router phone laptop but just don't
implement it for some unknown reason the
more expensive enterprise-grade voters
seem to sometimes support it it's just
those plebs that can't seem to get it so
at this point I wanted to tell you how
you yourself could avoid such a deal for
tag unfortunately you can't just run a
piece of software to ignore the D
authentication frames as they work on
layer 2 of the OSI model hence you need
to modify some really low level drivers
together working which is kind of out of
the scope of this video I then tried to
search for a two 2.11 W enabled Reuters
and got nothing so sorry guys it seems
like you're on your own on this one if
you want to find out how to make your
own Wi-Fi the offer out of either your
laptop or a dedicated cheap device see
the links in the video description
otherwise thanks for watching guys I'll
probably be making another video on a
topic though covering the legality of
jammas and the author's so do subscribe
so you don't miss that remember to like
the video if you liked it
follow me on the Twitter's and the
instagrams and stay tuned for more
hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
