immediately start typing so what well
this is nulls we know it's pretends to
be a keyboard plug it in and it will
automatically type whatever you want at
lightning speed open command prompt and
initiator Rochelle or maybe just change
someone's desktop wallpaper anything you
can do to a computer with a keyboard and
fifty minutes of your time the mouse we
know can do by itself in just a matter
of seconds mild we know comes in two
flavors light and delete firstly this is
the light version it's the smallest of
the two it features a small LED to let
you know when it's doing and when it's
completed its mission and a small switch
flip it to put smiled we know into
programming mode so you can change its
payload without it running on your PC if
you even fit into many standard USB
cases the lights 30 kilobytes of onboard
memory is more than enough for most
scripts but if you need something with a
bit more power look no further than the
lights bigger brother the elite the
elite has been some time in the making
I've gone from using off-the-shelf
modules to having a working prototype on
the component level now other designs
are ready which is where you come in
more on that in a second the end
products will have a similar form factor
to the light but the prototypes
Illustrated speech as well the elite
stores its payloads on a micro SD card
meaning you can still multiple scripts
on a single mult we know and
conveniently switch between them using
the onboard set of bit switches here I'm
switching between multiple payloads
using the dip switches as a binary input
the elite is ready to be made it just
needs your backing but tells you program
such beastly devices
well it's called meld we know for reason
is based on Arduino so you can use
Audrina's free built-in libraries to
program it directory or if you'd prefer
something a bit easier write a script
and ducky code a simple new friendly
language which is quickly becoming a
standard with the lights you could then
use a free converter tool and upload the
scripts your mod we know or if you're
using the elite it's even easier just
copy the script to a micro SD card and
you're done in keeping with the spirits
pods we know all project files will
become open-source once we start
shipping so far I've covered the
developments of multi we know out of my
own pockets to proceed I need your
guys's help
Malvina will only enter production with
your backing so head over to IndieGoGo
and take a look
you can get your hands on a mild we know
for just 13 pounds all that's 15 $16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
