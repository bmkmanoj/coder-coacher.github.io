Wi-Fi enabled bad USB I highly suggest
you watch my previous video first that's
linked in the description so here's the
tutorial on how to hack one together
multi new is an open-source arduino
based bad USB you can use it to inject
keystrokes at the lightning speed gain a
show change someone's desktop wallpaper
anything you can do with a keyboard and
15 minutes of your time
molds we new can do in a matter of
seconds to find out more see the
IndieGoGo link in the description so
there's two ways of making this one is
easier but you'll end up with a bulkier
end product the other is a little more
tricky but you'll end up with something
a lot smaller so for the first method
you'll need a we must be one mini or no
than Cu and an Arduino pro micro also
one of these adapters will come in handy
so you can afford go the micro USB cable
so if you want to make one of these
ourselves I'll put links in the
description to everything you'll need
for this setup
okay so first we're going to need to
flash our we must do on mini node MSU or
whatever you're using so go to this link
know Dempsey flasher I'll leave it in a
description go to win 64 and will
download this XC okay so then you're
going to need to go to the Wi-Fi duct it
gets our page this is all made by space
on out leave his Twitter link in the
description of course go to releases and
downloads the four megabytes bin file
just a quick intermission from future
stay tonic here if you seem to have
problems with your Wi-Fi dock then
instead of a four megabyte pin fall use
the one megabyte bin file but make sure
to keep all the instructions from here
on in exactly the same okay so then open
your node MCU flasher I've got mine here
go to Advanced tab make sure your border
eight slash size and all this stuff it's
exactly the same as mine then go to
operation and under comport you might
see one or two already there but just go
and plug in your we must be on mini
five-year micro USB port and another one
will come up here so I'm gonna use
number ten and in config make sure you
select that bin file we just downloaded
mine's already selected here and then we
should be good to flash so just go into
flash
and this will take about 30 seconds ish
so just leads us to do its thing so once
that's done you can just go and unplug
your d1 mini and we can move on okay so
now we're done with the d1 mini it see
understand so let's go to the Wi-Fi dock
you main page go to Arduino Wi-Fi duct
click on the Ino file we'll go to see
the raw code will control a and just
copy all of this and next open up a
blank sketch in your arduino ide and
just paste all of this code in then plug
in your pro micro and we can go to tools
board make sure or do we know genuine no
micro is selected under port select so
whichever one it is and we can click
upload and you might need to save it
somewhere before uploads so let's just
let it do that okay so now we're pretty
much almost done we just need to connect
up the arduino and do one mini right so
i'm showing you guys this bit on the
breadboard though i highly suggest you
solder it to make it a bit more
practical so the TX pin on the Arduino
should be connected to the rx pin on the
d1 mini and the rx pin on the Arduino
should be connected to the TX pin on the
d1 mini and then just connect the
Arduino raw pin to 5 volts on the d1
mini and simply connect the ground to
ground and that's it pretty much
so to give it go and see how it works
search for nearby networks and connect
to Wi-Fi duck with password quack-quack
then open up a browser and go to one
ninety two dot one sixty eight dot 4.1
and then we can test it by going over to
the live execute tab and in here I'll
just type GUI now this is a command to
bring up the Start menu in Windows so if
I run script and head on over to the
computer we should see that the Start
menu Vigo it works so you could go from
here and do some research and ducky
scripts watch my previous video to see
what you can do with this thing and
you're good to go okay now for the
slightly more complicated method I was
planning on
you how to do this on a breadboard
though it seems to be very unreliable
whether that's due to straight pass
turns on the breadboard interference or
whatever I don't know if you want to do
it this way you just have to solder
everything together and hope for the
best so to build this slightly sleek a
device you will need an esp8266 module
on arduino pro micro and at adapter to
plug it in of course and a 3.3 volt
regulator to power the ESP module as
always links to all this stuff will be
in the description so firstly you're
going to have to connect and solder
everything up in this configuration I
suggest you use very small gauge wire
for best results so keep in mind it'll
be quite fiddly ok so once that's all
soldered down you can go to the flash
over arduino link in a description
scroll down and copy all of this code
and paste it into your arduino ide and
then make sure you've got your pro micro
in your computer go to tools make sure
the right board and port is selected and
you can go and upload that so
this script allows us to program our ESP
module using the arduino essentially so
once that's done uploading we can go and
download the latest release so for most
people if you're using the link that I
put in the description you're going to
need to use a four megabytes one four
megabyte bin file so if you're using a
different module maybe an ESP o seven
then the one megabyte is probably going
to be the one you use so download the
four megabyte in file and let's go and
also downloads the node MCU flasher I've
a link to that in the description as
well and open your flasher go to
advanced to make sure your settings are
exactly the same as mine unless of
course you're using an ESP f7 or
something like that
in which case you're going to want to
select one megabyte for flash size go to
config make sure you have a bin file
that you've just downloaded selected
here mine's already selected and we can
go ahead and click flash just something
else to mention you might want to unplug
and replug your whole setup Pollard we
know ESP thing once you've uploaded that
previous Arduino sketch because
sometimes it might not recognize this
straightaway
and if this whole uploads process
doesn't seem to work for you then try
the one megabyte bin file because that
can't because the 4 megabyte can
sometimes cause issues so if you are
using a 1 megabyte bin file on advice
which usually takes a full megabyte bin
file then you still need to make sure
you have 4 megabytes or flash size
selected ok so now that's done ok so
once that's done go back to the why
photo get hub page and click on Arduino
Wi-Fi duct click on Ino file viewers raw
and control they just copy the whole
thing and paste it into your Arduino IDE
there we are make sure your promoter is
plugged in go to tools make sure
everything is selected and hit upload
ok so one more thing before we should be
good to go so we're looking at the
wiring again here and you can see this
GPIO 0 is connected to ground well we're
going to want to go ahead and cut this
wire here these solder it's do what you
have to do just make that dead so in the
end it should look like if I just add
this back because we still need ground
connects to grounds and GPIO 15 connect
to the grounds we just need to remove
GPIO 0s connection to ground because
when GPIO 0 is pulled low it's held for
ESP module that it's going to be
programmed which of course we don't need
because it's already been programmed so
just make that happen
and we should be good until the end you
should end up with a pretty sleek
looking device to test that it works
just do the same thing I did whether we
must be 1 mini earlier in the video so
that's it guys I hope you enjoy that I
hope this worked for you because I know
it took a long time for me to get this
video together sorry I haven't uploaded
much recently I've been busy with multi
nose and various things so yeah if you
liked this video make sure to slap like
subscribe if you haven't already and
follow me on Twitter and say tonic and
stay tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
