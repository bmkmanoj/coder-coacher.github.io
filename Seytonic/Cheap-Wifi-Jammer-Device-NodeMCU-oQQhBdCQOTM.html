weeks ago it's an IOT development board
it's like an Arduino in that you can
interface with it via the pins turn on a
few LEDs use some sensors however it
says Wi-Fi so it's great for projects
that need internet access it's pretty
awesome the things you can do with it
though today I'm going to be looking at
turning us into a Wi-Fi camera or a deal
so to be more accurate so let's get into
it right after these messages
mark we know is an open-source arduino
based bad USB you can use it to inject
keystrokes at lightning speed gain a
shell change someone's desktop wallpaper
anything you can do with the keyboard
and 15 minutes of your time
mods we no can do in a matter of seconds
to find out more see the indiegogo link
in the description so this is anode MCU
it's what this project revolves around
I've left links in the description to
where you can buy one of these they're
insanely cheap only a couple of dollars
from China so I was tweeted by one
Stephan kremzer linking this project
turning this into it the author so
that's what I'm going to be covering
today so I'll show you what it can do
and then show you how to set it up so
once you've set it up you just need to
apply power to its micro USB port using
a battery pack computer laptop whatever
though here I'm going to be powering it
from my android phone using a micro USB
to USB cable and OTG adapter allowing me
to plug the full sized USB end into my
phone next you just need to search for
available Wi-Fi networks and log in to
the one called pones using the password
to the author then just open up web
browser and navigate to 192.168.0.1 and
you'll be presented with a nice web
interface so I can go ahead and just
scan for nearby Wi-Fi access points and
it will present me with a few and I'm
just going to test us on a la mal
because well that's my network and I'm
just going to show you how it works
so then in a top bar I'm just going to
go straight to attack skipping clients
so it's going to present me with a few
options though I'm just going to hit
deals all as well that's the main one so
let's give that go and I'll show you
they does actually work so if I bring my
laptop you can see that it's connected
to Wi-Fi with a pretty strong signal
however when I start authenticating with
the nodes you'll see it it will actually
disconnect from the Wi-Fi network and
it'll just say Wi-Fi connecting and it
will keep on trying to connect however
it will never actually succeed because
as soon as it connects it will just be
do authenticated by those packets
straightaway so it's just a continuous
cycle and no one will be able to connect
to the network so this also does a few
other things which are arguably a lot
more fun so if I enable beacon spam and
disable deals all and go to my nearby
Wi-Fi networks you'll see that some
getting spammed with a load of a low
mouse so anyone trying to connect to the
network
Alamo is just going to be confused as to
which one's connect to and it's just
going to give them a massive headache so
some of them have got dots in front of
them however those do disappear after a
few seconds so it just becomes really
confusing and it will it's just good fun
to see people's reactions so the more I
can go ahead and disable beacon spam and
instead enabled random beacon spam so
this will do essentially the same thing
but instead of spamming the same SSID it
will instead spam load of well random
network names so if you give it a few
minutes to populate a massive list it
will just become it insanely annoying
for anyone scrolling through to find the
one they want to connect to another nice
feature is that you can target specific
devices so if you go to the clients tab
and hit scan it will scan for a load of
nearby computers laptops phones whatever
it might be so it will disconnect you
from this Wi-Fi networks that the node
has created however ten seconds later it
will automatically reconnect you so as
you can see it's found a few things and
if I select both of those and then go to
the attack tab I can actually just do
authenticate those specific devices
instead of deal fence gating everything
that's connected to that Wi-Fi network
you could even just plug this thing into
a power bank and let it just keep on
going for ages here with this Genki set
up on seeing how much current it draws
so it's about let's call it 19 milliamps
I've tested it while do your thing and
it's about the same 90 ish so if well
this battery pack is about 10,000
milliamp hours ten thousands divided by
90 it's about 110 so that's at least
four solid days of the other things you
could just leave this somewhere for four
days and just be also on which would
well you'd have to be a bit of a prick
to do it but that's up to you so on
second thoughts I don't think I'll show
how to set it up to github pages linked
in the description it's really easy to
do the instructions are
simple and easy to follow and the
screenshots so I don't really think
there's much I can add in terms of
toriel on setup remember I put links in
the description as to where you can get
all of a no dempsey they're very cheap
so I do suggest you buy one even if you
don't want to do this project they're
really good fun to mess around with so
that's that for this video if you have
any questions feel free to ask them in
the comment section down below
or better yet you're on my disc Club
server link is in the description
remember to follow me on Twitter I'm at
satellite and check out smolt we know if
you haven't already link is in the
description for that so yeah thanks for
watching and stay tuned for more hacking
