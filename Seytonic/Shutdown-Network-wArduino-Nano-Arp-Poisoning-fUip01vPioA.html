cheap IOT device into something
resembling a Wi-Fi jammer but here we're
going wired using an Arduino Nano and an
Ethernet shield as an RPR spammer plug
it into a target network and it will
some unsolicited up responses rendering
an entire network useless so let's see
how it's done right after this mult we
know is an open source arduino based bad
USB you can use it to inject keystrokes
at the lightning speed gain a shell
change someone's desktop wallpaper
anything you can do with the keyboard
and 15 minutes of your time
mold we no can do in a matter of seconds
to find out more see the IndieGoGo link
in the description if you want to make
this project yourself you'll need an
Arduino Nano and an e NC 28 g 60
Ethernet shield for where you can get
these see the links in the video
description ok so this whole system
works by using what's known as up
responses every computer every device
connected to a network has what's known
as an ARP table so I've got a Kali Linux
VM open here and if I were to type up in
the terminal it's going to list me all
the devices on the network that I have
communicated with and their
corresponding MAC address so you can see
here it's got its address BT home hub
this local host name and it's
corresponding MAC address that's because
when you're sending packets across a
network instead of addressing it to a
certain IP address you'll address it to
a MAC address so that's why you need an
ARP table because IP addresses can
change while MAC addresses are static so
this just links the MAC address with its
IP address so you'll see here it's only
got one that's because I've only ever
communicated with my default gateway in
this session because you need to know
that ARP tables are updated constantly
and when you shut down your computer
turn it on the art table is flushed
essentially it's updated very regularly
so if I were to say if I wanted to ping
my iPhone which is on the network ID to
ping as I know my iPhones IP address its
local IP is this one line two dot one
six eight dot one dot 65 so when I press
enter here my computer will check this
list and it will see that this IP
address is not in this table so it will
send out a request to all the other
devices connect to the network it will
ask everyone on the network does anybody
have the MAC address that this IP
address is connected to and someone else
on the nelq will respond with its MAC
address and then I'll be able to
communicate with it so if I press ENTER
here give it a second it will say its
unreachable and us just because Apple is
funny and it doesn't want people pinging
iPhones I'd imagine that's just me
guessing but if I were to go and check
my art table again you'll see that
you've got John T's iPhone with its
corresponding MAC address that's because
it's asked someone else on the network
what is the MAC address and then it's
added it to its internal table here so
if I wants to communicate with my iPhone
in the future it's not going to have to
ask anybody it just knows what its MAC
address is and it can communicate with
it directly so where this gets
interesting is if I go in open I find it
here
Wireshark so this is a piece of software
that comes pre-installed on Kali oh no
what am i doing comes pre-installed in
Kali and it essentially allows us to
sniff networks look at all the frames
look at all the packets that are going
back and forth between our computer in
the network so as you can see I've got
up here so this is only showing me ARP
requests and our press on sirs
it looks pretty bare at the moment but
when I plug in our Arduino Nano with
Ethernet shield I'm plugged in chassis
up though these are to go are now up
requests and responses happen constantly
so you're going to see a few before I
plug this in when I plug this in with it
with the codes already pre-loaded on it
let's see it okay if we give it a second
this whole list should light up okay
there you go
so I'm make this full screen if we can
okay so you can see that it's sending a
load of ARP responses so it will say
192.168
1.25 4 which is my default gateway is at
this MAC address that's the ultimate of
Nano sending that to all the devices on
the network as you can see it's a
broadcast to that say no it's sending it
to everyone so this is a fake MAC
address it's not the real MAC address of
the router itself it's just it just
keeps on spamming hey the router that
you've been communicating with for the
past wherever it's MAC address has
changed and this creates a lot of chaos
because if I were to open Firefox now
and try and go to something on the
Internet
fence security here if I open up a load
of tabs you'll see problem loading page
because instead of going to the router
which it's done in the past to get
information
it's instead go to this Sony MAC address
here which we've already established
isn't actually the MAC address of the
router itself but rather the MAC address
of the Arduino Nano and obviously the
Arduino Nano isn't connected to the
Internet so if you try to connect to
your internet through the Arduino Nano
it's just going to give you an error so
that's what this does so if we scroll
down you'll see that it keeps on sending
them and as soon as I unplug this device
it stops a lot of focus for allowing SEO
stops it's no longer sending them
however as it's no longer sending them
other devices and computers on the
network will now slowly begin to realize
and updates there are tables to reflect
the real MAC address of the router so
I've given it a minute or two to update
and now if I try and load a page it
works so yeah no harm done so to set it
up you need to take it you thin it
shield to take you're doing a nano but
the Nano on top of the shield push down
and you're done just try not to look at
the questionable Chinese soldiering for
too long as it can burn the back of your
retina so secondly you're going to need
to download the code so I'll leave the
link in the description for the Arduino
ARP spoof github page of course made by
space one who makes a lot of course
stuff I'll leave this links in the
description so yeah you just need to
download this and open it up in the
Arduino IDE
once you've got the sketch open plug in
your Arduino Nano go to tools make sure
you've got Arduino Nano selected and 18
mega 328 and the correct sport then I'll
just go ahead and click upload so when
you're ready to plug it into your router
of course you're going to need an
Ethernet cable but you will also need a
power supply I'm afraid so
most rooters come with USB ports on them
nowadays the modern ones at least so you
can just plug it into one of those or
power bank or whatever and that's done
and then you can simply sit back and
watch hell ensue and you saw was a
really smart I need it for the video Jim
in the middle of a calm you're recording
this on you
anyhow I think you get the general idea
so yeah if you have any questions feel
free to leave those in the comments
subscribe if you haven't already if you
liked the video remember to like it
follow me on twitter i'm at say tonic
and stay tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
