be a keyboard injecting malicious
keystrokes and fast there's quite a few
different permutations though previously
I've show you how to make one out of
nothing bits nard we know Pro micro and
an adapter but here here we're going
Wireless so let's get to it right after
this mult we know is an open-source
arduino based bad USB you can use it to
inject keystrokes at the lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's desktop
wallpaper anything you can do with the
keyboard and 15 minutes of your time
well do we new can do in a matter of
seconds to find out more see the
indiegogo link in the description this
is the latest iteration of the bad USB
craze it's made of an arduino pro micro
and micro USB to USB adapter and a 3.3
volt regulator to power the esp8266
wireless module by the way this whole
system the design the codes everything
was developed by space on his github and
twitter links are in the description
mine is a bits okay very messy with
wires do i recommend some time and
patience you could make this thing
really clean compact I tried to find a
case to 3d print but none of the ones I
could find on Thingiverse seem to fit so
maybe by the time I make my next video
that tutorial and how to actually make
this I'll have so as designed one myself
so what's the actual deal on this thing
well the whole idea is that once plugged
in and connected to a computer it will
remain dormant waiting for you to
connect to it via Wi-Fi once connected
you can navigate to its address and type
in ducky script so if you don't know
what ducky script is in essence it's a
very simple language which makes
automating keyboard injection easy so to
type of string into the computer you'd
put string and then your text or you
could do something a bit more malicious
like open the Start menu a command
prompt then execute the download of a
virus reverse shell or what have you
want I put some other links down in the
description if you're new to it I want
to find out more with this you could
even upload a whole range of scripts and
run them up will as long as it's
connected then you're within range you
can keep all executing scripts if you
want to make one of these yourself I've
put links in the description to
everything you'll need if it's projects
you'll need a pro micro an esp8266
module a 3.3 volt regulator and the
whigs micro USB to USB adapter overall
it's not to privacy and definitely
as for build instructions the github
page is links below which has them
however if you don't know what you're
doing then I imagine it can get a little
tricky so I'll have a tutorial and how
to make this coming very soon so
remember the links are down below so you
can get everything before I make the
tutorial so I think the applications of
this are way more gids worth screwing
with people rather than penetration
testing or something along those lines
imagine sticking this in a teacher's
computer and continuously
surreptitiously x.q some scripts during
class sounds like fun though future
developments are also something to look
forward to automatically connecting this
to a Wi-Fi hotspot controlling it from
afar will also be awesome so thanks for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
if you liked it remember to well like it
subscribe if you haven't already follow
me on Twitter I'm apps a tonic and stay
tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
