USB rubber ducky I've looked at quite a
few different solutions if you haven't
been following them I'll leave Inc in
the description down below to a playlist
but anyhow this is my latest creation
it's probably as bare-bones that you're
going to get it has pretty much all the
same functionality as my previous
projects the arduino pro micro USB
rubber ducky thing which has a micro SD
reader and a set of dip switches so here
we have an 80 mega 32 youthful breakup
board it looks like there's a lot going
on here but it's essentially just a chip
on board with a few connectors to make
it breadboards compatible it's the same
microcontroller that the arduino pro
micro uses so that's why I'm using it
though the board itself is actually
quite pricey it cost about 10 pounds
ships though funny thing is these when I
do get round to making a PCB version of
this which I'm sure it will I'll
probably just although a load of these
Pro microwaves from China and pull the
chip off them because this is about
three dollars this whole solution and
the chip itself in the UK is well more
than three dollars so it's cheaper to
buy the whole Pro micro and just take
the chip off it than to buy the chip by
itself in the UK plus you get the
Arduino Pro the opt we know bootloader
prints stalled on the chip so that's
nice bonus
quite convenient so next we have the
micro SD reader so since I only have one
micro SD breakout board and it's kind of
been butchered for this I thought I'd
Frankenstein my own together so it's a
micro SD to SD adapter but with a few
legs soldered on these pits pads by the
sides are not in use so that makes it a
little easier so well that does make it
a little bits we you might think it
makes it cheaper and easier because I
don't have to use the breakup boards it
does throw up a few problems so this
micro SD bronzer three all micro SD
cards we ran out 3.3 volts whereas the
whole the whole 80 mega 32 you for chip
runs at 5 volts so they can't really
talk to each other without blowing one
of them up so I had to make a few
changes so we've got the voltage
regulator which gives me a nice 3.3
volts but then of course this is storing
at 3.3 volts so I've had to use a what
is called
logic level shifter converter translator
depending on who you ask
so this converts the 3.3 volts data
lines to 5.5 volts and vice versa so
these two things can talk to each other
without killing each other though funny
thing is this I didn't have a spare
voltage regulator handy so I've had to
pull wit off my self-destructing SSD
projects which I think can see the three
yeah I just wiggled until it fell off
and I've had to solder some new legs to
it to give a new lease of life but hey
it works so next we have the 16
megahertz crystal and a few capacitors
to make everything work nicely
and a set of dip switches because they
fit on the board so why the hell not and
we have a capacitor here just to make
things work nice leaks the datasheet
told me to put it in and for the USB
connector I'm using just a normal USB
cable but I've split it to give me the
four separate lines the data positive
negative five volts and ground so I've
split that and sold it on some jumper
wires and they're color coded so that's
nice and the data lines form through a
couple of resistors till they go to the
board so on the chip I have loaded my
adduct window project which incidentally
I've done a whole video on so I'll put
the link in the description for that so
how that works pretty much is I've got a
few scripts on the micro SD card which
then here then I can choose the script I
want using the dip switches so when this
is plugged in via USB this will read the
scripts off the S micro SD cards and
interpret it and then run it essentially
so if I fall it's on the right one yep
selected so if I plug it in I'll show
you they it does actually work so let's
see if it does anything profound if my
tripod will cooperate so point up over
here yeah yeah yeah it works that wasn't
funny don't know I did that anyway
now this obviously isn't practical as
it's quite large however I'm going to be
making a PCB version of this pretty soon
as soon as I get my head around it all
so by the end it should fit on to us
more boards quite nicely I do have some
other ideas a woman adds this to make it
even more brutal though you're going to
have to wait for those in a later video
so make sure you hear that sub button so
you don't miss it
I
do you know some other people are making
their own PCB versions of this however I
want to make my own because it looks
quite fun and the end result should be
pretty cool and plus if I can make a
couple of videos on it so thanks for
watching guys I hope you found this
video at least mildly interesting if you
liked it remember to hit that like
button subscribe if you haven't already
also follow me on Twitter I'm at say
tonic for more frequent updates and stay
tuned for more updates this project and
other hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
