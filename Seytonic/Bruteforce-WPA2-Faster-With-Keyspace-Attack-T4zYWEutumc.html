capturing a Wi-Fi networks for way
handshake and cracking it using a
dictionary attack however most people
are just going to leave the default
password that came on their router as it
is which tends to be a bunch of random
numbers and letters so it's impossible
to crack that right well let's look at
bt Reuters their Reuters only come with
passwords using lowercase letters A
through F and numbers 2 through 9 and
the password is always 10 characters
long so using this information we can
exclude all other characters and lengths
and launched a targeted brute-force
attack reducing the characters we need
to consider from this to this so
cracking this part with my hardware
would just take a few days but it gets
worse dongles seem to be really bad at
default passwords this wireless song of
ever had for ages only uses a default
password with numbers 0 through 9 and
it's always 8 characters long I managed
to crack it in just a few minutes so how
would you go about taking advantage of
this well firstly you need to identify
the manufacturer and model of the router
which isn't that hard seeing that this
information tends to always be in the
name of the wireless network next you
need to find the key space of the
password for the route you're working
with check the link in description I've
created a load of default key spaces for
major routers then you're going to need
to capture the 4 handshake which
contains the password hash we're going
to crack watch the first half of my
previous video I'll put the link in
description for that so next we're going
to want to use hash caps to go through
and try all the different possible
password combinations so I'm on Windows
so I'm going to have to download it from
this link up in the description you just
need to download the hash cap binaries
but if you're using Carly or something
like that it will come pre-installed
with that so you won't have to worry ok
so once you've got hash cats unzipped
and in a directory along with the hCAP
file are going to be cracking in the
same directory we can go ahead and open
up a command prompt and CD into that
directory we're going to be working with
so next you're going to want to go ahead
and configure hash Katz to crack that
particular hash so I mash cat 64 dot X
dot exe and next we're going to need to
tell it that we're going to be using WPA
or wpa2 hashes so we could do that with
- M 2500
then we're going to use in
attack method 3 that's brute force as we
need to tell it the while we're going to
be cracking set crack taught edge cut
for me so next you're going to need to
define the key space you're going to be
using so for me that's going to be what
we need to do - one which is defining
key space 1 and then you're going to
need to put in all the different
characters which could possibly come up
in your key space so I'm going to do
that a through F 2 through 9
so it's ABCDEF and then did that work
out
yup it did cool so now we need to tell
it that it's 8 characters long which
could be different for you but for me
it's 8 so we do that by question mark 1
8 times 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
okay so wpa wpa2 attack method 3 the
file and then your custom key space
setup which is a through F 2 3 line for
me and then 8 characters long so if say
for example in my previous example
you're only using letters or numbers and
it's not a custom key space in that
you're only using certain letters and
certain numbers you can go ahead and use
their built in car sets which are here
so question mark L would be all the
lowest case letters question might you
be the up case then so on so if I was
going to go and do say for example the
previous one which is 0 through 9
I could you question mark D so I
wouldn't even have to define a key space
so I could do question might be 8 times
4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 yeah okay so I could
just go and press ENTER on that and now
it's gonna go ahead and set everything
up you might notice your fan start
kicking in and everything starts getting
a little warm but that is it to be
expected of course so when it's done
which could take seconds hours years
maybe depending on the key space and the
power of your GPU which are using
because of course hash caps uses GPU
it will spit out the correct password
which it's found here so this is great
it works 100% of the time it's just a
matter of time essentially waiting for
it to get cracked so that's it this
video guys
I've well I just wanna say I've started
the channel last week ish and it's had
such an overwhelmingly positive response
which is great so I'm really grateful of
that so yeah if you have any questions
just leave them down in the comments and
I'll be sure to answer them remember to
like and subscribe and oh yeah following
on Twitter I am at sa tonic and thanks
