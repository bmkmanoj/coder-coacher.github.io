[Laughter]
that we just found a USB stick on the
floor right six thinking of ideas with
Priestley yeah someone left the tear why
we weren't obviously our passports were
to plug it in yeah we put it in a power
supply first to check if it's either you
specula or something but it's mine if
it's you speak in song that's more yeah
I'd like it's a colleague without
internet so you if it's doing something
that's another exit where they open with
yeah
so I wants to plug it into a Windows
machine the engineer TV every winter no
yes not for you don't blame it I mean he
likes the sound when it turns on yeah
yeah that's the only thing that's why I
bother - for you know we would like with
the unlocking click here to create the
property right would it be that's my
Leichner can't can't plug it in one
question has come up is that all of
these in recording packets from
different channels how do you
synchronize them into one file where the
idea was the idea was that we send
packets out from another device with the
time stamp on each channel so later when
we merge it we can search for these
specific packets let me know at this
point where the packet was received
there was that exact time stamp we can
we get synchronized but we would it's a
bit complicated you need to write a
software first to send out these packets
and we need to write a software to merge
and
fix the time stands afterwards each one
has a different wrong time stamp a
different wrong time yeah because they
start at zero so this guy came by strips
strips to very quiet there is a
dedicated access point on the top on the
top okay cool
sure hope you control it I will try now
you know I had my thoughts to my wife
I'll and my phone water connected to a
network really yeah really
hopefully nothing that's weird too bad
happened and is trying to crank one of
those handshakes
what's you testing into the dictionary
attack yeah the default rockeo txt that
its installed on comes with cardi take
an hour
yeah yeah and probably won't find it
whatever and we got my computer that
high stakes
it's a CPU based I mean Eric only runs
on the CPU okay if you're honored with
hash codes over GPO and you have a good
graphics card well then they're gonna
make you a fake ID whereabouts
whereabouts to guarantee wants to be
German to stay in Europe for exit funny
funny funny so I just feel that to form
for a fake German lady
they make them here and c3 apparently
it's standing for devices in the Wi-Fi
network we've seen enough by the top
we're having a second see the number of
the talk that's how many Wi-Fi devices
are here so many types and well that's
insane
alright right now
oh my god what you think oh my god
are you fit away say Tony the religious
states army is great we found a lot of
funny SS IDs so I I'm programming the
ESP now to minimize it
wait can we just what happened what
happened he blinded the wrong way - yeah
no I'm okay Lola good there's - but he
put it in this way but you haven't lost
from the baby and I have to play that
like it smells let's go they all look at
Logan achievement we can achieve a pop -
why not he was a friendly it isn't user
friendly what is this I made the music
CDs not protective against years reverse
polarity
this is the old one it's actually been
able to control these LEDs so how have
you managed to any other Python program
yeah we are president
