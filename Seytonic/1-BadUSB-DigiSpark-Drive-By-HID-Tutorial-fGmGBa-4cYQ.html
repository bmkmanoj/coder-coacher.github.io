my previous video entitled one dollar
USB rubber ducky in that video I did a
review of it so in this video I'm going
to do a tutorial and show you how you
can get it set up and working as a
proper USB rubber ducky so firstly
you're going to want to make sure you
have the arduino ide installed i've got
mine here link will be in the
description if you don't already have it
secondly we're going to need to download
some drivers so this link will also be
in the description and you're going to
want to scroll down and download
did you stamp driver store zip okay I'll
save that open say that to my desktop
okay next in this folder you're going to
have to install DP into 64 thanks great
so make sure each drive has got a tick
next to it if it doesn't just run it
again and you should be okay with that
okay so next you can close all that
previous stuff and open your arduino ide
we're going to want to go to file
preferences and then where it says
additional board manager urls you're
going to want to copy and paste the or
the URL i've linked in the description
below and press ok okay so next you're
going to want to go to tools and board
and then go to boards manager okay just
give it a second to load and then where
it says type you're going to want to
click the box and selects contributed
okay now we're going to unselect did you
stumped AVR boards by digi stump and
press install okay so that's going to
take a few minutes or a few seconds
depending
so once it's installed you can close
that previous window and we're going to
want to go to tools board and then
select did you spark default sixteen
point five megahertz and then we want to
go to file examples and then right down
the bottom where you see all the
digispark options you can want to go to
digital at keyboards and then keyboard
okay cool
next you're going to need to go to tools
and programmer and change it to USB tiny
isp or rather it doesn't say that in any
of the guides if you're looking at but
it only works me when i select that so
that's why i want to show you how to do
okay so next you're going to need to
don't plug in your did you spark at this
point just press upload okay it should
compile fine and then it'll say plug-in
device now so I will plug in my digits
block okay and you might get some
drivers installing but that's completely
normal okay so I'll just press ok and
you can see in the bottom it will say
starting to uploads start to muse app
and then micronucleus done thank you
so now it's completely done essentially
so if I were to put my cursor in here
and then it will just type hello
digispark every 5 seconds later you
think yeah five seconds because there's
a five-second delay so now it's pretty
much all working we just need to figure
out how to program it so let's get to
that so it's really not hard to write
your own scripts however I'm going to
explain the simple scripts I've written
which is going to simply open up ones
prompt and after that it should be
pretty self-explanatory on how I should
write your own scripts so firstly the
Digi keyboards test scripts or rather
example script puts in the send key
strict zero it says it works makes it
work with all the computers but whatever
I just left it in the next thing I've
done is set a delay of 5,000
milliseconds which is five seconds using
digital delay 5,000 after that I've
pressed the Windows key which is what
this line does the left Windows key digi
keyboard send keystroke zero multi to I
left so I from my testing it doesn't
work if you just put mod to you I left
for whatever reason however if you put 0
comma mod you I left it does work so I'm
not too sure why but that's how it works
and then after that I put another delay
of one second and then it's simply
prints CMD so there's windows prints CMD
so you can use prints to print any
string of characters it doesn't really
matter
okay so after that there's another delay
of one second and we ignore this because
it's commented out for just a second and
then after that it sends a keystroke
enter so I'll put this
in the description but you can have a
look at the source code for digit
keyboard dot h and you can go through it
and look at the different keys they use
so if you're just doing say for example
digit keyboards print and CMD you can
just put that in as it is however if you
want to send keystrokes individually you
can have to refer to this document which
is going to list all the different keys
that you can use so it's pretty obvious
when you look at this you can use f keys
spacebar enter all the after numeric
keys and then some of the special keys
so that's that okay so that's just going
to wait five seconds windows key wait a
second
type command wait a second and press
enter so pretty self-explanatory but
what if you want to press multiple keys
down at one time like in my previous
video which was a tutorial on how you
can retrieve the windows logon hashes
you need to run a command prompt in
administrator mode so you had to press
the Windows key and then type CMD and do
control shift enter instead of just
enter by itself and then it will bring
up this prompt and then we can get that
past this by doing left and then enter
so how are you going to do that well
let's see how uncommon this so instead
of doing send keystroke with a single
keystroke on it you're going to want to
do send keystroke and then the three
keystrokes you're going to want to send
so in this case it's control shift enter
so I've got mod control left mod shift
left and key enter so the first two are
separated by a comma and then the last
two are separated by a pipe symbol which
is to the left of Z and you have to hold
down shift as well to get the pipe
symbol up and then there's another
second delay and then send to key shoki
arrow left which is going to go to the
left on that and run administrator mode
prompt and then which is going to press
ENTER as usual so that's how that works
although if you want to press just two
keys at once for whatever reason I think
you just have to let's see remove this
last bit and put a comma in between it
however it might be a pipe symbol I'm
not sure but it's it's one of those two
for sure
so finally let's check that this script
does actually run so we can do that by
going make what making sure that we have
the right board did you spot default
sixteen point five megahertz that
selected and program at USB tiny ISP and
then we're going to press upload and
then we're going to wait for the prompt
where it's going to ask us to plug in
the digi spark okay plug in the digi
Spock
so I've plugged in and now we're just
going to have to wait a few seconds and
it says done thank you so now we're just
going to wait a few seconds and see if
this thing does actually run as planned
CMD enter there we go so it works you
could shave down some of these delays
quite a bit oh it's going to keep on
doing it because it's on a yep that's
yeah I should unplug it you could shave
down these delays quite a bit however I
just put them adds a bit bigger so you
can see what's happening so that's it
