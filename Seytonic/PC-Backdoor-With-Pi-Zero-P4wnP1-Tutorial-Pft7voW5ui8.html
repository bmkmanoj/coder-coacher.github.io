you how you can gain a shell on any PC
with just a PI server w-want setup it's
as simple as plugging a PI into a PC
wait until you're ready setting it off
and there you go commands at your
disposal so let's see how it all works
right after this molls we know is the
arduino based bad USB you can use it to
inject keystrokes at lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's des of
wallpaper to find out more see the link
in the video description so this whole
pi backdoor thing is made possible by
pone pi it's the framework which makes
possible all sorts of attacks for the pi
0 you can use it to gain a backdoor
which is what i'm going to be showing
you in this video and it's its flagship
feature though you can also use it to
run ducky script emulator mass storage
device emulates network adapters on both
mac linux and windows
there's a lot of flexibility here
especially with creating your own custom
payloads so hopefully some of you guys
will have a shot at the creator name 82
is a critical guy so leave his Twitter
link as well as the getup for this
project down in the description setup
itself is actually really easy firstly
you're going to need to download the
latest raspbian jesse light image and
then flash it to a micro SD card using
win32diskimager
I'll leave download links are both in
the description next it'd be a good idea
to enable SSH on your Zrii pi because
after all you are going to need to
control it somehow so open a blank
notepad plus plus documents just go to
save as go to the boots partition and
then just save it as SSH with no
extension whatsoever so make sure to
select all types and go and save that
okay so next once you've inserted your
microSD cards give your PI a power
source and you will need to find a way
to interact with it so I'm going to be
using a USB to Ethernet adapter here and
by using one of these USB these micro
USB OTG adapters plugging this straight
into the USB port right here I will be
able to plug this even though it's a
full size USB straight into my PI 0 so
these little adapters and the Ethernet
adapter are actually really handy there
are only a couple of dollars from China
if I remember correctly so I'll make
sure to link these in the description
try and set it up without using USB to
Ethernet adapter can be done according
to the readme
however I got a little bit buggy when I
was trying it so this is a method I'm
sticking to though do check the readme
for alternative methods okay so once
your PI is set up or plugged in and
connect it to the Internet so I forgot
to mention that part SSH into your PI
with username PI and password raspberry
then go to the pone PI github repo and
all these commands on the installed PI
section you need to run them one after
another so it's pretty self-explanatory
and easy they'll just run through these
just to make sure now unfortunately it
doesn't all execute this fast is
actually sped up so I do suggest you
grab a cup of coffee or something to
keep you occupied once done go ahead and
shut down your PI and now in terms of
setup you're pretty much done however
you will need to take note of this and
that's - from now on you'll need to use
this second USB port here instead of
this one because this USB port doesn't
have data whereas this one does so you
can go ahead and just plug this into a
computer ok so once it's plugged in
you're going to want to wait 30 seconds
to a minute to allow it to boot up after
which go over to nearby networks and
you'll find one called pone pi so go and
connect to that with the following
password ok so once you're connected you
can SSH into it using the following IP
address and username PI and I just
accept that and then the password is by
default raspberry okay so now we're in
okay so if we CD into the only folder in
here prone PI and then we have a look at
what's there you can see there's a load
of features that this comes with see I
think it comes preloaded with John the
rip of some reason I I haven't looked
into that at all
there's USB storage you can take
advantage of you can store ducky scripts
and run them on commands with this thing
however here to make this simple because
there's just way too much to cram into
one video I'm just going to be looking
at how we can get that backdoor up and
running so we're going to nano into the
config I mean sorry setup config and
then scroll down all the way to the
bottom and you'll finds which payload is
selected so I'm going to go ahead and
uncomment or rather comment out the
network only payloads which is currently
selected
and I'm going to uncomment the hid I'm
called backdoor TX txt so we're going to
save that and X out of it and now that
virtually all set up and ready to go so
just unplug your PI 0w and get ready to
plug it back in and let's see how this
all works so I'm just plugging it into
my computer now and again you're going
to have to wait about 30 to 45 seconds
before that wireless network will show
up and you'll be able to connect to it
okay so once the PI has booted up and
we've connected to the pone PI Network
we can go and SSH back into it it of
course password raspberry but this time
instead of being taken to the normal
screen will be taken to this screen
instead so here it gives us a few
commands we can do so if we type help
quickly we're going to see our options
so firstly we're going to want to do set
keyboard language and for me that would
be GB for Great Britain because my
keyboard layout is something other than
us English and us English and UK English
have slightly different keyboard layouts
so if using another language like French
I think of WFR and Spanish maybe SP
you'd have to check the github for that
just to make sure so I'm going to do
that and language set 2gb okay so now I
can do fire stage one so what fire stage
one will do is when I run it it will pop
up
PowerShell window on the victim PC and
that'll initiate the shell for us
essentially give us that backdoor so if
I just redo the camera so you can see my
computer so you can see I've got my
laptop in foreground which is what we're
using to interface with the Raspberry Pi
and the background has got the victim
which is my computer so if I press ENTER
on fire stage one you should see that
PowerShell window pop up and it
disappears in an instant it's only up
for a second or two at the most and if
we give the laptop a few seconds you can
see that we've got pone pie shell
connected so from here there's only two
things I'm gonna look at today and that
send ducky scrubs which is
send ducky scripts and then there's
shell so if we were to type send ducky
scripts and press Enter it gives us a
few options of a few ducky scripts
already pre-loaded so if we were to go
back to that poem PI folder that I
showed you at the beginning there was a
folder in there called I think it's
called ducky scripts and in there you
can put your own ducky scripts and then
execute them at will from here so also
for comes pre-loaded so you can close
down whatever someone's got up and so
that would get fun and so then there's
of course a shell so by pressing enter
on shell we now have a shell which as
you can imagine quite dangerous
but quite fun at the same time this is
my personal computer which is a victim
so I'm not going to mess too much up on
it
however starts crying so I think half of
you will know where I'm going with this
one and press enter on that I've showed
up on the different screen but you get
the idea it's good fun something else to
mention here is that you can even
connect to the pone PI network via your
phone and then download an SSH app here
I'm running reflection on iOS I don't
think I've paid anything for it
although if I did you can find loads of
other apps like this for free and yeah
you can essentially control it on your
phone exactly like you would on your
laptop it's a lot more inconspicuous and
likely to raise less eyebrows see yeah
this is a this is a pretty cool idea so
all in all I think this project has a
lot of potential and I haven't even
touched off at the features yet I would
recommend you check out the github link
in the description perhaps make some of
your own custom payloads I'm sure I'll
be doing way more videos on this in the
future as loads to cover here so if you
enjoy this video please do give it a
thumbs up remember to subscribe if you
haven't already do you follow me on
Twitter and Instagram and stay tuned for
more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
