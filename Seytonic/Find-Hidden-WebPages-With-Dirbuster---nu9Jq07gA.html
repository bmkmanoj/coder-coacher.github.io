der buster der Buster is an information
gathering application that allows you to
index pages on a website which are not
normally crawled by Google or other
search engines when search engines visit
a website to index it they will detect
links on each page by visiting the links
and doing the same on each of those
pages they can build a map of the site
you can do the same with burb sweet and
Carly though it's not what I'll be
covering in this video when Penn testing
websites you'd probably want to check
each page for vulnerabilities or to see
if it contains useful information while
you could create a sitemap just like
Google doesn't go from there there may
be other pages on the website which just
aren't linked to do so they won't show
up it's important to check for these
hidden pages as developers often lazy
they might have a page up somewhere
where they're testing new features or
storing backups of the main site in
which case those pages are much more
likely to contain vulnerabilities than
the main site Doe Buster will scour a
website for unindexed resources using a
word list of common file names hopefully
discovering files that may be of
interest so i'm going to be using the
stock carly vm downloaded from offensive
security
so to find Durvasa t going to want to go
to applications and then web application
analysis and then web crawlers and go to
der buster and then it opens up so this
is a GUI based tool so for the target
URL I'm going to be using something
local so if I don't paste then though
you I was going to demonstrate this on
an actual web site but it didn't work
out great so remember to add that HTTP
or HTTPS depending on whether you're
using SSL and remember to add the port
84 HTTP and 443 for HTTPS okay so we're
going to want to click go faster so it
will just execute in a fraction of the
time as it normally would and then it's
going to ask whether we want to do a
list based brute force or a pure brute
force so we're going to do list based
because it just takes a lot less time
compared to pure brute force so we're
going to go to browser and this is going
to be the same location if you're using
the Kali Kali VM like I am so I'm going
to go to the root directory go to user
share and then find der buster here
somewhere
there we are
go to word lists CERN it will give you a
selection wordless they they're very in
extensivity is that word I don't know
but anyway but they all essentially
contain a load of common file and folder
names though I'm going to choose this
one because it's a smallest one so it
will be quicker so let's do that and
next it's going to ask you a few things
so firstly there's brute-force directory
so that's going to look for files as
well as directory so we're going to keep
these two selected and there's be
recursive so what that means is that
when it finds a new folder it's going to
look within that folder for other
folders and other files so this is great
but it does increase time taken to do
your scan so I'm going to deselect that
and produce blank extension I'm going to
keep that two selected directory to
start with I'm going to leave that as a
root directory so if you only want to
scan a certain part of the website you
can change that file extensions I'm just
going to do PHP here though you can add
other common extensions like HTML dot
txt dot old because some people do use
that so yeah I'll just click start and
I'll come back when it's done because it
could take some time so now the scan has
completed and it spit out a load of
stuff here so for some contexts let's
look at the site I was actually scanning
it simply says left site so if Google
were to visit this site they would see
that there's no links on the page so
we'll just leave it as it is this is the
only page on the website however if we
look at the results of the scan you can
see a lot more interesting stuff has
actually been churned out so here we
have the index dot PHP file which was
which is the main file for the website
so we were just looking at that a second
ago it's the main landing page and we've
got a few other uninteresting things
which have been discovered so this image
and icons but then if we look down a
little more there's backup so this might
be an interesting father to look at it
could contain backups for the website
maybe some of those backups are still
linked to the database so that's a good
entry point possibly into the system
what you have to keep in mind however is
that the response code to these some of
them you get 403 s
so a 403 response code
is when the website in question took too
long to respond so it just put it in
this results list anyway but just bear
in mind that file or folder may not
actually exist however if you get a 200
response code that means that file or
folder was successfully accessed and so
it does exist so if we look further down
here you can see you've got a dashboard
folder so that could be interesting to
look at there's a few more 403 s Wells's
they're here old index so that's
something that obviously it's no longer
in use but it could be still connect to
the database so that could be a good
entry point so that's the general gist
of der bust it helps you with
information gathering and finding files
and folders which aren't generally
indexed by search engines
