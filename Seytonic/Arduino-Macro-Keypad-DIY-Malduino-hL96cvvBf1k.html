today I often find myself typing the
same things over and over again
answering the same question constantly
so if we nice to have a set of macro
keys that can do that for me macro keys
on a keyboard are good but not all
keyboards come with them and something a
bit more dedicated would be nice so I
thought I'd make my own so today I'm
going to be showing you how you can make
a macro keypad alpha melt we know though
you could use an Arduino Pro micro if
you prefer so what's even is this melt
we know well it's a keyboard injection
tool useful for pen testers and
pranksters it acts as a keyboard typing
things very very fast the general idea
is that you can put scripts on the micro
SD card in the back here select the
script you want with the dip switches
then it'll execute when you plug it in
you can do a whole bunch of cool stuff
with it so if you want to learn more
I'll leave a link in the description so
today we're just using it to emulate a
keyboard
so for this project I thought I'd
utilize my 3d printer so I went on
Thingiverse I found this it's a kind of
keypad housing kind of thing it comes
with a few key caps so that's nice so
the idea here is that you put a button
underneath one of these holes and then a
key cap on top and then push the button
down and it pushes it essentially
so this is where the mold we know comes
in so you can see it's got a set of dip
switches so what we're going to do is
solder on the terminals of each button
onto the top and the bottom of each
switch so that will allow us to use
these buttons instead of switches so I'm
going to have to go and redesign this as
it's not exactly how I want it so let's
go do that
so this is a housing I came up with it
has a row of four buttons here it has
some spacers to keep it up from the
ground it has a hole to let the cables
through to the MELD we know which will
be seated right here some protection on
the sides for that to keep it in place
somewhat so the mods we know goes there
and it has a hole here to let the USB
ports on the model we know out so then
you can go and plug in a USB extension
cable or something to that effect so I'm
going to go ahead and print that ain't
that nifty so before I go ahead and
solve that everything up it's important
to note that I just explained how
this works so the switches on the multi
note or in this case buttons how it
works is that one of these terminals or
rather all these tunnels on this end
here are connected to ground on the
device and then each of these pins here
is connected to a different pin on the
chip so instead of wiring to each one of
these individually because you're
essentially essentially wiring to the
same thing what I'm going to use is I'm
just going to wire we're going to solder
this wire to one of these pins here
because all these go to ground and then
instead of soldering directly to each
one of these individually I can just
solder one of the tunnels on the button
somewhere along this wire and we should
be good okay so I've soldered everything
together so from the hardware
perspective it's pretty much done now
let's just see what we did because I
have done a couple things differently
okay so all of the so one of the
terminal on each button needs to be
connected to ground so I've done that
here connected ground here and here and
so on
so instead of the other terminal
connecting here I thought that would be
a bit tricky seeing as this copper wire
is probably going to touch the
accidently so you some hot glue to make
sure they don't touch and I've used the
diagonal terminal here because how it
works is that the diagonal terminals are
kind of congruent when you push the
button this terminal and this term are
connected as well as this one and this
one so it's just thing to keep in mind
so I've done that for each one as you
can see and they were all connected up
to their corresponding terminal on the
MELD we know end of things
spit tricky since single gauge wire but
I got there in the end oh and of course
I've hot glued down the buttons they
flip nicely so obviously this isn't
going to plug directly into a USB ports
so that's why I've got this USB
extension cable how does that go in like
that so that should go in and now it
just needs programming okay so I've
whipped up a quick sketch in the arduino
ide it's really very simple that i'll
explain it quickly it's all set so from
where
if I push a button well I'll show you
second I'll explain it first
okay so includes keyboard H that tell
well that's a library we're going to
need to use in order to emulate a
keyboard in the setup method we're
defining pins what digital pins six
eight nine and ten to use an internal
pull-up so that enables us to use them
as switches or in this case buttons and
then we're starting the keyboard and
then in the loop so this method runs
continuously as long as it's connected
it just keeps on running and it checks
digital read it checks digital pin at
six
and if we're pushing that pin then it
simply just types one and then it waits
500 seconds I mean 500 milliseconds
because of course if it checks it really
quick it only takes a fraction of a
millisecond to check and we're holding
the button down for more than the
fraction of milliseconds then it's going
to type one a minute like a load of
times so that set so that we can push it
once and it will only type one once and
the same thing goes for digital pins 8 9
and 10 except we're printing 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so
I'll give I'll give that a quick spin
it's all plugged in ok I'll type it down
here
so if I push this button we get 4 keep
on pushing it get more force this button
you get load threes and twos and
obviously once so it works so I think
it's probably a good idea that one on
the button says that down passwords do
offer as for the other ones either now
I'll leave those as is and come up with
those later okay so this is one possible
way to put it to use I've kind of just
taped it to the side of my desk people
are going to shout at me for this
because it looks so messy but when they
use this properly I'll probably add some
velcro to the sides just to make it a
whole bottom well less messy though I do
like how I've got a piece of tape here
with what each button does I think
that's pretty cool so I just reached by
the side of my desk press that button
and it tells someone or or other shouts
at someone what the pathways locks on
computer
copy and paste and I can reprogram them
at any time and I think it's pretty cool
I think it's great
so that's it I guess thanks for watching
if you want to learn more about mods we
know the thing we use to make this and
possibly get your hands on one and use
it for it it's actually meant to be used
for then go to multi we know comm or see
the link in the description I'll have
for that if you have any questions about
this whole setup then leave them in the
comment section down below
I'll be sure to get back to you çf
