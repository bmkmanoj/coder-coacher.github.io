taking a look at the pine book it's a
$99 14 inch Linux laptop though they
have an 11 inch version for only $89 so
let's find out what all the fuss is
about
right after this mild we know is an
open-source arduino based bad USB you
can use it to inject keystrokes at
lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper anything you
can do with the keyboard and 50 minutes
of your time
mold we know can do in a matter of
seconds to find out more see the
indiegogo link in the description so for
full disclosure when I found out that
the pine book was a thing I emailed them
and asked for a sample I get offers for
free products all the time but they
usually suck so I don't take them up on
them though as you'll find out the pine
book is different first impressions are
actually quite impressive it comes in a
carrying case though mine was totaled in
the post the lapse of itself has a very
clean design surprisingly polished for
something at this price point the fact
the front shell has no branding was
actually really nice to see though it
does come with stickers if you're into
that kind of thing it's not bulky at all
at only 12 millimeters thick and
weighing in at one point to 6 kilograms
as for i/o on the left you've got a
charging port USB 2.0 and mini HDMI and
on the right another USB 2.0 headphone
jack and micro SD slot which you can
actually boot from inside you'll find a
1366 by 768 glossy screen that's
surprisingly okay given you're not going
to be watching Hallowed netflix on this
thing more on that later the keyboard is
also quite standard I work daily on
Cherry MX red switches and using this
really didn't throw me off the keys
aren't sponge at all and unless you use
a lot of force there's barely any flex
in the keyboard as for the trackpads
well I'm not great fan it feels like
it's made from the same material as a
keyboard which just kind of feels weird
for a trackpad and really threw me off
for the first few minutes though you do
get used to it and it has this weird
tendency of being able to click when
you're not actually clicking the
touchpad you're just pushing the bottom
of the notebook so what is this thing
even running on is this pineville just a
glorified potato well it sports some 1.2
gigahertz 64-bit ARM Cortex CPU which
from what I gather is exactly the same
one as in the Raspberry Pi 3 the pine
work also has doubled the RAM 2
gigabytes compared to the PI's
one gigabyte it comes with 16 gigabytes
of flash memory and Wi-Fi b/g/n and
bluetooth 4.0 so being that it has
similar specs to a pi/3 and that it's
only double the price but comes with
monitor keyboard trackpad and everything
else I think you're getting a lot for
your money to open it up you first have
to get past ten Phillips head screws
once you're inside you'll see there's a
pretty large battery most of the
important stuff is covered by shields or
not much to see there however there is a
lot of room for extras so we interesting
to see if people come up with mods for
this thing now I'm not one of those
people that has a favorite Linux distro
for every day of the week though the 16
gigs of flash memory come preloaded with
meat which just seems buying I guess let
me know if you think otherwise down in
the comments the battery life is great
10 plus hours of normal use from its 10m
powered battery though charging does
take a long time six hours plus from my
experience oh and by the way it only
comes with either us or European plugs
so what can you do this thing what are
its boundaries
well web browsing is pushing it even on
lighter sites it's quite sluggish as the
media consumption video playback works
just don't expect it to be super smooth
the speakers are tinny and very quiet
which is very welcome in certain
circumstances so should you buy one well
I'm using mine as more of a client SSH
into my servers VNC viewing and such if
you want to play around in Linux then
one of these would be great just
remember there are very visible limits
to this thing also something to take
into consideration is that you're going
to have to pay shipping plus maybe
import fees depending on your country
which could increase the cost by 50% so
do make sure to calculate that before
you buy other than that guys thanks for
