by now that I really like for us with
spicy Rose I've made a ton of videos on
them because they're small compact and
cheap though the only problem here is
that they're slow like really slow it's
only got a single core processor which
runs at 1 gigahertz so here I'm going to
show you how you can turn a PI zero into
a multi core gaming monster that's right
my friends you're going to be playing
triple-a titles on this son of a bitch
and if you stay right to the end I've
got two pi zero w's that's the wireless
editions giveaway to you guys because I
know how hard to find an expensive
baking get in certain countries so let's
get to it right after this mult we know
is an open-source arduino based bad USB
you can use it to inject keystrokes at
the lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper anything you
can do with the keyboard and 15 minutes
of your time
mold we knew can do in a matter of
seconds to find out more see the
IndieGoGo link in the description so the
first thing you're going to want to
think about when overclocking a PI 0 is
stopping it from wasting energy so I
want to draw your attention to the GPIO
pins those are these holes at the top
they're pretty cool they allow you to
plug LEDs and all kinds of stuff into a
PI but the problem is is that if you're
not using them then the electricity is
going to fall straight through these
holes onto your desk wasting energy and
contributing towards climate change so
we're going to once head-on to go ahead
and hack those right off a knife should
do it so let's give it a go oh I
like that
okay so this isn't working good enough
to bring up the guns
now I can finish off its in that set of
sign okay so we might have slightly
overshot its little bit but that's fine
the pi0 is more or less intact so no
more electricity will be escaping
through these holes so next we're going
to need to look at the components
themselves in particular the resistors
now you remember from school that
resistors slowed down electricity
slowing down literacy means slowing down
your pi which you don't want the
resistors are the ones with the black
tops the other ones are the capacitors I
think so you're going to want to go
ahead and snip them all off if you don't
need them Oh God
took out a capacitor methinks collateral
damage just go ahead and remove all
those okay so it looks like we're done
in terms of the resistors anyway okay so
here's a single most important part
remember I said that the pi zero is only
single core well here we're going to
make it multi core and to do that so
we're going to need to take the
processor off of the board's completely
so we're going to have to heat it up so
that's the solder will melt and we can
just take it up with some tweezers so
let me set up okay it's probably almost
ready let's see if I can okay it's not
really okay now there's some smoke
starting to come off it that you might
that you may or may not to be able to
see it's getting towards reflow
temperature which is great and if I just
rotate it around because the heating
element is right here
I'll that came off that on let's go
off oh okay crap crap crap crap
crap it's on extra structure Rosa's view
of god the processors come off in two
pieces okay alright so this ladies and
gentlemen is the processor thing okay so
let's take a look at what we got out of
that so we got that PI zero itself the
camera connectors kind of gone AWOL but
who cares we've got the processor so you
can want to be very careful the
processor as it's quite fragile here and
that's the processor so again I said I'm
gonna be showing you how to turn it into
a multi-core processor so you can also
take some tape I've got blue tape though
it doesn't really matter as to the
colorful tape so put it in like that
some processors in there and then you're
just going to want to smash it with
everything you have
so I'm using a file so you could use a
hammer or whatever you have two hands
just actually it's not breaking okay if
the hammer it doesn't work like that
gonna have to just contort it and just
destroy it basically well not destroy it
but like explicit okay so I think that's
probably done so you want to undo the
tape okay so okay so just just put it
all onto desk just open up in DNA scrape
it all out onto the desk this is normal
so the whole idea here was that we've
just turned a single core processor into
a a hex core process that's just
processor with seven cos so your game
performance is literally just gone
through a group so you're going to want
to put it together it's like a bit of a
jigsaw it doesn't really matter if you
if it's not like a square when it's
when you're putting it back together but
it's fine it kind of fuses itself falls
back together in the next step so go
ahead and put that on the PI zero make
sure it's all in one spot because that's
where the process was okay next step
okay so now we're ready to solder down
our hex core processor onto the board
for this it's probably best that you use
a soldering iron of sorts to make sure
you get into all the pins however I know
that's a large proportion of my audience
comes from America so I want to use
tools that are more accessible to you
guys the ones so you're going to want to
grab your nearest Asia or like if like
me you live in socialist Europe you can
want to get yourself one of these now
this is some kind of arc generator thing
the idea is is that you put seven point
four volts in here and you get to about
a million volts out kind of like a
makeshift taser now I don't have any 7.4
volt batteries so I'm going to be using
a nine volt battery so if I'm just
demonstrate this for you guys it's very
dangerous
so just make sure you don't touch the
electricity thing because that's not
good it's pretty fun to play around with
and this really might be making comeback
in a future video
but for now let's use it on this pi zero
okay so the whole idea remember here is
that is this these are going to make the
electrons sticky so there's a few still
crap so going to fuse together and stick
to the board this pricks a large
government our crab is stuck to it
that's what electricity so we just want
to go ahead and hold this here for a few
seconds
unfortunately this doesn't really seem
to be working which is weird because I
mean it works before but so I don't know
it's really weird because you can feel
like a draught of air coming off it kind
of like a fan I don't know why maybe
it's like ionizing the air or something
I can't explain it but it's chords well
it makes the air smell really weird if
you can see the tips tips are actually
em if I get this to focus you can see
the tip so actually burns at the end I
can see that
on second thoughts hot glue will work
just fine
and there you go as far as hardware goes
we've pretty much done you've got to
know energy wastage through holes you've
got no resistors slowing things down and
you've got the processor encased in a
protective bubble the hot glue helps to
conduct the electrons around to all the
Pens
so the only thing left to do is boot up
okay guys I've booted it up and what you
know it works so I'm running Kali on
this because as you'll know I am a leaks
hacksaw however you're probably going to
be using raspbian or something like that
so there you go you can go ahead and
install games however I know what you're
thinking games on Linux kind of sucks so
we're going to want to go ahead and
install Windows 10 so go to applications
open terminal and type sudo RM hyphen RF
and then flash okay let's just read this
error okay so we're going to have to add
this on the end just copy that and paste
and okay so we'll just run that so we're
just gonna have to wait seconds for this
to execute okay any second out windows
should appear okay this is absolutely
normal guys and any second
oh and there you go Windows has loaded
up what can I say it's very smooth
there's no lag look at that Start button
action there so yeah let's go see if it
can even run games okay guys so I was
thinking of doing the whole will it run
Crysis kind of thing but I thought I
could do a bit better so here I'm trying
VR on the Raspberry Pi 0 so I've opened
up Bret room and OH on you haven't you
look at the master now Oh what do you
think
anyway so it works it seems to work very
well very smooth so yeah oh yeah the
giveaway that's why you guys clicked on
this video to begin with so I'll be
giving away two Raspberry Pi zero double
use the first one is going to be
available to my patrons over at
patreon.com because they help support
the channel and I'm very grateful to
them also never to go to basketball
anyway the other one will be able to be
won by absolutely anybody all you have
to do all you have to do is follow me on
Twitter I am at say tonic retweets my
pins tweet and let me know you're done
so down in the comments just post your
Twitter handle and in two weeks time
from the posting of this video or sat
April okay well through halfway through
the month April the 15th I'll select
winner I hope you enjoy this video I
hope you learned something so remember
to subscribe like the video if you
haven't liked it and stay tuned for
marking videos I guess or from a later
turn on notification exactly exactly
this guy knows what you're going out to
20,000 people right now anything you
want to say and I wouldn't call tonight
called borrow is your height based on
like your height in real life because
like um look at aspherical feel are
basically sublet like hey what's the way
to like a limit
ah it was gay
like a giant I'm like 6 feet tall but
like look at this dude or work it's
probably niche in your life the wolf
only getting that bladder yeah shut up
shut that out of here oh you
you believe you oh you know if almost a
fool teeny I agree wholeheartedly I have
no idea what he just said exactly
what does that outfit like can we just
brush this look at this
oh please it massages well oh my gosh
that's whoa oh cool cool man thank you
okay thank you
looks like a ginger went out for a
sundress Michael I love this guy like
this guy over here looks like he just
came straight from the club right after
this guy is slick oh yeah you guys thank
you yeah how about meter class not to me
 you look like you came
called oh yeah I do like and grooving I
like that I like that I'm about to take
this to the bus I like you and I want
your penis in my mouth right now
thank you
fortunately I'm gonna have to disappoint
you holiday white are you recording a
YouTube video
maybe yes I am okay gang gang are you
I'm showing yeah okay I'm not going to
be very rude
I'm going to tell my mom my friend my
best friend my not sure which way I've
been showing people to I'm overclock a
Raspberry Pi and run the are on us you
want okay no no no are you running a
Raspberry Pi right now oh yeah we have
er no seriously you want to watch the
video it's going to go home later today
is going to come out later today
just go here go come on right now just
go on YouTube and search stay tonic SC
why is tio N I see the same as my
username and say tonic okay say I can
remember that oh my gosh
there is three mate so you leave that oh
yeah you're hopeful on important record
or Google your ginger you have no
smelter in a sundress
way second go to heaven
literally
me looks like we like a friendly game is
just everyone roasting each other it's
just guys just NSFW labels look look at
this guy
okay with Cabernet just bang bang take
this confetti can and stick it up your
ass
I'm a babysitter no no my logic a pasta
with the ginger thread us all the pain
drawings and your beauty hey guys guys
guys yes how do you do this thing oh god
this all made it for another pitiful why
does count mark look so small like look
at this hi ads because I'm sitting down
is it wall Bethany wall faster the dough
off okay wait so explain to me how
exactly are we running this on a
raspberry but all yours so you're just
gonna have to work in the video as very
pie you just council watch anyone play
now like that's that's weird
I don't okay I got a whole new ring you
know you got to do like some major
overclocking on that but how's that it's
a li expect that to work you did i
mention are you for real did I mention
this is on the Raspberry Pi zero oh my
god even the oh my god exactly that's a
mess retarded tell yourself I think it's
pretty cool I think you're the retard is
one sorry Oh
I'm gonna jump do it let me join you I
said I could see just fine
I guess Robin Hood hey you have
something on your shoulder I can see it
fine it disappears I'm going to help you
with a thing this was lighting your
shelter you would usually get our second
it take it in my mouth
okay sorry
anyhow I should really get to editing
this because it has to come out today so
on
Oh what time is it for you it's about
10:00 11:00 in the morning last time I
checked and I've been invaded by virtual
Brielle as well okay okay yes we are in
the final conic faithfulness is a you
know letting thing I love you let me
give you a sub nice I like that way
better tonight
better throw game makes a tommix you're
gonna be in the video I did it Hey hi
awesome Lance yeah nice
let me handshake you and Joseph I was
gonna do this gently with everybody hey
yeah high five yeah right y'all let's do
this I'll see you guys later
later man have a table here likewise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
