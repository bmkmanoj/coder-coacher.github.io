different I hope you find it interesting
so if you've watched mr. robots who
remember the scene where Romero's house
gets raided the FBI find his computer
and start plugging things into it trying
to download data presumably until it
catches fire and destroys all the
evidence
so on to make something a bit similar so
this is part one of the SD SSD or other
self-destructing SSD build log so
instead of destroying the whole computer
we're just going to be destroying an SSD
as that's where all the important stuff
is stored after all
I bought these cheapo 32 gigabyte SSD s
from your 80s in this project next
there's a whole fire thing you've got
iron oxide and aluminium powder the
chemists among you will probably see
where this is going while harmless by
themselves will mix together with the
right proportions you get this thermite
again harmless well until you introduce
a flame hot enough to melt some of the
aluminium at which point a small
exothermic reaction is use burning it
over 2,000 degrees Celsius
I should take a moment to state the
obvious don't do this at home I've
researched this so I know what I'm doing
kind of I only used a couple of grams of
thermite here not enough at all to raise
the temperature of container by what's
needed to melt it so the general idea is
to surrounds the SSD in the stuff ready
for ignition on command this 32 gigabyte
SSD has four eight gigabyte chips so all
of those chips will need to be destroyed
since this is going to be taking up a
decent amount of space inside of a
computer I'm going to be hiding it
inside an optical drive that I've
hollowed out optical drives and SSDs use
exactly the same connectors one for
power one for data so it shouldn't
really be obvious that there's an SSD
inside of this thing so how this works
out in practice is that the SSD along
with the thermite is fixed here when the
self-destruct sequence is initiated the
server will turn pulling on a piece of
string which will be hot glued to the
button press you thing Magette lighter
igniting the thermite wrecking the SSD
all this will be done by an Arduino more
specifically a bare-bones Arduino one
that we'll be building myself with
actual 80 mega 328p chips soldered onto
a circuit board it's essentially the
same thing as nod we know it just looks
a lot cooler it's more compact and it
will consume a lot less batch power than
a full-on Arduino Uno so replacing
batteries regularly on your
self-destructing SSD will become a thing
of the past
alright guys so for the rest of this
video I'm not going
to be really prototyping it Bob's going
to be checking that each component works
and showing you my general kind of
thought process behind putting this
whole thing together and the next
episode and when I solder it and get the
software the the sketch that I'm gonna
be using on this fully working it's a
bit rumbly at times this next bit I
could have turned out better some bits
I've dubbed over other bits I'm just
talking as I'm doing it so if you don't
to put up with it that's fine just make
sure you check out the next build log so
I'll make sure there's a lot more
succinct end to the point so yeah stick
around if you want to and if you don't
don't
so this is or this is a normal Arduino
and the chips they use 18 mega 3:28 Peas
so it's essentially the same chip from
an Arduino but I'm putting on a
breadboard so we don't have all this
other stuff around it which we don't
really need in the first place so I'm
going to just put that down there okay
it has VCC which is voltage it's at pin
7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ok that's positive
and negative is ground ground so if i
hook that up to ground and a less
positive which is 2 down so put on there
so this is just providing power to the
board and next there's I'm going to be
using a 10 nano farad think it's
narrower than electrified u F whatever u
stands for capacitor to essentially
smooth out the current to think I think
my electronics is right on that one
so I'll just put that in there between
positive and negative so next what you
have to remember for these things is
that they don't run on a very large
voltage and for this in particular
usually say on a normal Arduino you have
a crystal which make sure it runs at 60
megahertz however with this one I'm
going to be running it on their internal
oscillator which is going to run out
so I don't need a crystal however I'm
going to be running it at much lower
voltages then I might otherwise do so to
make sure I get those low voltages
especially when I'm running on battery
is I'm going to be using a voltage
regulator so this is going to take I
can't remember what the maximum rated is
but because we're using a servo and this
this is only going to be using 3.3 volts
whereas servo we're going to be using is
going to be using something like seven
and a half because they just have
different power requirements so this is
going to take the seven half voltage
that we using for this convert it down
to a much lower voltage that we will be
able to use for the chip so I'll just
put that in over here I'm going to have
to check the pin out for this because I
cannot remember let's say let's run
let's say the input is going to be on
here on this row so I'm going to have
input going to here because I've all I'm
going to connect up the battery
terminals positive here and negative
here input output so for output that's
going to be going to the positive rail
on this side and ground of course is
going to be going to the negative rail
in the ground and to make sure I get
this right so I don't blow anything up
so and we were using a pull-up resistor
so this is going to make sure that our
thing doesn't reset itself and it's just
going to keep that constant which is
what we want so that's going to be on
the positive rail here
it's a 10k ohm resistor o negative is
going to go from here to here I know
this maybe isn't making sense
I'm Trevor Besser okay so they would
just explain what we've done so far the
chip is going to be running on 3.3 volts
so we're taking a much bigger voltage
from our inputs from our battery pack
which is probably running out 7 1/2
and that's going to be on the positive
that's going to input power to the
positive the negative so the positive is
going to run to the voltage regulator
and then it's going to reduce the
voltage to approximately 3.3 volts so
and then it's going to power this rail
here with 3.3 volts so everything on
here is run out 3.3 so then we've got
the capacitor which is just going to
smooth down things a little and then
we've got these two we've got positive
and negative and another positive and
negative that's powering the microchip
and then pull up resistor just to make
sure it doesn't reset itself okay so in
order to test this test that this setup
does actually work I am going to be
programming it I'm going to be taking
this chip out and programming it in here
so I'm going to test that it works by
uploading the default sketch which is a
which is the blink sketch and then I'll
be powering this buzzer so I'm going to
check my pin out okay so I'm going to be
doing that on pin 10 so pin 10 is this
one in 10 and ground and connect that to
ground if I can steal another wire to
ground
yep that looks about right so this is
just to check that it's receiving power
properly and if it works this should
make a buzzing sound so I'm going to
take the microchip out and put it in
here you could if you wanted to run a
load of wires from this directly to this
to program it directly however that's a
bit of a chore and you can get wires
crossed up and ugly messes up so it's
just easier to pull out and put it in
here to program it so now it's program
at programming yet okay so I've got my
computer so it's done uploading so I can
go ahead and just gotta put in quite
good take it out take that out of here
so now it's programmed I could I could
theoretically just plug it back in here
and it should run the blink sketch as
planned so now when I kill it I'm just
going to unplug the servo because it's
not being used for known so now when I
plug in the power it should start
beeping
so I'm these things are really hard to
plug into a breadboard so I'm going to
just be using but I'm just going to be
doing it money
negative and fingers crossed okay it's
very quiet so long story short because
the puzzle was quite quieter decided to
try it with an LED and it works
absolutely fine so no problem there the
buzzer might have just been a dud so
here I'm just demonstrating that I'm
getting two different voltages when I
show you the voltage of the whole
battery pack you can see I get about
seven and a half y estimated it to be
whereas when I try it across the
capacitor I get about three point three
so perfect the well is being powered at
seven and a half but the microchip
itself is going just three point three
which is what we want so the only reason
we want that big voltage difference is
we want to be able to power the server
too much high voltage down the microchip
so the next thing I went to test is that
the servo will actually work with an
Arduino on a breadboard because it's not
something I've used before and with that
voltage difference I just wants to make
sure that would actually work before I
start soldering everything together so I
reprogrammed the microchip using the
example sketch sweep in the Arduino ID
so I plugged everything and it works if
you manage to stick around this long
congratulations cause Leo's a bit of a
ride but yeah stick around for the next
build look I'll make sure it's a lot
more succinct to the point concise etc
remember to follow me on Twitter I am at
say tonic if you have any questions
whatsoever leave them down in the
comments down below and I'll make sure
to get back to you and yeah thanks for
