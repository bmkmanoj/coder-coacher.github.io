from my departure of videos lately
University hasn't been very forgiving in
terms of time hence the lack of content
projects videos are incoming so don't
worry about that if the audio sounds a
bit off that's because it is my nice mic
is that's home though there's a lot of
ice and snow in the way so you can also
put up with this for now I'm afraid
though today's video I'm sure will turn
out to be rather quite controversial
Macs tend to get sort of hate in the
community because they're under no
overpriced and respect though go to any
developer conference and you'll see an
absolute sea of them even if the hacker
conference I recently went to see three
in Germany and they were everywhere
which is rather quite odd given the
sentiments going around but why well
here I have both a XPS 15 and a MacBook
Pro both Philippe SPECT out and mine
I've been using them both for my
computer science degree these past six
months or so and I've come to the
conclusion that's how much you're gonna
get rid of one of these because the
other just makes it completely redundant
so which one am I going to get rid of
and why well let's find out right after
a word from today's sponsor me mal do we
know is the Arduino based bad USB inject
keystrokes at lightning speed gain a
shell change someone's deaths at
wallpaper with the elites version simply
store and select between up to 16
different scripts on a micro SD card to
find out more see the link in the video
description so this isn't going to be a
comprehensive review in comparison
between each specific laptop here I'm
only using each device as a conduit to
explain why for the most part
programmers tend to prefer max over pcs
and specifically I'm talking about
laptops desktops or a whole different
kettle of fish which I'm really not
going to get into oh and I'm not
obviously saying that all programmers
use Mac's that would just be factually
incorrect though I'm sure someone's
already accused me of it in the comments
so probably the number one reason why
programmers like max is Unix
so UNIX is a family of operating systems
that's been around since the 70s most
servers in industry use some variation
of Unix and pretty much all
supercomputers run UNIX if you have a
look at a long
of UNIX operating systems you'll see
there's various distributions of Linux
and Mac OS notes the absence of Windows
here
so since Mac OS is fully UNIX compliant
it means it's built on the same
underlying operating system as many of
those servers used in industry so by
learning to use the Mac OS terminal
you're also vicariously learning UNIX
and therefore Linux for the most part if
you're asking what's the purpose of
learning Unix well try setting up a
website on a VPS or dedicated server
without using your hosting providers
tools or try taking a computer science
degree where you have to learn UNIX sure
it can be done on Windows using various
add-ons but it's not native and you
can't do certain things unless you use a
virtual machine and your battery will
deplete faster than you can say
so you could duel boots but then all
your stuff and programs is ring-fenced
in another partition that you can't
accept no thank you with my Mac I can
write and run bash scripts natively
taking full advantage of my processor
without having to use a virtual machine
as an intermediary which is actually
really useful in computer science when
you might have to deal with time
complexity algorithms or whatever I'm
sure there'll be some Puritans in the
comments saying they run Linux natively
and write up all their reports in vim or
something and there too then great
I'm really happy for you but I want to
keep my sanity so number two on the list
is somewhat less vital though still very
important I think most people will agree
that when it comes to Mac's build
quality is second to none
this might seem somewhat trivial and
unimportant I mean if it works it works
right though when you use your device
for hours in the double digits every day
opening your laptop to find a clean
unibody design with an almost perfect
trackpad and keyboard is something you
come to really appreciate don't get me
wrong the XPS is keyboard and trackpad
or regreat for a Windows laptop they
simply cannot compare to that of a Mac
sundar I know some people won't like the
new Butterfly keyboard on the MacBook
Pros though I really like it and the
trackpad I'm sure most people would have
much contention with again when you're
using that trackpad for most of the day
small annoyances become really really
noticeable so when your actual job is
being a programmer paying a lot more of
what might seem to be small things is
actually something you start to warm to
also the displays are max tends to be
the best of the best though there are
some notable exceptions I opted to go
for the 1080p XPS 15 model simply
because 4k on a laptop seems really
wasteful especially when it comes to
battery life why 1440p isn't standard on
laptop screens in nowadays really really
baffles me this is where the MacBook Pro
or at least this model at least tends to
get things right it has a 28 80 by 1800
screen which is really bright and
there's not much I can fault it for this
brings me on to another big bonus for me
at least of max
are often overlooked so the screen race
you are max is 16 by 10 as opposed to 16
by 9 as you get on pretty much every
other Windows laptop
notice how the max display has slightly
less width but a little bit more height
so this means you can fit more code on
screen at once and actually makes for
really satisfying web browsing
experience and it's just a pleasure to
use but when it comes to films of course
they're in sixteen by nine so you are
gonna get black bars on Macs which which
kind of sucks next up is the simple
facts that's on a Mac you can develop
for pretty much any platform iOS
development is specifically limited in
that you can only develop for it on a
Mac this isn't much of a selling point
for me in that I'm just interested in
iOS development at all
however it's obvious why some people go
from Mac over a PC simply because they
want to do iOS development is it's just
no other way to of course there are
other advantages such as battery life
dpi scaling and such but also some
disadvantages such as the whole port
situation yeah not to mention the high
buy-in price though it should be
mentioned that Mac's resale value tends
to be quite a bit higher than that of
its PC equivalent so if you get a good
deal on your buying price and your sell
price over the course of a few years it
might actually be cheaper to own a Mac
but now para el did know more which one
of these am I getting rid of the X
Pierce or the MacBook well I'm pretty
sure I made it quite clear I'm getting
rid of the XPS I think that's pretty
obvious by now I'm selling the XPS in
favor of the MacBook though I do still
have my Windows desktop that I'm going
to hang on to mainly for hardware stuff
because from my experience trying to do
a hardware on a Mac simply isn't worth
the driver issues you run into in
addition to the fact that blowing up her
USB port on my desktop is a lot more
favorable to blowing up a USB port on my
Mac which is not modular so there is
that but alas it would not be a satanic
video if I did not show my social media
so remember to follow me on snapchat
Instagram my photography Instagram
that's a new one and discourse I'll try
being more active on that I'll put the
link in the description see ya
thank you for watching remember to like
if you liked it subscribe if you haven't
already and of course stay tuned for
more hacking videos have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
