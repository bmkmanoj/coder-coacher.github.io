IOT development board acting as a d--
author a device that will kick other
devices offer Wi-Fi network and prevent
them from rejoining there have been a
few updates to the project since then
which I'd like to quick look at though
more importantly this is a tutorial on
how to set the thing up as a load of
people have been messaging me asked me
how to do just that
so let's get to it right after these
words mult we know is an open-source
arduino based bad USB you can use it to
inject keystrokes at lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's desktop
wallpaper anything you can do with the
keyboard and 15 minutes of your time
molds we no can do in a matter of
seconds to find out law see the
IndieGoGo link in the description so
firstly I like to give a quick shout out
to the developer of this project space
one it's a bit frustrating that other
people who's made videos honest haven't
even credited him so do follow him on
Twitter and github as you make some
awesome stuff if you want to get your
hands on one of these no Dems few dev
boards I'll post a few links down in the
description they're really cheap and
definitely worth it even if only for
this project so in the last video I
showed you how to control it from your
phone kik devices off the network as
well as spam a whole load of beacons
flooding someone's nearby networks list
I'll quickly go over the new features
then show you have setup so in the
latest version you can spam a custom
list of network names so after you plug
the device in and connected to its
curves the attack tab then scroll to the
bottom then you'll see the SSID section
and if we tap add sir and I'll just put
a few random Network names in here what
it's going to do is it's going to spam
nearby people's networks list with these
network names so if I just put couple
more in and blah blah and there you go
so if we go ahead and save that and go
to the top beacon list and tap start and
then if you look at your nearby networks
on the computer or phone or something
you will see that those three network
names we entered are spams now these on
real networks if you try to connect them
it just won't let you it's just a kind
of trolling thing I guess it's pretty
cool and you could enter a whole list of
random things and really freaks them out
so now back on the phone I'll just stop
attack quickly scored to the bottom and
I'll just clear this list here
and we'll do our tap random so this will
populate 64 gibberish random strings
which will acts as SF IDs so then we'll
save that or if I get it and scroll to
the top and start the attack so now if
you check you're nearby now exists
you'll see a random clusterfuck of
networks so if you're trying to look for
a specific network to connect and miss
lots you're going to have a hard time
there's also the addition of a few more
settings so if you go to settings tab
you can change the SSID make it a little
more inconspicuous and the passwords
there's also some more settings for
advanced users so I won't go too much
into those of course the main feature of
this project is the author aspect
kicking people off networks so I've kind
of done a whole video on that so I'll
leave that link in the description if
you do want to go ahead and watch my
previous video setup is also really easy
you're going to go on to go to the
github page I'll leave this link in the
description scroll down to the contents
and click uploading the bin files and
then download the current release so
open up in a new tab and version 1.1 is
the latest release for me esp8266 d also
you're going to want to download this
and i've got that we're also going to
want to download the node MC flasher so
just click here and go to wind 64
release presumably you're running a
64-bit system and just download that
done it then just connect the node MCU
to your computer fire at micro USB cable
next open up the esp8266 flash
executable go to config and on the first
line here you're going to want to click
the COG and make sure you've selected
the bin file that we just downloaded and
then make sure there's a little cross
right next to it on the left here go
back to operation and under comport just
expand that and they might be two of
them there might be one if there's two
of them then it's probably not going to
become one it's going to be the other
one oh you might have to do a little bit
of trial and error here so I know for me
it's comm nine and go to advanced the
baud rate it doesn't matter so much I'm
just going to leave it on this on flash
size you're going to want to make sure
it's four
megabyte on flash speed you're really
going to want to make sure it's 80
megahertz and then just put di offe SPI
modes and then go back to operation and
click flash so this is sped up though
it's going to take about 30 seconds to a
minute for it to upload so the green
tick means it's done something else to
mention is that although this project is
made for the node MCU you can also use a
d1 mini though it's not officially
supported so your mileage may vary the
d1 mini uses the same chip as a node MCU
however it's a lot smaller and a little
cheaper so when when I'll put links to
where you can get one download the
description also a lot of people have
been telling me that it just won't do
off certain devices and what you have to
remember is that the esp8266 uses only
2.4 gigahertz so any device or roots are
running on 5 gigahertz or not be
affected by this at all if you want to
protect your own network from the
authentication attacks then you should
look up 8:30 to 11 w it's an amendment
to the 802 got 11 standards to increase
the security of its management frames if
you can't see author your own Network
then there's a possibility you could
have this enabled already so from my
experience it's really not widely used
at all so that's pretty much it for this
video I hope you enjoyed it if you have
any questions feel free to leave them
down in the comments or better yet in my
subreddit
remember to like and subscribe follow me
on twitter i'm at photonic and stay
tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
