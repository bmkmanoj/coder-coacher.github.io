welcome to part 2 of the
self-destructing SSD build log so in
this build log the actual device the
prototype is completely finished it
works hundred-percent though in this
video I'm going to be sole during all
the components onto a circuit board then
fitting the circuit board and everything
else inside the optical drive hopefully
getting a few practical tests done
so let's first go over the layout of the
optical drive right so firstly I'll show
you that this optical drive has been
gutted all the internal components are
in fact gone so firstly we're going to
have the SSD which is going to be
sitting at the top right inside it and
then some little bag of thermite it's
going to go on top of it and then the
light is going to go underneath and the
servo which is going to pull back a
piece of string which is going to be
attached to the button on the lighter is
going to be just beside it so the whole
idea here is that you will arm the
device by pressing a small button once
it's armed when someone tries to pick
the computer up and move it the servo
will move it will turn the will pull a
piece of string which is going to turn
on the lighter like the bag of
thermite's and wipe your SSD essentially
so I'll do a quick demonstration now so
if I turn it whole thing off and on
again by unplugging it and rippling it
in so the servo twitches but that's fine
so right now it's not armed so if I try
to move it nothing will happen until I
hold the button for about 4 seconds I
think is ok I don't know if you heard
that there's there was a very faint
buzzer noise because it's only running
off 3.3 volts so it doesn't really get
very loud so now it's armed if I were to
try and pick up this computer you can
see that the servo activates and it
pulls back and it will turn on the
lighter wait a few seconds for that
reactions get going and then it will
turn the lighter back off so the only
thing left to do is to solder all the
components onto a circuit board so let's
go do that
cool silver and goose right
alright guys so now everything is
soldered so it should technically work
as it is I will just show you what I've
done so there's a big mess on the
backside but signal that I've got a
positive and negative wires here cause
the buzzer the voltage regulators the
chip itself and the gyroscope
accelerometer thing and then we've got a
few headers so these first two are going
to be for the button I'm actually going
to be putting the button on the front of
the optical drive so the real bus and
fret so that's going to be quite cool
and the other three are for the servo so
the servo will connect there so that's
that so let's check that actually works
because I haven't actually tested that I
should have tested it before but oh well
let's plug this in so positive go and go
as well on the battery there we go
positive goes here and negative okay
let's bring this interview so for the
button I'm just going to be shorting
these two headers as I haven't actually
got a proper button in there just yet
please work okay so I think you guys
heard that very faint bus so now if I
move this in particularly uh extra
Haunter gyroscope it should actually
start moving the servo so there we go so
it does actually work nice and after a
few seconds it should release the okay
great so it works that's a ton of books
it worked first time awesome so as you
can see I've made some progress
so I've hot glued the servo to the
bottom of the optical drive here and the
lighter as well I was going to use
string but that kept on stretching and
if I was using other materials it would
sometimes just snap off the whole ball
let's call it trigger assembly for the
lighter so I decided to go with a zip
tie because it works perfectly so I've
also hot glued a button behind the
physical objects button off the optical
drive so if I
that's going to be the arming button so
yeah the want to get to the final thing
that's probably going to be a bag of
thermite underneath this SSD as well as
on top because of course says four
eighths gigabyte modules which will need
to be completely destroyed so yeah all
that's left to be done is put everything
inside the optical drive though I will
show you that it's working I'll move the
thermite and SSD safely away because it
would be kind of a bad idea to do this
indoors so if I holds the front button
to arm it there we go now I don't think
you're going to be able to see the flame
just because of mile light but we shall
see so you go it lights I've modified
this so I've cut off a large section of
X otherwise it won't be able to turn
because it will hit the top of the
optical drive and I've made sure it only
goes around a certain way instead of
full 180 degrees like last time it'll
close again it's just going to pull the
whole lighter off or pull the trigger
assembly off or something like that so
yeah I just need to put everything
inside the optical drive and then we can
get to the real the real thing
so that's that for this video guys I
hope you enjoyed it the next video is
probably going to be the finale and not
another build log so stay tuned face
should be rather explosive remember to
follow me on Twitter I'm at say tonic
like and subscribe and thanks for
