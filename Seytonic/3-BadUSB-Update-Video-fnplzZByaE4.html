brought you this it's a rubber ducky
clone made out of an Arduino Pro micro
for just three dollars if you haven't
seen that video already I suggest you
check it out link is in the description
down below so for the most part it works
very well however there are a few
problems with it
so I've made some improvements firstly
the USB adapter connect the thing is big
and bulky not to mention it requires you
to sacrifice a perfectly good USB cable
so instead you can use one of these it's
a small adapter meant to be used so you
can connect full-sized USB devices to an
Android phone but instead you can use it
the other way around in the Arduino it
stays in pretty good though you might
want to superglue it in so it doesn't
disconnect when you pull it out of USB
socket also I suggest putting a bit of
electrical tape on the other side
because it will short out two USB socket
if you plug it in the wrong way the
effects of which I even found out though
if someone wants to take one for the
team
lets us know what happens down in the
comments secondly the other problem was
that when you plug it back into your
computer for reprogramming it will run
the code on your own computer which has
the potential to cause some problems
so I soldered a button between the
ground pin and pin 3 on the Arduino so
now when I plug it in holding the button
the code just won't run there is a small
addition you have to make to your codes
to get the bottom working though I'll
leave that in the description it's quite
easy so that's it you have a very slim
lined USB Drive by you could 3d printer
case for this which would make it
obviously a lot better we could buy
cases from Aliexpress or something so
yeah that's all folks I have an upcoming
video where I'm going to try and store
programs on a micro SD card so stay
tuned for that so remember to like and
subscribe follow me on Twitter I'm at
say tonic if you have any questions just
leave them down in the comments and I
will be sure to get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
