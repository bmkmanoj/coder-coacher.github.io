nuclear bunker converted into a data
center they host servers and websites
though this isn't just a fancy
repurposing of a nuclear bunker there's
a reason they're in a fortress with five
meter thick walls and EMP shielding to
military standards they'll host
literally anything apart from child
pornography or anything related to
terrorism so presumably malware hosting
botnets all of that stuff is a-okay
authorities have tried to shut them down
at many at times but to no avail so
let's find out more about that right
after this multi we know is the Arduino
based bad USB injects keystrokes at
lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper with the
elites version simply store and select
between up to 16 different scripts on a
micro SD card to find out more see the
link in the video description I would
also note that I'm currently doing a
giveaway of a bunch of multi knows but
that giveaway ends the day this video
comes out so if you want to find out
more about that giveaway please see the
links in the video description given
cyberbunker will accept pretty much any
customer and that they describe their
services as bulletproof you can imagine
they're a perfect match for anyone
engaging in activities which may be less
than legal both the Pirate Bay and
WikiLeaks mirrors have been hosted here
though whatever your opinion on
WikiLeaks or the pirate bay cyberbunker
also hosts chinese new sites keep them
up and safe despite the efforts of the
communist regime given all of this you'd
imagine Li take their business very
seriously and I'm sure they do they even
go as far as to say on their sites that
they'll physically destroy all of your
hard drives if you decide to stop
hosting with them which is pretty
hardcore but can we take a minute to
admire their websites this thing looks
like it's straight south of 2005 making
liberal use of stock images and to even
looks like their header was made with
word arts even if you're not in the
markets for a secure server browsing
their sites makes for good qex
I imagine they had fun making it but if
you are in the markets one of their
servers be prepared for premium prices
their cheapest dedicated server on sale
starts at 100 euros per month for that
price you get a quad-core xeon processor
2 gigs of ram and 2 8 c drives and raid
1 so 8 gigs of effective storage space
so for most people it's probably not
worth the price of premium though I
imagine the bragging right
pretty cool however if you're hosting
something that could be considered on
the wrong side of the law then I imagine
that added security is well worth the
price given that they have a very good
track record to date they've been online
for 17 plus years and if you're extra
concerned about your anonymity they even
accept cash drops at the front gate as
payment so why hasn't cyberbunker been
shut down how have they been able to
operate for all these years
given their probably hosting illegal
sites and servers surely this thing is
on the government's hit list well to put
this into context cyber bunker is hosted
in the Netherlands and while the Dutch
aren't really known for their preemptive
strikes there have been a few incidents
among the usual legal threats which
never really amount to much cyberbunker
claims to have been the victim of an
unsuccessful police raid a SWAT team
allegedly tried breaking into the
nuclear bunker with battering rams
somehow unaware of the facts that the
bunker was built to withstand a twenty
Megaton nuclear bomb when they realized
that wasn't really working out they
threw flashbangs around randomly to try
and get the attention of people inside
the bunker eventually the SWAT team gave
up and went home no one inside the
bunker even realised what went on until
they checked CCTV footage later that day
when cyber bunkers lawyers suggested
CCTV footage of the raid could be posted
online which I imagine would be quite
embarrassing for law enforcement the
police capitulated and paid 8000 euros
to cover damage to the doors I would
note that this story is as told by
cyberbunker
as I can't find any sort of official
statement on it so if after all of that
you want in they're actually looking for
volunteers to join them in a new bunker
they're building in Germany with a
Chance of learning and permanent jobs
sometime in the future you'll get food
drink a place to live but most
importantly blazing-fast Wi-Fi so thanks
for watching guys I hope you enjoyed
this a new style of video I'm testing I
would like to remind you all about that
giveaway I'll have details linked below
