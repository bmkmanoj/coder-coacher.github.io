video on the reverse shell USB rubber
ducky scripts I demonstrated in my first
video I'm going to be using an Arduino
Pro micro though you can follow along
with an actual rubber ducky or a digi
spike I just wanted to take a second say
thanks for the 1k subs in two weeks
that's pretty cool I've got loads of new
stuff coming up soon I'm going to be
doing a video on poison tap I'm actually
going to be getting a hack five field
kits courtesy of Daren over hack 5 so
I'm really looking forward to that
also that self-destructing SSD project
will be reaching its den new more very
soon says a lot to look forward to
follow me on Twitter I am at say tonic
so you don't miss a second of it anyhow
back to the reverse shell so for
demonstration as you can see the command
prompt pops up though only momentarily
but for it then closes and then I have
the rush of all in a couple of seconds
right so let's have a look at the
scripture of amazing so this link is
going to be in the description so you
can just go to this link and copy and
paste the ducky script if you want to so
let's look at so firstly there's going
to be a 400 millisecond delay from when
you plug the rubber ducky into your
computer and then it's going to hold
down Windows key and are though here
it's called gy so that's going to open
run it's going to wait a little bit and
then it's going to type CMD and then
enter so this is obviously going to open
up a command prompt then it's going to
wait another little while and then it's
going to type all of this and press
Enter so why I've done here is instead
of typing commands by commands by
commands and then having delays in
between them that could take up a little
extra time so here I've shaved off one
hundred a few hundred milliseconds by
putting everything on line so I'll open
this up so it's just easier to explain
so essentially what we're doing in this
bit here is we're going to the root
directory and then we're creating a
folder called win and then we're going
into that folder and then way of
creating a PowerShell file called B dot
ps1 so essentially what this PowerShell
file is going to do is going to get
netcat which is the program we're going
to be using to establish the reverse
shell so I obviously haven't put a link
in here but you can just put one in
yourself Dobby gets netcat and then it's
going to save it to a dot u XE
so this
just making the file this isn't actually
downloading it until it gets the next
line which will actually run that
PowerShell file which will down the DXE
so then after that enter delay 50 so
this is on separate lines if you put it
in here because obviously downloading a
file can take a couple of seconds maybe
so this will run a little bit later so
this is going to start a exe and then
you can put in your port the IP rather
and your port so essentially that's it
you have to have your netcat listener on
another computer and just enter the IP
and port you're connecting to so - e
because of course we want to run the
executable cmd.exe and - D because we're
going to be running running it in daemon
mode which means that it's not going to
actually open up on the screen it's
going to run minimized and kind of in
the background and then once that is
done we're going to exit so next in
order to set this up you're going to
want to download netcat I'll put this
link in the description you can download
it from here so you're going to want to
go into it and find NC 64 DXE and upload
NC 6 folder Exe to a file hosting
service of your choice but it's very
important that you're able to get a
direct download link so I'll put a file
hosting service I use in the description
down below next we're going to be
constructing the duck is script so you
can go ahead and just copy all this from
my website and paste it in notepad so
you're going to want to get your to
write down a link for netcat and paste
it where it says netcat dl link and then
where it says IP and port you're going
to want to go ahead and put the IP that
you want to use and so I'm gonna put
192.168.1.1 yeah I think that's right
and ports is arbitrary really so I'm
just going to put actually let's give
full minecraft on this - five five six
five okay so let's just check that's
right yep
and if you're using real rubber look you
can go ahead and just paste this into
whatever the river but okie users but
since I'm using a sogndal on an Arduino
Pro micro I'm going to use the ducky
script converter that's hosted on my
website so I want to paste this in here
compile okay so I've got all this code
I'm going to copy that and I'm
going to paste it into an Arduino sketch
here you'll probably notice that the
Arduino sketch will or rather the
compiler will automatically add in a 500
millisecond delay so I'm going to get
rid of that okay so now I'm ready to
upload it to my pro micro I will just
make sure that the settings are correct
sorry no Leonardo good so upload and
I'll put it out as soon as it's done
compiling so it doesn't run on this
system okay there we go it's done
so the last step you're going to need to
do is set up your netcat listener I'm
doing this on Kali just because it's
easier so you're going to want to open
up a terminal window type NC and then -
listen port and then the port - you're
going to be listening on for me it's Q
four five six five and then press Enter
and now you're listening on the port and
you can plug your USB rob duckie into a
Windows computer and you should get
reversed shell on it so that's that for
this video guys I hope you found it
useful if you have any questions
whatsoever just leave them in the
