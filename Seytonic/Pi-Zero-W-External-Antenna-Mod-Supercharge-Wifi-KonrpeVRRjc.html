it's a pie zero but with Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth capabilities the Wi-Fi
internet is built right into the PCB and
it's meant to be some really new clever
innovative design the range on it is
good enough for most projects but my
guess is that it just won't compare to
an external much big antenna so here I'm
going to show you how you can natively
use a much more powerful antenna on your
PI 0w right after these words mult we
know is an open-source arduino based bad
USB you can use it to inject keystrokes
at lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper anything you
can do with the keyboard and 15 minutes
of your time well do we know can do in a
matter of seconds to find out more see
the IndieGoGo link in the description
for this model you will need a USL SMD
connector a corresponding cable and a
2.4 gigahertz antenna I'll put the links
to everything you'll need to write in
the description so if we look at the pie
itself you can see that the antenna is
here and there's a small trace running
from it which connects it to the rest of
the pie so if we follow that trace
through you can see it goes through a
small resistor here and then off to the
chip so the idea is is that we're going
to D soldier this resistor and rotate it
45 degrees so instead of connecting to
this antenna we're instead going to
connect to these gold pads to which we
can solder on our own UFL connector
right there so then we can just connect
our own antenna to this connector and
use our own external antenna instead of
using internal one that comes with the
PI so I wanted to use a soldering iron
as I know not many people will have
access to hot air reflow station however
this is where it got slightly tricky I
did manage in the end to get the
resistor off however I pretty much
destroyed it in the process as I didn't
see while looking through my camera's
display that had actually gotten stuck
to the iron and it cooked in there 10
seconds until I realized however this
wasn't really too much of a big deal
because I tested the resistor on my
other PI 0 and it has a value of zero
ohms anyway in other words it's just on
the PI as a jumper wire so I managed to
solder on a wire in the gap instead of
the resistor and while it worked fine it
was slightly messy pro tips don't solve
a very small things while looking down
the lens for the camera because whatever
it is you're doing will come out looking
absolutely horrendous which is what
happens here that being said it works
there's no bridged connections so I'm
just going to run with it for this video
of however I will fix this mess in my
own time I recommend using the hot air
station or hot plate for this if you
have it instead of a solder 9 so now all
that needs to be done is to connect the
cable and then connect that cable to my
antenna and then we'll be good to go so
I thought I'd benchmark supplies
internal antenna versus two of my own so
I'm using the smallest one I have versus
the largest one I have the largest one
is about thirty centimeters long it's 8
DB is the smallest one I really
controller specifications of its because
I've just had it for ages
however presumably because it's smaller
it's less powerful so I proceeded to
connect each of them up and do a few
scans
so for each antenna I ran this commands
which essentially just returned a list
of the detected wireless networks and a
few details to go along with it so for
each well I chose 4 networks that they
all managed to pick up and recorded a
few details so we can compare the signal
level the quality is rated out of 70 and
signal levels of closer this is to 0 the
better so network a was quite far away
as you can see minus 90 however it did
get better with the small antenna and
then much better with the well not much
better only marginally really with the
biggest antenna and the same goes for
Network B now let's see there was a
slight outlier with the smallest
actually got worse than the built-in
however I am going to ignore that as it
doesn't really fit with the rest of the
data
and so now what V which is my home
network is very close to me just on the
desk each of them achieved full marks on
quality which is great however the
signal level did improve drastically
with each of the better antennas so is
this more - even worth it well maybe if
you want to use the PI as an access
point for some reason then I'd say
absolutely yes though for most projects
you probably just do fine with the
inbuilt one save yourself athol if you
have any questions feel free to ask them
down in the comments though I'll be more
likely to respond if you post your
questions in my subreddit links below I
also have a discord server if you want
to chat see the description remember to
like this video and subscribe if you
haven't yet thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
