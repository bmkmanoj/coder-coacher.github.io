terms hash salt and pepper bit so I
thought it would be a good idea to
explain what they are a hashing
algorithm is a complex mathematical
function that transforms a stream of
data into a seemingly random output
string of fixed length for example these
words produce the following hashes the
same input string will always produce
the same output string but if the input
string has changed even by just a single
character then the output string will be
entirely different
usually encryption means to scramble
data temporarily until a key is used to
unscramble it hashing is often seen as a
form of one-way encryption as you cannot
go backwards from a hash to work out the
original string you can only go forwards
this is great for storing passwords
instead of storing the actual password
the hash of the password is stored when
a user enters their passwords at login
it is hashed and compared to the hash in
the database if they're the same then
the login is successful this way if an
attacker gains access to the database
they'll only have the hashed passwords
which in theory will be of no use to
them as they won't be able to go
backwards to figure out their original
password however in practice it's a bit
more complicated there are a few ways an
attack can go about decoding hash
firstly since a certain password will
always produce the same hashed output
the most commonly used password hashes
are widely known this website will
attempt to decode a given password hash
by simply comparing it to their database
with over 800 billion hashes so if you
use a common password then you're
screwed this websites database is an
example of a rainbow table a rainbow
table simply put is a database
containing common passwords and their
hashes secondly you can attempt to go
through and just guess the original
password hash it and compare it to the
hash you're trying to decode if it's the
same well then you found your password
you can do this through a dictionary
attack guessing common passwords or a
brute-force attack guessing every
possible combination of characters the
latter is very computationally expensive
and can take a long period of time so
hashing by itself just isn't enough to
protect passwords websites can further
protect passwords by using salts salts
are short random set of characters that
are appended to the ends of a use
passwords before they are hashed this
will most likely thwart any rainbow
table attack as
our cats are cool maybe in a database
cats are cool P hash close bracket
exclamation mark said probably isn't do
remember salts are added automatically
after a user enters their password the
user won't even know assault is being
used salts are generally stored in plain
text along with a hashed output so the
website knows what salt to use when it
comes to verifying a login this may seem
counterintuitive as you're telling an
attacker half the passwords and you're
right brute force and dictionary attacks
will still be an issue assuming the
attacker takes into account the salt and
those were about to put it in his
guesses however importantly rainbow
tables will be of no use
finally there are peppers a pepper is a
very short random string or character
for simplicity let's say in this case a
pepper is a single upper or lowercase
letter for example uppercase M so the
hash stored will be the product of
hashing the users passwords plus the
letter M so if the password is cats are
cool the hash storage will be the hashed
product of cats or call em when a user
comes to login the password they'll give
is just cats are called like with the
salt they won't know a pepper is being
used at all the websites will then cycle
through every possible combination of
the pepper in this case of upper and
lowercase letters there are 52
combinations so the websites will try
hashing cats are cool a cats are called
B and so on until it gets to cats oh
cool M if one of the hashes matches the
stored hash then the user is allowed to
login the whole point of this is that
the pepper is not stored so if an
attacker wanted to crack the password by
brute force it would take them 52 times
longer than without the pepper this
would be a bit tedious for them
conversely it would take 52 times longer
to blog in for the user but this isn't
going to be an issue for the genuine
user as it only takes a fraction of a
seconds to hash something so 52
fractions of a second really isn't too
long to wait in conclusion there are
many different hashing implementations
many websites will use a combination of
both salts and peppers in this video
I've only used the md5 hashing algorithm
but keep in mind there are many other
hashing algorithms out there so thanks
for watching guys this was a more
educational video over my usual stuff
but yeah if you liked it remember to hit
that like button subscribe if you
haven't already follow me on twitter i'm
at
a tonic and stay tuned for more hacking
