something new I find it's pretty easy as
a youtuber to shy away from
experimenting so I thought I'd given you
segments ago so let me know what you
guys think what sucks about it what
claims you better let me know down in
the comments so firstly let's talk about
Marcus Hutchins aka mr. accidental wanna
cry hero you might remember a few months
ago when the wanna cry ransomware hit
many hospitals in the UK were taken
offline and some businesses were
affected until this guy trolled through
one of cries code and found a hidden
kill switch the ransomware would check
to see if a certain domain existed if it
did the attack would be stopped in its
tracks a way for the attackers to
prevent the spread of the malware if it
got a little out of hand well Marcus
registered that domain name not knowing
what would happen and thus an accidental
hero was born now if we skip ahead to
just a week ago when he was in Las Vegas
at Def Con it looks like he was having a
pretty fun time according to his Twitter
timeline at shooting ranges and renting
fast cars well he was on his way home
only to be arrested at the airport
accused of creating and distributing
malware known as Chronos designed to
steal logins for banking websites so it
seems his newfound fame may be turning
sour pretty quick as for the allegations
Marcos admits to creating part of the
malware however he alleges his code was
stolen and used against his will in
Chronos and thus he denies the charge of
distributing the malware so do you guys
think is guilty let me know what you
think down in the comments however bear
in mind if found guilty he could face a
maximum sentence of up to 40 years in a
US prison which would be insane secondly
back in January
wide reported that the US military may
start buying off-the-shelf drones well
they seem to have changed their minds
since the US Army is apparently ceasing
all use of DJI products and services if
you're not aware DJI is a Chinese based
company a market leader in drones
presumably used by the US Army for
training and intelligence gathering DJI
was hit with the following memo put out
by the US military due to increased
awareness of cyber vulnerabilities
associated with DJI perks is directed
that the US Army halts use of all DJI
products that apparently includes
cameras radios batteries speed controls
a whole load of other things and at any
device with DJI software applications
installed on it must see speed
used so it seems that this is all being
taken very seriously not something
they've just come up with on the whim
the fact that DJI is a Chinese company
they've had some waiting in this
decision as Huawei if you remember was
banned from bidding in government
contracts under Obama for fears of
involvement in industrial espionage it
has been pointed out that DJI drones by
default will upload video and audio to
servers some located in China and Hong
Kong though unlikely if this is the
reason for the panic and that would be
pretty hilarious though it's more likely
that it has something to do with DJ is
not so stellar security record but
hackers easily getting around the
limitations coded into DJI drones
including height restrictions and
geo-fenced areas such as airports
next up a us-based vending machine
company is giving its employees the
chance to get chipped these chips are
about the size of a grain of rice and
will allow workers to buy food and log
into their computers there is a choice
here no one is being forced to get chips
this is a vending machine company after
all so their main aim here is probably
to help normalize getting chips and I
hope that sometime in the future we'll
have one of these things implanted in us
making purchases from vending machines a
whole lot easier let me know what you
guys think about this I personally
probably wouldn't mind having it done if
it means I don't have to carry around
wallets with a dozen different cards in
it I mean these chips only use RFID
which means you have to be pretty close
to readers use them at all so no GPS no
government tracking well well at least
not yet so that's it guys if I continue
with this segment in the future it will
probably be a bit longer this video was
just kind of thrown together as a pilot
episode if you will so remember to let
me know what you thought down in the
comments as well as like subscribe if
you haven't already follow me on Twitter
and Instagram and stay tuned for hacking
