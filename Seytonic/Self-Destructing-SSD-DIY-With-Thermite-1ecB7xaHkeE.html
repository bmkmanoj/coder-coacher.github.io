the scene where Romero's computer
catches fire when the FBI tamper with it
I wanted to make a similar solution so
this is what I came up with it's a mini
SSD however packed with thermite and in
an auto ignition mechanism
I built it inside an optical drive as I
needed some more room and optical drives
and SSDs use the same connectors so
hopefully it'll be a bit more
inconspicuous
you arm the device by holding the eject
button on the optical drive for about
four seconds then a short beep for
indicates that the device is good to go
then when the computer has moved the
server will be triggered
the light will be switched on the
thermals will be ignited and the SSD
will burn in temperatures in excess of
2,000 degrees Celsius and this all takes
place in just a regular standard optical
drive the whole device is powered using
a micro controller running Arduino links
you're in the description so to build
logs I've done this so if you want to
find out more about how I made this
project check those so now it's time for
the real life test everything is ready
as you can see I've constructed a motor
around this thing
so if anything does get out of hand I
can just push it into there I've also
got a hose to put out anything that goes
wrong so the device is armed it's ready
so now I'm just going to try and tilt it
and let's see what happens hopefully it
works
so at this point I thought it was going
on a bit too long maybe the servo is
caught fire so I thought I'd better end
it if you look closely you can see that
water is actually boiling off the top of
this thing so I thought I better leave
it alone
just for a few minutes so if I can get
the current focus you can actually see
there bits of molten iron that I've
formed on top of the SSD so now it's
cooled off a bit I'm going to try and
take it apart and show you the full
extent of the damage so as I was taking
apart these molten beads fell out
they're probably made of iron made when
the molten iron in the thermite
solidified I also found this chip which
looks like it came from the SSD itself
it's a bit slimy gooey and it's very
brittle very crumbly so I don't think
you're going to be retrieving any data
from this at all so if I managed to pry
this open you can see the full extent of
the damage everything's really charred
and broken I would presume so if we take
a closer look at the main thing here the
SSD you can see that it's got a load of
molten plastic over it probably from
those bags everything's all kind of warm
it's very crumbly its sides but I'm
thinking to be getting any data of this
so for fun I thought I'd try and
actually get it working again when I
plug in the power the server does
actually twitch which is a good sign
it also arms so I hear the little beep
although when I tilt it it doesn't
actually move the sofa at all so I think
some of those wires are a bit broken but
apart from that it's it looks ok so if
we take a closer look at the mainboard
here you can see that everything is a
little charred however later on into
that you get its work all the components
on it work fine though the lighter is a
different story it's a bit melted and
well I only put a small amount of butane
in it to begin with so it wouldn't
create a massive gas explosion and I'm
just checking here to see if there's any
left in and no it seems to me it's all
them see yeah it seems as though this
project was a resounding success
everything worked first time I might add
yeah I do need to go wash my hands but
rooms like this video subscribe if you
haven't already follow me on Twitter I'm
at say tonic and stay tuned from
watching videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
