gadget as is tradition it's named after
an innocuous carbon-based life-form in
this case squirrel I'm making this video
after having had it for less than 24
hours so consider this an array of
initial impressions rather than a
full-on review so here it is the packet
squirrel in a nutshell Malta we know is
the arduino based bad USB inject
keystrokes at lightning speed gain a
shell change someone's deaths at
wallpaper with the elites version simply
store and select between up to 16
different scripts on a micro SD card to
find out more see the link in the video
description the packet squirrel is a
mini man in the middle platform it has
two Ethernet ports one for the victim
the other for the LAN as the leaflet
puts it packets go in packets go out
what happens in between that's up to you
the switch on the side allows you to
select between four different modes
there's scope for up to three different
payloads with the fourth being the
arming mode which allows you to
configure what the other three do in
order for the packer squirrel to do
anything it needs a power source
applied through the micro USB connector
it does not supports power over ethernet
you could use a power bank or a mains
adapter though this is a bit of a bummer
since it increases the size of the
squirrel by quite some margin it would
have been nice to see a lipo connector
on the side along with the charging
circuits which would have kept the
overall footprint much smaller and would
have been way more convenient though it
only uses between 100 and 150 milliamps
so it will easily last a full working
day on only a two amp hour battery bank
the packet squirrel has a USB port which
as I gather is mainly used for plugging
in a USB flash drive in order to store
any captured communication for easy
recovery more on that in a sec the
button on the side is used in certain
payloads to start and stop scripts the
overall package is pretty bland though
that's exactly what you need from Pentos
and gear so no complaints there the
three payloads that come as default are
TCP dump DNS spoof and Open VPN the TCP
dump payload allows you to easily save
TCP through flow as pcap files on a USB
stick the USB stick will need to be
formatted to NTFS or ext4 though once
done simply connect up the ethernet plug
in the drive
apply power and it'll just start logging
once done just press the button located
on the sides and it'll stop a loots
folder on the USB stick will contain all
the logs communication these pcap files
we opened in Wireshark the second
default payload is DNS spoof by default
this will simply redirects all DNS
requests to the IP of the squirrel
however you can configure it to redirect
certain domains to custom I P addresses
a very powerful tool
the third payload is open VPN there are
two options here firstly you can have
the squirrel act as a server such that
you'll be able to tunnel into it and
gain remote access to whatever network
it's plugged into very useful to use as
a backdoor though alternatively you can
configure it to tunnel everything from
the target device through an open VPN
connection very useful if you want to
use it to gain access to your home
network from afar however this brings me
on to the squirrels main disadvantage
unfortunately throughput is limited to
100 megabits this means that any target
machine will be limited to well 100
megabits I'm sure in most cases this
will be just fine however with the
advent of high-speed Internet
connections it may become quite obvious
to a victim that something isn't right I
have pretty good internet in my college
dorm though if I suddenly found my
speeds drastically lowered I know
something wasn't quite right which would
prompt me to follow the trail however I
can't really criticize hak5 for this
gigabit isn't something you can simply
just tack on it's it's not that simple
besides trying to log it gigabit
connection over USB
just not gonna happen it's an
unfortunate compromise though quite
understandable anyway do keep in mind
the three payloads I mentioned are only
default ones by setting the switch to
the fourth position you can put it into
arming mode which allows you to SSH into
it and configure the default scripts to
your heart's content in order to make
your own payloads you will need to know
what you're doing as squirrel script
only helps with a few basic things the
packet scroll costs roughly $60 links to
the hak5 website are in the description
so what do you think of this furry
mammal do let me know down in the
comments perhaps suggest some ideas for
future projects with it if you liked
this video do remember to like it
subscribe if you haven't already
remember to follow me on the Twitter's
and instagrams and as always stay tuned
from what I can video have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
