last video where I discussed why some
programmers tend to choose Mac over
Windows I thought I'd shake things up a
bit and go for a bit more of a redeeming
topic so today I'm going to be talking
about which laptops are best to buy for
Linux
no this isn't becoming a laptop review
channel though I thought it would be an
interesting and hopefully redeeming
follow up with very few manufacturers
making Linux specific laptops it can
often be confusing trying to figure out
which laptops is going to be compatible
with Linux and just which one's going to
work best and is going to be worth your
money so if anything I hope this video
points you in the right direction but
before we get into it a little word from
today's sponsor me mal do we know is the
arduino based bad USB injects keystrokes
at lightning speed gainer she'll change
someone's desolate world paper with the
elites version simply store and select
between up to 16 different scripts on a
microSD card to find out more see the
link in the video description so why
would you even want a Linux laptop well
I'm sure for a large portion of you guys
is because you want to be neat axles and
that's fine though Linux systems are
generally a lot more secure than Windows
counterparts virus associated risks are
generally really small so not really any
money spent on antivirus also Linux is
for the most part for you so no license
key nonsense so there are many Linux
distributions though for the purposes of
this video I'm going to be focusing on
the how well that laptops run up and to
just keep things simple
and besides Ubuntu is really user
friendly and has a pretty interface so
in no particular order let's have a look
at my top picks so this is probably the
easiest recommendation especially for
beginners and that's a Dell XPS 13
developers Edition it's exactly the same
as the regular XPS 13 which has a
reputation of being very good however
this version comes with a bun - rather
than Windows 10 you aren't saving any
money here compared to the regular XPS
13 unfortunately Dell probably gets
those ohem keys really cheap these days
though the fact that this comes
pre-installed with a bun - by the
manufacturer themselves really inspires
a lot of confidence that it'll just work
if you've ever installed Linux on a
laptop before you'll know that it can
require a lot of tweaking to get right
think Wi-Fi drivers
sound Karzai's a pain and absolute pain
though here Dell seemed to have done all
that hard work for you they're
apparently there is still one crippling
downside with this laptop and that's
that people have taken to the forums
complaining that this version still
comes with a Windows key only to be
misunderstood and to be told that have
been to is free and can be installed
without a key but anyway if you've got
some cash to splash then this option may
be for you unless you live in the UK
because because we just we just don't
get nice things secondly if you want the
Linux laptop built to your
specifications then system76 is where
it's at simply pick a laptop shell and
then choose what you want inside it it's
that simple and of course this comes
with full compatibility confidence each
of their laptops comes pre-installed
with either one two or their OS it's
obvious these guys know what's best
their 13-inch laptop even comes with a
full size drop-down Ethernet port it's
like sunbrella Crum some bygone era
the only real disappointments here apart
from the price and sheer fogginess
is the battery life it's hard to put a
finger on exactly what the battery life
will be given the possible variations
and specs but TechRadar tested an i7 13
inch version and they barely scraped
four hours of web browsing so and that's
the 13 inch version by the way so this
is probably one I'd skip oh and also the
ownership from the US so input fees so
on to probably my favorites on this list
and that is Chromebooks yes they do only
come with Chrome OS though they can be
modded to run Linux and once you get
them working Chromebooks at absolutely
grateful Linux they're cheap low specs
those still with good enough specs to do
most things and they have absolutely
great battery life I had two Dell
Chromebook 13 for Weiland well what is
one of them all Premium Chromebooks
it cost me 300 quid which is roughly
$400 and for that I had a fully
compatible laptop I run Carly on it it
even had a backlit keyboard and all that
with ten plus hours about your life it
was it was great though as for that set
up from what I remember it was really
involved so I'd only recommend this
option if you have some patience though
if you're running Linux at all you have
to have some
patience so maybe that makes that
downside redundant up to you also if you
plan on doing this keep in mind the
memory limitations of Chromebooks you
might want to upgrade to that 16 gigs of
flash storage also for the love of God
gets an intel-based Chromebook thank you
later
and do make sure to research the
specific Chromebook you're getting
extensively to make sure everything is
compatible and you won't run into any
issues down the road and onto number 4 I
thought I should mention what you should
probably avoid you might remember I made
a video on the pine book a while back
it's a cheapo $89 Linux laptop I do
recommend checking out that video link
it in the description but since then
I've got a ton of people asking me
whether it would make a good secondary
laptop and so that I have to say no
while it might seem like a good option
here coming in at only $89 for the 11
inch version and having roughly the
power of apply.you which is decent for a
dedicated laptop I'd really just
recommend looking elsewhere the thing
can barely handle web browsing on their
stripped down browser I forget what it
was if you want something to mess around
with Linux on just pay less but more
unless you're using that thing as
anything more than a dumb terminal
you're probably wasting your time last
but not least with good port selections
timeless design it's the classic
second-hand ThinkPad you can pick up
twenty eleven twelve thirteen model
thinkpads on ebay for real cheap take
this thing pad x2 20 option for example
it comes with a ton of customization
options and you could easily get
yourself a laptop here for less than 150
quid and you could even try messaging
the seller and ask them if they'd sell
you it without Windows installed for a
couple of quid less however if you're
gonna get to ThinkPad buy a new battery
a lot of these laptops will come with
their original battery which may have as
this listing says one hour of standby
time which is a diabolical kind of
defeats the purpose of having a laptop
however there does seem to be a thriving
community behind these thing pads the
bun to science even has a section where
they list old ThinkPads in their
individual compatibility issues
hence this option seems to be a
relatively decent choice as
mine's a rather bulky solution so those
are some of my top picks though there
are tons of good options if I've missed
out your favorite laptop on here then
I'm sorry but there's not enough time
I'm sure you'll let me know about it
down in the comments the great thing
about Linux is there's a ton of
community support so if you do have a
question about a specific laptop then
google it and you'll probably find an
answer and if you don't then you can
post on forums and someone or help you
out I'm sure me being me forgot to film
a proper outro so if you like this video
remember to like it subscribe if you
haven't already let me know what we
thought down in the comments and as
always stay tuned from walkin videos
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
