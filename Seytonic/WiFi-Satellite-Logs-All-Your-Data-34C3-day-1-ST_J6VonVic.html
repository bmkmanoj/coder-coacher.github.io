I liked it I liked you like it gives you
all my fault is that
that's horrific we need to get to my
final C 3 cos here in the Hoff I was
late
observe it buildings over there
it's people walking in water typical
thing you see on the city typical German
things yeah when they get bored when you
get bored you know I have a slight
suspicion there might be a path in
between there no John a slight suspicion
I don't know I couldn't run I could be
wrong oh I was correct yeah you were
right Wow
Chubby's body
reaching for a distant star
we get her into space to kinda project
show people to kind patient's yeah and
they have a lot of awesome stuff to show
this is true it's better than ours so I
think this should go like down here
something so hands down the main
attraction to our booth at c3 was space
Hung's Wi-Fi satellites but at least
that's what you called it it's not
actually a satellite of any kind it just
kind of looks like one like in solar
panels on a satellite but anyway it's
inspired by his deal thorvald's I'll
link those below and all they are so it
was made up of 14 ESP modules one to
monitor each channel of the 2.4
gigahertz fans and it launched all data
onto microSD cards on the back we don't
think it picked up everything so we only
blogs if I run correctly a few gigabytes
of of traffic which probably quite a bit
more than that that went on but
nevertheless it was pretty cool we had
like dozens of people crowded crowding
around the points wanting to have a look
at it I'll link the project page below I
think it's on hackaday or something like
that but yeah it's definitely definitely
worth a look
so yeah cool stuff don't wait how's it
how's it gonna work there's a table ok
she bought the
and those kind of Amenti another side
another one yeah the modulates them and
then there's 14 we didn't have power
banks exploded and they didn't explode
they didn't explode and we gonna save
everything to need to purge these each
for every module years ago its computer
which which is Python so we are they
draw hundreds 110 million each module
okay so but where they can peak up to
300 million when they start off okay so
it's quite badly
yeah yeah 14 of them I mean it's just
like four wanna let the internet know
that team breaks all my boss no I only
break the broken board it's really
breaking yeah
this is pretty much the ideal goal but
not all he has it has an automatic
reboot because a problem was with grant
space and so I report after 1,000
also on flashlight or put-upon on power
LED where you can the first module of
the one of 14 2014 more coming coming
so all we can do concerns changes pretty
much done yeah okay alright see the rule
login packets today
no no it's because I need them for home
I mean like yeah yeah if I broke some of
them and I need new ones that's why I
have two years for my one this
what'd you think of this what's up
YouTube hey people here that love change
meetups no no that one I think that
we've got some comments with us
oh yeah
like needs to be honest it's what your
guys thoughts on c3 so far so far so
good for me yeah so it's great good
great experience with it I mean that
compliment is better well this is fully
community-driven yeah
the DEF CON is I know so many that come
yeah DEFCON is like you buy we are
commercial you buy the big I mean no one
has to DEFCON us
no one was a difficulty Vasya so this is
that this looks 3d printed Wow
the unis hacking the mainframe with PHP
PHP see that because I see Simran
drinking water or why you can see me
show us the Aquabats oh yeah
it's a web-based interface for like pen
testing so it's like modular so you can
like basically you can manage the entire
spy from an interface and here we have
like some general information we can
turn on and off interfaces we can manage
the system information now okay so this
is hid here we actually use yeah super
easy making modules is that that's a
point and it can be used like in its
ever more like on a like portable mode
where you have like just your pipe with
you and you install it somewhere and you
just access it so you have like tires
access to and then you have some like
kind of modules that can be executed
like actually there is only one module
that is males things one is still in
development it's basically
is gonna be released like some somewhere
maybe documented more you are I mean
like Wi-Fi pineapple software it's also
modular but it's like I want it I want
this to be like super easy make more you
it's like great and the thing is that
then this one can be also operated like
in a server more like you have a botnet
with all these connected to the same
server so you control all of them at the
same time homogeneous and ensure no one
else and when it comes out
so all back at the house and I believe
Dean is cooking dinner he's cooking what
burritos
love to be no baby love to be in spring
I broke the bottle okay when everything
above I'm sure I'm gonna send up okay
oh we didn't know you can't kick so what
did you think
space son has a discord server if you
want to join it you should join state
opiate bus and then we'll give you the
link
yeah it's discord I lunch three people
join sedated like a minute ago so it's
this old sock Gigi force our state OPI
and then just also links Facebook
apparently it's a thing in Germany that
you are tick bottles to the supermarket
and you put it in a crusher and it gives
you like 25 cents so uh space-time has
been going around the convention just
picking up everyone's water bottles
okay so I just went to brush my teeth
with this quote-unquote toothpaste I
bought in a supermarket in Germany and
it's what is it it's it's super adhesive
cream and they try to brush my teeth
with it it is it tasted absolutely
horrible it just started gluing up my
teeth I was like oh this isn't right is
it that's what it's for apparently
better why did they put me in a
toothpaste box they put it in a
toothpaste box why why I did oh my god
anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
