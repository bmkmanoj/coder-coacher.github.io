it's a mild we know set up tutorial if
you don't know what small Tomino is well
it's not we knew based bad USB I'll put
a link down in the description or just
go to multi no calm to find out more
also I will advise you to check the
video description for any updates or
changes to this tutorial that may happen
in the future so other than that let's
get right to it so for step one you are
going to need to download the arduino
ide
i'll have a link to this in the
description just go ahead and download
the installer for your particular OS
however I would advise against using
Linux as it has presented problems for
some users in the past so if you can
stick to Windows or Mac so just download
whichever one you need
so I've already installed that arduino
ide however it's just an installation so
it's just clicking continue each time
just make sure with the admin popups
that you do select yes for those and
also to install any drivers that it does
prompt you to install so once you've got
it installed just go ahead and open it
up you should get a page looking like
this so just go to file and preferences
and then where it says additional boards
manager URLs just click on this little
checkbox here and now you're not going
to have anything in here I've already
got a few things installed hence why I
have a couple of things here that you
won't have anything so now what you're
going to need to do is paste in this URL
here again I'll have it in the
description and just click OK and ok on
that and then go to tools and go to
board and scroll all the way up to the
top where it says boards manager click
there and then just let it get a few
things and scroll all the way to the
bottom and near the bottom somewhere you
should see mold we know bad USB boards
so I've already got it installed though
you will have a button here that says
install so you just need to click that
once installed you can close this box
out go to tools and board and then
scroll down to the bottom somewhere and
you should see multi no boards elite
elite Apple and light now these three
things could change in the future so see
the description of the video to see if
there's any changes to that I went by
the way these board files were made by J
links I'll have his github links below
big shout out to him for making these
for us ok so this is where the tutorial
diverges for Lite and elite so I'll have
a time code on screen
if you want to skip to just the elite
though I'm gonna cover the light first
okay so for the lights you're going to
need to go to the converter so I'll have
this link in the description of course
and this will bring you to this page so
what you'll be able to do here is write
your scripts click convert and it will
convert it into code that the mouse we
know can understand and execute so I'm
just going to write a very simple script
that'll wait a couple of seconds and
then type HelloWorld
so to do that we're going to want to
have a delay at the beginning just to
give the computer a couple of seconds to
initialize the mold we know so I'm just
gonna put two thousand milliseconds
which is two seconds and then imma put
string and hello world okay so now I can
just tap convert and often give me this
code so by default the Arduino IDE uses
us English so if you're in the US and
hence you're using u.s. English you're
free to just highlight all of this code
copy and paste it right into the IDE
into a blank file like this however if
your keyboard layout is different say
you're in the UK or say you're in Spain
or wherever you will need to select the
keyboard layout - at the bottom here so
I'm gonna select English UK and then I'm
gonna put a name for a zip file that
we're gonna have to download so I'll
just put a test and tap download okay so
this will give me a zip file so what I'm
just going to do is extract the whole
lights folder to somewhere okay so once
I've extract to the contents I can just
double-click light and it should open us
up so it's very important to download
the script if you're using a keyboard
language other than us English because
otherwise it will default to us English
and you don't want that so at this stage
you are good to plug in your mold we
know lights just make sure the switch is
in the off position that's closer to the
one and I'm going to plug that in your
computer should recognize it just give
it a couple of seconds here and then you
should be able to go to tools port so
for me I would have to select comm 3 you
may have other comp orts here if you're
not sure which one to select you can
just unplug the mult we know go to tools
ports and you see I already have come on
here so my mild we know can't be
one however when I plug this in you will
see that com3 magically appears so
that's the one that my mod we know is so
I'm going to select that next before I
upload it under tools and board you're
going to want to select a multi-layered
out so I'll just click tools again to
verify they selected meld we know light
and it's using the right comport and I
can just go and hit upload so it'll say
in the bottom here that it's compiling
sketch and it should upload it
absolutely fine okay so it's uploaded
you'll notice that your multi we know is
flashing red so unplug it and to put it
into execution mode because right now
it's in program mode you're going to
want to switch it to the on position and
now when we plug it in it should type
hello world exclamation mark so there
you go that's your multi no lights all
set up if you want to change the script
and maybe putting you on in just unplug
it and switch the switch to the off
position plug it back in you are then
free to write some new code in the
converter converts downloads and upload
your new sketch so simple as that really
do keep in mind that between uploading
sketches on the tools the ports that
your model you know is may change
however it should be more or less
obvious which one is okay so now for the
elite so you're going to need to go to
the converter as well for this I'll have
this linked in the description and make
sure you have elite selected on the
right now just go to your keyboard
layout I'm using English UK you select
whichever one it is you need and tap
download so I'm going to open up this
zip and extract and puts the elite
folder somewhere once the elite folder
is extracted just double tap the elites
arduino ide file and it will open
something that looks like this okay so
now you're ready to plug in your mild we
know elite so I'm gonna plug mine in
here and then go to tools and for me I
have to select comm 8 it might be
different for you in order to find out
which comport you need just unplug it
check what ports are available and then
plug in and which everyone appears is of
course the one you need SOCOM 8 for me
and then under board I'm going to scroll
down and select small twin o elite
so here we also have multi no elites
apple because on Mac OS if you don't
plug in a keyboard that's not an apple
keyboard it'll ask you to verify it so
if you're going to be running on an
Apple Mac do you do select Apple there
may be other options this list which are
added in the future so see the
description for those so I'm just gonna
select mold we know elite and then I'm
gonna double check on the tools I have
select as multi no elites it's very
important that we select the right one
and then com eight and then I'm just
gonna hit upload it's a pump I'll sketch
and upload it and if it's I say oh well
you should get done uploading so now
just go ahead and unplug that and put it
aside for a minute okay next you're
going to want to get your micro SD card
here I'm just using a bog-standard 4
gigabyte card I would advise against
using the really high-end class 10 cards
as those have been known to cause
problems so just use a bog-standard
cheapo one I'm gonna plug that in using
my adapter okay so now you're going to
want to format it so I'm gonna right
click go to format make sure you've got
fat32 selected which would be the
default and click start
just tap yes anyhow and format is
complete okay so as you probably already
know you don't have to program the elite
using the Arduino IDE
each time you wanna upload scripts to
upload a script to it you just put it in
the micro SD card so I'm gonna right
click here go to new and text document
and I'm just going to put let's say 1 1
1 1 dot txt or author not with the
extension as it's already implied cuz
it's a text document so I've called it 1
1 1 1 because the name of the file
corresponds to how many switches are on
or off so this script will only run when
all of the switches are on if I were to
rename it let's say 1 1 1 0 then all of
the switches would have to be on apart
from the last switch which would have to
be off so you get the idea
you can have up to 16 scripts listed on
this thing so let's just keep it as 1 1
1 0 so I'm gonna open this up
and here I'm just gonna have very simple
scripts like I tested on the light we're
gonna have a delay of 2,000 milliseconds
which is two seconds and then we're just
gonna type hello or other hello world
okay
so now I'm gonna save that control s and
close this out so now I'm going to
unplug my micro SD card and put it into
the elite and make sure I've got one one
one zero selected on the switches and
I'm gonna open up another notepad file
here just so you can see when they plug
it in it'll type hello world so when I
plug this in we get hello world now if
you wanted to upload more scripts to it
you of course free to do so just plug in
the micro SD card again and you can have
multiple scripts so you could have you
could have let's say 0 0 0 0 which would
be when all the switches are off and you
can do that for all the different
combinations which are up to 16 now you
don't have to program your elite every
single time using the Arduino IDE the
only time you'd have to do so is if you
wanted to change the language so my mods
we know I've currently got UK English
though if I wanted to change that to a
French or Spanish I would have to plug
it in and flash it again like we did in
the beginning but with the different
language file selectors on the online
converter ok so thanks for watching guys
if you want to learn more about how to
create your own scripts then I'll put a
couple of links down in the description
other than that I hope you enjoyed it
