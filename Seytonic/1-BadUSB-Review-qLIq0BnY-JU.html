USB rubber ducky for just $3.00 but I
may have found something better this
thing is a digi spark available for just
$1 this isn't a setup tutorial it's
review the tutorial be coming very soon
so stay tuned flats you probably need to
watch it if you get on these things so
how does a digi spark stack up against
an actual $45 rubber ducky and the $3.00
Arduino Pro might grow well let's find
out
the digi spark is really low profile
it's tiny
and easily concealable much better when
compared start doing a pro micro however
not as incognito as a real rubber ducky
obvious reasons so is it easy to set up
and program well in comparison to the
other two options it is by far the most
tricky there's a few drivers to install
but it's not too bad you'll need to
install a custom board manager into your
Arduino IDE as it doesn't use a typical
Arduino microprocessor additionally
there's no working ducky scripts
converts for it so you have to get your
hands dirty programming or at least
mildly greasy as it's not really that
hard it's mostly copy paste so once you
got the basics down though I will be
explaining all of that and everything
else in my set wood sorrel coming soon
so subscribe to don't miss it bear in
mind these things are cheaply made I
ordered a handful of them and one of
them just doesn't work though I'm not
too annoyed given the price additionally
if a USB port is loose then the pass on
the digi spark may not make contact with
those inside the USB port because of
which the digispark just won't work on
my computer's front USB ports unless I
use an extension cable one of the main
problems with a digispark is memory
space it only has six kilobytes of
memory available for scripts so it will
quickly fill up you can forget about
uploading a long scripts this thing
though unless you're typing out a whole
VB or C programming basics before you
really should have a problem but is it
worth it yes I'd say you can buy 45 of
these things for just one genuine rubber
ducky if that doesn't speak volumes I
don't know what does there's literally
no reason not to buy one or or a few of
these things given the price and
potential even if you're not interested
in USB Drive bys just for a dollar why
not give it a go
overall the Digi spike is really good
value for money but it's a bit of a
chore to set up so in a few days I'm
going to make a video on how you can set
it up and how to program and such so
make sure you subscribe for that
so that's it guys I hope you enjoy this
video any questions just leave them down
in the comments as always thank you for
watching remember to Like and subscribe
and stay tuned for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
