video will be looking at some cool cheap
Chinese electronics related stuff you
can buy online hobbyist electronic stuff
is already quite cheap though if you
know why so that can you willing to wait
for international shipping and it gets
even better but firstly a few things
sorry for not putting out a video in
some time I've had my hands full
recently also if you don't follow me on
Instagram you should that's at jaunty I
did a giveaway recently on there which
chances are you missed so I'll be doing
another giveaway in just a couple of
days but only on Instagram so do you
follow me on there if you're interested
in winning some pie zeroes and/or meld
we knows so let's get to it right after
this mold we knew is an open-source
arduino based bad USB you can use it to
inject keystrokes at the lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's desktop
wallpaper anything you can do with the
keyboard and 50 minutes of your time
moulds we knew can do in a matter of
seconds to find out more see the
IndieGoGo link in the description
so first up lots of people ask me for
project ideas or how they can learn
soldering and something like this is a
great bet it's a wireless microphone FM
transmitter kit for just 2 dollars so
when you order it you just get all these
components and the microphone in a bag
and it'll come instructions and you're
expected to solder it together it's good
fun you learn a lot and it's just 2
dollars so you really can't go wrong if
you're afraid you're going to break it's
messed up and screw it up whatever just
by 2 4 dollars you know no big deal so
next up is the orange PI 0 a lot of you
guys seem to have problems getting
Raspberry Pi zeros so this is your next
best option it's a computer on a single
boards it's um it's got 512 megabytes of
RAM it's called core I mean you're not
going to be breaking any speed limits
with this thing but it's actually really
good value it has a full size Ethernet
port USB and it has Wireless built in
and it's all powered by a micro USB
connector once you factor in shipping
you have with a normal Raspberry Pi 0 W
this is actually really similarly priced
so it's a good option and if the single
USB port isn't good enough you well you
can just get a kind of hats and
extension boards like this one for just
for less than 4 dollars you get an extra
two USB ports and the microphone jack
one thing to mention is that the
community around the orange pi0
isn't really as big as the raspberry pi
zero so that is one of the trade offs so
next up is this digital TV tuner while
you could watch TV with it what's more
interesting is that it can get you into
SDR software-defined radio
I don't know much on the topic so don't
ask me any questions about it though you
remember a while back I did a video on
turning a Raspberry Pi zero into an FM
transmitter and this was the exact thing
that I used to listen into that
broadcast you can listen to a whole
range of amateur radio with this and
it's good fun to just explore thus the
airwaves and just mess around really so
for seven dollars 90 i think it's well
worth it next up there's these cheapo
Wi-Fi USB dongle things they're less
than two dollars and they're really
great value you could breathe new life
into an old Raspberry Pi or even better
if you want to try out Wi-Fi hacking at
all which I do recommend it's good fun
there's quite a few videos on YouTube
for that well if you want to try that
then your going to need to use your
computer's wireless cards which of
course you won't be able to access the
internet to watch that tutorial at the
same time so by getting all of these
you'll have two Wyles interfaces so you
can use one for hacking screwing around
with and the other you can use for
browsing the internet and doing what
whatever you want to do so I do
recommend these so next you've got these
electronic storage container things
they're absolutely perfect they're small
and compact you can kind of take them
out and rearrange them they're
spring-loaded and you can get sixty of
them for just $15 for that absolutely
perfect for components next if you plan
on getting into Arduino whatsoever
it's a must that you get one of these 37
sensors assortment kits they're just $12
and if you have a look at what you get
you get loads we've got here heartbeats
detection module tilt switches buzzers
magnetic sensors you get joysticks flame
sensors there's just tons of stuff and
if you're if you come across a project
chances are the stuff you need will be
in here so I really recommend you get
one of these I bought three of them in
recent months next up this one's kind of
pointless but I thought I'd include
anyway its ruler
PCB ruler so it's essentially a circuit
board an unpopulated circuit board with
scales on the sides 1 4 inches and 1 4
centimeters and it just looks really
cool it just has loads of places to
soldier on components which of course
doesn't come with any soldered on if you
want to practice your soldering maybe
you could use this for that but it just
looks pretty cool and it's for one
dollar 37 free shipping why the hell not
so I know that wasn't a very long list
though I wants to keep it short and
sweet
if there's anything you saw in this
video that you do want to get links of
course will be down in the description
and if there's anything that you think
should have been on this list do let me
know down in the comments and who knows
maybe I'll make a part 2 at some point
as for that giveaway like I mentioned in
the start of a video do follow me on
instagram at jaunty and our release
instructions of how you can enter that
only on the instagram so thanks for
watching if you liked it remember to
leave a like if you have any questions
do ask them down in the comment section
if you want to see more remember to
subscribe and follow me on Twitter I'm
at say tonic and stay tuned for more
hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
