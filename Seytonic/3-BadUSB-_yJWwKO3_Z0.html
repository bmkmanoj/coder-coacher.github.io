cost 45 freakin dollars so I want to do
a video on this thing it does pretty
much everything a rubber ducky can do
but for just three dollars or that's two
pounds 50 for me it's not we know Pro
micro which has the 80 mega 30 to you
for chip which means it can do human
interface device spoofing ie pretend to
be a keyboard exactly like the rubber
ducky does so I've got a full-sized US
pupils attached as it only comes with a
micro USB port it's attached to it it's
about the same size as a large USB stick
however you get one of these without the
headers and cut down the exits wearing a
head underneath so that'll make it a lot
more compact it's really easy to program
it uses exactly the same rubber ducky
scripts that duck uses so there's no
programming knowledge needed whatsoever
so before I get into showing you how to
programming out how to use it I'll show
you that it does actually work on this
one I've got a reverse shell script
installed so I'll plug it into my
computer and 2 also happens so if we
just give it a second to execute they go
it will run the script executes it and
I've got a reverse shell on my laptop in
less than 2 seconds so let's see how we
can program it in order to program your
Arduino you're going to need the arduino
ide so if you google search arduino
you'll be sent to their website just go
to the download section and download the
windows installer and just run that go
through that and it's pretty easy can't
go wrong so secondly we're going to be
using two queen ojs which is an open
source project what it does is it will
converts the ducky code into codes that
the Arduino itself can understand so
this is the github page for it but if we
just go to say tonic comm which is my
website I've got a version of it running
up here so you can use it here see Tong
comlink just go to resources and ducky
scripts converter and now you can put
any decade in here press compile and up
converter into codes which you can just
paste into the arduino ide and install
it into your we know so let's try it's
good practice to put delay before you
start your codes because it can take a
second for the computer to recognize the
USB device so let's delay 400
milliseconds and then just string
let's say remember to like comment and
subscribe
alright so now we can just press compile
and it will spit out a load of code here
so you don't need to understand it but
if you do that's great copy that and we
can paste it into our Arduino IDE so if
I open up a new document here and I'll
paste this in and one thing I'll need to
plug in the Arduino Pro micro but one
thing you have to remember is when you
plug it in in order to program it
it will run whatever it's on the Arduino
on your computer so right now I've got a
reverse shell on it so when I plug this
in it's going to run in Reverse shell
which is a bit annoying but you just
have to kind of click off it quickly
oh yeah it's run that anyway so now
that's plugged in we can just go to
tools just make sure the settings are
correct sorry no Leonardo content yep
and upload I need to save it before it
can upload it so just put some random in
save and it worked load give a second
and they go and it will just run
automatically once it's uploaded so you
might need to remember to pull out the
USB device as soon as it's uploaded in
case you've got saying I'm really bad on
there pretty much any ducky script
should work on this so if you just
search for rubber ducky scripts you'll
find a load of ones that you can use
pretty easily the only downside of using
a pro micro to do something like this is
that the memory space is quite limited
so if you're trying to use a really long
ducky script then it's probably not
going to work however I haven't come
across any problems so far oh yeah if
you want to see how to do that reverse
shell I showed at the ginn of this video
and take control of someone's computer
I'll probably have a video up on that by
now so just check the description flat
so this has been my first ever youtube
video if you guys have any questions
whatsoever just leave them down in the
comments and I'll be sure to answer them
other than that remember to Like comment
and subscribe for more hacking
which we up very soon so stay tuned for
those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
