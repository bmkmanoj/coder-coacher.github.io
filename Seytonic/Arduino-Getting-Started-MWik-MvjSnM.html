related videos lately and I've had a
load of people emailing me tweeting me
saying how much they've enjoyed those
videos but they want to learn a bit more
about do we know itself and how exactly
they can get involved in it so it's very
easy to get started and it's an
exceedingly cheap hobby
so essentially Arduino is an open-source
hardware and software project which
makes it really easy for you to program
microcontrollers have a lot of fun and
learn a bit about electronics at the
same time and you don't really need any
programming experience to get started
help you could even learn programming
through Arduino the possibilities with
Arduino are endless you could light up a
few LEDs experiment with some modules
and at some points maybe even build your
own Arduino and make a projects
completely on a circuit board
like I did with my self-destructing SSD
project link in the description for that
to get started you'll need an Arduino
board
there are tons to choose from but I
recommend getting an Arduino Uno they're
the cheapest odwin as you can buy but
they're by far the most popular boards
and there's a lot you can do with them
however instead of buying an Arduino by
itself I suggest buying an Arduino
starter kit these will come with an
Arduino Uno a breadboard for prototyping
more on that in a second a bunch of wise
to connects things up a few common
components such as resistors and LEDs
and some more interesting modules like
for example this wireless remote or a
joystick on average kits aren't that
expensive see the link in the
description to my websites where have
made an expansive list of the best value
starter kits and whereabouts you can buy
them once you've got your kits you'll
need to install the Arduino IDE this
program is used for writing compiling
and uploading scripts to your Arduino
after that you're ready to start if you
know nothing about electronics I suggest
looking for tutorials based on which
components came with your kit so for
example your kits will probably come
with a few LEDs so search arduino LED
tutorial here's one on the official
arduino website our websites you should
probably bookmark by the way it has a
diagram of what your setup should look
like and some example codes to get you
started so you'll need to set up your
Torino like shown in the diagram this is
where the breadboard comes in red boards
are used for connecting different
components together they're great for
prototyping because it means when you're
done with the project you can just pull
all the components off and use them in
something else they come in a whole
range of shapes and sizes however they
all pretty much work the same so this is
by far the most common red
so it's probably going to be the one you
get in your kit however you might get
something that looks a little bit like
this if you opt for a cheaper kit so the
best way to show you how it works is to
show you one of my existing projects so
this project in particular is powered by
USB notice how the black line is plugged
into the negative row and the red is
plugged into the positive row so
anything connected to the same row as
the black cable is going to be connected
to the negative terminal and anything
connected to the same row as the red
wire is going to be connected to the
positive terminal this works the same in
the bottom row as you can see I've got
two red wires connecting each of the
negative and positive terminals together
so if we look at the middle section of
the breadboard how it works is that all
the pins in each column are connected to
each other so you can see that this
components gets power it's also
connected to ground and this blue wire
is connected over here which is in turn
connected to this white wire because
they are in the same column which
connects it to another component it's
important to note that the divider in
the middle of the breadboard splits the
upper and lower sections so anything any
columns in the top section are not going
to be connected to the columns in the
lower section so if we have a look at
that diagram from earlier and make it a
little bit bigger we can see how to set
things up we need to have an LED here
connecting the negative terminal to
ground and the positive terminal to a
resistor and that resistor in turn has
to be connected to pin 13 it's important
to note while it's something you should
remember that you can tell which is the
positive terminal on the led by which
pin is longer so because this pin is
bent and it's the same size when it's
bent
obviously this terminal is going to be
the one that's longer so it's the
positive terminal so let's go do that
so for the benefit of people I've ended
up with a smaller breadboard that's what
I'm going to be showing you how to do
this with it's exactly the same as the
bigger breadboards however you haven't
got to the positive and negative rows at
the top and bottom so we're going to put
the LED in our breadboard making sure
not to put it in the same row as each
other because that's just going to
connect the positive and negative
together and that's just not going to
work so we need to make sure to put them
in the different columns making sure
okay let's say positive is on the left
and then connecting a resistor to
positive like it's shown as I go
and by the way if you reads that page we
were just on it was said that the
resistor could be anywhere from 220 ohms
up to 1 kilo ohm so that this is a 220
ohm resistor and I'm connecting this
jumper wire over here to the same one as
the resistor and I'm going to turn and
connect this to pin 13 on the arduino
which one to pin 13 that want to pin 13
and then this one is going to go to
ground next all you need to do is plug
your Arduino into your computer with the
included cable and go back to that
tutorial page and copy all of the
example codes and paste it into your
Arduino IDE after which you're going to
want to go to tools select boards and
change it to Arduino Uno if it isn't
already selected so it mines up here and
next you're going to want to go to tools
again go to port and for me it shows
com1 and content so for you it will
probably only show one and that's when
you have to choose however if it shows
two or more you're going to have to just
go through those and see which one works
view after that clip uploads it will
compile the sketch and upload it and it
works so obviously this is an extremely
simple example but you need to be able
to crawl before you can walk I guess so
if we go back and take a little look at
the odds we know ite you can kind of get
an idea of how this works as long as you
have some basic programming experience
so you can see the setup this function
runs on startup and it initializes the
pin as an output then in the loop which
runs continuously over and over again
you can see that it sets the pin high it
waits a thousand milliseconds which is
the second set low delays a second and
then repeats whole process over again
I do recommend watching some basic
programming tutorials just to give you
an idea of the structure of code and how
it works
it'll be highly beneficial so yeah I do
recommend playing around with this a bit
maybe change the delays add some all
rights then maybe you can get a pattern
going it's not gonna be anything amazing
but it's going to teach you the basics
of how this works which is what you need
I mean this is the same project heist
by the year ago so there's no shame in
doing something very newbie like this
once you're done with that I recommend
getting ahead around all the components
that came with your kits before moving
on
there's tons of turtles around on pretty
much any module you can buy so it's
pretty hard to get lost so if your kids
came with an infrared remotes follow
some tools on that play around with the
code once you have it working maybe
combine it with the project you learned
earlier such as the LED and make it so
that when you press the button it will
light up the LED and before long you'll
probably have some pretty cool projects
going one quick tip before I sign off is
that if you're new to electronics don't
go around just plugging random things
into random things make sure to follow
tutorials in the beginning because you
might break yours we know they're pretty
cheap to replace they're only a couple
of dollars but it's a bit of an
annoyance so that's just what a word of
warning so here if I plug five volts
it's ground by accident or on purpose
and turn that we know on it would break
felt we know probably so I wouldn't
recommend doing that though once you're
comfortable of course feel free to
experiment because that's what Audrina's
for so thanks for watching guys I hope
this video convinced you to give Arduino
a go those links for the starter kits
are in the description so make sure you
check those out I've hand-picked all the
best ones from various places so yeah
thanks for watching remember to follow
