ah
you
whoo guys let me know if you enjoy that
cinematic intro introducing this week's
project switch if you can get the memo
is an Arduino controlled fingerprint a
computer on button slash password
manager so let's get to it right after
this mult we know is an open-source
Arduino based bad USB you can use it to
inject keystrokes at the lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's desktop
wallpaper anything you can do with the
keyboard and 50 minutes of your time
mods we no can do in a matter of seconds
to find out more see the IndieGoGo link
in the description so in regards to its
features assuming the computer is off
you can simply use anything that you've
already got registered on this thing and
it will turn the computer on when the
computer is on you can use passwords
assigned to different fingerprints so
this finger could be eBay the other one
could be Amazon that could be read it
and so on when you need to use a certain
passwords just pick a finger on the
reader and it will type in so this
project uses a fingerprint sensor an
Arduino Pro micro an NPN transistor a
3.3 volt regulator a 10k ohm resistor
and a bunch of jump wires to connect
everything together I'll put links to
where you can get all of this down in
the description so how does this all
work well the odds we know taps into
your computer's power button circuitry
allowing it to control when the button
is pressed rather than you physically
also it knows when the computer is on
via the power buttons LED if the LED is
on then the computer is on this allows
the Arduino to toggle between power
button mode and password manager mode
the Arduino also gets power and injects
keystrokes using a USB cable the
fingerprint scanner stage shoot was
wrong so I had to figure out what each
line was for if you want to do this
yourself and you're using a pro micro
you need to connect as follows the date
she also said it runs at 5 volts however
I tried that and it became very very hot
so I'm running it at 3.3 volts and it's
works absolutely fine so firstly you're
going to need to download the Adafruit
fingerprint sensor library download
extracts then put it into your Arduino
libraries folder then in your arduino
ide go to file example a different
finger print sensor library and enroll
this script is going to allow you to
register your fingerprints on the device
itself you can store up to 162 fingers
which is more than enough seeing as I
only have 10 since we're using a pro
micro we're going to want to go ahead
and change the software serial pins to 8
and 9 instead
of two and three so connect your pro
micro make sure your settings are
correct and hit upload once uploaded
open the serial monitor
make sure you have carriage returns
selected down here and 9600 as the baud
rate so fingerprints are stored with an
integer as an identifier so I'm going to
put one here make sure the center is
clean then put your thumb down on the
sensor and then you're going to need to
do it again to confirm and I did this
for my whole hand you can test to make
sure it's works if you go to file
examples Adafruit fingerprint sensor
then go to fingerprint uploads that
sketch and then place one of the things
you've registered and if it's done
correctly
it should tell you so let's have a look
at how we actually interface with the
computer itself this is my computer's
motherboard and if you look in the
bottom right you'll notice two arrays of
pins these are called headers pretty
much every motherboard has them and they
used to interface with various things on
the case so grab your motherboards
manual or search up online and you can
find out watch what each of these pins
are for so you can see here we've got
the power LED we've got the reset pins
the power switch how those work is when
they're shorted together the computer
turns on so these pins are what we're
going to be using to control the
computer essentially okay my dude so I
couldn't find a fancy piece of software
that would allow me to sketch out this
design that included the pro micro hence
why you're going to have to put up with
this I'm afraid so we've got a voltage
regulator here 3.3 volt voltage
regulator of course so voltage in of
course we've got VCC going here that's
five volts in out our three point three
volts is going directly to our
fingerprint sensor and ground from the
fingerprint sensor is connected here and
you can't really see it but this is
connected to ground over here so pins
eight to nine on the pro micro we know
those are four data lines on the
fingerprint sensor and then the power
button so the power button works using
this transistor Dole points for
transistor is when you apply power to
the middle pin it will essentially
complete the circuits and currents will
be allowed to flow from this pin to this
pin so that's how we've got it set up so
when we apply power to pin four
the pro micro it'll go along here and
essentially complete the circuit between
these two which these two if you haven't
guessed already are the positive and
negative of the power button on the
motherboard so that's how that works
and I want to preserve the functionality
of my power button to LED so this five
digital pin five I've got the positive
line of the motherboards power button
LED going here with a 10k pulldown
resistor and pin six is the positive
output going directly into the cases
power button power button a LED that is
the negatives of the case LED and the
motherboard LED are shorted together
okay so the act of preserving the power
button ad is actually quite important
and its own Kyle explain in just a
second when we get over to the code okay
so now we're in the code let's have a
look at how this is all put together so
this whole sketch here is essentially
just a modification of the fingerprint
example sketch from earlier so at the
beginning here I'm defining a few pins
this power LED that's the output going
to the cases LED so when we set this to
one this turns the case LED on power
button for this pin goes to the middle
of that transistor we saw earlier so
when we set this to one it triggers the
power button turning the computer on and
power status okay so this pin is
essentially the motherboards power LED
output though we're using it we're using
it as an input and we're using it to be
able to tell the state of the computer
whether it's on or off so the reason we
want to be able to determine that is
that we want to be able to switch
between turning the computer on mode and
password manager mode because obviously
we don't want to trigger the power
button by accident when all we want to
do is put in our Amazon passwords or
something like that
so when the computer is on obviously the
computer is going to turn on the power
LED so that's how we know whether it's
on or off as pretty simple really okay
so of course we set my serial to eight
to nine and now let's have a look at
this so just
setting those pincers as outputs inputs
respectively and then we're beginning
the keyboard allowing us to inject
keystrokes and if we scroll down a
little this is all the same and the loop
okay so this loop essentially just keeps
on executing over and over again
infinitely and in the beginning of the
loop it all gets ID of the fingerprint
sensor so how this works is that if
we've got a finger if we haven't got a
finger on the fingerprint sensor this
will just return - wanna so ID will be
-1
however if we have got a finger on the
fingerprint sensor it'll return whatever
the ID of that fingerprint is so
assuming we've got our finger on there
if we scroll down let's have a look what
happens
so if digital reads power status equals
okay so this will execute and regardless
of whether what regardless of what state
this is so if power status equals 1 that
means if the computer is saying turn on
the power LED then we're going to turn
on the power LED else if the computer
isn't saying the turn on the power LED
then we're going to keep the power LED
off so this we're using this little bit
of code because in our case the computer
isn't directly connecting to the power
LED we're kind of acting as an interface
between it okay so this is the more
important bit
if ID is greater than minus 1 as in if
we've got a valid finger on the
fingerprint sensor and if the computer
is off then we're going to turn the
computer on
so essentially turning the power button
on the for 250 milliseconds and then
we're telling the power button off so
this is self explanatory finger on it's
a trigger the power button turning the
computer on and notice how we've got
that too if ID is greater minus 1 so
pretty much anything that will turn the
computer on so you could change that and
make it to a certain finger if you
prefer okay so now we've got else so if
it's a compute
sir is already on if the computer is
already on instead of triggering
triggering the power button instead
we're going to check what finger is
actually on the fingerprint sensor so
this is which a switch statement it
allows us to set different outcomes
different cases of what the ID might be
so in the case that ID is one I've set
this is my thumb I've set that to the
two Anna's on so this is my Amazon
password well it's not really but you
get the idea
case two so this is actually my index
finger and I've set this to my computer
password so when I get to the login
screen on my computer it's presses enter
its stops pressing enter it waits a
second then it puts in my computer's
password it waits a fraction of a second
and it presses enter again so this
allows me to log into my computer
essentially without typing anything if
I've got my middle finger on there it'll
put to my YouTube passwords that have
got Google passwords essentially users
YouTube and Google users saying that
well and then I've got my reddit
password so yes you could set this up
for both hands maximum of ten passwords
hell you could even put one of these on
the floor and then set one up for each
of your toes so I think that would be
really cool so of course I'll put all
the code I've used here in the
description so let's talk for a second
about the negatives of this thing should
you trust it to keep all your passwords
and your computer safe well yes and no i
doubt anyone in my household even knows
what's not we know is let's known has
the ability to reverse engineer this
whole thing download the binary from the
arduino finding out my passwords and
screwing me over like that however if
you know people that's more
technologically inclined then this might
not be the best of ideas just something
to keep in mind anyhow links to all the
things you need to make this project
yourself are down in the description
