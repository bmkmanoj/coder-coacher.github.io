I'm making this video just to update
you'll give you an idea of the plans I
have for coming here I haven't posted in
the last couple weeks because well
Christmas taking my time
that being said Here I am so expect your
normal programming to proceed as per
usual I have no idea what's going to be
in the background of this video this is
more of a off-the-cuff kind of thing so
apologies if it is not to your taste so
firstly as you guys will know I've made
a ton of videos on USB Rob lucky clones
and here I'm taking it one step further
I'm taking both of my main USB robotic
clones I'm telling them into actual
devices so that means PCB design
choosing the components sold and Amman
and all that kind of stuff bit of a
learning curve for me I must admit
however it's been quite fun so this is
what I've come up with I've designed the
first one and made it and it's turned
into this so obviously it's a lot
smaller and it looks like an actual USB
stick there is going to be a switch on
the back to toggle it off and on though
I haven't received this in the mail just
yet it's also got an LED so you can
actually see when your script is
executing so you know when to remove it
and that will even fit into a generic
USB housing so it works quite nicely
yeah just a normal USB as for this big
one and I am going to be doing this as
well however that's more on with the
pilot tester though I've already made
the designs for this it's just a matter
of getting it printed and stuff like
that I am going to be doing a giveaway
of these and some of the big ones once
I've made them so make sure you
subscribe and follow me on Twitter so
you don't miss the details and I've
already had some people on Twitter
asking me if I'm going to Sully's so in
that case I thought why not do a small
production run so if you're interested
in possibly getting these one of these
or one of the better ones once it's made
then there is a survey in the
description just so I can gauge how many
people interested and some other market
research don't we mega expensive of
course but let me know if you're
interested secondly I'm going to be at
least trying to do this whole YouTube
thing a lot more I'm 19 currently on an
impromptu gap year so I've got a lot of
time on my hands I did get a job earlier
this year becoming a delivery man decent
pay surprisingly however
quite boring I almost get kills every
now and then so I'll probably overlay
some footage on top of this because I
wear a GoPro the whole time is my
insurance policy so it looks like
instead of that I'm going to be trying
this YouTube thing so if anybody wants
to give me a helping hands I have
started a patreon I'll put the link in
the description so far I've spent quite
a bit on equipment so I need to make
videos however I really don't mind
seeing as I enjoy this quite a lot but
it would help quite a bit to be in the
positive
at the moment all perks are unlocked at
just $2 per month however you of course
welcome to pledge more if you can I'm
going to be doing a few patreon or only
giveaways as an incentive at some points
however of course there will be
giveaways for everyone else you'll just
have a higher chance of winning if your
patron because they don't expect many
people to become patrons additionally
patrons will get access to a private
channel on my new discord server
more on that in a sec however most
importantly you'll be enabling me to
spend way more time and effort into
making videos rather than getting run
over on the streets of London so next on
the agenda is my new discord server so
people always have questions on every
single video I made can YouTube really
isn't the best place to answer those as
firstly I don't get YouTube p.m.
notifications and comments easily get
buried so even if I get a notification
for comment and I think ok I'll check
that later respond to it
I might click on that video and find I
just can't find it some people might
email me or message me on Twitter and
that makes it easier how I've of course
that's multiple places to check so it
just slows everything down so I'm going
to be making discord server to be fat -
perhaps cultivates community anybody can
join the link is in the description you
can ask questions about videos make
suggestions if you want me to clarify
something I can or if you just want my
opinion on your mixtape I can also do
that patrons will get access to a
private channel where I'll be more
prompt in answering questions and will
provide a more in-depth opinion on your
mixtape also given that this is still a
relatively new channel I'm still
experimenting with things and I'm
thinking of doing a bi-weekly new
segment looking at what has happened in
the world of security and tech so do let
me know what you think of that in time
I'll probably get a facecam startup
going however it's a bit tricky seeing
as my background is my window so it just
makes me look like a silhouette and I
only have my phone to record on so it's
not very
convenience to do that sort thing I have
to get they've come anyway it's not
priority however it would be something
to get done apart from that I still have
loads of other ideas as to tutorials and
other stuff for one to make explain
style videos on I still have a load of
stuff hak5 semi that I'm still toying
with so 2017 should be a packed year I
quickly want to thank everyone for their
support almost 5k subs and growing I
never thought a beer so quickly see ya
remember to subscribe and follow me on
Twitter so you don't miss the details of
that giveaway if you're interested in
buying one of those I do we know rubber
ducky clone you are do we know things
whatever then check that survey down in
description I really need to find out
how many people are interested in that
remember to join that disc called server
link is in the description and if you
really like what I'm doing please do
consider supporting me on patreon
literally every dollar helps for two
dollars I could buy something called
from China and pack it into a project so
yeah thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
