attack ominous right it's a fundamental
flaw in the wpa2 protocol if you're
watching this video on Wi-Fi and chances
are you're vulnerable
so is Wi-Fi cooked does your Wi-Fi now
belong to hackers is Wi-Fi security
balked let's find out right after this
mal do we know is the Arduino based bad
USB inject keystrokes at lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's deaths at
wallpaper with the elite version simply
store and select between up to 16
different scripts on a microSD card to
find out more see the link in the video
description so first see let's take a
little look at how this attack works
I won't delve into it too deep the 16
page reports links below does a really
good job of that though essentially
crack attacks the very part of Wi-Fi
think that creates a secure connection
the four-way handshake the for a
handshake is used to make sure both the
clients and the access points know the
secret key aka that's the passphrase but
without directly exposing that
passphrase to creepers in the process
and then they create a session key to
use for the rest of the connection
periods if connection is lost and they
have to reestablish it this session key
is entirely different it's just unique
for the connection period once the quick
math is done message three or four of
the four-way handshake is transmitted to
the client this contains the session key
however because sometimes messages go
missing or are dropped the access point
might have to retransmits that's third
message each time the client receives
the message it reinstalls the key
contained within it this resets the
incremental packet number and receive
counter used by the protocol by forcing
this reduce the encryption protocol can
be attacked oh and also this affects all
iterations of WPA including enterprise
networks once pones an attacker can
perform man-in-the-middle attack between
the clients and the interwebs it becomes
even more problematic when victim is
using non HTTPS websites as any data is
sent unencrypted even if you are using
HTTPS some sites are badly implemented
and simply by using a tool called SSL
strip this extra layer of security can
be easily removed frustratingly most
people wouldn't even realize if this all
sounds a bit complicated that's because
it is
the paper that's just been released
describes this method in quite a lot of
detail but even at several months old
the researcher who uncovered this has
already found easy ways of implementing
this attack
he's holding off on disclosing those for
the time being the guy who figured all
of this out has a name I can't pronounce
so it's on screen instead though he's
chosen to be very responsible with how
the information is being disseminated
instead of publishing his findings on
paste bin grabbing the nearest bag of
popcorn and watching the world burn he
instead informed a load of vendors a few
months ago giving them some time to
patch their devices however he then
realized that this problem wasn't with
the vendors implementing wpa2 badly but
rather with wpa2 itself there's a video
showing an actual attack linked below
though even now there's no tutorials on
how to perform this attack the scripts
used to exploit this vulnerability offer
now under lock and key and will only be
released once everyone has had a
reasonable amount of time to update
their devices so onto just that updating
your devices is that really enough to
fix this issue or is this situation as
the hype suggested do you have to throw
away your router and buy a new one we
all know how much hassle it would be if
you actually had to update your Reuters
firmware luckily that's not the case
this exploits targets clients themselves
so it looks like yota will be fine it's
just everything else that needs a fix
for people frantically trying to change
their route as passwords don't bother
crack doesn't have anything to do with
your Reuters passphrase even if you do
get pwned your passphrase still remains
secure just make sure to keep your
device's updaters and you'll probably be
fine I know right a very boring fix also
don't try to be edgy and revert back to
WEP so in all honesty the doomsday
predictions surrounding crack really
weren't all they were cracked up to be
furthermore Wi-Fi hasn't been immune
from security issues in the past there's
a whole host of problems with it
including but not limited to being able
to kick other people of any other Wi-Fi
network even when you yourself aren't
associated with set network to find out
more about that see the video I've made
on how to make a Wi-Fi the author link
in the description please note this
whole crack things a rapidly changing
situation you information is bound to
come out so do keep an eye on the
