all about wpa2 Wi-Fi password cracking
surprisingly it's not really that hard
at all it comprises of two main steps
number one capturing the for a handshake
and to cracking the for a handshake so
what is the for a handshake well when
you connect to a Wi-Fi network you have
to enter a password but this password is
never actually sent over the network
instead only hashed versions of its are
sent over the network this is how the
device and the access point able to
prove to each other that they do in fact
know the password it gets a little bit
more complicated but this is in essence
two for a handshake
so if we can intercept this handshake
will have the hashed password we can
then go on to connect this hashed
passwords and that's it pretty much
don't worry if it doesn't make sense
just yet because it will later on so I'm
going to using Kali for this tutorial as
it has everything I need so make sure
you're using a compatible wireless card
or USB wireless adapter a link is in the
description to check that all right so
to get started you're going to want to
open you terminal window and then check
that your wireless interface is actually
detected by doing em on - ng and then it
should come up as W on something rather
for me it's W on 0 so we can put that
wise interface into monta mode so we can
have a deeper look at network traffic
just by doing em on - ng start wlan0
okay so it's going to identify a few
processes that might interfere with what
we're trying to do so as soon as it's
done this we can do em on - ng check
kill so now not only is it in monitor
mode but all these processes which could
interfere are gone so next we're going
to want one to run em on - ng again and
we'll see that our interface name may
have changed so for me it's changed to
double NZ Ramon so you're going to have
to keep their mind for the following
commands so next we can have a look at
what's going on in our area by doing aro
dump - ng W and serum one and this is
going to populate a list which is going
to show us all the nearby wireless
networks so once it's on to your network
is shown on the sides you just wanted to
do control said to stop that so I'll
just put it up here so the network
coming to beat attacking is well it's
actually a lamell but there was enough
space
forever reason so whatever so we can see
that the network I'm going to be looking
at is on channel 1 and its MAC address
is this so I'm going to open a new
terminal window and stretch over there
so next what we're going to want to do
is log all the traffic that goes on in
that network so when the for a handshake
does occur we'll know about it so I'm
going to create a new folder on my
desktop just called CAPTCHA it's for
everything in so next we're going to
want to do arrow dump - ng - C and then
the channel name so the network I'm
looking at is on channel 1 in the next
double - bssid
and then be a society of the network so
it would be this for me okay and then -
W so that's - writes all the in all the
traffic that goes on to a certain folder
so for me it's route desktop capture
okay and then make sure to put your
interface on the end so for me doubly
lanza Ramon okay so now it's going to
start doing that so everything that goes
on the network is logged to that
particular folder so we can see this is
the bssid of the network and we can see
these are the devices that are currently
connected to the network so if I close
this top window and just put this up
here then I'm going to open another
terminal window because we can only
capture the for a handshake when a
device connects or reconnect to the
network so because what we could sit
here and wait half an hour for someone
to connect to the networks but we want
to obviously speed up that process so we
can do airplay - ng - zero - just bear
with me how I explain in seconds - a and
then the BSS ID which I think that might
only be in my yep and then toggle on
zero one so what this is going to do is
send the authentication packets across
the network so it's going to deal sense
Kate's everyone up on the network kick
them off and then they're going to
rejoin to the network and then when they
rejoin to the network we're going to be
able to monitor that traffic can capture
the for handshake
so we're selecting the authentication
packets with - zero and then we're only
sending two of them because of course we
want to allow them to reconnect and then
- a which is access points bssid and
then on the end of course our interface
so I'll press ENTER on that okay so as
you can see it's sent those deal
authentication packets and the devices
you may not have seen it but the device
is quickly vanished and then reconnected
and on the top we can see WPA handshake
for this bssid which means we have the
four way handshake so if we close all
these windows and then open up the
capture folder that I put everything in
my desktop you can actually see this
these files represent all the traffic
that was going on in the network which
will also contain the for a handshake
which we can go on to convert and then
crack which I'll show you in just a
second okay so for the rest of the story
I'm going to be using Windows 10 which
is my host operating system it's best to
use your host operating system when
cracking hashes just because it's going
to utilize the resources better so to
crack the hash we're going to using hash
Katz so a link will be in the
description to where you can download
that so you just need to go to the
website and download the hash cap
binaries and then it extracts the
binaries into the folder so in this
folder you'll also notice I have a list
LST so this is the word list I'm going
to be using to crack this certain
password so in the description I'll put
a link to where you can download a load
of word lists they range from hundreds
of megabytes to many gigabytes you can
just try a small one and then work your
way up if the small one doesn't work so
firstly what we're going to want to do
is convert this file here which is the
main one we're going to want to focus on
- 0 1 it's a wireshark capture file
we're going to want to convert that into
formats which hash cats can understand
and work with so a link will be in the
description to this website where you
can upload this file and then tap
convert and it will convert it into a
file that's hash gate can understand and
then you can download that and crack me
hCAP is that file that I've already
converted
downloaded so we're going to want to put
that file into the hash cap folder so
now we're ready to crack essentially so
we've got all the hash cat stuff we've
got the word list and we've got the file
we want to crack so you're going to want
to open up a command prompt and CD into
the folder which contains all of the
stuff so see documents my dad's okay so
now we're going to want to run hash cat
so you can do that by doing hash cat
64 exe which you can season folder down
there and then you're going to want to
specify that it is actually a wpa2 file
you're going to won't be cracking so you
want to do - m 2500 and then put in the
capture file which for me it's crackme
dot H cap and then the word lists that
you can all to be using so for me it's
list dot LST and we press ENTER and then
it will run this and hopefully it's
cracked so for me it's found the
password is shrek 'l sh r 3k k l3 so how
long it depend how long it takes to
crack the password depends on one side
of the size of the word this this word
list is the where this i use was quite
small it's only about 16 megabytes but
you could use a lot bigger word list
maybe a few gigabytes big which would
increase the chances that the password
is going to be in that word list and
also the GPU power you have so i have a
gtx 1080 which means cracking passwords
going to be quite quick but if you have
something different something less say
it could take a lot longer so that's it
first video guys i have another really
cool video on wpa cracking coming soon
which is actually pretty cool you're
going to want to stick around for that
but if you have any questions about this
video make sure to leave in the comments
below and I'll get to them as always
remember to Like and subscribe and
thanks for watching my videos stay tuned
for the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
