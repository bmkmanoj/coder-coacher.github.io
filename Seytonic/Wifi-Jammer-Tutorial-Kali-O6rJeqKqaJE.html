lot about wireless network security so I
wanted to do a quick video on Wi-Fi
denial service aka
Wi-Fi jamming this isn't really hacking
but it's a cool trick you can use to
effectively prevent someone from
connecting to a certain wireless access
point or kick them off it completely if
they're already using it so to do this
you're going to need air crack installed
I suggest just downloading Kylie which
is a Linux distribution because it has
air crack and a load of other hacking
tools pre-installed secondly you're
going to need a wireless card or USB
wireless adapter capable of multimode
and Pakistan Jackson so to check whether
yours is compatible see the link in the
description down below alright so let's
get started so firstly you're going to
want to open a terminal window and check
that your wireless card is actually
recognized by Kali by doing M on - ng
alright so it's detected my wireless
cards and it says a chipset the driver
it's using an interface so we want to
make a note of this interface and we're
going to want to start monitor mode on
our wireless card so we can do that by
doing em on - ng start wlan0 Doby lines
here is the name of the interface for me
yours may differ so be sure to use the
right one and press Enter okay so while
it's enabling monitor mode we can see
this identifies three processes which
could interfere with what we're doing
kind of messed things up so you could
kill these process of manually by type
and kill and then the number for each
one but instead you can just kill them
all by doing em on a - ng check kill
such adds kill thrillers they go okay so
next we're going to want to view which
Wi-Fi networks are nearby that we can
potentially jam so we can do that by
typing Aero dump - ng and then the name
of our interface so when you enable
monitor mode your interface name might
change so you can check that here by
saying by looking at monitor mode v
enabled for wlan0 on turbulence zero
month so my name has my interface name
has changed wlan0 Mon so that's what I
want to put in here so airodump-ng job
you land 0 Mon ok
now that takes a couple of seconds to
beat up
it's going to monitor the network
traffic in our area so it's going to
show a few wireless networks and what
you might notice is that it's actually
picking up more wireless networks than
it would as opposed to if you went and
checked for wireless connections the
usual way and that's because it's a
monitor mode so it can pick up a wide
variety of things I think maybe possibly
anyway moving on okay so to get rid of
this and to stop this from Raleigh we do
control Zed okay so I'm going to just
put this to one side because we're going
to need to have a look at what's up here
and I'm going to open new time window in
just a second so my wireless network is
LML of course so I can see that it uses
wpa2 encryption it's on channel 1 and
the power is how close it is to you so
minus 8 is closer than minus 68 and it
also gives the bssid which is the MAC
address of our wireless router so I'm
going to open new tab window and we're
going to check what is actually on this
network and where while we're doing that
we're going to set it to the right
channel twos so we can do that by typing
aro dump - ng - C and then the channel
we want to listen to so in this case
channel 1 double - bssid and then be a
society of the router so we can pop it
up from here copy and paste ok great and
now we need to put in the interface name
so for me it's double + 0 1 okay so now
it's just monitoring just this wireless
network by itself and it's ignoring
everything else okay so we can see that
there's it currently can see four
devices within range ok so I'm going to
stop that but in controls it again ok so
now I've set it to channel 1 so we can
go ahead with jamming or rather it I
call it chiming but in practice what
it's doing is it's sending to your tenth
occation packets to every single station
so the station represents the MAC
address of the device that we're
actually looking at
so it's sending deal that is going to be
sending deal authentication package -
eats each of those devices on the
network
so to do that we can type airplay - ng
and then we do - a and then we want to
go and I want to put in the bssid of the
route that we want to send the - your
education packets from so that okay oh I
miss something so want to go back a bit
so before the - a we're going to want to
put - zero zero so this is quite
important the first zero represents the
authentication packets we're going to be
saying deal authentication packets to
the devices on these net on this network
the second zero means we're going to
send them continuously so we're just
going to keep on sending them and it's
not going to stop until we make it stop
you could put a number and say like five
and then so you're going to send five
the authentication packets I'm just
going let it do it infinitely okay and
then on the end we need to put W on
serum on COF I press ENTER we'll see
that it's saying to your indication
packets I'll flash up a video of my
phone and you can see that the wireless
connectivity has been lost by the phone
and it will try to also reconnect but it
will just get kicked off again and that
process will repeat right so stop those
your authentication packets being sent
just by pressing ctrl Z so what I want
to show you now is how we can kick off
or jam just one device access to the
wireless network because of course what
we've just done is going to kick
everyone off so let's get up a list of
the devices connected to that one
wireless network we were looking at so
let's go back through the commands as
let's do this one so it's going to show
us everyone on the network is the same
one we did earlier essentially so answer
okay so it's going to take a few seconds
for the list to populate but hopefully
any second it should pop up okay there
we go we've got one let's see if we can
get anything else come on I'm canceling
you okay just want to shut up no mind
okay that's fine so up - okay - l2
control Z so what this is going to do is
that's going to end that so what we can
see now is there's two devices
but say if we want to jam my phone of
course I'm not going to know which one
my phone is just by looking at the MAC
address so what you can do is these
first six characters of a MAC address
actually relates to the manufacturer
that made the device that's connected to
the network so what you can do is copy
these first six characters and then I'll
put this link in the description to a
website where you can actually paste in
those first six characters and press
find so now it's going to tell me that
this device was manufactured by a
oneplus stick which of course oneplus
makes phones so this is a 1 plus phone
so I'm going to kick that device off so
now what we can do is let's look for the
airplay okay that's this so what I'm
going to do is copy the station or the
MAC address for my phone and I'm going
to go back a few spaces and I'm going to
add minus C and I'm going to paste in
that address so essentially this is
going to use airplay it's going to be
authentic occasion packets infinitely on
our wireless network over here and it's
going to use the station as this one
here so now if I press Enter
great
so it's sending the authentication
packets and ok so I'll stop that being
sent in just a second so I can explain
what all this is ok cool so you can see
we got in the first line 259 so what the
59 stands for is the packets we sent and
what are the packets the college mint
packets we got from the router and the 2
means that acknowledgment packets we got
from the phone so since it went from 2
to 0 that means we know the phone has
been deal indicated from the network
when we get to 0 so it's on the network
here it's not the network here you can
see if we go down a bit it tries to
connect to the network again because we
get more acknowledgment packets from the
phone itself then it goes back to 0
again trust connect again gets to 0 and
then that's that essentially so that's
it for this video guys if you have any
questions feel free
to leave them in the comments section
down below as you can see on screen I've
started to twitter account at say tonic
so follow me all now I'll be tweeting
out what I think on cybersecurity news
the projects I'm working on and new
videos coming up soon so as always
remember to Like and subscribe and stay
tuned for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
