that I recently hit 50k subs as a
thank-you to all of you for making this
such an insane reality I thought I'd do
a giveaway or rather seven giveaways to
be precise sorry there's nothing much to
look at on screen I'm punched over my
laptop in my dorm room right now amongst
a big mess but anyway before we get to
the giveaway Black Friday is here so for
a limited time you can get 25% off all
meld winners with the discount code on
screen right now so to take advantage of
that or if you don't know what a month
we know is please see the links in the
description so as for the giveaway I'm
doing 7 giveaways giving away 7 mild we
know elites and not many people enter my
giveaways really so you've actually got
a real chance here so all you need to do
to enter each giveaway is the following
so for starters I will be giving away
one elite to a random person who
comments on this video I will check how
many times you've entered so to enter
only months secondly one elites to a
random person who follows me on
instagram and who has liked my latest
post thirdly I will be doing a
livestream most likely on Saturday
evening though possibly Sunday I'll be
giving away at least one elites there
though my streams do tends to go on a
bit so I'll probably be giving away more
than that just make sure to turn on
notifications so you don't miss it
whenever it happens next I recently
created a Facebook page so by liking
that you're automatically entered I'll
have that linked below fifth one elites
to random person who adds me on snapchat
all you need to do is add me and snap me
something and I'll randomly pick someone
number 6 1 elites to a random person who
subscribes to my mailing list linked
below I thought it would be a good idea
to build a mailing list or something in
case YouTube blows up so there's that
and lastly one ally to a random person
who follows me on Twitter and retweets
my pins tweet so there's quite a lot
there you've got pretty decent chances
if you miss something all the details
are in the description winners will be
chosen on Sunday and I'll contact the
winners within a week or so so next to
who this giveaway is open to I don't
really like limiting giveaways to just
Europe in the u.s. since I understand it
have a much more international audience
though please understand delivery to
certain countries can be incredibly
unreliable so if you win and you live in
Pakistan or something I'll happily send
it there just keep in mind it could take
a few months to get to you assuming it
turned up
at all so yeah just keep that in mind so
good luck everyone don't forget about
that 25% Malta we know discount codes
are links below and I'll see you on
Saturday or Sunday whenever I do the
stream so good luck and may be odd to be
ever in your favor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
