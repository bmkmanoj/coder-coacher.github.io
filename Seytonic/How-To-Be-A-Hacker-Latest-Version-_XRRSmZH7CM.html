lot of hobbyist hacker hardware stuff
though I've never really covered the
topic of how does one actually become a
hacker how does one climb the ladder to
achieve such a noble status well that's
something I'm going to be covering today
I'm going to be documenting my journey
of becoming hacker right after we hear
about something every hacker needs
Mulder we know is the Arduino based bad
USB injects keystrokes at lightning
speed gain a shell change someone's
desktop wallpaper with the elite version
simply store and select between up to 16
different scripts on a microSD card to
find out more see the link in the video
description so firstly it's well-known
and hackers don't use Windows on Mac
they use a special firmware called Linux
Linux is like Windows except it comes
with special hacker tools such as
terminal and bash so firstly to start
off you're going to want to find a Linux
download though I couldn't seem to find
a pure Linux download only these
advanced versions of Linux such as the
Bayan CentOS and open so say if you do
have a direct download link for Linux
please leave it in the comments as I did
get quite lost here anyway after
searching through hack forums on
incognito mode of course so I didn't get
caught I found out that Kali is the best
Linux hacker
distribution so I figured that using
Carly was the next best thing to using
the real Linux so I downloaded a copy of
Kali and I installed it by putting into
my Applications folder again just just
more issues I tried opening it it
wouldn't work it just mounted a drive I
was a bit confused so I went on to stock
overflow to ask for help
though people just started downloading
me which has a beginner just made me
feel really disheartened and made me
feel like I was stupid which just really
wasn't cool all of this just got me
really frustrated so I ended up just
going to eBay and buying a genuine copy
of Carly if you do decide to do this
just remember that Carly's classed as an
illegal substance so it could get you
vac banned if the authorities find out
you're using it eventually it arrived it
looks like just any normal CD but they
disguised it from being a hack at all by
putting a picture of a green penguin on
the front along with some gentlemen
wearing various monochromatic colored
hats only then did I realize that my
my laptop can't do CDs to be honest at
this point I really just considered
giving up I'd spent over $50 on the
hacker discs I couldn't even use and
over two and a half grand on a laptop
they can't even do CDs so for the rest
of this video I am going to have to put
up with just using Mac OS it's not ideal
though it has come to be my favourite
Linux distro also it does come with
hacker software such as terminal and
text-editor
so it's not complete disaster so now I'm
ready to start hacking though I'll need
to get some hacker gear and set up my
workspace you'll know from the movies
that hackers have multiple monitors I
spent all of my money on one 1440p 144
Hertz gaming monitor it may have cost me
more than three lesser monitors but it
does have a way higher refresh rate so
my response times when hacking into
mainframes it's just gonna be so much
faster also I paid $200 extra for the
version with G sync so I won't get
screen tearing when typing really
quickly though I haven't been able to
figure out how to get G sync working on
my macbook if you know how please do let
me know in the comments to be a real
hacker you need to know how to use
hacker hardware so I figured I would
test my skills by making some USB
dead-drops that means getting a bunch of
USB sticks and leaving them lying around
when someone picks one up and puts it in
their computer and opens the virus BAM
instantly pwned so I went over to ebay
and spent my entire student loan on two
thousand USB sticks eventually they
arrived and I opened the box with
intense trepidation though what's really
annoying is that the seller forgot to
stick the actual electronics bit onto
the USB connector so they don't really
do anything when you plug them in so all
I have is a bunch of worthless
connectors I guess he's not responding
to my emails and I obviously paid with
bitcoins I'm trying to be a hacker so I
don't really know how I'm going to get
my money back here at this point things
really started to look bleak though I
figured I should at least try and learn
how to do it programming since hackers
tend to do a lot of lads using some
YouTube tutorials I learnt up to if
statements in Java but everything after
that seemed to get a bit tricky but
anyway I figured I was at least a level
four programming so I thought I should
join a hack again to put my skills to
use and become at least a junior level
hacker I went and posted on various
hacker sites asking if any positions
were
available though I didn't seem to have
much luck anyway
hackers tend to be really politically
active so I changed my wallpaper to some
great historical and current political
heroes perhaps I'd be more accepted in
the community if I came across as more
woke the best hackers tend to be
intellectuals of sorts specifically very
good at maths so I thought I should open
my mind and learn some of the great
mathematical theories from great
mathematicians such as Dijkstra Newton
and Diane Abbott
unfortunately this this entire exercise
was all in vain as I no closer to
realizing my true hacker potential I was
even forced to reinstall my OS after I
accidentally opens the notorious
ransomware vim which I was unable to get
out of so anyway guys I hope you learnt
from my mistakes and maybe one day you
can be a proper hacker unlike myself if
you liked this video remember to give it
a like or two remember to subscribe if
you haven't already sure if you've got
any hacker friends maybe they can leave
comments let me know how I can be an
actual hacker and yeah stay tuned for
more hacking videos I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
