zeros lying around that chief and
powerful but obtain some program
directly by the way I keep on getting
asked where I get my PI zeros so head on
over to where's my PI zero comm it will
tell you exactly which nearby retailer
stockett to program a PI zero directly
you'd usually need a mini HDMI to HDMI
adapter a micro USB to USB adapter oh
and a USB hub if you want to use a mouse
as well as a keyboard and then of course
your micro USB to USB cable for power
not only will this make your PI bulky
but also double the cost kind of reminds
you of a certain laptop so here I'm
going to show you how to reduce the size
of this whole thing down to just this
something you'll be able to directly ssh
into on the host computer in this case
we're effectively turning the PI into a
USB to Ethernet adapter so let's go do
that right after these words mult we
know is an open-source arduino based bad
USB you can use it to inject keystrokes
at lightning speed gain a shell change
someone's desktop wallpaper anything you
can do with the keyboard and fifty
minutes of your time mods we new can do
in a matter of seconds to find out more
see the IndieGoGo link in the
description so firstly you're going to
want it down at the latest copy of
raspbian and flash it onto a micro SD
card simple stuff so after that's all
done you're going to want to go ahead
and open up the boot partition and find
a file called config txt so open up with
whatever you like and scroll rights the
bottom and on the bottom line we'll just
add a few lines and then paste in this
I'll leave these things and descriptions
you have to type them out so you just
want to paste that somewhere in the
bottom and save so then just close out
and then we want to open up command line
dot txt edit with notepad plus plus and
it's all one line here you just want to
go along until you find route wait here
so now we've got to paste something else
in there so if we just make sure we get
the formatting rights to leave one space
on either side of what we're pasting in
and just paste that in there save and
close that out and lastly we're going to
need to create an empty file called SSH
on the boots partition with no
extensions no anything no contents so we
can go ahead and
well I'm going to use notepad plus plus
so I open that up and go ahead and
create a new file and then without
typing anything in just go to save as
make sure it's in boots partition
filename has to be SSH and as for the
save type just select all types you want
to make sure there's no extension here
whatsoever and just save that so now if
we go and check there you'll see there
it's been created now we're pretty much
done so go ahead and eject the microSD
cards and plug it into your pie now as
for the microUSB cable make sure to put
it in the arm the right hole that's the
second one down from the top because the
top one doesn't actually have data lines
is just for power after you plugged it
in the pie will take a couple of minutes
to set up because it's its first boot so
after that let's continue so to check
that the pie is properly accessible from
the computer we can go ahead and open up
a command prompt and just try ping it so
the address of the pie is going to be
raspberry pi dot local that's just the
default so if we go ahead and try and do
that thing goes crossed and there we go
we're getting on replies so now we can
go ahead and directly connect to it so
now let's just as a searching switch
just like normal raspberry pies are
local and we should if everything works
correctly if there is and just drag over
okay so the default login would be pi
and password raspberry so you're going
to want to change that of course however
there is something else we need setup so
if you were to try and ping something on
the internet you would find that the
network is unreachable because as it
stands hi doesn't have access to the
Internet and that's something which
depending on your project you may want
to fix so let's go to that so in order
to get that internet working you're
going to want to right click on your
networking icon thing open network and
sharing center and click change adapter
settings okay so here you're going to
have a few options
so let's ignore these two because these
don't have any have anything to do with
what we're doing here
so here Ethernet that's my main internet
connection and Ethernet five is the
Raspberry Pi as I understand your are
three pi should be called Ethernet five
as well however if it isn't you just
look for something underneath here that
says USB Ethernet are ndis gadgets
okay so we're going to want to right
click on our main internet connection I
mean that's Ethernet and go to
properties and then go to sharing and
then check allow other network users to
connect stories computer internet
connection and where it says select you
can select your three pi which for me is
Ethernet five press ok and that takes a
second to do its thing and we should be
able to just close that out and go back
to our PI so let's just reboot the PI
so I've waited them in also and let's
restart the session and there we go so
pie and raspberry so now hopefully if we
try and hang something on the internet
we get response so what this is doing is
that the pie is just using our Ethernet
connection to exit into that so that's
pretty much it it's a nice simple trick
that I'm probably going to be using in
every single pie zero projects I do from
now just because it'll make my life so
much easier
