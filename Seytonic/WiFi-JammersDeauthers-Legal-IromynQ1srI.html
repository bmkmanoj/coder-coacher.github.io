on Wi-Fi the author's you can make one
for just a few dollars see the link in
the description when I show you how
Wi-Fi the authors are similar to jammers
in that they prevent you from accessing
your Wi-Fi network however are they
legal and how do they compare to real
jammers in the eyes of the law well in
this video I'm going to be looking at
just that however bear in mind this is
just my interpretation and therefore not
legal advice either way let's get into
it right after this mulder we know is
the arduino based bad USB you can use it
to inject keystrokes at lightning speed
gain a shell change someone's desktop
wallpaper to find out more see the link
in the video description so let's starts
with real Wi-Fi channels which are
pretty much universally illegal in every
country I checked jamuns aren't
particular to Wi-Fi you can get GPS 3G
jamuns 4G jammers etc however with
jammers you can't pick and choose what
goes down because everything in the
immediate area just goes blank so they
could potentially be used in crimes to
stop people from calling emergency
services originally used just to harass
someone in the u.s. operating a jammer
can result in jail time and a fine of up
to $16,000 even if you're just in the
middle of nowhere and you're only
testing the jammer on your own equipment
it's still illegal a jammer is dedicated
device you can't really turn a laptop
into Wi-Fi jammer so you need specialist
equipment so jamuns are pretty much
illegal but this is where the authors
come in a Wi-Fi the author is particular
to Wi-Fi you can't get them for GPS 3G
or 4G I've made a video on exactly how
they work so I highly suggest you watch
that and come back link in the
description of course though essentially
deals just take advantage of Wi-Fi being
badly designed and are able to
masquerade as wireless access points
then just tell clients to disconnect so
they're quite different from jammers in
that they don't block signals
indiscriminantly
with a dias attack you can choose
exactly who you want to be affected the
authors aren't dedicated devices so you
could just turn the laptop or even
cheapo module into one you yourself
could make a deal sir I've done a few
videos on actually so see the links in
the video description so RT author's
legal well yes and now let's look at the
FCC guidelines
maybe the authors fall into the same
category as jammers so the FCC states
that federal law prohibits
but any type of jamming equipment
including devices interfere with
and wireless networking services Wi-Fi
so the question here is what they define
is in fear real jammers will actually
interfere with the signals themselves
drying them out whereas the authors will
interfere with the acts of someone
trying to use their Wi-Fi
so what's interpretation is correct by
the way I'm looking at US law in
particular here because it doesn't seem
to be anything specific to EU law on
this subject
those guys are too busy with other
things anyway luckily the FCC has an FAQ
so under the hell did jammers work
section it tells us jamming technology
generally does not discriminate between
desirable and undesirable communications
a jammer can block all radio
communications on any device operates on
radio frequencies within its range so
since the authors do discriminate ie
they can choose specifically what
devices they want to affect and thus
will not block all radio communications
that operates on its frequency I think
it's fair to say that the authors do not
fall under the FCC's definition of a
jammer so they're legal then well not so
fast
in 2013 Marriott Hotels was fined
$600,000 for use of the author tags
Marriott's got annoyed that people
weren't signing up for their overpriced
Wi-Fi service charging customers up to
$1,000 for each device connected so they
decided to deal everyone else's Wi-Fi in
the immediate area forcing them to sign
up with Mario's overpriced plans if they
wanted to access the Internet in the
wake of this the FCC was forced to put
out a statement on why fight the authors
under the waters prohibited section it
states no Hotel Convention Center or
other commercial establishments or the
network operator providing services at
such establishments may intentionally
block or disrupts personal Wi-Fi
hotspots but I don't - boy you hear but
you can't do it if you're an
establishment and you're trying to force
people to use your Wi-Fi that's just a
big no-no so it would seem that if
you're not dealing maliciously or for
financial gain then they don't have
anything against that they don't mention
private individuals here in their
statement however I would has a guess if
you were caught do your things someone
else's Wi-Fi network and got caught then
you would end up in trouble so my advice
would be to stick to networks you own
however it would be really nice if the
FCC could just come out and clear up all
the nonsense and just tell us
is it okay to use it at all I mean you
can't use jammers at all wherever you
are for whatever reasons so
clarification would be nice especially
for countries that don't have anything
on the subjects like in the UK the rest
of the EU so even if you're in one of
those countries that doesn't have it
specifically banned or even doesn't have
any specific laws on it whatsoever I
would still keep it to your own Wi-Fi
networks because if it came to it then
it really wouldn't be a stretch of the
imagination for someone to argue that
the author comes under the same category
as a jammer which are pretty much
universally illegal so yeah your own
Wi-Fi networks will be fine just don't
do it to anyone else if you're still
wondering what a deal authentication
attack is at this point then I'm
surprised you got this far however I've
got a video for that so see the link and
video description if you want to learn
how to make one yourself I also got to
be here for that
multiple see the link in the video
description as well so yeah thanks for
watching guys remember to like this
video if you liked it subscribe if you
haven't already and as always no no no
remember to follow me on the Twitter's
and instagrams and then you can stay
tuned for more hacking videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
