and it's my pleasure to data introduce
David schwate er who's going to talk to
us about innovation in business today
David's the author of a number of
technical books and you should google
him and find out more very interesting
man to talk to and I'm sure he'll
welcome your questions both at the end
of the presentation and and if you want
to talk to him afterwards so please
welcome David swatter it is a distinct
pleasure to be here today ladies and
gentlemen and I'd like to start off by
thanking Google you are my home page I
use your maps extensively I gave google
mail I just like Google you know
inventors stuff it your open source
project in OpenOffice i'm looking
forward to that hitting the street I've
got a von do system coming in that's got
open source on it for the first time in
my life it's your your your
consciousness in data center efficiency
I've actually quoted your work has come
out your your analysis on disk drive
failures I do a lot of writing about dis
data storage currently the editor in
chief the semantic technology Network
and I put out a newsletter to 120,000
people every month across the world and
a number of articles so if you would
like to be internationally published
there some way for Google and semantics
to do this together I am your guy and
your go-to guy so let's let's move on
we're going to have a lot of fun in this
presentation we don't have time to
explain that particular picture there
but you might be able to figure it out
from crossing the chasm and we all
arrived here in stations in life with
expectations now my expectation and I'm
going to do my level best to deliver on
it is is that this is going to be fun
it's just going to be exciting and it's
going to be interactive sort of like
this YouTube Google at the YouTube video
have you seen this Joe Joe Joe Satriani
Google of 10 you got to see this one and
I'm formally asking Google if they would
please put the you
to video that this will be right next to
this guy's because I want to look over
the cyber fence and ask him how he does
all of his great could trace where the
greatest guitar players in the world so
the other expectation I have is this
will be an interactive presentation I
will ask the audience questions and i
will get answers okay I've got a lot of
heartbeats to spin so that said what are
your expectations somebody to see a lot
just of just a few what do you guys want
you what do you what did you think was
going to happen when you came here today
learning and what else fun entertainment
diversion food cafeteria all right there
you go okay okay good all right but
we're going to try me at all those I'm
going to kick it off with a little fun
now that we've established a little
interactivity got a Chris twenty-dollar
bill here try to the first person that
can identify what is going to appear on
the screen right now okay you got to
yell it out no guts no glory one call
one close call early call off and call
at the top right take a stand you ready
here comes what is it okay who's first
you okay all right can I bother you to
bother you to stand up okay you see it's
called an audience victim it bear with
me you're doing great you're really
doing just bear with me on this okay now
in a word the answer's no it's not a
hair dryer but but you get partial
credit okay because you know it's closed
so here just the twenty-dollar bill
right okay there you go there's your
twenty dollars okay so there's your
partial credit here now there's a lot of
smart people here at Google I'm is
blowing every nose right lots of our
people here no no no no no
your public beating is not done yet okay
so lumpy so do you know everybody here
you don't you don't write and so you
answered and maybe some of these people
are snickering say no no yeah watch a
little nervous about that you know maybe
blurting something out or were you just
overpowered by that I took a risk alex
took a risk good ok so I'll who did not
hesitate everybody raise your hand who
do not hesitate ok I didn't see
everybody's hands go up ok so that means
that there's some people here that
hesitated guess what when it comes to
innovation it helps to drop some
defenses and go for the goal for the
goal line right right away take a stand
in uncertainty because he doesn't know
me so I'm going to reward that ok so now
you've got half of it you got ten bucks
worth so when you have an appraisal with
a manager and he says you did great on
this and you did great on this and you
did wonderful on this what's the next
three letter word out of his mouth but
ok ok but you didn't get it right ok
what is it let's see if we can get it
it's a tow dryer that's what it is I
mean this is this is my toe dryer I swim
in the Mountain View pool and what's
what's in Mountain View stays in
mountain view you know Las Vegas and
stuffing us so I dry my toes so that's
what it is there's no way you could have
gotten the answer right ok but the point
here is is that when you look at
something and you're an innovator you're
going to describe it with words your
words will necessarily constrain the
perceptions of what it is used for here
is maybe a more suitable definition
electrically powered device that
generates an optionally heated focused
airstream when you go into target and
you want one of these things is that how
you describe it no you say I want a hair
dryer ok so what's going on here is as
we live in a very complex world and I
and I don't like the word complex ok we
live in a multi-dimensional fractal
based nonlinear world with feedback
loops that exhibits
discontinuities tectonic shifts and
effects of scale and time so when you
are trying to invent something you've
got to look at something differently
than when you are asking to buy one
because you do something different for
efficient communication and bundled
communication what I just talked about
is a very technique a very common
technique that Burt Rutan uses he has no
no preconceptions on how things are used
when he needs a part for one of his
airplanes you know like spaceship no
your spaceship guy out there you know
where he gets him he goes to the
junkyard and it gets the switches and
stuff out there okay so pigeonholing
typecasting stereotyping that's the
effect when you go in and you're
communicating what you want okay so your
punishment for not getting it right is
to accept the remainder of this on the
condition that you will discuss these
three words with somebody over a
favorite beverage somewhere we do that
for me please would you please give this
this wonderful man a good half a
wonderful sport thank you very much
thank you very very much so for the rest
of the audience that didn't cash in you
see those three words the first person
that yells bingo when they see them on a
slide one slide they get ten bucks Hey
Oh 3 have to be in the same slide so
here we go so my name is Dave swatter
we've got a number of books out and I
couldn't understand when I worked in IBM
for 15 years how they could miss
Ethernet how they could miss tcp/ip how
they could miss routing how they can
miss the web and how big could miss the
internet you know I only costs him 100
billion dollars and let me tell you
there were a lot of smart people in
there you know shaking trees and things
like that and and I was what I was
leading the charge come on so I began
studying 10 years ago intensively change
or resistance to change and I have I
have studied innovation in these six
disciplines
girl the picture you see over there on
the left that is Dillman writing about a
70 foot wave impossible before 1992 very
possible now that was my first lecture
at Stanford on the evolution of the
surfboard and it's it's very fascinating
I can come back here and do this one too
it's it's it's not it's not a sports
story art literature music today we are
talking about industry now all took
biology right King to file a motor class
family genus species and all that the
taxonomy here is innovation innovation
and industry innovation in the aircraft
industry integration in the light
aircraft industry in in the experimental
like craft industry and scaled
composites in a root on aircraft Factory
and a specific project all the way down
on the food chain called flight of the
Voyager incredible successful it's
hanging in the Smithsonian with the
Wright Flyer the bell x-1 Brook speeds
you know with and with with our buddy up
here right so hang it outside so this is
this is the book called Voyager it's out
of print but you can actually go to the
pilot he has a site dick rutan you'll
see it on the next slide and get a copy
of this it's fascinating really go to
amazon barnes and normal used books six
bucks and get it and get one of these
copies if you want but it's pretty
accurate lots of good information on
there and it's sort of the story so if i
can get my little puppy to work here ok
so this is it this is the stanford
innovation presentation that i gave in
january of this year and i'm going to do
it stock as i did it at Stanford but
there's one more special google slide
one more Google bonus ok when it's done
so this is it this is the Voyager you're
never going to see an airplane like this
again let me tell you and you'll
understand why as we go through it it
was designed for one purpose and that
was to fly around the world on a single
tank of gas without refueling right and
then take took off at Edwards Air Force
Base and it landed it inverts Air Force
Base
it happened a little over 20 years ago
in December of 1986 dick rutan is the
guy that tells it all best because he is
the guy that flew it most of the time
there are only three people that flew
this airplane and they probably had a
tough time finding any other volunteers
yeah so this is the agenda of what we're
going to talk about we're talking about
the principles and all good startups
right have wet napkin in a greasy spoon
restaurant somewhere and you know pencil
drawings on it you know compaq computer
started there things like that talk
about that initial plan and then the
test plan phase one test plan phase two
the flight and then the conclusion and
what we're going to do here is we're
going to learn about the startup because
this is Silicon Valley startup stuff set
in Modesto in an alien industry and it's
intentional that I do this because it's
called lateral thinking it is to start
you off in a place that you are unlikely
unfamiliar with and take you to a point
you've never been and and so you're
basically most of you are defenseless at
this point you know nothing about this
so here we go these are the principles
two of them to start with the gentleman
on the left is dick rutan he's the pilot
he's the older brother of the gentleman
on the right who's burt rutan ok so
let's find out a little bit about him
dick rutan obsessed with flying he got
his his his flying permit first and then
he went and got his driver's license the
same day at age 16 he just loves to fly
me this guy'll fly anything can't keep
my home decorated aviation war hero he
was shot out of the air in Vietnam II he
was on his third tour in Vietnam the guy
was that was in the pilot seat went in
too low they got ground fire flames
coming out of the airplane about 50
yards and they had to kill the
afterburner it shut off and then the gas
needle started going like this and they
said we got to hit it again and they hit
the afterburner and shot up flames
exploded out again
over the coast do it about Mach 1 and
ran out of fuel they jected that came
down that was his last flight he rotated
back he did another ejection in England
where somebody left an oil cap in the in
the oil pan and it blocked the oil and
the engine just blew up and and he got
so he's he's seeing there any guy he got
injured on that second one day so he
retired from the Air Force and one of
the reasons why he retired from the Air
Force's he's a maverick he objected to
the concept of a superior officer when
people were really referring to senior
officer and there's a great great
distinction there and I admire him for
for recognizing that he is the right
stuff in the Thomas Wolfe sense he's
this this is this is a guy that will fly
anything anywhere and probably lived to
tell about it and he survives by a micro
view as a pilot he knows he's going to
die in a single thunderstorm cell over
Denver it's going to be like real
personal and real tightly focused in the
way the wings are going to come off the
airplane okay he loves acrobatic flying
he says he he's a jet job his younger
brother is also obsessed with flying but
more on the design side as a kid he
would go and pick up wrecked balsa wood
model airplanes and he rebuild his own
airplane and it would win he and he was
he was a youth champion model aeroplane
builder he want so many times they
started moving the fence near the goal
posts to try and keep him from winning
no one could beat this guy so got a lot
of really hardcore experience a longer
planes and in fact most of his airplane
designs now are a direct result of his
model airplane they're just big model
airplanes very prolific I think he has
30 or 40 airplanes that have actually
flown 300 different designs he works on
lease costs he admits he designs him on
the toilet in the morning you know you
just seem think that's you know no
productive so in the 70s he founds route
an aircraft factory aria and he
discovers he has absolutely no interest
in customer base and mundane stuff this
guy's all about design and eventing as
soon as the thing is designing
moves on to the next one and just and
let somebody else handle the details
doesn't want to worry about inventory
cost control accounts receivable any of
that stuff right very prolific he works
in composites which gives him at a
tremendous advantage in that when the
design is wrong he brings out a chainsaw
I just chains off the you know chainsaws
off the wing right he slams on some more
go form core and he covers it up with
graphite or fiberglass or whatever it is
and boom he's back up in the air again
none of this six-month turnaround for
aluminum molds and stuff like that he is
an avid Experimental Aircraft
Association supporter which is the group
that sponsors home-built airplanes and a
bunch of other things as a macro view he
says you know probably some time next
year is gonna be a really big cold front
that comes through from Canada down to
Texas that's that's about his he's
dealing with whether he hates acrobatics
flying so the problem here is that the
younger brother is the boss of the older
brother okay I both confidence stubborn
older brother wants to be acrobatic fly
these these little airplanes which it
calls Ferrari with lanes down here in
the bottom line and they stand it so he
quits he says okay I quit can't take
work in here anymore for you Burt and so
he quits and of course that's the way
it's going to work because younger
brother is the boss okay there's a third
person here a third person is Ginny agar
and she's just a little 95-pound teeny
little thing dripping wet out of the
shower and the reason why that number is
important is because they're going to
fly around the world when you fly around
the world every transported pound that
you fly around the world takes two point
six gallons of gas that weighs six
pounds per gallon so it's 12 pounds
those 1,200 pounds to get her around the
world you're going to need two people
because you can't stay awake for you
know five six eight nine days due to fly
this airplane so I have some handouts
here which I can pass out but over there
on the left-hand side these are just
some of the designs that Burt Rutan has
come up extremely prolific
you know not all of them saw a light of
day and if you look in the upper
right-hand corner this is the internals
of one of these little airplanes that he
designed the ford canard airplane very
efficient took the world by storm that
said with as much fun and games as all
this stuff is let's take a look here
there's somebody else at the table and
it sir isaac newton all right and you
can romanticize all you want but the
fact is is that you know when you're
doing your calculations in and I'm
listen we'll work out a few of them here
you guys bring you slide rules oh oh you
know you know okay all right you work
out some of the rules you know if the
wing snaps off you know sealed story the
the 15,000 footfall will not hurt you
know it's too sudden stop and you won't
live to tell about it so you got to get
these things right so that's what is
this okay so one plug for EAS
experimental airplanes can be very safe
but a bunch of people get killed after
they have a safe one and they start
experimenting like but prop pitch
control motors and say well you know we
can fix that next time and I know you
can't you ever play one exists next time
and you're going to have two people in
the air flying this airplane it turns
out there's a support crew of about a
hundred people let's meet some of them
yeah okay Larry Caskey he's the guy that
ran the control center he did really
really find you Bruce Evans he's a
gentleman actually built most of the
Voyager working for root an aircraft
carrier aircraft company Burt Boutin's
company mike and sulley melville those
Arbor true tans partners there's the the
flight medical doctor George aletta Jack
Norris he did the fuel calculations
which are very very complex because it's
a calcul it's a calculus problem you got
to get a bunch of fuel and and you're
flying at a certain efficiency at this
point but after its burned off your
little higher efficiency here and you're
burning less and burning less and so
there's this decay
see Doug Schoen great pilot Lynn
Stillman one of the greatest weather men
that ever lived when these guys did this
flight they were wired in military
satellite systems that were beaming down
five a minute weather satellite
photographs typhoons and weather clouds
and thunderstorms and things like that
and last but not least is John Ross and
John ronski is one of the greatest
aerodynamicists that has ever lived and
this guy he built his own heathkit
computer as a kid and he was doing
laminar flow projections and lift and
drag ratios and everything else and he
actually fixed a number of burt rutan
designs and in fact you know the global
floor global flyer right the one that
just went around the world in a jet you
know Steve Fossett and all that all
right a single guy all right he did the
aerodynamics on that and it's one of the
most efficient and far flying airplanes
that has ever existed it's miraculous
almost made out of tissue papers like so
you've got two people in the air you got
100 on the ground that's generally what
it takes got a few guys out on the rock
band on stage right you got a big crew
moving everything around behind them so
it takes a lot so here's the wet napkin
dick net dick resigns from routine
aircraft factory and says hey got a plan
wants you to design an airplane for me
that I can do acrobatics in and i can
sell and bert says no way you know he
knows he's going to eventually get sued
by people to get killed whether there's
a case or not because the united states
anybody can sue about anything so he
says it's an alternative want just fly
around the world on one tank unref you
you know composites make it possible now
you can do it it's the last thing that
hasn't been done last great milestone so
they get talking and he draws up a plan
on it teriyaki stained dinner napkin and
it starts right there as luck would have
it here it is there's basically the
drawing it is drawing model number 76
because it's the 76th design that Burt
had envisioned hey aspect ratio 3035
meetings really long
and slender wings that's impressive you
like the you to to place tandem two
people are going to be and it got to be
oh hey look dick the app cockpits a bed
so one person can be catching Z's while
the other guys lying I love it let's
pressurized so you're not going to need
any oxygen so you can get up real high
and fly fast and you know over the
weather and all that good stuff that's
time pretty good the takeoff weight
versus landing lane is 1.2 eighty
percent of the airplane when it takes
off is going to be fuel not see how it
sounds good carbon fiber retractable
gear course you know don't want that
drag those gears steerable got two
engines one in the front 22 you know the
pullet is a tractor and the other one is
a pusher stock ones of course you
minimize risk you got a new airframe
here so let's minimize the power plant
risk alright so minimize the new stuff
really goes far biggest airplane yep six
to twelve months hey I'm impressed what
are we talking about here we're talking
about a plane that they call light and
slippery I mean this thing is really
really classy oh yeah they have a behbeh
have a plan look at this you're going to
build the airframe actually they're
going to have somebody build the
airplane airframe for them based on
corporate donations to come in because
they're going to put logos and stickers
on it so they're going to be funded
bigger it's cadillac phase one you're
going to test make sure it's and fly
right and go far enough phase two
they're going to install all the
components you know all the radios and
radars it turns out they need I'm going
to fly the mission I don't know how are
you guys you know I I'm pretty impressed
here I think we should declare victory
now look all the elements are here right
we've got experienced professionals deep
knowledge base a design we got a plan
stretch goals yeah I like it I like you
okay yeah I want to hear you yelling
dingo oh yeah stretch goal I mean you
know all the elements are here all right
so it's just a small matter of execution
but being the you know uncertain person
I am I think we should ask Hellmouth
what do you think when asked helmet
let's ask helmet ok let's homeless a Oh
Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke 1860
general and the German army no battle
plan survives contact with the enemy
this is actually in this quote by the
way and which is a whole nother lecture
so what changed oh that great flying
wing well small problem didn't have
enough fuel to get around the world and
even if it could by the time it started
getting the home base if there was a
breath of winning the air will just blow
it away from the Air Force Base so I
mean like uh huh and it's not gonna work
ok so God do something else that's
februari of 81 here's where we are in
march of 81 he says ok we're going to
put some big pontoons out there I'm
going to fill those suckers up with gas
and now we got the gas right and we'll
have our two engines and and everything
so so this is a you know this seems like
a pretty good plan so let me um I
brought some some goodies here and I
want you to know that I'm not much of a
I'm not much of a model builder and as
it turns out it's it's also Russian
plastic so it's a well you don't want to
pass it around with that I don't want to
do it here's here's the missing wing
okay no no no no that didn't happen in
the in the actual flight so he pass it
around yet sticking annum you give you
an idea what this thing looks like
that's pretty slick okay I feel a lot
better now maybe you know maybe they're
gonna make it what you think okay that's
it here we will move on ok so we're
passing around the model here came from
Russia I got three of these they're very
hard to get and plastic is terrible Oh
other wet napkin plan changes I one of
it look this is they were going to get
major sponsor money let's see they'll
beat a path to our door
this is kevin costner feel the dream
stuff 18 months went by called everybody
nobody cared right we were so naive so
there's only one option it's what your
founders did in the garage right over in
Palo Alto right right you know I
wouldn't got a bunch of cheap
motherboards and slammed them together
and they boot strapped it up and they
they went over and talked to Andy
bechtel Sean good guy really good guy
and so they got okay so like this so
they start bootstrapping what does that
mean well what it means is I think it's
going on right now there's a big EA a
convention airplane convention in
Oshkosh you probably heard about it so
they flew their nets them coming in and
there's a story about that flight cup of
them coming in and they're out there to
petition for money and if you look
carefully over there sort of in the
middle left hand side of the screen
you'll see the airplane out there were
thronged people around it and these
people go gaga right if you look over
the right hand side of the screen you
see how those little lies well those are
all the other Burt Rutan airplanes right
so you know the very easy to long
easiest and things like that so like
these guys were real well known they
were there rock rock heroes when they
show up and particularly with this
airplane so here comes some of the money
they get one for two dollars it says
give it your best shop or bidding on you
don't laugh I don't get lunch today so
they funded a two million dollar project
back in eighteen eighty six on to dot
and hundred dollar donations and things
like that and this is what you want hi
when you guys indexed my lecture on
digital image processing that I gave it
computer literacy back in nineteen
ninety eight or so I said Google is
really good these guys are gonna make it
because you didn't so he had me I was a
roy g tuck that good so all right so
these guys are scrounging around and
they do get a few fabulous sponsors they
really do Hercules for some of the
carbon composite were
and some other people you see later on
they said okay somebody else is going to
build the plane Yeah Yeah right they're
going to build the plane right so there
they are that's Bruce Evans over there
on the left-hand picture and he's a
route an aircraft factory employee for
working for Burt Burt Rutan and the
other picture there's areas again along
with dick rutan and they're building
part of the looks like probably the one
of the pods there and you've got Jenna
Jaeger over there building another part
there so they actually are out there got
quarter-inch Nomex honeycomb stuff and
they're laying down to three thousandths
of an inch carbon fibers at 45 degree
angles and the top and the bottom and
there are no fuel tanks in this airplane
because the inside of all of the
cavities are sprayed to be fuel
resistant and they are the fuel tanks so
what do we have here ah good okay now
we're all engineers here so I get a
little nervous but you will be pleased
to know that they observed the
internationally accepted TLA our
engineering aircraft construction
standards does anybody know about the
TLA are that stance where that looks
about right and it it's wags there are
very very few for mo drawings so this is
engineering on the fly and it was up
yeah pretty good engineering oh boy
those cockpits are going to be
pressurized with no 0200 it's not going
to be pressurized 02 is gonna be
required they're gonna have to carry
very heavy tanks so rather than carry
three tanks for oxygen what they do is
in one tank they put three times as much
as they should so they have hey they
have you know potential projectile
oxygen canisters you know you know like
four feet away from them at all times
and because they're flying low it's now
going to add three days the flight was
going to take six days and now we have a
50-percent mission overrun I wonder if
that makes a difference when you
okay gosh okay oh yeah I'm gonna fly
west to east Wow turns out that the you
know the global trade winds and
everything go the opposite direction so
Lynn snow them and save him on that and
it turns out here's a factoid for you
spring it on somebody at lunches hasn't
been here did you know you know you got
the equator there is more land mass
exposed above north of the equator than
south of the Equator turns out they're
going to fly in December and because of
the inequity of the distribution of land
mass the the convection currents come up
from the south hemisphere to the north
and just all blazes break out over a
over Africa when they're going to be
trying to do their mission so they know
they've been warned there is no way you
can get across Africa forget it it's
just every day it's just it's absolutely
insane so well they have we're at least
they're going well no doesn't look like
they're going to have lots of interior
room they cut it down to about the size
of a telephone booth for two people and
there's no soundproofing because they
can't afford the weight for
soundproofing so few feet behind them
they've got a motor and a few feet in
front of them they got a motor and
they're going to lose their hearing okay
and the physiological thing there it is
that's the cockpit that's it one person
lays down and then the other one flies
okay you got dick there and this is
Jenny Yeager and that's it that's that's
all the room there isn't a thing for
nine days so oh it looks like in
addition to some plan changes we've got
some surprises I wonder what these are
well okay we couldn't afford the weight
penalty of insulating putting the wire
mesh in to get rid of the static
discharges and so in things like empty
fuel tanks you've got static electricity
shooting a communal kaboom right here 32
oh that's impressive smoke smooth fuel
fumes come out and the airplane they
never track down where this
slope comes out of the panels and things
like that very straight their fuel lines
start rotting on them that flight that
they did to ahsha ahsha they kind of
like grabbed some motorcycle motors and
stuck them in there for you know
temporary power plant well the off-gas
some acid and they got in there and
they're all rotting away and getting
ready to leak so they cut them out where
they could see them but by now they went
way out into the wings and in places you
couldn't get to at this point so you
gotta hope now did they get it all well
okay they put one rudder in rather than
two and the reason why they did that I
want to save weight and that's it it's
over there on the I guess that's the
starboard side of the airplane if you
were I'm not at all right all right yeah
it saved a pound right every pound you
save it was three and a half pounds of
fuel so what they discovered also that
the vertical tails even for level flight
were marginal barely keep the thing in a
straight line it was just like wandering
all over the air this thing if you
wanted to turn in ah good luck so what
does that mean highly compromised for
mange asymmetric handling you could turn
right easier than you could turn left
because you only had one rudder and it
wasn't on the center line okay this
sounds kind of you know Jana winter oh
oh the canards also the little wings up
front you know they have tremendous
loading on them don't get the canard
wrong airplanes just fall right out of
the sky John Rahn 6th some of the canard
designs for retreat and when they flew
in the storms and it's called
perturbation theory when the laminar
flow gets in disruptive you know epsilon
distance away from the the surface of
your airfoil so they had to go in and
add stick vortex generators into to
create turbulence to break up the
laminar flow disruption was too close to
the leading edge ok John ron's did that
very very good work very good guy ok
Bert's comment was don't fly in the rain
yeah kind of fly around the world go fly
in the rain ok hi
adverse yaw and dihedral effects what
that means is you try and turn the
airplane but it starts turning into
spaghetti and as soon as you let go of
the wheel it is call it just comes back
because the airplanes bent and it just
just just comes back so it's it's a
miserable handling airplane verte says a
dick its mission adequate its World
flight doesn't have to turn it all you
get in at your honey come on okay okay
so they learn on the Oshkosh flight here
a dart and oxygen is absolutely
essential and Burt says no it's not well
unfortunately it was so they had to put
in the extra weight and they put up
there in the starboard front pod there
okay credible noise in the cockpit they
had 16 fuel tanks that they bled very
carefully into a feeder tank and then
the feeder tank went to the engines and
they were constantly siphoning fuel out
of these tanks it was so time-consuming
that they had what was it six minutes an
hour idle time 54 minutes per hour for
both of them were spent handling fuel
reporting doing everything else this is
a nine-day flight 6 minutes and our time
on ok the cockpit wasn't put on the
center line of the airplane and was put
off to the right so the people could
move around inside and so it was on kind
of an angle like that so if you tried to
straighten it up you know the wings were
going like that and you weren't flying
straight so you very easy to to to get
pretty good Dix comment was well you
only have to live 48 hours after the
world flight and if you live any longer
than that then we've wasted something
obviously 444 range capacity okay oh
there's more surprises in phase one okay
so if you go define colon Voyager you
know in the Google search page you get
17 compartment sealed flexible flying
fuel bladder containing 3.5 tons of
explosive fuel surrounding to potential
incineration candidates oh yeah oh yeah
that's this is this got a lot of feel OK
at worse worse oh my gosh I actually
on it send my car above 82.5 knots there
was an induced annotation amplified
wiggle in the airplanes caldera last
icity and actually i had a model that's
it there i call it my voyager Pentagon
general training and if you grab it in
the center spar and you can you pull it
up and down the wings flap up but also
at the same time the nose flaps up and
when that happens this becomes a control
surface along with the canards and so
then the airplane starts porpoising and
it becomes divergent got any stanford
mechanic any mechanical engineering
students here all right ok google test
look familiar all right that's what
we're talking about here right above
82.5 if you did not hop on to these
oscillations within 15 seconds your
airplane was toast and you shortly
thereafter so so it's ok let's fix this
and the way they fix things typically
with these airplanes is with band-aids
so they raised the main gear which are
the back one and they lower the front
landing gear and oh by the way the
landing gear was only built to sustain
10 smooth landings and they were
probably up to thank you very much thank
you very much ok maybe we could know
what this is too rigid yeah oh yeah ok
well that's that's speak of the devil ok
so fix the failing look so they had to
fix the front front wheels to at the
same time because the thing is uh wait
so consensus is it's fundamentally
unsafe airplane death trap we're going
to do this thing and we are never going
to fly this thing again these are very
experienced pilots you know dick rutan
you guys can thought it's going to kill
them and and you know it really did ok
oh now in phase 2 when they're putting
in the instruments there's some more
changes to the plan here let's hear your
plane design are they were going to use
those two proven engines well a new one
and a super good one
appeared and it was for a spy airplane
and the spire plane now is hanging up in
the Hiller hiller air museum in san
carlos it's the big one it's called the
Condors all the way up in the ceilings
got two of these engines incredibly
efficient ok you got 13 less horsepower
out of it but because they were so
efficient it eliminated 2,000 pounds of
fuel which is pretty important as you'll
see so they said ok we're going to go
with this with this new guy here ah
here's a winning decision is trying to
minimize the weight on your airplane
right because all that gasoline all the
stuff around so you go after really
lightweight wooden propellers from
Europe go the glider guys right that's
good okay well then quite work out for
reasons you'll see in the next slide
they had to replace those with metal
propellers that weighed seventy pounds
more but they were three to five percent
more efficient and so what was happening
here was they were optimizing on the
wrong independent variable weight versus
a fish you know delivered efficiency and
they discover this and they fixed it so
very easy mistake to make six to 12
months required took him six years to do
this small matter of a five-year overrun
on a one-year plan ok ok give me nine or
ten test flights 67 test flights before
they did the world flight so you know
they're off by a factor of six or seven
I the landing gear designed for 10
smooth landing ok all right now they
lost their prop now naive me I thought a
prop was you know like one of these
wooden things that you kind of like
screw on to a shaft and you're done like
a tire wrong this is what a prop is it's
this complex all kinds of stuff in there
you've got the variable pitch props
you've got motors that are changing the
pitch of the props and you know
electrical and everything else a lot of
stuff involved in that this is a
non-trivial change this is sort of like
saying
Oh instead of x86 we've got to use spark
processors oh okay it's a big change
here so Vandenberg they had an emergency
landing on one of their endurance runs
and and an impossible a problem it was
supposed to be impossible happened they
lost control of their prop pitch motor
okay they landed down there they reached
up and they grabbed and fell apart in
their hands when it happened the R in
the rear engine was windmilling and they
discovered that if your front engine was
not working and your rear engine was
windmilling and they couldn't feather it
because they had it the alternative was
using it as a break that the airplane
could not stay in the air you needed
that rear engine to stay in the air know
where engineer in the water so they
learned that they find out what the
electrical profits motors are rated for
a hundred degrees centigrade is the
running out of more than 150 the running
it's supposed to be at nine volts
running in 28 bolts they say time out
this is not going to work so they swap
it out but the pitching problem
purposing stuff increases as they start
adding fuel for distance gets worse and
worse they did an uneven touch up on one
of the anurans up in the canard and just
a little bit of paint got on the back
versus the front and it went into a
flutter flutter is what kills airplanes
in about two seconds it just when it's
gone you're a neurons have gone to your
any on so they discovered that
electrical system out of control it was
it was a hack job they knew it
alternator failed on him it was a day
manage get that landing gear bolts were
breaking the lead in fuel airplane fuel
fouls the spark plugs these guys are
going for hundreds of hours you're
supposed to swap out your park spark
plugs every 25 right there's no place up
in you know 15,000 feet to change your
spark plugs so they wind up getting
really good ones from champion they had
to move to on the rear engine had to go
what
cool vs. air-cooled and when they did
that they discovered if the radiators
had to build where had been much bigger
than all of the formulas described by
the way to send to the Wright brothers
too they were going along try to build
their airplanes they couldn't understand
why they didn't get enough lift the
answer was formulas were wrong so they
went in and they did their own formats
so going to lose here so all kinds of
problems with the wooden propeller so
they went to the heart cell and it was a
it was a just a Trojan Trojan effort to
get it done it was done they required
emergency assistant from the national
business aircraft association that came
right through and they did it dick
discovers and his flights he can't sleep
in this airplane but he feels he has to
fly now the problem here is now the
clock is ticking and they get there
getting money in donations but they're
going to start losing them they're gonna
have to return all of their equipment
and so they're under pressure just like
the the lunch was for the shuttle they
saw that happen by the way they say ok
that's it fix everything they can and
they live by the maxims of airplane will
never be totally ready right software
ever really completely debugged yeah you
know it's kind of good enough and let's
go for it the weather will never be as
good as you want it's called uncertainty
and they proceed in the face of
uncertainty here they are December 14th
they're out on the Hammerhead at Edwards
Air Force Base ok you look carefully in
those circles there those are saw horses
underneath the wing tips because they're
filling up the tanks and the wings all
this fuel are starting to settle no
problem they stay off the ground they
stay about that far off the ground so
gets ready to do their run and they
remove them they remove it and they spin
it around and they start the props and
also you'll see the that yellow hose
there they are deicing because there's
frost they can't afford
the disruption of the air flow laminar
airflow over the wings and the weight of
the frost and so they're spending most
of the night out there okay so this is
dick he says adverse stars the Voyager 1
sir ready to go where's your one is the
sub boost our ATC clears Voyager 1 from
Edwards Air Force Base to Edwards Air
Force Base by a flight plan maintain
8,000 cleared for takeoff Godspeed and
they're gonna need it all here we go now
they're rolling structural weight of the
composites was 934 pounds it is lifting
10.38 times that weight right the people
the engines the electronics the wires
the lights and things like that that's
2683 pounds dick rutan on the fly just a
hunch just added an extra 354 pounds of
fuel more than was called for in the
flight plan takeoff weight of fuel is
7,000 plus pounds of highly explosive
gasoline and this stuff burns like
you've never seen ok feel fraction 72.3
percent slightly lower than what they
thought they were going to do the weight
of the fuel was put so much stress on
the airplane it warped the entire frame
when they handed him the canopy he
couldn't screw it in he had to pound it
into place with his hand because the
actual fuselage had warped at this point
he's thinking boy this really looks dumb
or all fueled up and I can't even get
the canopy on ok so he starts rolling
well you know as it turns out those boom
tanks that are out there they have more
fuel in it than normal and they're you
know they're you know moment physics
moment right ahead of their folk room
there and so it's pushing down now ok
airplane is literally as it's taking off
trying to fly right into the concrete
the wings that were about that high off
say starts taking off they star
dropping as the airplane tries to go
right into the concrete and the wingtips
dragged probably drugged for over a mile
this is a plastic airplane plastic
around foam it says I reached up and
grabbed the stick started easing back I
said to myself dick if you've ever been
smooth in your life you better be smooth
right now because this is the big one
and it was two minutes and 14 seconds it
took for the airplane to lift off they
set their first record on the runway
along 14 thousand two hundred feet eight
hundred feet is if it's the longest
concrete runway in the world they almost
used at all well what's that all about
well they were flying fifteen percent
heavier than they had on their last
flight they added 1264 pounds of fuel it
over doubled the take-off distance so
they were above the bend in the
exponential curve at this point Burt
Rutan says instead of 15 if it been 20
to 25 there would have been a fireball
down at the end of the runway would not
have been able to probably to get off
the ground so a mile or so these
wingtips drag and it takes its toll but
now it's in the air first thing that
happens is they're up in the air and
have to wiggle the airplane and have to
break off the winglets because they're
they're flopping around and they don't
know what else is going to go off with
the winglets and there's also fuel vent
lines that are out there but the weight
of the airplane is so heavy that it's
bent up like this and so it's not going
to be venting out and no fuel will be
venting on them as it turns out so up to
this point they had flown at 354 hours
with six emergency landings like right
now here okay so their flight plan is
for 255 non-stop hours with no landings
heading out immediately over the long
just transoceanic flight possible in the
world California to Hawaii not a lot of
ripe frat life craps out there they have
been warned repeatedly December is the
worst weather you will not be able to
get across Africa they said we got to do
it because we're going to lose our
funding if we don't so it's now or never
okay there is no root none there is no
way that's planned there's no certitude
in this they're going to be receiving
weather updates every six hour and path
recommendations the priorities and the
path recommendations is favorable winds
meaning tailwind next sorting criteria
collating criteria is how good is the
weather they'll take bad weather over
good weather if it means better wind
okay although one is politically
sensitive area you fly over police is
like Chad and things like that you know
they got missiles that are shooting down
airplanes and helicopters and everything
else over Lake Victoria so it was a real
problem where they got over Africa they
got over the coast of Africa they turned
off their transponder so they lost their
winglets right over California they only
found one of them and the other ones out
there similar and there's a six percent
additional drag now meetings they just
lost 1,500 miles of range so now they've
seriously eroded into their safety
distance there is their flight path
right out of the book let's take a look
at some of the exciting things that
happened okay they lost their wingless
their their noise suppression headsets
bill their critical needle on a critical
gauge falls off and just just it's just
vibrated to death maybe okay okay they
they hit a typhoon and what's what you
know it's favorable winds right over
whether what do they do they pull as
close as they can into this typhoon and
they go right between the rain bands and
they let them slingshot them through
that's right and it had to do it really
really carefully because there's a low
front coming down from China and it
closed right need a life within a half
an hour behind them so they were doing
that
so they get to the point where they can
turn off the front-engine because the
front engine was only there to get the
airplane up in the air and once the back
engine could fly that was real efficient
and they would turn off the front engine
so they try and turn it off based on the
fuel they know they have consumed the
airplane start sinking they've got to
turn it back on again I don't understand
what that's all about so Gina takes over
and flies dick absolutely blows out he's
just he you know he's been up for like
two and a half days three days flying
nonstop and they're still not below
eighty two point five knots and dick is
a superb pilot jenna is not as good as
dick so he just there's no choice so
they they finally get it onto one engine
somewhere around Oh golly that looks
like what Malaysia okay and then after a
short laughter Malaysian again a below
eighty two point five knots and so now
they're relatively safe and running
along and they notice just over the the
Indian Ocean it's the indian ocean or
the Arabian Sea or something coolant
it's leaking into their oil that's right
this is just a show stopper time you
know this is like power from the dam
just dropped you know you know up in
columbia river so they're pretty upset
about that but it seems not to be too
big of a problem on critical instruments
the light bulbs start burning out and
they'll take another light bulb for
another instrument put it in boom it
will burn out because it's a hooked up
electrical system in this thing well
they get over Africa and Mission Control
says look it's really better be you're
going to hit the worst weather in Africa
so why don't you hang out there over the
coast a while and everything will be
cool and they don't get that message
right you know when Francis Drake
Colonel Evan Drake was was drilling in
in Titusville the guys that were finding
him said stop stop the oil drilling
right stop the oil drilling because
we've run out of money write the letter
took an extra day to get there the day
that it didn't get there is the daily
discovered oil so it's the same kind of
thing here they noticed that the fuel
was flowing backwards to the source
tanks and they've been calculating all
of their fuel consumption based on this
transducer but transducers don't care
whether the fuel is flowing forward or
backward and so they would load up the
header tank and then it would start
flowing back so they had a lot more fuel
and then began to realize wait a minute
that's why we couldn't turn off her
engine maybe we're going to make it here
so they go over Lake Victoria they slide
right through thunderstorms and
everything else they get on the other
side dick blows out lays down and says
Jennifer for heaven's sakes wake me up
when we get to this when we get to this
point here she doesn't do it and he
wakes up you know sometime later and he
looks and he says where are we he says
oh we're past that point and he says
look at the radar screen it's all red
because they're just about ready to be a
long dark inside of Mount Cameroon and
if you look at here if you look at Mount
Cameroon near-miss then was hit that
they're out over the ocean now they're
punch-drunk because they're tired sleep
deprivation instead of pumping oil into
the oil tank apparently they pumped it
out not realizing what they were doing
the headset the valve and they almost
lose the engine mobile synthetic oil
potentially saved the airplane and their
lives they get it back up now when all
the weather breaks loose in the
wintertime along the equator it's called
the intertropical convergence zone itcz
and in the dark over there near South
America a large block of storms broke
off and drifted south and they hit them
and it flipped the airplane right on its
side dick actually thought it was going
to go over this is a piece of tissue
paper with a couple of motors on it that
can maybe go like that but this is now
like this and because he was a supremely
gifted pilot he was actually able to
nudge it back in out of full vertical
and bring it around shortly thereafter
he completely melts down and collapses
okay so they hit the Caribbean and
things are looking pretty good they're
pretty sure they're going to make it now
so what they do is they hit the throttle
they really start burning the gas
because the slower you go the better
your fuel efficiency because there's you
know you know what is it one half K V
squared and friction and all that other
stuff so they're drifting in and the big
one hits engine out now this is the
second time the slide is seen at you
guys are engineers so you're going to
understand this top of the slide is the
start of the airplane it has a motor
that has been turned off for a week it
is cold it is feathered and it requires
a complex process to unfeathered
hydraulic process the back engine is the
really efficient one it does not have a
starter because this is going to run all
the time in you you prop it you know you
pull on the prop and you start this
thing and rather than feather it you can
use it as a break so that's the
trade-off there okay and you've got
these these things these diamonds with
eighths in those are eight way selector
tanks and this is where you set where
you want your fuel to come from when
you're tapping it in to go to the header
tank okay every motor has a mechanical
pump plus it's assisted by an electrical
pump that does two things it clears the
fuel line of bubbles and air so that you
can start the engine plus it also does
the pumping of the fuel into the header
tank and you've got to a selector tank
depending on whether or not you're going
to be pulling your fuel in from the
header tank or from the tanks directly
in the case there's a problem yeah it's
a little complicated and enter tank is
42 gallon capacity there are nine
gallons in it they know they need 28 to
get there got to find 19 gallons no
problem look out on the tip sell tanks
there which is the last guys to go and
you know they're all been up there
there's twenty nine point three gallons
so they trip the solenoid over on the
left-hand tank to let the tip sell
drink draining the tank 8 they set the
selector switch over there and they're
going to get their 29.3 which is going
to be 10 gallons more than what they
need to get home oh boy guys get nervous
their small problem tank has been
leaking the entire trip aren't 29.3
gallons in there there are 8.1 gallons
okay well we're almost there yeah about
11 galit short here now oh look there's
29.3 over in the other guy there okay
set the eight-way selector switch to go
to you know tank a flip the solar cell
and hit that electrical pump over there
oh it just burned out and now that
gasoline is all marooned over there so
Dix is all right all right we've got a
back-up plan here we're going to invoke
that net number two thing there and
rather than pull pull gasoline from the
header tank directly we're going to go
out and we're going to pull it from the
tanks over in the right-hand side
because they have gleaned everything out
of the left-hand side so he activates it
there's your bypass and he goes up and
he starts pulling off of the front
canard tank he gets distracted
the fuel line fills with air
to start the engine he has to reprime
the engine guess what r e Prime's the
engine the dead electrical pump the
mechanical pump does not have enough
suction to clear the fuel line what
happens to the rear engine I can get it
here it immediately stalls here here's
the sound effect now that's what it
sounds like in the plane slowly spinning
to the right because there's more fuel
over there on the right hand side and
they don't have six hands to level the
airplane they're trying to figure out
what to do and it's spinning in and
they're going to die they are going to
die now why are they going to die
because vandenberg told them if they
start the front engine and the back
engine is windmilling the front engine
doesn't have the power to pull the
airplane they learn that in benin burg
they're going to die well dick does what
he can he tries to pump it he can't get
that rear engine gone and he says okay
we got to do something let's start the
rear to start the front engine front
engine hasn't been started for a week it
takes three hands to hold it like he's
got his attorneys it's pumping stuff
here and he's getting hydraulic pressure
up to untether the thing and hits it and
hits it hits it and bam it starts but
it's cold and they have no options and
they pull the full power unwormed up it
stays airplane is patna long and now
they have delayed their deaths a couple
of minutes but suddenly dick notices
that the airplane is accelerating and
what had happened at vandenberg was they
were high altitude with a lot of fuel
and now they're low altitude with very
little fuel
and indeed the front engine can pull the
airplane and he's here oh my and he
holds back on the yoke and he / rotates
in the airplane goes up in the air about
like that and guess what happens fuel
runs down the line to the rear tank
which doesn't have a starter but it's
windmilling right I am it starts and now
he's got two engines okay you got two
engines and so they go in and they swap
out the bad fuel pump with the good fuel
pump they loaded up and they're going to
make it now they're coming in here yeah
coming in Boyle's wingtips look just a
little beat up would you like to get a
closer look up of those they're just
pretty beat at least to have winglets on
it so they're coming in now and dick you
know knows that he'd taken off nine days
before and Edwards Air Force Base is a
very busy Air Force Base and a better
bag to land there because it is a
top-secret facility so it calls a nice
adversity Voyager 1 we're about 20
minutes out and I know you guys are busy
but it is kind of like let us come in
and like land out in the dry lake bed so
the two or three guys that are there to
take pictures and take the pictures and
we promise we'll stay out of your way as
much as possible ok boys your said
bursts are cancelled flying for today
and we're all here waiting to meet you
there they are there's 40,000 people the
sponsors are waiting they had absolutely
no idea they're flying around and
they're so you know we have to give
these guys a show right in the other
thing that came out here it's cold
everything's December all right there
flying around I mean while Reagan back
in Washington's looking at his TV sit
and said will they land the damn thing
please just land you just flying around
and around the around and around right
ok so have 40,000 people then they took
off a 7,000 pounds of fuel they landed
with a hundred and six now they did go
faster out of the Caribbean that was
necessary but they didn't realize they
had leaking
banks and things were going to blow okay
so they use 98.4 eight percent of their
fuel it was a 18.3 gallons when they
were done so they're in the hangar now
very famous hangar at edwards air force
base that's burt rutan talking about the
wings there and you know that close-up
look you wanted to get of the wings
you're one of the few in the world oh
here you go this is saying there's no
rules they broke all the rules and they
did this they deceived Edwards Air Force
Base oh yeah yeah we don't we're doing
this is all real safe and this is going
to be cool don't worry about it's really
cool all right they knew was high very
high risk potentially people getting
killed they did it anyway and Burt
what's always amazed that nobody ever
said are you sure this can be done once
you show me in paper and his little
brother said if he said it could be done
and we do it so there's this trust
that's involved in this kind of thing no
they're news you're one of the few
people to ever see the wing this close
this is it that's the real deal okay
that's sort of like those servers that
your founders had that are over in the
computer museum you know that are very
oh they'll kind of like bit you know
later they're extern supported right
that's right okay so Bruce the main guy
says there's no way this airplane ever
should have made it don't fly it again
dick says well we've got to get it from
Edwards Air Force Base back to my hobby
he says okay take it off don't turn
anything on just take off pull up
left-hand turn land it okay so they do
that and they take some pictures and on
the way in right over the runway in
lobby if they notice that the coolant
seal had completely failed up to the
last heartbeat so there it is it's
hanging there they didn't clean it up to
this day nobody knows why the fuel was
flying it was flowing backwards I've
actually talked to dick rutan about I I
have my suspicions right
but nobody knows he was going to go into
the airplane one last time and look
around in the fuel system to figure it
out and the next thing you knew it was
on the way to the Smithsonian okay so
here's some takeaways guys devices
versus a product can you take can you
use a clunky thing and scale it up
Voyager as designed was a highly
compromised device for range that's what
it did had no strength that had no other
redeeming qualities Burt Rutan has has
Burt Rutan has designed three airplanes
that have attempted to go commercial
industrial strength here's how it worked
out Voyager was a complete success
uncontested success nobody made a nickel
the guys who tried to make a nickel
raytheon meats crafts darshan add a sab
salute catastrophic failure it built
like 60 of them 55 of them are out in
the Tucson desert and evergreen aircraft
waiting to get cut up and destroyed
vizionare was another one per dollar
debt you know VC money they returned 1.2
and sale to some outfit done and one
point two cents on the sale and Adam
aircraft is yet another one that's
trying it right now and actually know
this gentleman that that's president of
that company injuries out but they've
slipped and slipped slipped and every
time you read their press announcements
and I have them all it's like real soon
now here and we're working and we expect
and none of it has come to me because
the problem is not the device the
problem is injecting the device into an
existing world you know this fractal
based multi dimensional nonlinear world
with feedback loops subject to
discontinuities exhibiting tectonic
shifts subject to effects of time and
scale that one is it is it his fault
that this happened no
it's a really big world if somebody says
it's a really small world isn't it you
know they have immediately identified
themselves as somebody that lives in a
very small corner of a large world okay
so here are some observations we can't
go through all of them I'm not sure 43
we have maybe can you know I guess the I
guess a statement is entropy never
sleeps to counteract against entropy
requires eternal vigilance and you'll
see you'll find it here you'll see
you'll see here too okay I'm going to
have a good team unless you know
everything and and I flunked on that one
of 100 people on the ground who are
going to be in the air and that's quite
often you know rock bands there's five
guys up on stage and there's a road crew
football team 15 guys on the field and
there's 50,000 spectators real real
Silicon Valley bootstraps are generally
harrowing hardcore experiences unless a
fashion event happens and when you're
suddenly cool and the thing takes off
your guys that lived in a garage they
earned it they earned it okay don't
expect people to be excited about what
you're excited about even though it's
worthy of excitement it's a bad plan to
bet on it you know just expect that
they're not going to share it and that
way you won't be disappointed you
shouldn't be discouraged just expect it
because it takes perseverance and and
and aggressiveness so spectators don't
when you gotta show up to play right
boldness is in short supply if you've
got an idea that you really think is
good here's a notion go out and sell it
yourself boy you'll get a real education
real fast as to how big the world is and
how many viewpoints I don't think this
is a big problem here at Google as it is
in a lot of other places want to be
successful be willing to be thrown out
of a lot of really nice places I come to
a place
like this and i really like these places
I never know what the reception is going
to be here if I'm going to get thrown
out she just got to go do it ok it over
till it's over Yogi Berra all kinds of
things can happen and what a precipitous
thing happens it's very important to
understand that you won't know for some
time whether it's for the best or for
the worst surprises in failure are
different concepts do not equate a
surprise with a failure it's best to
know what the definition of success is
before you embark on a very expensive
program and you're going to find it's a
journey not a destination I think
there's a saying that says success is
never final defeat is never fatal it's
got to get up do it okay sometimes in
expensive commodity components are good
and sometimes they're not right
sometimes they're not all depends
devices and products are very different
things so all those voids your design
surprises anybody know about Sophocles
great great quote from Sophocles here
one that I try and live by you go and do
it and you screw up as soon as possible
so that you can fix it and the screw-ups
aren't mistakes generally they are
surprises things that were unknown
things that were in those dimensions
that you were unaware up when you start
it out okay now I'd rather be lucky than
good but these guys lucky who yeah they
were like okay remember let's roll these
are 19 and 18 or 19 things here any one
of which could have either killed
everybody or stopped it right in its
tracks they didn't happen it's also the
same with startups in the valley and
efforts and initiatives and things like
that there are a number of things in
this big world that can snuff you out in
a heartbeat they may not show up to play
I sort of like
and the gates you're going to go you're
going to traverse a bunch of and gates
and there's a whole bunch of them that
aren't in the chain so you may get
through you don't know when you get
through when you get down you can do
something else on the other side so now
I have two more slides I think the next
one is the Stanford closing slide that I
the Stanford presentation that I gave in
and well actually yeah three more slides
these are some links that you may be
interested in dick rutan he's a really
good speaker and if you search on him he
said dick rutan no come the EAA is EA
org they sponsor a youth organization
called Young Eagles and I have the
permission for the Stanford presentation
to use their pictures and that's where
these voids your pictures came from if
you have children that are interested in
aviation this is the place to start
hiller museum up in San Carlos is also a
good place to have activities for kids
and things like that and it's really a
very fascinating deal some of the
photography is taken by Mark greenberger
gentlemen I know flight classics calm
now I've got two more slides I'm pretty
sure so this isn't okay this is not the
closing slide so this is the end of the
of the Stanford presentation that i gave
you no thank you cleared for takeoff and
Godspeed for on your journey so here's
the last slide this is this is a google
bonus slide that i made last night for
you guys yeah oh I like you it's this
good this is good yeah yeah I got your
attention he didn't sleep I love it ok
so here see maybe I lied hey Revere the
speaker lied ok all right so everybody
looks at innovation right they think
it's on a big white board it's not
there's all kinds of social forces and
existing technologies and everything
else that's wrapped around it right what
a macchiavelli say something about
there's nothing more difficult to take
in hand
change and more uncertain and its
outcome oh yeah it's a real deal for all
kinds of reasons that you're not going
to be able to anticipate because of that
world I talked about you know that a
multi-dimensional thing all right figure
out what tomorrow is is a exercising
calculus of variations with respect to
non variant calculus of variations with
respect to you know multivariate
manifold analysis it's real tough right
you're out the shop you see now there's
a theory last statement that we are six
degrees away from everybody else in the
world right here the six degree theory
ok well there's a whole bunch of things
that are one degree away from innovation
one degree now I've got a double come on
talk to Daddy there they are ah you got
it ok yes you did ok so I've trained you
right and and and all good training
programs have a graduation exercise
right have a graduation exercise and
here's a graduation exercise innovation
survival right concept cruising change
and there's all these words sitting
around here so if you want to graduate
you got to do the graduation thing you
got to bounce the ball around that's it
and read a word that's yet ladies and
gentlemen you've been a wonderful
audience and I'll give you your Tim
bucks come on thank you very much
you
