sure appreciate everybody coming out for
this I'll have to admit this is a pretty
interesting experience I am a little bit
technically challenged even though I
have a web-based business and everything
I have some trusty people that surround
me that help me with a lot of this but I
obviously am well aware of Google and
use it quite extensively and and a
couple years ago my cousin who's with me
today and handles all my website stuff
he says there's this new thing that's
you know starting to catch on that we
really need to start riding the wave
he's like it's called YouTube I'm like
what are you talking about he's like and
he explains it all to me he's like we
need to start doing little technical
videos and putting on YouTube we can
reach a bunch of people and and at the
time I forget how long ago it was but it
was pretty pretty obscure and a lot of
people didn't know about it and I'll
have to say it was one of the the better
moves we made because one of the things
that when you start getting working with
alternative technologies and things the
internet really has made a lot of stuff
possible that 20 30 years ago was stuck
in people's garages and nobody could
really network and figure this stuff out
so you know whether I'm sure a lot of
you are aware of the impact that your
work here has but I've seen it
personally in the alternative fuels
world where the internet and and things
like Google and YouTube really have
created a path so you know you're really
involved in a lot of cutting-edge stuff
and hats off to you so I wanted to talk
a little bit about truth about biofuels
in America and the reason I use that
title is because there's a lot of
misinformation out there there's a lot
of propaganda and fluff out there and
and what I want to do today is possibly
shed some light on some of the the the
fluff and and some of the misinformation
and kind of cut cut to the chase on on
what some of these technologies and
options really are and have a discussion
about some of the viable options that
are out there and some of the options
that are being presented is viable and
you know
looking taking a hard look at him to
give you a little bit of background
about Who I am and why why I'm
supposedly qualified to talk on this I
grew up in a little small town in in
Alaska and I had one grandfather who was
a rancher the other grandfather was a
commercial fisherman and my father was a
land surveyor and a bush pilot so
growing up in this this small town and
in the wilds of Alaska and everything
you kind of by nature you kind of learn
to be self-reliant and to realize that
you can't always go down to the corner
drugstore and buy what you need if
you're on the fishing boat and something
breaks you either have to do without you
have to fabricate something that'll work
or fix what broke and and the same with
you know being on a ranch in Alaska and
everything and and surveying out in the
bush and and so I grew up with people
around me that really taught me how to
think outside the box and the necessity
of being able to do for yourself and
unfortunately when it comes to
alternative fuels and alternative energy
and and things like that because of a
lot of misinformation out there we
really have to take the responsibility
of finding what what these technologies
are really getting to the bottom of them
by ourselves because unfortunately we
can't believe everything we read on the
Internet and there's a lot of
misinformation out there but with a
little bit of of knowledge and the right
questions each one of you can figure out
what's going to work for you and what's
going to complement your lifestyle and
allow you even if it's in a small way to
to somehow lessen your dependence on on
fossil fuels right around 1999 I decided
to move from Alaska and move my family
down to southern Missouri we bought a
farm down there and and wanted to start
getting back a little bit close to
family a lot of my family moved out of
Alaska and I heard this reference
somebody was talking about how you can
make diesel fuel out of vegetable oil
and when I first heard this I thought
that's
that's a really brilliant concept you
know it's it's a renewable resource and
it's not something we're pumping out of
the ground but I never did get very much
information on it right at the time and
just kind of stuck in the back of my
mind and later I started reading and
finding out a little bit more about
biodiesel and this process of taking new
vegetable oil or waste vegetable oil and
creating an into diesel well growing up
in Alaska on the fishing boats
everything's diesel and like my
grandfather was really into
fuel-efficient cars and so grandma was
always driving a diesel Mercedes and he
had a diesel VW and and so I kind of
grew up with this culture of fuel
efficiency and conservation everything
and so when I heard about this concept
of taking a waste product and making it
into fuel it really intrigued me and I
did some research on the subject and and
found out about biodiesel a little bit
and and and got all my chemicals
together and I was gonna play chemist
and brew up a pot of this biodiesel and
realized that I really didn't know what
I was doing and so I set it back on the
shelf and and I got to read a little bit
more about the concept of straight
vegetable oil and and when you're
looking at using vegetable oil in a
modern diesel engine the main thing that
you have to overcome is viscosity or how
thick it is and so instead of using
chemicals to go overcome that viscosity
you can also do it by using heat
everybody's fried something on the stove
you you put it yeah put the oil on the
stove heat it up it gets real liquid and
runny and so I started to venture down
that road and built this crude little
contraption that I put on my old toyota
diesel truck and and I went down to the
local Chinese restaurant and got some
some oil and filtered out the chicken
strips and small mammals and whatever
else was swimming around in there and
and poured into my truck and flipped the
switch and was waiting for it to blow up
and it just kept running and so that was
kind of the start at at the beginning
there was no and and we refer to this as
sbo or straight vegetable oil versus
biodiesel there really was no SVO
industry there was one or two people
that were dabbling with
on with it and you could get on the
internet and find some people who were
kind of talking about it but you know
very few people had actually done it and
and by going through this experience and
all the trial and error I realized that
maybe some of my experience would be
valuable to others that wanted to break
out of the patrol the clutches of
petroleum and so I decided to put
together a little do-it-yourself kit and
put it on the internet and see what
happens and so during the early years I
refer to it as our Model T kits you know
it was you know we were just taking
off-the-shelf components and forcing
them into into into service and and I
was working out of my garage and and we
you know had had some early success in
everything and really started to get
into this and realize that there was a
lot of people out there that realized
that that petroleum wasn't working too
hot for us and they wanted to do
something else and so in the early days
we we did a lot of trial and error and
like the saying goes good judgment comes
from experience and experience comes
from poor judgment and so there was a
lot of trial and error but it worked and
we kept growing and and now we've we've
come up with some technology that has
been developed specifically for the SVO
industry and as we we gain more
experience instead of taking
off-the-shelf components we can we can
actually design stuff that works
specifically for our application we'll
get more into the details of straight
vegetable oil a little bit later and I'm
gonna go through and just highlight some
of the alternative fuels and alternative
transportations that are talked about
today and we'll go through and just
highlight a few of those and then what
I'd like to do is open it up to
questions and and just have the rest of
discussion be question driven hydrogen
fuel cells interestingly enough we don't
hear a whole lot about that anymore like
we did three or four years ago three or
four years ago State of the Union
address and everything that's all we
heard about was hydrogen fuel cells
and this is a great little piece of and
you got to remember that I'm by nature a
conspiracy theorist and and believe
everybody is out to get us and all that
stuff so so you know free legal advice
is worth what you pay for it but I'll go
ahead and give you the version of
courting to Anderson of what I think's
going on and and like I said I've been
in the alternative fuels industry has
seen a lot of the the stuff that goes on
I've gotten a few threatening phone
calls from a few different parties that
you know I better join the club and get
the secret decoder pin and let them help
me otherwise I might you know end up in
jail or worse and you know some of that
stuff does go on but generally they're
doing that because they really don't
have a leg to stand on anyway hydrogen
fuel cells a lot of people got excited
about hydrogen because they think well
you know you take there's hydrogen and
water and you yeah use electrolysis and
and separate the hydrogen and the oxygen
and and you got nothing but clean
exhaust coming out and and that's
wonderful let's all get behind hydrogen
fuel cells and the reality is hydrogen
fuel cells
you can't extract hydrogen from water
but when you do that it's more of a
power storage medium because they're the
only way that you can get the hydrogen
out is if you put electricity in and
unfortunately it's not really an
efficient process and the dirty little
secret is is that that when they're
given the State of the Union address and
talking about you know on the news about
new hydrogen fuel cell technology they
weren't talking about electrolysis they
were talking about extracting the
hydrogen from propane or natural gas and
so here we have something that still
relies on fossil fuels now granted the
exhaust was cleaner but when you looked
at the cost of the technology and that
were still tied to fossil fuels it
wasn't really as sexy as they were
making it out to be it really wasn't the
answer
thinking well we got a whole ocean full
of water there's all the fuel we need
and so that's kind of an example of a
technology that the powers that be
really got behind and we're promoting
and the reality was that it was it
really isn't viable at this stage now
I mean we stopped researching hydrogen's
heavens no because there's so many
different things that are discovered
every day and there might be something
discovered next week that might make it
a solution but at the stage that it's at
now and the way that they were really
planning on doing it in my mind it
really didn't make a lot of sense
because we're still kind of business as
usual
I've got a theory and that is is that if
if high-level government officials are
promoting a certain alternative fuel run
because what it is is it's not really a
viable solution and that's why they're
behind it they get behind stuff that
they know really won't affect their
long-term goals of selling petroleum and
I know that sounds cynical but if we had
several hours I could tell you quite a
few stories that really bring that home
but but unfortunately that's pretty much
what's going on if it's if it's a
solution that they're promoting and
saying hey this is the latest and
greatest it means that there's some
really big problems with long-term
viability and that's why they're
promoting it is because they can get
behind it and it looks like they're
really you know promoting something
that's great and they run it on CNN you
know for a week and everybody gets
excited and goes out and votes for the
guy that's talking the most about you
know some new technology and the reality
is nothing really happens
so that's hydrogen let's move on hybrid
electric vehicles interesting story when
we flew into California last week flew
into San Jose as everybody's probably
heard the actress Daryl Hannah is really
and Willie Nelson they're all into
biodiesel and biofuels and we recently
did a did a conversion for Daryl Hannah
and had to go do some tweaking on her
car down down in Malibu and so we had to
rent a car and and we get in and I had I
had reserved you know a small compact
and everything because I knew we had a
ways to go and and rumor has it gasoline
is a little bit high here in California
and and so we get there and immediately
they said you know well you're gonna be
paying a hundred and fourteen bucks for
this five days but
for a hundred and thirty dollars we can
get you in an SUV that was there their
sales pitch and everything like I said
you know I said that's great and all I
said but we got a ways to drive and I
said I think I'd rather have the smaller
car so we can get better fuel economy
and the guys like oh well you want fuel
economy on Mike and he's like well for
that same $130 for the five days you can
have this Toyota hybrid I said okay well
you know that sounds cool we'll take it
but it's interesting that people's first
thought is let's get into the SUV let's
get into the SUV and so anyway we got
Toyota hybrid and we've been able to put
almost a thousand miles on it so it's
been really interesting to get a use
that and to to really see what it can do
I have test driven hybrids in the past
and you know in certain situations they
really shine in certain situations
they're a little bit overhyped but you
know going down to Malibu and back and
right driving the Pacific Coast Highway
and and not really paying attention to
to baby in it too much and we've
averaged forty six point five miles per
gallon which compared to the other
vehicle that we would have you know even
the smaller car would have gotten maybe
twenty five thirty if we were lucky so
it really wasn't that bad of a deal and
you know as we - you know the hydrogen
fuel cells isn't really anything that
your average Joe can get their hands on
but obviously hybrid cars and up and
coming some electric vehicles are
something that are some options are here
on out we'll talk about some options
that that actually are within our grasp
and and we need to analyze and see is
this gonna fit my lifestyle and this is
something that I really want to stress
to everybody is that do your homework
you know if it takes if you think that a
hybrid is going to fit your lifestyle
and the way that you drive and commute
and everything I'd encourage you to go
out and rent one for a week you know
there are only about 130 bucks for the
week and just really drive around and
see what kind of fuel economy you're
gonna get I mean in certain situations
they really shine
certain situations they're not so great
but you know any technology that you're
looking at and in any way that you're
looking to lessen your dependence on
foreign oil really spend some time and
do your homework and don't just jump
into it there is a lot of information on
the internet there's a lot of
misinformation but there are people out
there and and generally if you put
enough time and you can sift through the
misinformation the information and get
some good hard data on the technology
that you're looking at you know like I
said we've spent the last few days
driving a hybrid and it definitely you
know has gotten a lot better fuel
economy than our you know a car with
just a regular gasoline engine but at 46
miles per gallon you've got you know
extra money and into the initial
purchase of the car there are other
vehicles out there for example the the
Volkswagen TDI that will get 45 to 50
all the time without the hybrid drive
one of the the things that really
frustrates me is when I travel around
the world and I go to these other
countries they have diesel electric
hybrids now that's something that I can
really sink my teeth into because a
diesel-electric hybrid about the size of
a Toyota Prius running on waste
vegetable oil you'd pretty much
eliminate your use of foreign oil and
you'd be getting probably close to 90 to
100 miles per gallon and so there's some
politics on why we don't have a lot of
fuel-efficient diesels in this country
the reality is that the technology
exists for the hundred mile an hour car
right now it's there it's accessible the
problem is that that they are prohibited
from importing that stuff into this
country for the express reason is that
they will last too long and they won't
burn any fuel one of the things that
really frustrates
that they're using over there and and
over here we have the politicians you
know signing some bill that's going to
mandate 35 miles per gallon and
I've got cars you know in Europe and
Japan that will get a solid 80 miles per
gallon right now and meet every crash
test that we have but they will not let
them import them into this country and
so yes they do they meet the emissions
tests in fact the European emission
standards are more stringent than ours
here and they meet the emissions hands
down and especially when you look at the
overall lifecycle of the vehicle and how
much fuel it's going to be burning and
so you know these are the things we got
to look at where you know how much does
it cost to produce that vehicle where is
the energy coming on electric vehicles
one of the things that a lot of people
think well I can just plug it into the
wall and I can drive and I'm not using
any fossil fuels but they don't realize
that we've got a coal plant somewhere
digging out coal and then you you know
got to transport that to the power
generation plant and then you look at
the laws of thermodynamics and the
amount of energy that actually makes it
to that plug if I remember rightly is
somewhere around 28 percent of the the
coal the energy out of that coal
actually makes it into the energy in
your home or into your vehicle okay so
you've got over over 70% of the energy
in a coal plant is used to just keep the
whole thing up and moving and you've got
you know power loss through high
transmission lines and everything so
this is one of those areas where like I
said you really got to do the homework
and figure out what's the whole life
cycle this technology and if I buy an
electric car okay where's my electricity
coming from a lot of electric co-ops you
can you can pay a little bit higher
price and be guaranteed that that
whatever electricity use is going to be
bought from a renewable resource if you
do something like that and do your
homework on that then you can sleep well
at night knowing that you're not really
participating in dirty technology but if
you buy an electric vehicle and all your
power is coming from a coal plant
somewhere and when you calculate all the
losses and everything you're using you
know you're polluting twice as much than
if you would have just driven a gasoline
car you know you might sleep well at
night as long as you don't dig too deep
and find out what's really going on and
so this is one of those areas where you
need to realize where the electricity is
coming from all right
compressed air cars it's fairly new
there's been some developments recently
in in some fairly small air engines that
are very efficient because they're
running on air there's not there's not a
lot of their mechanical energy is law
isn't lost in heat but there again we
have to look at where is that compressed
air coming from you know how the laws of
thermodynamics do not let you create nor
destroy energy you know that you can't
really get anything for free and and
that energy has to be developed from
some sources so we need to analyze all
right if we're gonna look at something
like a compressed air car that's great
it's going down the road with compressed
air but what kind of energy did we put
in to to compressing that air because
that energy to move you down the road
has to come from somewhere but this is a
fairly new technology that I anticipate
that we're going to see quite a bit more
of ethanol here's here's here's kind of
a black eye on the alternative fuels
world the reality is is that it takes
about three gallons of petroleum to
produce one gallon of ethanol and that's
not even talking about the waste water
it produces and when we talk about this
we're not talking about cellulosic
ethanol which is definitely better but
not quite there yet but what we're doing
in this country right now with corn
ethanol is pretty much a disaster it
takes it takes a lot of petroleum to
grow that corn and when you look at the
the numbers as we're spending about
three gallons of petroleum to produce
one gallon of ethanol so you don't have
to be a mathematician to figure out that
we're heading in the wrong direction I'm
not saying that we need to scrap at
places like Brazil they've done a lot
better with with some sugarcane and
sugar beets
but also you've got to look at the
impact the amount of force that they're
clear-cutting to put in those
plantations
and so everything has a ripple effect
and and there's no one technology that
has you know all goods and no badge
you've got to look at everything and
look at the lifecycle of the fuel or the
technology that you're looking at and
realize where where it's coming from and
where it's going and in this country
right now with with corn based ethanol
it's pretty much politically charged and
there's a lot of big lobbies out there
for the for the corn industry that have
gotten stuff pushed through and and
they're not hanging on to it you know
that now that the truth is coming out
you can see that there's not a lot of
support for and it's kind of kind of
dying out and you know ultimately the
farmer is going to be the one again left
holding the bag anytime that that the
government or any entity will put a lot
of subsidies into a technology to take
it public and I'm not talking about
research I mean obviously there needs to
be research done but when they take it
to the public and try to present it as a
novel alternative and the reality is
that it's heavily subsidised pretty soon
that can't go on forever so pretty soon
the carpet gets yanked out from under
people and it's the people like the
farmers that are left holding the bag
because they've changed their whole
operations so I've had people argue well
you know of course we've got to support
after the ethanol because we got to take
care of the American farmer but you
can't take care of the American farmer
on something that's based on a lie and
so there again we got to cut through the
emotions sometimes and really look at
what's happening and look at history and
look at some of the the catastrophic
effects of some of these things
throughout history of have done
biodiesel talked a little bit about
biodiesel before and the next one we
have is straight vegetable oil which is
is what I've chosen to devote my life's
work to but biodiesel is where you take
plant oils it could be from peanuts
sunflowers rapeseed olive oil any kind
of plant oil and it goes through a
process called trans ester
vacation which is a really fancy word
for taking some household lie and some
methanol and mixing it up together and
it goes through a chemical reaction and
it basically drops all the real thick
stuff out of the oil and it thins the
oil chemically biodiesel is is used
fairly extensively in the US the thing
about biodiesel is it can be mixed in
any proportion with regular petroleum
diesel and in low proportions it really
doesn't have any effect on the
cold-weather abilities and so it's a
fuel that can be assimilated into our
current distribution structure without
too much trouble there's a lot of you
know here we've got a commercial
biodiesel plant here we've got there's
several websites out there we can buy
some home brew kits that are a little
more professionally put together and
then you've got you know rube goldberg
in his garage here and people brewing
their own you notice the respirators on
these guys I've got a few friends that
do biodiesel that are missing their
eyebrows and unfortunately there's been
a few people that through some
explosions have have lost their life
over the last few years doing some
homebrew biodiesel projects so if done
right biodiesel is an option for the for
the do-it-yourselfer but you are dealing
with some fairly caustic chemicals and
you do need to be careful if you start
to to get into biodiesel production from
from a homebrewer standpoint if it's
something that you decide you want to do
in your garage or your backyard like I
said you're gonna need methanol you're
gonna need a little bit of lye regular
household lye
sodium hydroxide I think is the official
name for it but something correct me on
that if I'm wrong but anyway you it
takes it takes about 24 hours to to brew
up a batch and wash it and everything
it's a little bit labor-intensive and
when you factor in your your cost so
I've heard numbers as low as 75 cents
per gallon and and as high as $2 per
gallon what it's going to cost you to
that biodiesel but when you consider
close to $4 at the pump it can be a
viable option for people one thing about
biodiesel is that you don't have to
modify the vehicle hardly at all
especially the newer ones and it can go
just right in your tank and you can put
a tank of petroleum diesel in there
right after you've had the biodiesel and
vice versa waste with biodiesel you're
looking at about 20 to 25 percent
glycerin content and so the volume if
you do a hundred gallon batch of
biodiesel you're gonna have 20 to 25
gallons of glycerin you can make a lot
of soap with it or figure out how to
dispose of it here are some shots of me
at my local neighborhood fish fry place
gathering some waste vegetable oil and
as you can see the stuff looks good
enough to eat
we generally I've got two restaurants
that are fairly close to my house and I
live in for a fairly rural Missouri and
I can get anywhere from four to 500
gallons a month and I just take a
trailer over there and I I bought gather
it a lot of people a lot of our
customers that live in in small you know
apartments or something they'll hook up
with a you know little cafe or something
just get a little five gallon jug and
they'll take that home once a week and
it really depends on your usage you can
get thousands of gallons or you can get
you know five or ten gallons and what we
do with straight vegetables we use the
waste vegetable oil that the restaurants
throw away most places the restaurants
usually will have to pay to get rid of
this oil and so if you go in there and
make friends with them and talk to them
they're usually more than happy to
support your your little alternative
fuel habit because it saves them and
they can give you fuel for free and so
what you have invested is a little bit
of time but generally speaking once you
get set up you'll spend no more time
dealing with your your straight
vegetable than you would if you had to
stop at the at the gas stations so
this isn't for everybody obviously you
can see I've got a big setup there like
I said I gather probably over a thousand
gallons a month for my business and for
my personal use and so that's fairly
extensive but if you think about that a
thousand gallons at four bucks a gallon
you know that's four grand a month that
that I can go out and literally in about
an afternoon get that amount of oil so
financially it makes a lot of sense one
of the great things about straight
vegetable oils there's no chemical
modifications we probably stop that
there's no chemical modifications that
have to happen to the oil you got to
filter out again all the bumpy chunks
and the and the dirt and from there on
it's a matter of putting it into your
vehicle that has a conversion system
that's been put on it what the
conversion system consists of in a
nutshell is we put on a parallel
auxilary heated fuel system and so we
don't really mess with a stock fuel
system on there but we put in heated
tank heated fuel lines heated filters
with a switching valve so we can go
between the two fuels we start the
vehicle up on regular petroleum diesel
once the engines up to temperature we
flip a switch on the dash and it
switches over to the auxiliary fuel
system which has the vegetable oil in it
and you're running on a hundred percent
recycled vegetable oil and this I've got
some other slides that I'm going to
probably stop in the interest of time
and open it up to questions but as you
can imagine this is kind of pretty
obscure in the alternative fuels world a
lot of the powers-that-be especially in
the biodiesel world don't really like
what we're doing because they don't want
people to get the word out that you
don't really have to go through the
trans a certification process I'm
definitely not anti biodiesel it
definitely has a place biodiesel the big
biodiesel Lobby tends to be a little bit
anti SVO because you know we're not
playing the game by their rules little
by little we are gaining some footholds
I think there's about five states now
that have passed exemption laws I helped
write some legislation that we got
passed in Arkansas that totally exempts
waste vegetable oil in this
piriform as a fuel so it's non taxed and
it's got a full exemption so there's
definitely some semion rows being made
legally because it's really a no-man's
land
depending on who you talk to they say
there's no problem with and some people
say you can't do that you know they
haven't given you permission but little
by little the states are stepping up and
and interestingly enough there's quite a
few legislatures around the country and
the different state legislatures that
actually burn vegetable oil and are
getting a little backdoor legislation
into to kind of open the playing field
and just say hey look you know we'll
leave you alone keep doing this that's
general overview is straight vegetable
oil the answer no zefa no the answer no
is hybrid cars the answer no none of
these technologies or or the technology
that might be thought up next week or
something none of these things are the
one answer it's going to take a little
bit of everything I think we don't have
too many alternative fuels at this stage
there's a lot of great ideas that are
hatched in people's garages throughout
time and a lot of them with because of
lack of networking you've kind of died
some of them have been killed some of
them have died but it's kind of a unique
time in history because with the
internet and a good old Google search
now and then you can network with people
that have these ideas and you know I've
definitely benefited from being able to
literally go around the world and
network with people that have some ideas
and when we start to talk we think of
ways that we can reduce our dependency
on foreign oil we know what doesn't work
in this country going overseas for oil
is not working so hot for us and so this
is something that everybody can look at
and realize that even though it's
something small possibly in your life
that you can do something to change a
little bit the amount of petroleum that
you affect effectively use and straight
vegetable oil is something that I found
that you know there's several billion
gallons of waste vegetable oil produced
in the
u.s. annually its disposal problem for a
lot of restaurants it's something that I
can do and a lot of my customers can do
that can totally take them out of the
petroleum cycle does ExxonMobil feel it
absolutely not we're just a bunch of
cooks that are running around on french
fry grease do I feel it yes you know in
the last three years I Drive a big old
Ford Excursion evil SUV that is cleaner
emissions of the Toyota hybrid and I've
saved $30,000 in fuel the rig didn't
cost me that much when I bought a three
three years ago so for me it's a hundred
percent difference for ExxonMobil we're
not even a thorn in their side and so
it's little things like this some of
these these unique and obscure ideas and
technologies that little by little can
make a difference and you know some
people I've talked to they say well you
know well if everybody does this there
won't be enough oil so I'm not doing it
well you know that may be true but
there's there's about three billion
gallons out there that's thrown away in
landfills every year let's soak that up
let's use that that's three billion
gallons that we're not important from
overseas and once that's used up let's
go for something else and in the
meantime there's new technologies that
are coming up you know algae oil for
example is a really exciting thing
because instead of getting you know a
hundred gallons from an acre of soybeans
of oil they're producing five or 50,000
gallons of algae oil on an acre every
other week you know some of these
technologies and that can complement the
biodiesel straight vegetable there's a
lot of neat stuff up there but but we
people have got to learn to open their
minds and realize that we don't have to
keep doing things the way that we've
been doing all right go ahead and open
it up for questions and a little
discussion here great stuff fun I've got
actually a lot of questions but I think
I'll only ask
I think I'll only asked one especially
considering the second one I forgot so
the first one would be and it's the only
one I'll ask basically you mentioned
that your big Ford Excursion is more
clean than Toyota hybrid basically how
is that can you talk a little bit about
the the surgeons sure thanks well just
start with we don't have to be a chemist
to realize that when you have a food
product that's you know liquid sunshine
basically that hasn't been chemically
modified that there's not there's not a
lot of nasty stuff like in petroleum for
example sulfur dioxide is totally
limited there is no eliminate there is
no sulfur in vegetable oil and so sulfur
dioxide which is a leading contributor
to acid rain it's gone it's not even an
issue
it's a co2 neutral fuel when that crop
of soybeans or sunflowers or whatever is
sitting there growing it's consuming co2
now when we burn it it does give off
some co2 but it gives us off less co2
than was consumed when the when the crop
was grown and so you know the problem we
have with co2 right now it's not the co2
is bad you know it's what plants thrive
on and stuff like that it's that we're
dredging up co2 for millions of years
ago and we're putting that into the
atmosphere along with all the stuff
that's growing on their surface right
now and so this fuel is is co2 neutral
and it's oxygen rich fuel Oh to will go
up with your emissions and your
particulate will go down the opacity
test and so there's been several several
emissions tests one was done and an EPA
lab in Colorado I think and across the
board straight vegetable oil beat out
petroleum diesel and biodiesel biodiesel
is a lot cleaner on most cases NO x does
go up with biodiesel over diesel whereas
with straight vegetable oil it goes down
so so across the board is just a lot
cleaner there's less particulates and
you know it's it's food there's just a
lot less nasty stuff coming out of your
tailpipe I've got another question here
I was wondering if you felt that the
dual tank system is necessary in warmer
climates in light of the greater
complexity versus a single tank system
okay let me give a little background on
this question here
he asked about a two tank system versus
a single tank system now when I
described how we work with straight
vegetable you have your your petroleum
side and you have your your vegetable
oil side and you
which between the two there is something
out there that they is referred to as a
one tank system which is basically you
don't have dual fuel systems usually
you've only got one fuel system and you
can put either diesel in or you can put
just vegetable oil and you start it up
on the vegetable oil and you and you can
run it all the time on vegetable oil
unfortunately with a dual fuel or with a
single tank system like you're referring
to that your narrow of operation your
window of usability is is narrowed down
quite a bit and the main thing is is
that once that engines up to temperature
the oils is being heated enough just by
the the heat properties of the engine
the engine acts as a final heat
exchanger to heat it up enough to have
proper spray pattern and everything like
that but getting it from from the rear
tank up to the engine compartment if
you're running at 20 degrees that can be
a serious problem unless you have a
heated tank and heated fuel lines and
heated fuel filter and so for Sutton and
then of course there's certain engine
families that don't take well to single
tanks so to answer your question a
little more directly in certain
situations a single tank and with
certain engines a single tank can be a
viable situation sometimes they're more
complex sometimes they're not you know
there's a lot of ins and outs in
different ways you can do things and so
if you are in a warm climate have very
good oil quality and the right engine
then a single tank could be for you but
if you plan to travel very much and want
to use vegetable in any climate then
that just narrows your window of
operation down considerably and if you
clog a filter or get a french fries
stuck in your filter or something
because you didn't pre-filter well you
could be sitting beside the road and you
don't have an auxilary system to switch
over to and so you got to be on your
toes a little bit more and you've got to
really concentrate on where you're gonna
be and the vehicle that you have so
just a quick follow i I'm running a
single tank in a 300 d great in San
Diego yeah with no problems but would
you say the Mercedes engine is more
well-suited to that exactly the the
older Mercedes that you'll find driving
around a lot are pretty much bulletproof
you know there's kind of a miss a
misquote out there that Rudolf diesel
designed the diesel engine to run on
peanut oil and the reality is he didn't
design it to run on peanut oil he
designed the engine and experimented
with with many different fuels coal dust
was one of them that just about blew his
head off and so he says you know there's
got to be a different fuel that I can
use it's not so volatile and the
inventor of the diesel engine over 100
years ago was using peanut oil straight
vegetable oil to to run his engine with
and so there's actually you know the
history of using straight vegetable oil
it's kind of the original you know
biofuel it's a very long history and the
Mercedes engine is is built and over
built and over engineered and it's just
a really fine piece of equipment and it
does have the capability to handle a
single tank system a lot better than a
lot of the newer vehicles so the issue
here seems to come down to the co2
emissions I mean we have plenty of
carbon hydrates we can convert into
liquid fuels if he wants but now we
don't have a good way of dealing with
the co2 emissions we have you know if we
wanted to convert to the car into
gasoline we could do it for hundreds of
years there are even bigger sources now
for the Achilles heel of the solutions
he presented was that they other than
recycling waste they all seem to
generate more co2 than the status quo
which is wearing gasoline like there
there's a devastating study or a couple
of studies which were published in
science magazine this week which show
that
pretty much all uses of ethanol and
biodiesel generates far more co2 than
they save so what is what can we do well
I education is the biggest thing because
you're correct you know when you look at
the lifecycle of of corn-based ethanol
it's a disaster we are not gain and
we're definitely going behind no
economies no it's not correct that corn
based ethanol takes three gallons of
fuel to generate one gallon gallon of
ethanol it's actually slightly energy
positive but the co2 impact is worst
loudly it depends on who you talk to
I've talked to professors at Cornell
that have done some extensive research
that have have stated that and and
here's another thing you can find a
study to base anything that you want to
you know to prove any point that you
want to and so you know it's it's kind
of pointless to you know say well this
science said this and this science said
that we've got it you know there there
are so there's no scientific truth in
other words well no there is but you got
to wade through a lot of BS to get to us
sometimes the and and so what can we do
I mean the first thing that we've got to
do when we're looking at this is
conservation and and that's something
that no matter what you're driving or
what fuel you're using that needs to be
the first tool we take out of our our
tool boxes is how can I conserve and
then you've got to look at things you
know with with straight vegetable oil
where you're using the waste product you
know that's kind of a no-brainer because
that's already there we're trying to
recycle something but as far as when we
turn that you know go over that hill and
now we're we're growing oil based crops
and everything like that to harvest is
fuel these are things that we have to
look at I don't know all of those things
have negative worsened the co2 impact
for hundreds of years due to land use
changes yeah well you know and and there
there's going to be different camps and
and you know I don't have every single
answer to every every single fuel kind
of my overall theme is that we
definitely can't take things at face
value and we do need to dig a little bit
deeper so you know the more the more
reports you read the more
notes you make on this stuff and compare
you know we might find that that right
now ethanol looks bad and biodiesel
looks okay but in the in the future
things might swap a little bit and so we
we've got to be vigilant make sure that
we don't just take things at full face
value and that we do a little bit of
digging on our own because if you just
listen to people and don't do a little
backup research you can find somebody to
support whatever idea they want to come
with so we got another gentleman here
that has a question thank you hi it
seems like the the big problem with SVO
is inconvenience and inconvenience from
both your vehicle you know supporting it
as well as the distribution means and it
seems like you know both of those are
probably addressable I'm just sort of
curious like you know is there any push
or lobbying to get either both you know
traditional petroleum distribution
companies to help distribute SVO or even
someone like you know fast food chains
to have a place where you can pull up
and and pump up and then part two is
with respect to automobile manufacturers
you know is there a push or any
incentive or way to get people to make
vehicles that are either dual tank or
more Minah bolt to a single tank with he
didn't all that yeah very good questions
first part of your question you know
five years ago we were just a bunch of
cooks in our garage I mean we still kind
of are but we've been able to take this
to a few levels that are you know have a
lot of hope for example we have a branch
office in Hokkaido Japan and we were
able to do some work and get a blanket
exemption from the Japanese government
for straight vegetable oil and a lot of
the the work that we do over there is
for city governments who are in charge
of the waste collection disposal and so
there's a a pretty good network of towns
and cities over there where they have
centralized dump points for the
restaurants and those then in turn are
used in the city vehicles in the United
States here there's several companies
that are starting to spring up that are
processing anywhere from fifteen to
twenty thousand gallons of
and starting to deliver to some of our
fleet customers and it's is slowly but
surely going out of the the single end
user and going up into a little bit of
industry and so these are natural
progressions and steps as we've got a
few years behind our belt and everything
and people that are running businesses
see the the tremendous cost savings that
they can do by running straight
vegetable oil then they say but we can't
go to you know our local fish fry house
and and get our you know we're in the
trucking business we can't do that so
there are some companies that are
popping up that are starting to fill
that need we actually worked on a
project down in Phoenix Arizona all the
Carl's jr. restaurants there we did a
pretty extensive fleet for them and they
set up fueling stations at their
restaurants and so all the executives
for Carl's jr. in the state of Arizona
run around on their own french fry
grease so little by little these these
things are being addressed and there's
companies that are seeing that need and
filling that void and we're working on a
couple of big projects that if I told
you about it have to kill you but there
there are moves in that direction to
take this into trucking companies and
everything like that and get collection
on a grand scale so that we can really
make a big dent where it where it
matters and see your second question was
car manufacturers we actually got in two
years ago with General Motors and was on
a crop we were on a cross-country
promotional tour called the Go Green
tour I don't think when they signed us
up they really realized the
ramifications of what of how abstract
straight vegetable oil is but they were
they were pretty accommodating and it
was kind of cute and it made for some
good PR for them for a little bit but I
really don't see a a push right now for
any car manufacturers getting on board
unfortunately they're a little bit tied
too close to the petroleum companies and
so you know they'll they'll kind of
treat it as a cute little thing as
as they don't see any threat from it I
am thank you for being the Maverick you
are thank you with in terms of heavy
equipment say buses and they were driven
by diesel fuel and this alternative
fuels that you talked about how well do
they function in terms of reliability in
terms of noise and also mileage and that
will be for heavy equipment as a
caterpillar Tractor Detroit Diesel Oh
excellent yeah one of the great things
about straight vegetable oil is although
it contains a few less BTUs than
petroleum diesel because of the added
lubricity and it's burn characteristics
we actually tend to notice slight gains
and horsepower and fuel economy so
there's not there's not a lot of you
know with ethanol you've got it you take
a pretty big hit in efficiency but with
with the vegetable oil because of its
density and its lubricity it gives you
just as much bang for your buck as
diesel does if not just a little bit
more and the the added benefit is
because it lubricates well the longevity
of your engine is going to you know I
don't go around saying hey your engine's
gonna last forever if you you know run
on vegetable but but done right and when
I say done right meaning that you have
clean dry fuel the longevity of your
engine is not going to to go down at all
and in some cases we've seen with older
vehicles they've actually held on for a
little bit longer because of the added
lubrication and so we've we've done a
lot of applications with big rigs I
guess I can go I've got a few more
slides here we'll we'll go through
here's some of the vehicles we've done
big semi trucks my bus some motorhomes
that right there was the truck that we
did for the General Motors tour and you
know the big the bigger they are the
better they like it and the quicker your
payback some of the the big fleets that
we do we've got guys that are going
through you know just unbelievable
amounts of fuel and they actually can
make their money back in a matter of a
there too and instead of you know for
some end-users it may take them a year
to make their initial investment back so
you had a question sir yeah you
mentioned three billion gallons a year I
believe is the waste oil well Oxley
that's a hard number to pin down I've
heard some of the the general numbers
and somebody's gonna Google this and
then tell me I'm wrong but here that's
good just send me an email so I have the
exact number but the numbers that I've
looked at for over the last year -
there's somewhere between five to six
billion gallons produced in the u.s.
annually and it's roughly estimated that
about half of that is not made doesn't
make it into any recycled system at this
point and some of its in the food itself
right you eat french fries well when I
see a lot of it the the stuff that is
collected is put in animal foods and is
put in cosmetics and stuff and then a
lot of the smaller places are just
dumping it in the back 40 and so my
question was what's our daily usage of
petroleum for transportation it's on the
order of numbers like but no no I've
just shooting from the hip I think that
that represents less than 1% of our
diesel just a diesel yeah just the
diesel consumption so it's not a huge
number but when we look at technologies
like algae oil and the the huge numbers
that they can bring in per acre and you
don't need you know arable land you can
do it in the desert with seawater you
know there's a lot of California that
could fit that bill you know and so
there is some huge potential for growth
there but as far as just the waste
vegetable oil
you know I you're talking maybe around
1% a little less so that's that would
still be a very large fleet 1% of the
you Oh
well several big yeah I mean that so big
yeah right but yeah I can replace all
guess not gonna replace all diesel fuel
at this point but you know it's it's
definitely some some a place to start so
any other questions yeah
there is any difference in the vegetable
oil that you use I mean my question is
connected to the fact that you were
talking about the farmer and ethanol I
mean they can still use you can still
use the corn that they produce to create
vegetable oh yeah it doesn't matter what
plant the oil is do it well let me back
up there's there's one or two plant oils
that don't do too good in this one of
them is linseed oil if that sounds
familiar is because they use it in paint
and it dries like that it's got a really
it it'll polymerize very quickly
that's not one you want to use but
nobody cooks with linseed oil so it's
not really a problem but as far as the
common oils that are used to cook with
peanut oil olive oil canola whatever it
all burns good and you can all mix it
together and make you know pretty pretty
healthy concoction there so yes sir so
you said today that people have to pay
to have the vegetable oil remove his
waist in many instances in in most
places yeah there's a few markets around
the country where the the rendering
companies will actually pay the
restaurant you know a few pennies per
gallon but and then there's places where
they don't pay them but they don't
charge but more often than not the
restaurants have to pay to dispose of it
it seems like if there was usable energy
in it or you know a reasonable amount
that was being easily converted by you
know normal processes that there would
be you know people who would be burning
it and you know larger reactors too
often you know to do cogeneration and
you know plants and stuff and that this
would quickly become a valued commodity
right it's like if people were you know
and and this is the thing I mean to a
lot of people that first learn about
this this straight vegetable and stuff
they're like wow this really makes sense
how come everybody's not doing this how
come other people are doing it and you
know unfortunately sometimes really good
ideas take a little while to catch on I
mean there is a huge groundswell of
interest and growth in our industry and
everything but but in people like you
know what's the catch you know but
really there's literally millions and
millions of gallons sitting out behind
restaurants and getting dumped in the
landfill and everything of a perfectly
you know liquid
fuel that can be used in existing
equipment and we don't really have to
wait for new technology so you know
sometimes it's frustrating because you
you you're like you know how come people
can't see that you know even though it's
it's a small percentage it's a
percentage and we could be doing
something with this and and my message
is is that if there's something this
obvious that we deal with every day
everybody's eating fried food every day
if there's something this obvious what
else are we missing let's open our eyes
and realize that you know there's all
kinds of stuff we're thrown out that we
might be using for energy do you know if
anybody uses it for cogeneration today
oh yeah you mean like electrical
generation yeah run it in a big diesel
engine connect to your plant and you
probably say you know potentially save
ridiculous amount of money yeah I've got
I've got a lot of customers that run
generators with this if they're off the
grid and stuff you know generally
speaking net metering states you're not
going to make enough money to offset
your cost but if you're in a situation
where you want to produce your own
electricity it's extremely cost
effective it's not I just wanted to
speak to your points about you know the
costs of reticulating electricity around
as an argument against electric vehicles
because I think the system that you're
describing with SVO is you know
something that could work with you know
elec electrical propulsion sure you know
hybrids set up so they don't necessarily
have to be opposed but I just wanted to
clarify that that that issue because
it's an argument that's been brought up
and remember reading the there's a book
called plug-in hybrids and it sort of
sprung bought off of the who killed the
electric car thing there was a whole
conspiracy theory around that I guess
the thing is that yes there are lots of
coal plants producing electricity but
there's also a number of hydro plants
around in the states so it's one of
those things where if it suits locally
for you to run an electric vehicle then
you know the economies might be right
for example we've got a bunch of solar
cells on those cars
and electric leads hanging down and no
one's using them yeah and I didn't want
to give the impression that I'm against
electric cars because she you know she
reiterates my point very well that you
just need to look and see what your
situation is and in some times even
though we may not be quite there yet you
got the chicken in the egg scenario we
don't have the renewable electricity
quite yet but we've got to develop the
the electric cars and get those more
accepted before we can you know get the
the renewable energy and so I'm not
opposed to technologies just because at
this point in time they're there they
haven't quite made it over the hill and
but I think it's very important to be
informed of exactly where it's coming
from so that we at least know what the
rules to the game are yeah yeah because
one of the other economies with electric
propulsion is you've got all the fancy
regenerative braking and yeah all of
that cool stuff yeah there there's
there's some amazing technologies out
there and and I you know I I just look
at the the SVO stuff and if we had the
these diesel hybrids in the States how
you know we could marry those two up
together and we could really be getting
somewhere that then and so you know I
think all these things are important too
to not discount any one of them right
off the bat but let's make sure that we
really analyze where they're coming from
and know what the rules to the game are
so that if they're not quite there we
know which direction we need to head I
think we're officially out of time but
I'll be happy to stick around and talk
to anybody if you got any more questions
thank you for coming
