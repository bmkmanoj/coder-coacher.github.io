kara Google and I'm happy to introduce
Stephen Dow who is a currently a
postdoctoral scholar at the HCI group at
Stanford University and he got his PhD
from Georgia Tech and so today he's
going to be talking about how
prototyping practices affect design
performance q Jimmy hi everyone good
afternoon so my talk today is going to
be about design and I wanted to show
quick slide here of some of my prior
work in the area of design and
technology and people I'm not going to
go into these projects but I wanted to
give a little bit of background on where
I come from and i graduated from the
human-centered computing program at
Georgia Tech and have spent a lot of
time probably over the last eight ten
years creating these sort of fantastical
experiences with technology and most
recently for my dissertation in
augmented reality drama called a our
facade where people come into this 600
square foot physical apartment and
interact with speech and gesture with
these two characters who are reacting to
the things that you do and say that's a
whole nother talk what I'm going to talk
about today is how prototyping practices
affect design outcome so I spent a lot
of time doing what i would consider
design work this work focuses on sort of
the meta view of design what it what is
it about the design practices that
really matter designers discover and
manipulate variables that are often
implicit context-dependent and difficult
to articulate and they externalize
through sketches and prototypes not just
the things that they already have in
their heads but they instigate this
process of discovery they do that to
learn about the environment so today's
talk is describing a series of
experiments that we've run to sort of
tease apart how prototyping practices
affect design outcome and so I like
starting out with a Dilbert cartoon
we've hired the world's most innovative
design firm will observe their
successful methods and steal them for
our own
hahaha maybe their secret is hiring
smart people I'm hoping it involves
easels so the question that Dilber
raises here is is it the methods that
matter or is it just having really smart
people what's the secret behind places
like Google so our research takes us its
hypothesis that the process does matter
that our choice of problem-solving
practices can have significant outcome
impact on the outcome and what we have
intuitions about iteration exploration
and refinement we don't have concrete
evidence as to why they matter and so
I'm going to start off talking about a
little bit about the Stanford d.school
it's the Stanford School of Design it's
pretty popular around Stanford campus
this idea of design thinking and I was
over there a few weeks ago in one of the
meeting rooms and i saw this really
interesting flyer hanging on the wall it
said zoom in here believe in process and
the goal of my research is to move
design and design thinking beyond these
faith-based notions of what matters to
more of an evidence-based discipline so
there are anecdotes about how
prototyping practices affect design
outcome there's a story of the ceramics
teacher comes into class the first day
and splits his clots up into two groups
he tells one group you are going to be
graded on creating as many ceramics as
possible that's your grade is going to
be based on that he tells the other
group create one really good ceramic and
that's all you really need you're going
to be graded on that one ceramic well
come the end of the the term the end of
the quarter the works of highest quality
were all produced by the quantity group
and bales in orland who reported this
story wrote that while the quantity
group was busily churning out piles of
work and learning from their mistakes
the quality groups at theorizing about
perfection
and in the end had little more to show
for their efforts than grandiose
theories in a pile of dead clay so
there's preliminary evidence here
anecdotal that focuses on demonstrates
to some extent that iteration focus on
an iteration rather than refinement can
actually affect the outcome and we
speculate that repetition and deliberate
practice helped practice einar's learn
more and discover new opportunities well
I think all of us would agree that
iteration is important given enough time
we would all iterate as much as we could
but Michael schrag who studied
industrial cultures across numerous
organizations has shown that has argued
that production schedules often
discourage iteration in favor of
realization people take fewer risks
under pressure and the aversion to
iteration is defended as we don't have
time we don't time to to continue
iterating so we had the following
research question is it valuable to
continue eliciting feedback when the
common intuition is to stop iterating
and start refining so we conducted a
study 28 participants and manipulated
our their ability to get feedback within
a design process our hypothesis was that
iterating multiple times under time
constraints would lead to better results
than allocating time to refinement to a
single iteration more unforeseen issues
would would be discovered creative
opportunities would emerge one of the
leading creativity research Robert
Sternberg argues that it's very
difficult to measure creativity because
you don't know what's going on in the
noggin so the trick here was to choose a
task that was somewhat representative of
real-world design while still allowing
us to draw contrast between the things
that people create and so here are some
of the criteria we had to test our
hypothesis we needed an objectively
measurable
design outcome unlike traditional
problem solving research we didn't want
there to be just one solution to this
problem we wanted there to be a wide
variety of different solutions many
different paths to reach the solution
finally for this initial experiment we
are looking at iteration and feedback so
we wanted to have a task where feedback
was available in iteration in in this
discussion is where someone creates a
prototype and then get some sort of
feedback whether it's from the physical
world or from the social world or you
know a real world deployment where
they're getting lots of real data about
how a prototype works and we also wanted
to do this study within a small time
window a lab study time window so our
solution are our task was to choose an
exercise fairly common in K through 12
schools the eggdrop exercise have you
guys heard of the eggdrop exercise yeah
so what we did is we gave people a bunch
of materials everyday materials paper of
rubber bands tissue paper and we had
them construct a mechanical vessel to
protect a raw egg from a fall and we
would drop the vessel from a foot and
then a two feet and then keep going
higher and higher until the egg cracked
and that was our measure of performance
pretty simple and it looks like this
contract constructing a vessel people
have different ideas and then we have
them test the if they were able to test
they tested right next to the design
area so we had 28 participants we had
two conditions that we balanced for
prior exposure to the eggdrop exercise
that they done it before in school if
they have any formal design training and
gender and everyone completed the task
individually was not a group exercise so
the non iteration condition was provided
one egg and told it would be used in the
final drop subjects in the iteration
group were given a whole carton of eggs
and then we're encouraged to drop their
vessels periodically throughout this
design phase the key here is that after
the design phase we had participants
throw away everything they had created
threw away the prototypes and they came
into this build phase with only what
they had learned in the in the design
phase after that we conducted a short
interview where we asked them to
describe the design and what they
thought would happen when the egg
dropped or when the vessel dropped so
what did our results show comparing
conditions of results showed that under
time constraints as we hypothesize
several rapid iterations yielded better
results than a single iteration and this
was significant by by quite a large
margin they learn more during that
design period so what did they actually
do in iteration versus not interation
well across both conditions participants
use the entire time to build in not
iteration they would tend to test on top
of the table do what they can they would
refine their their ideas throughout the
entire time folks in the iteration group
tended to tended to really take the
opportunity to test their ideas many
point x to the point of cracking the egg
they would continue testing and getting
up on the table and so on
so overall in both conditions
participants created a wide variety of
ideas some employed parachutes and
landing pads others attempted to suspend
the egg in some sort of box or triangle
others still try to create a canopy to
catch the raw egg so a lot of different
ideas notably this the the top three
performer several performers all came
from the iteration condition and they
were vastly different design ideas there
was no silver bullet feature but
successful egg drop vessels seemed to be
constructed well and accounted for
several key variables such as slowing
the the fall of the egg cushioning the
initial impact point and then after the
impact point there tended to be some
some recourse some falling to the side
that you had to account for balancing
the impact and then containing the egg
itself as sort of another key variable
so where do people come up with these
ideas well people who had done it before
remembered some of the ideas they had
seen that they had donned that others in
their classrooms had done last time I
did this is like
years ago or something and I have some
vague recollection of like some box sort
of thing that kind of like get the egg
suspended and a little bit notice he
didn't actually create the idea of
suspending the egg in a box but it was
available to him as an option so turns
out that if you had done egg drop before
you're much more likely to perform
better on this experience on this task
so significantly you know if you had
done the egg drop before you perform
much better this wasn't terribly
surprising those folks are probably
exposed to more examples they had more
intuitions about where to go what was
interesting is when we looked at the
interaction between what we manipulated
in the study and those who had done
prior egg drops tasks before so it
eration really aided participants who
had done the egg drop before they had
sort of a compound effect there and you
might expect that prior experience to to
provide a similar advantage in both
conditions or maybe even the people who
had not done the egg drop before would
would do even better if they had
feedback you know comparatively but this
wasn't the case the experienced folks
got much farther with iterative feedback
than newbies so it seems that prior
experience to the task not only exposes
design examples it gives participants
experience perceiving and processing the
feedback that they're getting in this
design process interpreting feedback in
a sense is a separate skill a separate
operation from simply knowing design
exemplars so the interviews were
interesting to they revealed a lot about
how people approach the feedback and why
the feedback mattered mentation with
materials is important at the very
together like everything possible you
can do with them and then it's also
really important to see like what
actually happens when it hits because my
first design I didn't realize it would
hit so hard or hit at such different
angles some focused on the binary
interpretation did the egg crack or did
it not crack other people formed a much
more nuanced understanding of why their
egg broke why the prototype failed or
how it could be improved so the nature
of the feedback has different
characteristics and people who are
getting feedback tended to make changes
to corresponding to what they observed
prior to eight eight of these things to
support with the egg and then I decided
to another platform I think the very
problem of the last design is that it
also wasn't covering the egg enough so
beautiful that but I realized I need
more on the sides as well to help reduce
the pressure and I added a second cone
inside which I had before so people were
learning where it gets interesting here
is when we start looking at what people
actually designed and what we noticed is
that the iterative feedback tended to
lead to slight variations on an existing
design not necessarily a divergent
exploration of different ideas so here's
an it one example of someone's
progression through his through his
different prototypes so the question is
how much do people actually explore
different ideas did they consider a
broad range of possibilities you know I
don't know for some reason this is this
seems to be
there needs to be a platform and then
it's going to push it as possible with
the materials I I don't see any other
way i am not a very good outside the box
thank you shall i kind of just had one
idea and i was going to try and make it
work I kind of went with the whole
parachute idea and what I had from the
beginning so this is the best approach
for such a design so it was interesting
participants across conditions tended to
pick a concept very early in the process
and stick with it and this was partly
attributed to the short timeframe but
there's this element of fixation that
they had already considered all the
possibilities there is no other way they
could do it and here we have four
different people saying it with
completely different concepts that
they're saying this is the only way you
could do it so this notion of functional
fixation was introduced first introduced
by Carl dunker in 1945 through a series
of experiments with the candle problem
you may have heard of this so he gave
people the following items and the the
puzzle is how do you fix the candle to
the wall with and light it without
having the candle wax dripped down onto
the table so what's the answer anyone
didn't they ask you this in the Google
interview yeah now
what that's right that's the answer the
answer is you dump the tax out the box
is the candle holder okay and so people
exhibit functional fixation in viewing
the boxes primary function as a holder
for the for the tax rather than as a
potential holder for the candle and it
turns out if you run this the same
experiment same materials but you leave
the tax out on the table and the box is
empty when you start the experiment
people are much more likely to solve the
problem so we thought well maybe people
haven't just just haven't explored the
range of possibilities for their egg
drop vessels yeah in a really motivated
our next research question which was can
we improve exploration and reduce
instances of functional fixation by just
simply by structuring the process
differently and so we looked at is
whether creating prototypes in parallel
and explicitly enabling comparison
produce better results than a more
cereal approach to design where you
create one idea then get feedback then
create another idea and so on and so we
also wanted to we ran another experiment
we wanted to get out of egg-drop land
into issues of digital design and but
just as before we wanted a task where
the solutions were creatively diverse
and objectively measurable so what we
chose our insight here was to have
people design web banner ads where we
could run all these participant
creations online in an ad campaign in
parallel at the same time and get click
through analytics so how did this work
all the participants created ads are the
same client ambidextrous magazine it's a
Stanford journal of design run by
students they were given a participants
in the study we're giving a short design
brief describing the client
they could visit the website and look
around get to know what the client
wanted in advertising what's sort of
advertising they're looking for all
participants use the same design
environment this was a really simple
graphic tool that's embedded in the
browser when you visit myspace and you
want to build an ad for myspace you can
use this editor to create an ad and so
we had people work in this environment
one because it's very simple people
don't have to know Photoshop or learn
Photoshop they all kind of come in at
the same level recruited 33 participants
and balanced them across two conditions
again if they had had prior design
experience in advertising or in graphic
design we split those up and we also
balanced for gender and again it was an
individual task not a group task and
what were the two conditions in the
study well each participant in the study
created five prototypes and then a final
add that would be placed online in the
parallel condition or in the serial
condition that created one ad and then
obtained feedback I'm going to talk
about feedback in a second or critique
they created one after another getting
critique on each one in the parallel
condition they created three
advertisements then receive critique on
all three and then two more and then a
final one so the only difference here
was the the timing of the critique so
let's look at the critique what kind of
feedback did we give participants on
these designs well before we ran the
study we brought in ad professionals to
help us develop a system for applying
critique we generated a list of about 50
different critique statements in under
three main categories overall theme
composition and fonts and colors and
graphics so for example the experimenter
may choose the following statements to
apply to the ad here on the
might the critique statements were
technical in nature intended to provide
high-level direction without being
explicitly positive or negative in it
most importantly the feedback was the
same in both conditions so he took a
steps to try to apply critique without
bias the experimenter first wrote down
on paper perceived violations of graphic
design rules and then selected from
these pre authored critique statements
so they would select three statements
from that from that list also the
experiments are viewed and critiqued the
parallel adds sequentially so they
finished you know these three ads would
come in they would finish the first one
before even looking at the second one so
each ad was sort of critique
individually not compared to other ads
they never said like this ad has a
better color than that ad so we worked
hard to ensure that the parallel
feedback matched the stimuli of this the
serial feedback does anyone have any
questions about I'm going to actually
move on to this next slide and then ask
me more questions I know this is a
sticking point so the main difference
was how we structured time both
conditions created the same number of
ads serial participants received
critique after each ad parallel
participants received to critique
sessions same amount of feedback so they
received critique on three ads and then
they were after that they received
critique on the and their second to
their their fourth and fifth ads and
then the other thing we did is to ensure
that both conditions were interrupted
equally we asked the parallel
participants to start on their next ads
at the same interval as the serial
participants so this is our experimental
design any questions at this point yeah
yes they were they weren't told how they
should design they they are instructed
that they're going to be creating five
prototypes and then a final design and
then we just came in when when those
time periods were up and and told them
what to do next where it was very non
explicitly okay now it's time to create
your next ad we didn't say okay make
another version of that or okay they had
to start the next that they've had to
stop
the question is when you were done with
one AD do they have to stop on the on
the previous could they go back to a
previous ad right you could not go back
to a previous side once they were done
with one ad they're done with ax all
right so so it ends up interesting
because we had 33 unique creations ad
creations that people came up with and
we took all 33 ads and we stuck them all
on myspace com at the same time so we
ran a 15-day campaign where we're
collecting analytic data the entire time
and we have it targeted to a group of
myspace users who might be interested in
this magazine people interested in
design or an engineering or in arts
which is sort of the theme of this
magazine in total we created over a
million impressions an impression is a
when an ad appears on a myspace users
page there it's formed an impression on
them and in total we generated only
about 500 klicks which I'm told is
pretty common you show it a lot of times
and you only get a few clicks out of it
but when they click it they they go to
the ambidextrous website so we produced
three primary measures of ad design
performance one is how often were the
ads clicked based on the number of
impressions that were generated for that
ad secondly how much time did they spend
on the target website on the
ambidextrous website and we had google
analytics set up on the target website
we were able to get a number of
objective measures of once the visitor
reach the site how much time did they
spend how many pages they visit within
the site and then we also show the ads
to experts we had the magazine editors
ambidextrous editor's review the ads as
well as several ad professionals they
all rated the ads individually
on a scale from 0 to 50 so what did we
find so according to the myspace add
data parallel ads received more clicks
per impression here they're displayed as
clicks per million so significantly more
clicks per impression for parallel ads
than for serial ads and the
click-through data is actually quite
interesting and complicated because
myspace varies the number of impressions
for an ad based on its prior performance
so this is the main reason I'm showing
clicks per impression rather than total
clicks because once the I own time to go
into it right now but if you're
interested it's really interesting how
the impressions evolved over time and
how the campaign actually worked and how
we evaluated there was a number of
statistical analysis we ran over time to
look at this but the main one was simple
if you just look at the clicks per
impression there were more in the end
the parallel condition so not only the
people more myspace users click the
parallel ads once they reach the
ambidextrous website those visitors
spent more time on the ambidextrous
website this was not quite significant
but it was still interesting that they
spent more time on average on the client
website finally our independent raters
rated the ads and judge the parallel ads
to be better than the serial ads so by
all measures that we came up with for
this experiment the parallel process led
to a better outcome than the serial
process then the question is well why
did we see this difference so we started
looking at some of the literature on
cognition and learning and one of our
inspirations for doing this study was
dead Regan Turner's work on analogy in
one of her studies
she they presented subjects with a pair
of funny illustrative scenarios so look
at these photographs the task was look
at these photographs and try to remember
things that you see in the photographs
okay there's a pig spraying mud on a
tractor a farmer shouting or blowing a
whistle he's shouting there's a baby
over there ya see a bunch of things in
there and then they would have them go
do something else for 30 minutes and
come back 30 minutes later they would
cue people with portions of these
photographs so for example they would
show just the picture of the baby or
just the picture of the artwork and they
would ask people to recall everything
that could remember about the photograph
you saw that that Imogen so if you
showed someone the picture of the baby
how much could they remember about the
photograph on the right so it turns out
that people are much more likely to
recall aspects of the photos if you cue
them with the sub portions of the photos
that have alignable differences with the
other images that were presented in
parallel so when there's an alignable
difference between the photographs
people are much more likely to remember
things about the photograph so the baby
was a much better cue because it has an
alignable difference in the left photo
the pig spraying mud meaning that
there's something analogous in the left
photograph it's not a similarity it's
not another baby but it's an analogous
object doing something similar it sort
of fits the same activity as the other
one where the artwork for example has no
alignable difference or some analogous
object in the left image so they are
less likely to recall aspects of that
photographs
that's a good question i'm not sure the
answer to that yeah the question was did
the study control for the focus point of
the cues that were being presented and
whether or not they aligned or not and I
don't know the answer to that I imagine
that for example there's other alignable
difference like the farmer and the witch
I don't know what that is something
right that is not quite front and center
but you could argue that's maybe a focal
point of the image so I'm not sure the
answer to that but it's a good question
people to go back and look at that so
they argue that they argue that
comparison processes that our abilities
to to look at two things in draw a
comparison is what helps people learn it
helps people focus on key relations
creates a focus of four matching systems
of knowledge and aids in the recall and
an acquisition of underlying principles
and so our our hypothesis here is that
one of them is that the parallel process
i'll perform cereal because it
explicitly supports comparison between
the the different critiques that they're
receiving on the ads okay that's one
hypothesis number two we looked at the
interview data and what people are
saying afterwards and it turns out many
of the same things we saw in the eggdrop
study we're appearing in this study
fixation for example this this cereal
participants that i tried to find a good
idea and then use that idea and keep
improving it and getting feedback so i
pretty much stuck with the same idea so
we took all our ads that were generated
all of the final ads as well as all the
prototypes that were created up to that
point about 200 ads and we put them on a
giant poster separated by parallel and
serial and we looked at it and we could
see a lot more of this similarity some
sort of fixation happening in the
cereal than in the parallel there were
some cases of that in the parallel as
well so what we did to kind of back up
these intuitions was we try to get a
measure of different similarity we took
our ads that were created by an
individual participant and stuck them on
to mechanical turk and we asked
mechanical turk to do a pairwise
comparison between each individual pair
within a participant set of designs so
if they created six ads there's 15
different pairs that you could you could
you could create 15 different pairs of
AB from a sexed a set of 6 ads yeah ok
so we had we had tons of much we had I
think something like we had 30
Mechanical Turk judge 15 pairwise
comparisons for all 33 participants so
this generated about 15,000 judgments of
similarity and basically we just ask
them how similar are these two ads it
was interesting because the results show
that these independent raters found the
serial ads to be much more similar than
the parallel ads and it produced a high
significance because of the number of
participants we recruited in the number
of data points that we had but but
essentially it showed that the the
parallel ads were more divergent they
had explored a wider set of
possibilities and that's our second
hypothesis is that by structuring the
process that way and having participants
wait for the feedback they are able to
explore more concepts because they
weren't concentrating on just improving
the idea that they had they weren't
getting the feedback and then just
directly applying it to the to the
evolving design finally the interviews
also just uncovered that the serial
subjects tend to define the feedback
more negative than the parallel
participants so this one serial
participant said
I received really negative comments
saying that the clients are looking for
a creative and clever ad which in other
words is saying that my ad is stupid or
ridiculous and and we had about eight
out of 17 people had sort of offered
negative comments about the critique
that they are receiving whereas none of
this cereal participants had things to
say on that note so the another working
hypothesis is that the cereal
participants lost confidence they were
sort of more invested in the ideas that
they are putting forward and so the
critique took a shot at them you know
rather than at the work itself you you
if you go through art school I have
friends who went through art school
talking about how when they go through
critique sessions they often talk about
the work rather than you know your your
design because they want to separate the
personal emotional attachment to an idea
from the the actual critique that needs
to happen on the concept so last slide
actually a research touched on a number
of issues iterative prototyping helps
designers learn and discover what
variables and constraints are in play so
for example the participant talking
about how she realized after dropping it
the first time that it actually does
something funny you know on the second
drop it falls to the side so she's
learning things in that process secondly
we showed that it appears that iterative
feedback did not automatically lead to
divergent exploration so if anything the
feedback directly influenced the next
variation the next iteration that they
are going to create once you start
getting a sort of feedback on your
concept you start thinking about well
how do I fix that one thing and it tends
to lead to hill climbing but not
necessarily at the right Hill so if you
are on the right hill you're going to
get the top of it faster but if there
are other hills to explore
you may completely be ignorant of those
and so we did this other experiment
where we showed that structuring the
process in a parallel way where you
first explore different concepts and
then sort of narrow in on a concept
you're you're you're not only in this
experiment led to better results but it
helped participate explore a wider
variety of ideas and avoid sort of that
functional fixation or investing in a
single concept and so I have a number of
other slides if you're interested in
seeing more but that's the end of the
talk and I'll take questions now thank
you
so the question I have it can you study
how the number of parallel designs of
design iterations can actually affect
the design performance how the number of
iterations can actually change it so you
thinking in the context of the first
study or the second study for the first
studies the number of iterations right
so for the second study the number for
parallel yeah the first study was like
four iterations compared it to 21 okay
so it doesn't matter if they create two
or three is that what you're asking so
for the first to study you fix the
number of iterations they can do oh
right so my question is did you study if
you set a number to six or eight whether
that's actually going to change the
performance of design so for the
iterator more or less yeah so you could
argue i think i got your questions so if
you continue to iterate more and more
doesn't ultimately lead to better
results right i think it depends a large
extent on the on the task that you're
doing you could argue that over time you
kind of level out and you just sort of
reach a performance peak that you you're
not going to be able to overcome unless
you start exploring different ideas like
completely reinvent what your what your
concept is so i believe more iteration
leads to better and better results
because you're constantly learning how
to improve the concept that you have but
i don't think it's an ultimate principle
like i don't think that more iteration
is always going to lead to better
results okay
make sense so for the second study it
did it's the number four parallel
designs right so you work on three
designs at the same time or five design
same time will that be different I mean
presumably I think that again we
structured the process in a way that we
could compare it to the to the serial
condition so we wanted to have the same
number of prototypes in the same number
of critique statements provided to each
process so you could argue well let's
add you know let's make it five an early
session where you create five or more
prototypes upfront and then I think that
one of the things that's really hard for
people is coming up with vastly
different ideas in the first place and
so what's interesting is how getting
feedback may temper that ability the
fact that you're getting cereal feedback
if you just create a single concept that
that's somehow limits your ability to be
diverse in those in those first three
ideas we just look at the first three
that were created if you're getting
feedback in the middle of those it may
actually temper your ability to to be
diverse to be creative and how you think
of different ideas so I think there's a
lot of follow-up questions like what if
we do this what if we do that what's
really interesting for me is to think
about well you know how much how do we
know the right amount of exploration to
do how do we know the right number of
iterations to do how do we know there's
not another hill over there that we
haven't explored versus just keep going
on the idea we already have so there's a
number of questions that we're still
trying to unpack but that's what the the
research is for I think yeah one quick
request can you go to the previous slide
I wanted to see the learnings okay so
might one of my questions is around
group dynamics versus individuals so
what you're talking about is individuals
coming up with solutions becoming
fixated on that by the nature of a group
there's probably a lot more
collaboration far more divergent aspects
have you guys explored that and done any
comparisons we haven't done it in any
studies but I've I've read it quite a
bit about it there's fantastic work by
Bob Sutton and Hartigan that's they
actually out of Stanford as well but
they looked at group design practices
and did Studies on individual
brainstorming versus group rain stormy
and they actually found and there's
quite a bit of evidence showing that
individuals are better at coming up with
diverse ideas than then groups and the
reason is part of the reason is that in
a group you're I think there's a number
of dynamics that happen one
how comfortable do you feel introducing
ideas whether they're good or bad
another is this idea of groupthink yeah
that once you hear a good idea you're
sort of you do get fixated even in a
group setting but what their research
argues is that the reason why we
brainstorming groups instead of going
off to our offices individually and and
then coming together with our list of
ideas is that it taps into our knowledge
of each other and the skills that we
have it opens up new possibilities that
sort of giving the the organization
cohesiveness and and a better
understanding of where individuals are
going with their research so I think
it's an interesting area for research
and we plan on doing this work we've
just at this point we've just studied
the individual because once you start
looking at groups there's all these
dynamics that come in that can affect
the results like maybe they get along
better than then these people maybe you
know there's male female gender issues
and so we wanted to just eliminate all
that for this preliminary work thank you
yeah so the participants in the parallel
ad development group were they told
please come up with three completely
different designs for review or they
just said you know create three things
for feedback okay so the question is did
we tell them anything about how to
create to create divergent ideas yeah no
we didn't we told them essentially told
me exactly the same thing as the serial
participants we said you know you're
going to be creating a series of ads and
we said okay you have 10 minutes to
create your first up and then after 10
minutes we said okay create your second
ad and then we said okay create your
third ad and then we said we'll wait 10
minutes and we'll give you some feedback
on your three ads or I think it was 15
minutes because we had five minute
intervals between AD designs for the
serial participants so we match the
amount of time that they waited and the
in the exact same stimulii for the for
the two conditions I'm just I'm
surprised that they came up with diverse
ideas as opposed to just doing
variations on a theme I think so too i
think that it's we did see elements of
that you know variations on theme and
but it's interesting that the mechanical
turk independent raters seem to view the
ads is more similar in the cereal
condition and I my hypothesis here is
that if you're getting feedback on an
idea you're ten your tendency is to
create an offset of that idea and I
haven't quite unpacked why that is I
think once you have an initial idea
started and you have some ID you know
you get feedback that's good that that
gives you an idea how to improve it
you're going to do that you're not going
to go off this other direction but we
need we need to do some other studies to
really look at that one more question
yeah I'm for the serial case I'm
wondering if you think would improve
diversity of ideas if after the feedback
the participant was told okay now throw
this out and start over yeah I do i do I
think that that there's been a lot of
research on reflective practices and
mindset framing like if you just give
people the right mindset and tell them
the right thing at the right time
they're they're more likely to do the
right things so I believe there's things
you can do to intervene and create these
effects that you want but it's
interesting that just structuring the
process differently has that effect as
well
I are you aware of any effects when you
introduce it's still an individual
exercise so it still has that
competitive element but you introduce a
cross-pollination of the ideas like
midway through everyone gets to see all
the prototypes I don't understand your
question are you like so far you've
talked about research for solely
individual work and then they not seen
any other ideas yeah right okay if they
get to see each other's ideas part way
through the prototyping process right so
they can see what other people are
coming up with so let's say they get
halfway through the design process and
then all of a sudden they see like
everyone has to get 50 different egg
drops or 50 different ideas how would
that affect mmm actually let me show you
a couple things here
we have it we have a couple of ideas so
I think that does matter this one's fun
I just like showing it because you guys
are engineers this is from the egg drop
study but that's not what I what I was
going after yes it's not significant
what's up sure um so what I did is I
looked at the data I rated the majors so
a lot of our study participants were
undergraduate or graduate Stanford
students so I separated the majors like
communication and STS and philosophy
from the people who had engineering
majors and it turns out that that's the
result and I think what's happening here
is engineers are contemplating the the
the sort of formal solutions methods I
didn't see anyone drawing formulas but
the egg job task is very informal and I
think that the idea of trial and error
matters a lot in this in this particular
task this certainly isn't going to be
true in all design situations but
there's this idea of comparison going
back to what you brought up here if you
not only just allow people to compare
different ideas but you have them come
up with some theory or intervene in a
way that they're they're more likely to
to solve the problem but we have this
other idea which is to give people
examples and so this kind of delves into
what we saw in the eggdrop study where
if you had done the eggdrop task before
and seeing all these examples in the
past not only came up with better ideas
without feedback so there's that if you
look at the non iteration condition the
people who had done the egg drop before
did better than those who had not but
they the people who had done the egg
drop before when given feedback actually
did much better so the question is is it
examples that are accelerating design or
is it something else the experience of
parsing between the different ideas is
that the act of getting feedback and
seeing what happens the sort of
observation of contextual constraints
and opportunities and so I think doing
another study where we looked at
exposing people to examples exposing
them to examples with feedback or with
some other metadata how does that affect
the performance does it help them be
better at iterating in observing
feedback and I do think it makes a
difference there's also been researched
that shows that when people see examples
they're more likely to go in the
direction of those examples that you're
sort of more likely to integrate aspects
of those ideas into your design so the
quality of those examples probably
matters as well if you're looking at bad
examples you're going to integrate ideas
from bad concepts and
okay could you go back to the slide from
the first experiment where you compared
the results from people who knew before
and right no information before mm-hmm
because something I noticed was the if
you look at the error bands the people
who did not iterate but had prior
experience was very similar to people
who iterated and did have did not have
experienced sorry so if you look at the
4.3 where's a 3.8 in the error bars is
this did you consider doing this with
more students so you can reduce the gap
and find out whether or not it's no just
because like so when you started the
presentation you were just you just
tried to distinguish whether it's the
process or it's the people it's the
knowledge base this seems to suggest it
could be the knowledge base because
somebody with prior egg-drop knowledge
is doing as well or possibly one times
out of 20 better than somebody who
iterated but didn't have prior or did
actually this slide would suggest that
it's both right cuz it's it depending on
where it actually falls in the air bar
but yeah people had done it before
so if you look at the prior slide right
so people who had done it before on
reform better than the people who hadn't
done it before but then when you splice
it out it turns out that the people who
have done it before that we're getting
an iteration accelerated so not only did
they're not done for with generation
have done better
experienced people that had no iteration
right
that way up that's really interesting
it's almost like a power of two but the
question becomes the people who are who
have done it before and iterating
they're just spanning the knowledge base
right so is it the processor is it the
knowledge base don't you need to compare
the two separately people without
knowledge using the process and people
with knowledge not using the process I
would think there would be the cheetah
Gator I mean so there's people who have
the power knowledge right
yeah I guess I just asking if the if you
were trying to get more juice in there
that never there are things would be a
little more I think the way to do would
actually do another study where we
control for how much knowledge they have
so pick some tasks that no one has done
before and sort of inject different
points of knowledge build up that
knowledge base and that was the table I
showed just a minute ago where we expose
examples before the task or we expose
examples with metadata and where
metadata is this thing where we could
play with are the are the examples
compared to each other do they we have
some sense of what they how those
examples perform or whether or not
they're perceived as good or bad
examples in a certain design situation
so there's a lot of research like in
tool research there's a lot of tools
that try to embed examples into the
system into the environment well i'm
arguing i think that there's a good
theoretical reason to not just provide
the examples but provide a host of
relevant data about how these examples
perform in different contexts and that
being able to absorb that as well will
help you much more on the on the design
it embeds more of that experience that
you get actually going through the the
iterative trial and error process and so
I think the more you can bring in
instill that that experience that you
get from actually doing it the more
likely that you're going to improve or
make novices more like experts
so next
