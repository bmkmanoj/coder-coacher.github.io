and I'm with the Hispanic googler
network and we're honored today to have
four hits Avila CEO of tech ba Business
Accelerator from freeing companies from
Mexico to the US is a serial
entrepreneur engineer and easily shows
are tell us about his experiences in
Mexico and bring happiness here so that
further ado porque esta la la yes got a
week have a good quorum that's good okay
well welcome to all of you and I am very
pleased to be in this event to be part
of the Google Google Earth's team and
helping all this panic community I going
to talk about three the talk is going to
be divided in three parts the first part
is about my history how I do I did some
technology business and how life was in
Mexico then I going to explain a little
bit about the program that we're
building here in the Silicon Valley and
all are on the war with the government
of Mexico and then the end invite you to
be part of this active process to be in
that sense really my life has been a
very interesting life I I cannot
complain I born in mexico city in got
into the engineering school in La Salle
University where I'd really learn a lot
of things in how to develop technology
at that time micro processors was just
coming into the arena they for a lot of
you maybe you never listen about the 40
of for 40 40 8008 processors and was the
barrier lyst intel processors and we
were playing at that time in the
university we were the very first
university in Mexico done started to do
these kind of things and what's a very
interesting because at that time will
learn how to use technology for new
things I going to describe a little bit
which one where that that was then I i
did my
Master the green in Canada I jump from
Mexico City to Waterloo Ontario where I
was very pleased to learn a lot of
things and switch between Matty Matty
between engineering environment to
mathematics than for a lot of people
here in Google maybe is not a big deal
when you are an engineer move into
mathematics that is a very very hard
part because he's usually the engineers
will see all the times thinking in how
to build things the mathematicians are
people then I tried to prove than the
things work once they prove it nobody
cares and that's a big change challenge
doing in another way maybe they're from
mathematician to engineer could be
easier because doing things is more easy
than really having the abstraction how
to how to build things and that is very
was a very challenging for me from them
I really i can define now as a poly
maker without any speciality Ike has
been doing a lot of things I going to
explain moving from engineering to
research to doing intrapreneur I did
seven companies in mexico and then i
move into the venture capital
environment something them for everybody
here in the US is quite here in the
Silicon Valley is quite normal in Mexico
that was a non-work what means venture
capitalist is something than not too
many people knew it from that point I
move it and i am doing really now a
business development that is my current
passion a lot of things than I am doing
very much in how to manage the process
of creating an idea and getting that
into the market from that point when I
was in the university that was quite
interesting my life in the university I
was not really any student I was really
a problem within the student within the
university because I got in the second
in the second semester in the second
quarter I got to work within the
university and I start to develop a
research group
as Anna student that was a fantastic
experience really was a unique the
University la salle university was a
young university of the electronic scene
was brand new we were the first
generation of people in the in the
engineering the stove and from that
point was very interesting because we we
start to develop the research capability
with the same students not with
professors and that opened a lot of
doors and changed really the mindset in
how do you develop technology because
usually when you go to the school you
expect on the people in the school show
you how to do things and usually and
that's one of the big issues and I see
today in the education the traditional
way of doing training or doing teaching
is getting behind at the speed that the
technology is moving and that is
something then at that time and we did
it in about 30 years ago that was the
students were taking hit of where they
want to go and for that reason i said
and we were a paying for the university
but was interesting because what's a
pain than the top level of the
university like it the dean of the
university enjoyed that and they were
very pleased every time that we got into
the Dean office and ask for resources to
do new things he was a very first
guidance a a take it from where and we
go to the Dean of the engineering school
and say no way you go into the head of
the department and they were very much
the enemy because we were taking their
own sources for them to create the very
first application and the very first
application than ideal was first using
micro processors to do that acquisition
systems how you are able to control a
lab equipment to do research in the
university we were getting into the
health and medicine school a medical
school and we start using the technology
microprocessors to do the sampling of
things that we're doing all day long
where where students taking measurements
every hour and
they were really complained because they
were they need to do a lot of sampling
every day 24 hours a day seven days a
week and we got and put some devices
that device is decided the same device
later on I showed that to the electrical
utility in Mexico and they say we can
use that the same device to do the fully
automatic control system in how to
generate energy in Mexico and that was a
very interesting experience because from
the lab we became into the real war we
put that kind of systems we built a
technology that that time was unique in
the world we were the very first place
in the war then use microprocessor-based
fully automated data acquisition systems
for electrical utilities that was in
1981 no no 1976 sorry 1976 that was
great really just be appearing the micro
processors Apple to was on the rice was
not yet IBM I things like that nobody
knew about that there was not yet in the
mindset of a lot of people and we use it
we complete world wire in a context to
get a bit of how to do the full
automation with a bucket by a Research
Institute in Mexico they say okay we
back it we did it we created equipment
and three years later was in production
in Mexico and we want in the
international bit how to do that kind of
things at that time we learn a lot
because was not just doing the idea and
keep it that into some place this we did
idea we create a prototype we tested in
the very very hard conditions and there
is a place in there to very bad places
in Mexico than our Mexicali if you ever
been there on right on the border is the
worst place for weather side temperature
high salinity big ranges of temperature
in day and night and if you want to test
and equipment for fulfill any kind of
possibilities that's the best place we
were lucky the electrical utility said
well that's too bad we have a second one
we say they send us to a second place
than was a little bit more friendly for
doing the test we did that and the
product two years three years later than
the very first test was on production in
Mexico and was jus sit for 30 years in
doing the full automation of the
generation of electrical around the
country Mexico has something that is
very different from the u.s. is Mexico
has just one generation company and all
the national system is fully integrated
you generate energy it makes in Tijuana
in the top film of Mexico or in Cancun
Danny's in the other extreme and the
energy can be distributed all around the
countryside just one network of
electricity is not in the US and there
is several networks in the village and
that sense we did a lot of things and
that time really I face my first
existential crisis in life we go to do
something new or we went to doing
something in the same approach at the
time to compete as a competitive
advantage we decide to move from
electronic circuits and the traditional
hardwired assistance and use a
microprocessor based system that nobody
else was using before and we survived
and was good then something happens very
interesting that was back bucket within
a research center in Mexico the research
center by obvious reasons was not
focusing how to do manufacturing how to
do technology applied technology and we
got the rights of use all the technology
and move and create a company that was a
private owned company at that time I was
not yet aware about what means
entrepreneurship and somebody else took
the risk I was just an engineer in there
and we gained when there and wester
using the same kind of technology the
same approach is at the research center
we took 75 people that research center
at that time was have 1500 people we
took 75 people from the research center
and we have another 75 people from the
outside and create a new company
born with three large projects that was
how to do simulation how to do sugarcane
automation and how to do flight
simulators if I knew today at that time
the things that I learned here we never
dare to do these kind of things because
we were talking about three different
markets three different approaches and
that's the Mexican style we do
everything does his is we are appalling
makers without nonlin speciality that's
a brand name for Mexican people is we
are very good to do a lot of things but
we hardly focus into one part and that
time we make that mistake that company
did a fantastic job because we were able
to create a chapter simulator then runs
fine we created a plan simulator than
was used for the subway how to train
operators for the subway like the nodeb
ETA with the bugs and that was a very
good thing and the two one was the
project i was involved i was a system
architecture is we create a software
application than was able to create the
sugarcane production fully automatic but
for the first time in the in the world
is in the way you have a sugarcane
production is usually is a lot of
process very manual and one of the very
manual process is when they take the
people take with the hands the the sugar
producer and say well you need to cook
it a little bit at pressure or reduce
some kind of ingredients in there
increase the temperature you know that
you create a way to produce the
crystallization of the sugar we didn't
fully automatic with a tremendous
advantage and we reduce the amount of
energy what is the biggest cost for
sugarcane and we create a very high
quality in sugar that was my second
existential crisis because that
companies was owned by an egg
engineering company and the data we
finish the project I talked to the
president of the company and the CIA
and say a you know then we have a
tremendous set of products here that can
be done done worldwide production and
the guy say we're engineering company we
don't care to do products at that time I
resign of the company and decide to be
money intrapreneur life because I really
was pissed off because if the effort
that was done was three breakthroughs
very well done then never was used it
again we produce it we start the
system's the assistants work it for
several years until so they die for
absolutely obsolescence and that's it
that sense I decide to move from the
engineering side and move into my own
company and the very first company we
decide and we cannot go to automate
again the electrical utilities which
because what's already a market already
cover and where we can use the same
technology and that at that time I
learned one thing then is quite
important from the engineering when you
do something good how do you reduce that
something into a new thing once again
and again and again and we use the same
technology than we were producing was
never patented who has never copyrighted
that means was complete free available
and we reduce it and what's very
interesting because at the same time
three people in the same original team
of the electrical utilities development
we have the same idea I'm from friends
we came we came to be a competitor's
each one of us decide to open their own
company and we start fighting for how to
do water systems automation and worse is
the automation I guess is one of the
business and even today is quite
interesting because the problem of water
is getting more and more complex instead
of less and less solvent at that time we
start doing the competition in that
sense we want the round the big
contracts than my company at that time
one was how to
manage the 1100 wheel systems to extract
water of Mexico City to produce to
complement the water needed from the
rivers and other places to feed the
world systems in Mexico City and that
was a fantastic job the company still is
alive I sold that company about fios
known 10 years ago and they know the two
time before the 2000 year when I found
an was interesting to be going into
another kind of companies and I decide
and I need money to start a new venture
because the internet was not yet on the
corner multimedia appears to be there
and we were started to use in multimedia
as a tool to do the development of
medical people how to train people in
the medical environment was very complex
we created company that company it
really was not a very successful company
we did a very good projects but the
company just was a surviving company at
the one of the days I decided I didn't
like that internet appears on the market
and I decide to create my latest of the
company's other seven companies who are
within these companies are branches the
spin-off something like that and given
became to be in the two thousand in that
99 98 begins to be one of the very first
internet companies in Latin America we
learn how to build a website digital
equipment at that time was exists
personal and now we want the contracts
for doing the website for them then that
company weekends compaq then some
companies and you may know that is
called microsoft was starting to reach
through internet the the market in latin
america and we want the contract to be
dealt the official outsourced for all
applications websites and marketing
productions for Latin America than was a
very very high interest interesting
company given we start doing that we
found and doing the
same kind of things to other companies
could be good and well what was at that
time a similar sized company that could
be over customer HP well is one of the
largest and today is the largest with
other time was not the largest computers
we want the same kind of contract with a
Latin America and we start doing the
outsourcing and that became once again a
very interesting learning process having
a service company is good to be survival
but is very hard to really grow the
company into a by anjaneri wealth at
that time we decide well why we don't
move from outsourcing company to tool
manufacturers or two producers and we
switch on the fly something that was a
tremendous experience we were the best
supplier for HP and Microsoft a
microscope with at that time that opens
the door to any a company than was
thinking to decide assistant related to
internet say a you have the best
credentials for doing systems for any of
the large companies in Mexico Latin
America everywhere and we started to do
a switch from instead of selling
outsourcing we selling the tools for
doing the full automation of content
management ecommerce and knowledge
management everything integrated that
was a very interesting the best example
that we had at that time we were the
very first people then create the yellow
pages about the same time than Paul
grahan was doing here with Yahoo the
concept of the yahoo s tours at that I
mean I learned something that is very
interesting when you a big company is a
monopoly a monopoly you lose the sight
and the desire to grow and keep going we
build a technology than is still today
than was used for yellow pages was a
full system for how to automate
companies not was
really a yellow pages they never use it
they nevertheless never learn how to
really take advantage of how to use it
and the best example is well yah who
took part of the business in Mexico the
yellow pages now Google but I can tell
you who this you know the history you
you have much better information than
any of the yellow pages in Latin America
and that is a tremendous Fink than is a
very high reporting from that experience
I decides suddenly one day when the
Argentine government did well we were
trying to grow personal before the
Argentine case is we decide a key wind
say well was the largest and the most
more solid a ecommerce and content
manager company in Latin America why we
don't move from looking into the south
looking into the north we decide to do
that we became here to San Francisco we
found on the resources to open a new
company in the US was not a trivial
kinda quantity that was much before in
1999 before the dot-com bubble and we
try it to to get into the u.s. doing an
alliance and get a venture capital
resources we interviewed 37 venture
capitalists we didn't know how to do
that kind of things how to get money
from a venture capitalist who was a
learning experience really and at the
very last moment we decide okay we make
a joint venture with another company get
resources for one of these 37 companies
there are seven venture capitals and
open an office here in the US I came
here in febbraio 2001 when was the
dot-com was 2000 2001 was 2000 2000 i
guess was one month before the dot-com
cry a bubble burst we came here and when
we came here we start learning about
that we have a disagreement my other
partners and allah knows
and say hey why we don't put that on
hold for a week and we decide that and
we were the most low-key people into
that time because at that time that week
was when the burst bubble we decided not
to go this company lost a lot a
tremendous amount of money and we didn't
went into the environment the company
keep going giving was going well at that
time we were about 200 people we were
selling about seven million dollars
whether it was flash enabled company and
something then we were very confident
say we can switch the model we were
moving into tools we were getting
resources and how to move into tools
when something that we never believed
and what's going to happen the
government of Argentina make a
devaluation and say hey what happened
you are wearing Mexico who cares well
that was the critical thing then the
government needed evaluation and was
about at tier of the amount of money the
value of the capability of Argentina
took tremendous interest for a lot of
the largest companies we were working
only with very large companies and they
decide to move all the outsourcing
capabilities to Argentina they were able
to buy the same kind of resources for
the third of the money than we were
paying that day in really was a I recall
that my first meeting with HP was well
my only meeting with HP was on first day
and I came back to my office called to
my lawyer and say a what is the fastest
way than you can close a company and say
well no well it could take for a month
sorry you have one day I took a very
very
drastic decision on Friday I got the
board of directors saying the company is
closed at on monday Monday was Holly
week it makes it go insert time and the
same was no way to convince me then move
into another way was her tremendous bad
time to sell a company and we decide to
do it we closed the company on Monday
next Monday the 150 people that was
working with us was working with my
competitors all my competitors were very
happy than we closed it because they got
a very good talent and I decided to move
into venture capital decision and that
was when we got into visionary efficient
area was one of the very early venture
capital ideas in Mexico was created by a
guide that used to be the vp of Latin
America for Microsoft he was looking how
to he left Microsoft the same day than I
closed the company and saying hey I want
to try it venture capital was not ready
in Mexico to be gone there and the
reason why was the complete different
reason than we expected everybody say
the problem was no money available to do
venture capital and the reason was and
you know here is to be part of a venture
capital venture back at the company you
need to have a very very clear idea
where you go have a very high value the
morning how to manage and a team they
need to know a lot of things that we
didn't found very often in Mexican
companies at that time we were doing
that kind of approach we decide to go
instead of open really a venture capital
we decide to go into a business
development process we have a lot of
companies at that time the government of
Mexico I i present the idea of how to do
business development of Mexico and the
government of Mexico say oh that's a
neat idea but you are talking to help
fighting companies with 50 million
dollars as an initial venture capital
say well if you manage five companies
that is going to be good enough
and the government say the Minister of
Economy how you can do that to a
thousand 1 million red thousand
companies in a ten-year pier there's no
way we have a very good discussions and
that becomes to be a PA in that
discussions the government say a you
need to help not a few companies is you
need to go 400 or companies we create a
new business development process that
process and we has been gone for five
years and easy it's a dream it still
been a dream then we need to go to find
how to get these companies into an idea
so far Mexicans people know Mexican
companies we thought we have found just
one Mexican company one Mexican person
then has gone to the full process of BS
founder and get into a gnostic that's
something then we are looking how really
to fulfill what I di learn in that
stages first of all I learned really to
work all around the 360 degrees of a
company from how you create ideas how
you put that on the market how you do
marketing how you get resources and you
find something that is very interesting
you here as a part of a team you may be
are a good executive and executive is a
person than is able to manage the
resources and somebody put you then
tripping or is the guide and is able to
create value without any resources
that's a big challenge and entrepreneur
class and that's a very typical line and
I don't know how many of you has been
talking to people than are into the
intrapreneur environment and they put a
little bit of the credit card then they
found somebody that helps a little bit
to get into the next stage with an angel
investment and that from that angel
investment how to move in to create a
big company that process is quite
fantastic and in that time I learned
well 30 years or more learning how to do
that full process could be very
interesting taking the challenge than
the government of Mexico as me
to be doing and I'd really in some way
is the organization with sometimes
you're Danny's Don Quixote is a bearing
is more into the side of philanthropy
than in the silo business but we hope
Danny is going to change and the things
I are going very well take the egg was
created with a very very big support of
the minister of economy that has been
gone a tremendous alliance and is run it
by a nonprofit organization then is the
us-mexico foundation for science and the
idea here is how we focus in helping any
idea are in Mexico becomes a good
business provide them a fascicle system
to develop commercial capabilities in
the US at the beginning we started with
the NAFTA agreement and in that sense we
started with a an office here in Silicon
Valley in 2005 almost five years now
then we decide to open the next of
office and in Austin Texas within the
University and we learn something that
was quite interesting in that sense
because here you come and learn the
environment of entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurship is really every place
is not a single event than you don't get
there and you find people than are
seeking how to create the next cool this
the dream is here here at the example
and I am very proud I don't know if the
people that work here in Google than one
of the Mexican people was very early in
the stage of creating Google is when
patient fries where students in a stand
for his professor was sector
garcia-molina and it's a Mexican guide a
very well-known guide in the in the
academics and he was one of the guys and
was starting to discuss about searching
and how to create all these things and
organize the information of the wall
and in that time when we create all in
the office in Austin week we went to a
university learning how the
intrapreneurship works into this
environment and compared how to how is
the develop in a university is a
complete different thing then we decide
to open in Montreal because the NAFTA
agreement was covering three countries
the Canadian people say a what you don't
consider to be here and really we didn't
think about that and they invite us we
open the office over term then we
decided we should go into a more
international broad range we open an
office in Madrid the decision for Madrid
was very easy getting into a far away is
well what is the easy one in that sense
after we took the decision of a starting
in the hardest one that the Silicon
Valley if you succeed here you can
succeed everywhere in the work that it
we took a a chance there to go into a
different approach and open in Madrid
that was the easier part in a Europe to
open an office and the last to compare
two offices was open in Michigan
everybody say what are you doing in
Michigan well that's interesting the car
industry's in a very very critical time
Mexico has a very high participation we
produce a lot of cars in Mexico and that
is going to be quite of a very
interesting challenge how is going to be
recovering the car industry but Mexico
is going to be part of that much more
active in that sense and the latest
office and we open is in Phoenix then
was opened this year the program
announced every to every year we open
two new offices this year still been two
more to go is not yet the final is going
to be at the very end of the year and
that is going to be under the president
calderón policies to keep going that
for at least for the next few years more
I hope we is going to be for long long
time and how we work in that direction
in that direction we work in a way then
is take back when we have offices all
around the world with different people
learning how is developed the
intrapreneur environment we call
it'd take like Oh system that is we work
in Mexico we are creating a something
that we call innovation spaces is we
have a network in Mexico last year we
did events in more than 30 cities and
this year we are reaching about the same
amount at the end of the year and the
idea is we get together people from
universities students professors power
academics we get people from the
industry we get people from the
enterprise and we get the government's
in each of the cities and work together
in how to develop compounds that's the
subject that we are facing and we have a
local operation we create a program that
is awareness program that is a very
interesting we call press elevation as
we bring companies into the US for a
week with teach them how to do business
with say how the different environment
in each place is different and then this
companies has a transformation then
create products than arc for the global
market and the focus is how we adapt or
create new products and get into the
global market and here is a tremendous
opportunity and we're really looking how
to spread that war into everybody we
want to do that not alone also our
companies here today are three companies
is margarita jose antonio and cosine are
three companies than are from mexico and
they are seeking to learn invite people
make alliance develop new possibilities
and that that thing we are doing every
word than we go we want to these
companies learn how to do a global
company have the capabilities these
companies will margarita is about 2,300
people working in a call center because
Antonio has a saw a software development
environment to create to support the
product and its a 50 people company and
horse's neck is really a start-up than
is starting with a new alternatives of
the payments online then is going to be
some time announced it how is happening
he is still in a little bit
in the development process the range of
the companies are from very small
companies to any kind of companies in
any sector that could be not just
technology could be companies in any
other artists example done has been in
that sense for instance Jack me and
maybe you know that Jackie is a company
is maybe the most known company that has
started for Louise le chien a guide and
was in Mexico God's own little venture
capital moved the company into
Washington DC and he's doing a lot of my
shop software he has a development
office in fremont about the base of the
company's mexico city they already are
indeed already got the children of
investment that sense is over hope then
maybe is one of the very first IPO
companies then info link is hos Antonio
is a product support environment a
capability when the typical thing that
companies here in the valley are doing a
product that you start to put the
product on the market and happens to be
than the engineering people is doing the
support of the company and you get into
a store into a problem then you don't
get more development because the people
is taking care of the support that the
support people is not very good because
engineers are not good to doing the full
support they want to do the new product
development and that sense is a very
critical stage and the value proposition
than info link is bringing into the
table is how to do that process easier
faster and then in a very good way
synology fields is a very interesting
company I'd really recommend that you
visit the website it's a company that is
producing algea into our captive
environment is in the u.s. there is not
algea produced for anyway in fresh book
for anything is bringing from India
China China or Japan if you are eating
sushi the sushi cover is idea but now
one of the interesting things is they
are introducing new kind of products not
only for you being use it for the sushi
grub but is you use it for
a complement to oddity for food and that
is a very interesting area of
opportunity maybe you are going to start
seeing sometimes that's a dream on the
lettuce spinach and algea for doing
inside salads why not that's some of the
ideas next contact is margarita is a
company than is focusing customer
support customer care and they are doing
very well 2,300 people are working with
them the bills is the company from a
horse's neck and in that sense is a very
interesting start to accompany a noble
path that means an oil company than is a
compliment to be used with color or
things like it styles of Facebook or
could a social networking in how to
produce content for social networks
location-based and that's a very
interesting is a company than is almost
ready almost close to to sign the first
angel investment the company's already
has some product and we hope to announce
very soon in that sense I want to
imagine really how you can go and find
our way to work I mean I invite you to
go to the our website i'm going to show
you that later talk to the company's
find how you can be a mentor for a
company it's a fantastic experience I
can tell you when you're working into
our organization you have a very high
creativity but doing a product within a
very large organization is a complete
different beast than doing that by your
own with a new company than do not have
the resources of things like that that
sense I in value in the e tegra website
you can see the portfolio of the Quorum
41 companies and are active with us we
are really in working very strongly with
a lot of companies the portfolio the
full portfolio of the companies that has
gone for the full take da process is
more than 450 and tutorial 230 one of
them has gone through in our office here
in the Silicon Valley we are located in
sarkozy near by the airport one
rock from there that is very convenient
but today the words flat the
communication is complete available we
will talk can't reach any place and
that's the way then we're seeking how to
do things I appreciate your time I don't
know if you have questions or you want
to talk with the companies thank you
very much mr. Zavala thank you very much
for coming this was very interesting I
got one question and do you know of any
models like this in other countries or
Asia I mean or continents that are doing
the same thing that you guys are doing
and you know if you can elaborate a
little bit of the success of the program
you know because I'm seeing that you
know you're opening new offices and you
know there's clearly success but if you
can elaborate on you know what happened
with the companies that started with you
the first year where they are now those
are my two questions thank you thank
your own Hollow and that's a very
interesting is yeah first of all is the
question is how is done that all around
the world there are different come
organizations you can see here in the
valley there is the answer organization
that is bringing company from Australia
there is a silicon French than is
bringing companies from the France there
is a g8 Rojas an office than is helping
companies from Japan the Taiwanese they
the Korean people has different ways we
finally found so far than we are the
only ones than we have a complete full
scheme then goes from the original place
in Mexico to how to reach that companies
the success globally and that is a
unique molar in some way i am glad and a
lot of these governments comes to also
private organizations consoles to ask
how we do and we're very open we share
that we discuss that about that
how the the process is done and the
track day we found the most of the kind
of activities and or a very traditional
incubation is we probably on the space
we have a couple of events a year and we
provide some kind of introductions but
not into a very well structure now we
are doing a lot of very different things
we do awareness programs we provide we
are creating in fact companies part of
the company comprising the portfolio now
has been spin-offs then provide services
in how to manage telecommunications for
companies how to do lead generations a
worldwide how to do a market research
for this kind of combines that services
and are happening all are on over a
consistent right now when you have a 500
companies in a portfolio and growing 200
every year that that it gave you really
a critical mass to be creating an
ecosystem and I don't see right now a
similar model I imagine then soon we're
going to start looking about that I
organizations like plug-and-play
currently for instance whiteboard
strategies it is an organization than
are bringing people from Europe with a
models than are not exactly in the same
way they are more focusing how to bring
in that the companies into the venture
capitalists not provide the under
underneath support we provide the full
level and that is something that we are
very pleased to learn and we learn in a
different modes with the different
environments the success that's a very
good question than I love to to receive
every time than we presented a program
we have different way so happy mature
take measurements of these things at the
beginning we would like to see than each
company than cons widows got into a
venture investment and go into an IPO
that's instilled in something that we
are seeking very much currently from the
41 companies and we're working this year
is phi of them are seeking for venture
investments
but not all them are seeking for that
and why that happens well we're covering
the full spectrum of companies the
worst-case scenario that happens is from
the 231 companies that has gone with us
so far I found that just three of them
has gone out of business that really one
in a hundred is no but the rest of these
companies may be about thirty percent or
something like that decide to retire and
work in Mexico make a more much more
robust company and then come back later
on and that is maybe well the very
interesting cases most of that companies
at least doubled their sales in the
first year at least there are companies
that has gone to five times not all them
good and that is a very interesting
things then they do a lot of much of our
business using just the knowledge they
got from being for a formal spear of in
the US they go back to Mexico and they
double the sales that's no bad now the
next step is from instant companies and
our widows is we have companies and has
gone into the venture investment we have
about four or five companies that that
is a very interesting is a mindset
change now has gone through the Mexican
companies typical companies or Latin
American people don't like to have
corners of the embezzle of the company
and they want to have their own
companies when you bring an investor the
investor say oh I want to have a very
important part of your company and that
is a mindset than has been learn it now
every day we're receiving more companies
and are seeking specifically that
approach and that is going to be a train
then I can see in the future that is
going to be the majority of the
companies but that was a
transformational stage of the program
from the next stage is from that
companies from the 231 companies that
has gone here we keep about half of them
doing business in the US and that some
of them do the business from Mexico the
open a branch in the u.s. they have a
commercial office with one person than
is really a representative and usually
they're counting people and with this
man marvelous world and you can move
back up for it with Mexico is you can go
to Mexico from Mexico to hear almost any
place in the US in less than two days
that's in fact doing a my my benchmark
is my shortest route has been 23 hours
to be in Mexico gift conference have
meetings with people and coming back in
23 hours that the shortest period of
time the night has been able to do it
and that when you want to go to other
places to India to China to the
Philippines you to spend four days or
five days at least in traveling and
don't say when you get there with the
change of the schedule is your complete
bore out in Mexico you are about the
same time schedule now last year we saw
with these companies new cells outside
of Mexico was 54 million dollars for the
companies and we have here in the 231
companies and this year we're expecting
then we may reach into the expectation
is wearing the nearby neighborhood 0 to
200 million dollars with the company's
in the full ecosystem that is really
very good if you are taking companies
and for the first year doing business
outside of the of the current
environment they were working generate
50 for millions release have very good
kind of things the target or the dream
of each company's try to do as a sales
capability of a million dollars for a
person than they have in the new
location and usually they have one or
two persons in the new location that
means the target of expanding is to go
for two millions at the end of the very
first year
some other question yep
what is good for the two for the
recording because it's going to be on
you on youtube or okay so other the the
200 million that are projected for for
this year I guess how's the distribution
in terms of the types of markets is in
mostly technology companies or is it a
mix between an allegra culture and all
the tips are okay yep yeah from the
portfolio I can tell you today from the
41 companies that we have here in the
valley is 9 call centers and business
process outsourcing companies 19
companies and our software related to
companies in the food industry one
company in marketing and about seven or
eight the rest of the companies are
doing into mechanical and optics devices
on medical devices and in that sense the
amount of money really then we're
getting is services are very high so for
the software products are getting into
some kind of about ten twenty percent is
it is ramp out and a lot of these
companies really the star top is going
to be not a very high amount of money
but a lot of customer acquisition
because they're moving alluring to the
software as a service approach and at
the beginning the customer acquisition
is going to be the toughest part because
is more important to get customers than
they paid for that amount and that some
kind but for instance while the
companies in the portfolio go tell is
now today to recognize it as the only
supplier or rfid tools locator for the
air force in the u.s. that summation is
tools within the air force camps is very
critical to know where they are can you
imagine a screwdriver than is missing
and left in the into one part of the
motors when they do maintenance of
things like that and they create a
system than by rfid locate all the tools
in order to avoid any kind of mistakes
and things like that and that and that
is a very high potential volume of sales
and are going to be doing we have
another company that means a classified
project put it there into the security
environment and it has a very large
project right now in one of the states
in the u.s. we have another companies
and our into the kitchen they are
providing education and materials for a
k to 12 and that's getting quite well
and in that sense most of the companies
i can say eighty percent or ninety
percent of the company a production is
highly very high tech level okay well
thank you very much
