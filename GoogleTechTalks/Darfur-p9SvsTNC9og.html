in welcoming mark recchi
thank you very much my apologies for
bringing in analog into google i have my
own slide projector by the way we're
working on this I do have a short DVD of
a film trailer that he mentioned of a
documentary that's almost finished will
be completed in January of 2007 but
we'll start with some of the photographs
I took in the Darfur region of Sudan you
want to turn on projector thanks QA will
be afterwards if you have any questions
please ask or come up to me afterwards
if you're too shy to ask during the
presentation or afterwards little focus
please thank you these are political
cartoons I do a lot of research before i
go to these places i'm not a journalist
i just happen to work in current events
this came out in july of 2004 and if you
saw is it's very dated not so much to
date but the number of confirmed killed
about 35,000 the next slide please and
here is another one a year later March
12 to two thousand five on the
anniversary of Rwanda in 2004 April
there was interest in Darfur and this
kind of sparked kind of a grassroots
movement with Save Darfur org and all
these student groups who have mobilized
at the university level high school
level and around the world now to pick
up the slack where the media and the
politicians have definitely failed the
people of Sudan next slide please and
this is the Darfur region and this is
going to be quick you could spend you
know a month on the politics alone to
understand what's happening in Western
Darfur you must understand the
north-south war that happened since the
early 80s in recently um with fragile
peace agreement in 2005 as you may know
Sudan is the largest country on the
continent alone period this region is
about the size of french Darfur or Texas
and to the left is Chad eastern Chad
those are the 12 refugee camps run by
the UN there's 200,000 plus in these
camps and with in Darfur you see in the
pink symbols those are the confirmed
villages that were burned and you have
about almost 3 million people now that
our refuge
in their own country called IDPs
internally displaced the Khartoum
government does not want you there
especially now even back then from 2004
September through december i spent in
the region i was in sudan without a visa
i went across the border with the
Sudanese Liberation Army and spent
months with the People's Army to
document the ongoing crisis next slide
please this is cassani refugee camp
there's about 29,000 people who live in
this tent city this was a camp that was
in a very far north the last one up on
the eastern border of Chad here i knew i
would meet members of the Sudanese
Liberation Army this is my first day in
the camp I spent one month living with
the UN in the compound next slide please
these are new arrivals now what you must
understand this is a year number three
that's happening in Darfur you don't see
much this happening today because what
ethnic cleansing could be done has been
done and there's not too many people
left to come across the border they're
either in the camps or they've been
killed what you see in these lines is
mostly women in children the men have
been targeted from 16 to 45 if they
think they're going to join the rebel
movement definitely targeted for
extermination next slide please of the
four hundred thousand or so 300 400
thousand people play kind of games with
numbers this is a systematic campaign by
its own government the majority of
people died by a man-made famine it's
one of the oldest forms of weapons of
mass destruction is very effective you
burn people off their land destroy their
water sources kill their cattle and burn
their homes and their in this desert
basically the starve how do you detect
malnutrition or famine is these children
have to be measured their arms each one
this is a process done by different NGOs
it's long but necessary next slide
please this is something that wasn't
covered in the press this is more of a
cultural identity it is too simplistic
to say this is African Arab it is not
like that they are both of the Muslim
faith
in eastern Chad alone or in Chad as one
of the poorest countries in the world a
lot of people would like to get school
water in food to make sure that their un
is really serving the people in Darfur
one member of the family comes and
squares on the Quran that she is a
refugee from the Darfur crisis next
slide please they hire the local people
in Chad there is some of this Leah same
tribe only the colonization divided the
sand the French and Chad a course in a
British in the Sudan and so this is a
family registering there again you don't
see any men or young boys next slide
please this is a registration card if if
you need to see focus I'm a little close
go ahead and say focus and somebody else
can okay that's good to be a refugee by
international well the UN and standards
you have to cross into another country
and of course they've done this in Chad
she has 12 stamped in or card this is a
feeding car this is a car do you need to
live in the refugee camps you must
understand these people may be here you
know 15 20 year is the best conservative
estimate there's nothing to go back to
in Darfur especially now it's quite
dangerous next slide please if there's
one photo that sums up Darfur then in
Darfur today it is definitely this one
this is the one I've sent to the media
quite a bit this is a mother just
arriving with her seven children about
an hour before this photo was taken they
have witnessed their father their
brother their uncle murdered in front of
them the women have been multiple raped
trust me in this one and they seen their
villages destroyed yet they're able to
gather their children and make it into
these camps in eastern chad sometimes
you know 20 30 60 days if they have a
donkey or camo they're lucky most of its
by foot next slide please this is
another mother where their children
completely exhausted did not even go
through the registration process you saw
before this collapse in the sand through
a translator they told me the story next
slide please
this is a woman trying to rebuild what
she had in Darfur and like I said
they're going to be there for a while so
they they're trying to make it as
comfortable as possible this is a circle
this replicates their house usually
there's a grass hut on top of it next
slide please these images were kind of
generic when the crisis was kind of
slightly covered by the media in august
of two thousand four these are refugees
who just made it ended Chad and they're
too traumatized to register with the UN
camp and you can get a good perspective
of what they fled with their lives their
blankets are in the trees or water jugs
this kind of thing this very similar
image was on the cover of The Economist
2004 September with the caption on top
saying Sudan can't wait of course now
it's 2006 November and it has waited
much too long next slide please to make
sure the food distribution is organized
the world food program is set up a
system where they inkblot every child
one per day it's about a kilo of
porridge they get per child I should
mention that the United States is the
number one food donor to the World Food
Program but the supplies are actually
running low since I was there next slide
please and this is a woman for their
daily rations ready to tie her child on
their back with her blanket these people
are farmers their Shepherds they have
come from a very proud culture they're
not used to handouts used to fending for
themselves Darfur has to be one of the
most geographically challenging places
in the world by the way for any
civilization to live off of the average
woman in Darfur knows about 28 different
natural roots and plants if the crops
don't come in she can feed your children
they rely on 12 to 18 inches of rain a
year only in this very rugged rugged
desert next slide please I have done
many versions of this slide presentation
in in the last two years some as long as
I'm a shorter this one will be a little
shorter when I was in the refugee camp
in
and oh kassani I made contact with a
satellite phone to one of the
representatives of the Sudanese
Liberation Army they have changed quite
a bit since I've been there there was a
man named Suleiman John moose he was
ahem edit Arians affairs coordinator
he's no longer with them in fact he was
captured by them and put under house
arrest by mini Manali the leader of the
SLA he is responsible and the kind of
the unsung hero of Darfur for granting
safe passage for NGOs and journalists
and filmmakers such as myself through
Darfur and 2004-2005 in the world would
have seen a lot less of Darfur if it
wasn't for Suleman jube moose this is
for sure they picked me up in a truck I
came to the border this is the desert
and they're leading me down to where the
truck is by the border of Chad next
slide please you can focus that a little
bit a little light is the light in here
I usually sat in the middle of the truck
this is typical they sat on the side
next slide please and this is a village
called fought area it's about an hour
and a half from the Chad border so once
you leave the sanctuary in the sense of
the UN you're now in Darfur with the
opposition and I was there for quite
some time this is the first image that I
photographed they wanted to show me this
is a mass grave site now with the size
roughly of Texas there's probably a lot
of these these men were brought up to
the rocks they were murdered there's 13
of them over 12 years ago 11 years ago I
was in Wanda another small country
people knew very little about except for
the silverback mountain gorillas in will
wander course you don't have to look far
for this mass grave sites were stacked
up along the side of the road next slide
please and then again 10 years later I
find myself and yet another country in
the continent of Africa photographing
basically the same thing next slide
these images are never easy to
photograph I should let you know that no
matter how long you've done this it
never gets easy and you hope I never
does next slide okay
next slide this is a water well one of
the few that were still working most of
the Janjaweed which is kind of a militia
that the government has hired early on
they would poison the wells with either
dead bodies or pour petrol down them to
make them useless this is one of the few
that actually worked this is the women
through a long buckets of rope and so
some parts of Darfur you can kind of see
the traditional life but that's slowly
fading as well next slide please when I
reach Sulieman jumbos it was a good
opportunity this is a meeting of the SLA
there bring it up to par in a sense
what's happening in Darfur to some of
the tribal leaders who stay behind there
again the SLA have fashioned it's no
longer safe to work with them they'll
turn you over to the government they
have other groups call themselves now
that the National Redemption front you
have justice and equality movement which
is Jim and they were more of an Islamic
movement and that's so much military
power next slide please and this is
silly man John moose with his thoria
satellite phone he has a daughter who
lives in indiana which i've been in
contact with he calls her from his phone
he's got a PhD in paper technology he
used to work for the government itself
the man to the right with a camouflage
jacket he is an international lawyer
from the University of Cairo what I'm
trying to say is I was very careful to
say this to the media when I returned
not all people's movements stay people
who movements you hope they do but
history does not always show this and of
course now they have their own
atrocities on their hands but these
people left a perceivably comfortable
life by Sudanese or any standard by the
way to go fight for what they believe it
in the desert they have been
marginalized for decades there's no
roads no schools no electricity in
Darfur they don't want autonomy they
just want to share power in Sudan and be
representative as a Sudanese citizen
next slide prints they're extremely
armed and very organized
majority of their trucks were stolen
everything was stolen from about 2001
their weapons from the government troops
they would attack the man with the
glasses as goma hagar he was a top
military commander of SLA he may be dead
I don't know he had some problems on the
ground recently next slide please and
this is normally how I traveled with
them they they are toyota landcruiser
pickup trucks they chopped off the cab
to make more room and there again they
when I was there that they would attack
if they needed petrol if they needed
more weapons but there was a ceasefire
which was broken on both sides and
things have only gotten worse as you may
read about soon next slide please these
are ambulance their bits and pieces of
the Quran scorpion tails or go back a
long ways or tribal they protect you now
from being raped or you know killed by
the Janjaweed attacks on the villages I
have to I where as I speak we were
attacked one day and i'll tell you that
later but they're no different than
other ambulance in different cultures
for protection this is kind of extreme
the children were more on their necks
and the camps the women on the inside of
their clothing next slide please these
images have come on some of the
mainstream press as well this is a
village called Anka there's 100 families
that used to live in this village you
can see the circle mud wall is what she
was trying to replicate in the refugee
camp earlier on and there again the
roofs are missing this was completely
bombed out burned out and I think that's
what's really surprised me is the number
of villages that were just absolutely
story to partially destroyed within a
three year system and will play a small
clip of the film soon and you'll see
Samantha power and describe that very
articulately next slide please very
modest life's humble life's they have
little beds cooking this is the inside
perspective next side place there again
as well what they've had so you
basically have taken nothing from
nothing these are civilians they've had
this complete and just thrown upon them
for the last three years and with little
interaction by the communities of the
government's including our own next
slide please as I saw me touring with
the rebels they would come out of these
IDP camps that were controlled by SLA I
should mention the rebels controlled
about eighty percent of Darfur twenty
percent of the government these are bits
and pieces of a bomb that this man shop
was burned and so the evidence is all
around they just don't want you to see
it next slide please this is a woman the
elderly of course could not make it to
the long journey in to chat or the IDP
camps she's describing how her and her
husband were where they were tried to
burn him alive one day and they're in
their Hut there bombed him and how the
attacks would happen is that the
government gunships from Khartoum would
bomb from the sky and then the judge we
would come in and horseback and take her
the rest of the people running out of
the village or burning the village of
course she's breaking down as she's
telling me the story of what happened
next slide please it's a little focus
please I'm sorry the light is going too
bright for slides this is a woman's
Center these women stayed behind they've
been through a lot and now they're just
kind of waiting for the SLA of the
rebels to kind of give them instructions
and what's going to happen next far as
security and where do they go from you
know they're in Darfur and is basically
a kind of a country that's been
extremely broken is no government and
there's a lot of lawlessness now and
this is the first day was it was a two
day meeting actually I was able to
attend next slide please this is an IDP
camp in rebel-held areas the ones in the
government-controlled areas are much
worse I am I couldn't go to those of
course I would be arrested and you can
see the circle is well now made of
sticks it's this family lived in Anka
the burned-out village in it he's ready
to pour me tea as you can see it I'm sat
on the blanket you know there is um I've
never had better hospitality and been
treated so well then in this culture and
not because I was a photographer not
because of the crisis
just who they are as Sudanese people
period in Africa its itself especially
in the West and I'm blamed it as well
guilty of covering the kind of the
tragedy of Africa there is actually more
good by the way then there is bad and if
you ever get the chance of some of you
have been here please visit the
continent it's definitely the best in
the world but it always overwhelms me
that people who have absolutely nothing
in this world they really give the most
this is for sure and this is exactly
what he's doing now next slide please I
tour the hospitals they were still
attacks happening when I was there the
Janjaweed shot this man twice in the leg
you can see is in a lot of pain he's a
farmer he's a civilian he's not a rebel
next slide please this is another man
who was shot in the foot they came back
to kill him but he was managed to escape
a different village a different hospital
next slide please it's like going back
2,000 years I've never been more close
to a culture my life in a sense that you
have to live like these people there's
just nothing out there and you know with
the size of Texas and very little
electricity maybe one percent there is
no light pollution I've never seen the
stars or the moon so bright in my life
then in this region of the world and
just utter silence and we slept outside
every night on carpets and this is above
from here to the wall away one morning I
heard this ruckus and of course it was a
wild herd of camo that was passing in
front of me in the morning light about
five thirty in the morning now when you
see images like this and you're emerged
in this culture so deep you kind of
forget you let your guard down that you
are in a in a civil war you are in a
region of ethnic conflict until you're
definitely reminded of that next slide
please this is the first image I shot
after we were ambushed one day by
government troops in by the Janjaweed
same thing I was very startled tense
young rebel six of our guys were hit we
were very lucky no one was killed next
slide please the next day they brought
me to the medic tent if you want to call
it they're extremely resourceful some
are real doctors some left medicals
go and Khartoum to join the movement I
think the majority of their supplies
were ripped off by the way from the Red
Cross this was a commander I got to know
quite well we was shot through the arm
twice next slide please this is another
rebel and a lot of pain most of his arm
was will probably be amputated next
slide please they're performing surgery
on this man's hand what's left of it
most of it was shot off with ak-47 I
should mention as well he has no
anesthesia nothing next slide and you
get a close-up of it next slide please
the next day he was up sort of up he's
hooked to an IV they commanded to the
left is gentleman here with the
commander movie Dean he was assigned to
me by Sullivan Gemma's his English was
perfect since nine eleven I've only
worked in Arabic speaking countries my
Arabic is a little better but how long
ways to go that's for sure we became
very close him and Suleiman met in 1972
in a factory and you taught me a lot of
Arabic and taught me a lot about
Sudanese culture next slide please going
into Darfur takes about five days I
spent a couple of months down there
leaving Darfur it takes about depends on
where you are it takes about six seven
days and those trucks to come back to
the border of Chad and you have to make
your international flight back to Paris
or something like this so we have to
time it quite well the UN planes for
free of charge this time for filmmakers
journalists because the crisis were on
is edge of the world most of the time
this is not the case as I was leaving
Darfur we met up again with Suleiman
Jomo's to your left this image is one
that was chosen by the Senate for the
capital building which significant about
this he is not wearing a uniform that's
why I knew I could slip it under the
wire in a sense and also I've mailed
this in a DVD of the installation of
these images to his daughter who has
only been in the States for about a year
and a half now and her father's hanging
in the Capitol building you can imagine
what that must feel like I also have
somebody on the ground now shooting some
b roll for me and the Chad Sudan border
she also brought
DVD of the installation of the photos in
the capitol building and she's going to
show that on a laptop to the refugees in
Chad there again the voice has been
heard it's just nothing's been done next
slide please this is my last image i
took in Darfur and I'm sorry in Chad as
I was coming out they quote they could
not drive into the refugee camps with
their gun trucks and so they had a
civilian pick me up these are new
arrivals since I was in Darfur people
had come across the border this is a
family within three days of this image I
was back in Paris having coffee with an
old friend what I'm trying to say is I
never take it for granted in a sense I
can always return i'm here at Google now
which I thank you for having me they
don't of course they're always there and
usually in the same situation as these
images show something you have to put in
perspective next slide please sometimes
I show this sometimes I don't this was
taken by a German photojournalist this
is me with the rebels the first day
silly man is to my right with the white
turban I usually sat in the back of the
truck I was always nervous I'm around a
lot of guns but they never make me feel
comfortable and I prefer to course issue
with an icon that which I told them as
well so in this turn off the slide
projector thank you
we have the DVD set up this is a trailer
in February 2005 members of the hill
wanted to see what I did behind rebel
lines I was on this powerpoint tour if
you want to call it I said okay you
stick everybody in one box up there by
the way and I will come and do the slide
show now the senators and House of
Representatives these people have
absolutely no time it's amazing and so I
knew it was going to be short and I get
to call two days before 17 of july two
thousand five and NPR heard me at a Q&amp;amp;A
one time Sam I'm going to go on
Greyhound bus because I have to pay for
it by the way the Senate is not going to
pay for my trip at that time I said well
if I have to be on this bus for days i
will bring my actual photographs and I
will show them the passengers along the
way and get their reactions and then mpr
with better idea they put me on Amtrak
and this is a short clip is a feature
documentary will be released in 2007
January
in early two thousand three I started to
hear stories of a crisis that was
happening in the Darfur region of Sudan
started by the government of ethnic
cleansing when the conflict first arose
the crisis it was done with my quite a
few in the community as the first
genocide of the 21st century
in 2004 I set out to go too dark for and
spent three months in the region it was
so little coverage of this crisis in the
media still today that you can share
this in the UN knows about it the
politicians know about at the
international community knows about it
but what I've taken is very tragic story
and to sharing it with the common
citizens on the train on an amtrak that
will bring my actual points my
photographs and I will shave them with
passengers along the way and can get
their reactions it's quite humbling you
know only people in America could
actually look at these pictures and not
be so selfish you think you know that
could be
you know what if we were attacked one
day and all of a sudden my home is gone
if you look at a map I mean it's sort of
like clockwork almost the way they
worked across the country the sudanese
going to in conjunction with our militia
on the ground now it's a little bit
different because much of rural Darfur
has already been ethnically cleanse I
mean three million people are more have
already been displaced the farming life
that was the foundation for non arab
tribal groups who were being targeted by
the government has been obliterated you
know so if you don't see quite the same
systematic campaign of destruction in
2006 that you saw in 2003-2004 but again
that's not for good reasons that that's
not because the design has changed by
Sudan it's simply because you know they
have already succeeded in you know
wiping out non-arab life as it
previously existed I called home and my
mom she told me then used that he got
killed and how he got filled he was in
courtroom and he hear about the Yankee
weed and he said okay he I'm gonna go
this year I'm gonna go to see my kids
and my wife we went to Darfur they can
give it came to his belly and the way
they killed him they bought him in front
of his five kids and they blow up his
head so it was very painful and they did
not kill his kids but they killed him in
front of his kids and his wife and it's
sad and it's painful because this person
I know him personally he don't know
politics he don't know anything even he
don't know what's the name of politics
his simple man is just looking for
single life and better life for his kids
and his wife
if there was any other way to not put
myself I should say in the film I would
have done that to share the photographs
and like a one-on-one story I had to be
in front of the camera I should say NPR
has sent me the recording equipment in
was a perfect way into the film people
knew and trusted NPR they paid attention
to like the real radio documentary as
they were being filmed the other talking
had experts he saw Samantha power if you
haven't read her book yet problem from
hell the American age of genocide i
recommend it she's now the foreign
affairs advisor to solve for barack
obama we have John Pendergrass in the
film he was a top aide for Africa an
administration barbara Lee is well of
maxine waters and hopefully a resident
president bill clinton speaking of his
remorse this is the consequences if you
don't act in his 10 year course in the
balkans in rwanda of course at this time
I'm open for any questions yes related
22 black and white and why is there so
much paperwork in the refugee camps
paperwork your food stand
well the first question is um I prefer
film of black and white I think it's
less sensational it's a stronger medium
it's what I I never studied photography
I should stay I came from experimental
film making you know some of them
Sebastian Salgado if you know his work
the great Brazilian photographer is
probably the best in the world today and
definitely the highest paid for what he
does in the world today and he still
uses film and always will there's no the
documentary photographer versus a
photojournalist we don't have deadlines
will mean me I've SAT five hours under
trees in Sudan I prefer that but if
you're working you know for the LA Times
or Time magazine you but I believe
there's some guy behind a desk in a
skyscraper yelling at you from his
satellite phone to tell you to get these
images in so one I have too many bad
habits I could never put up with that
and two I prefer working the way I do so
the second question on the paperwork
there again these regions in the world
they're very poor the neighboring
countries of course are poor they want
to make sure that the aid gets to the
proper refugees in this it's it's a beer
um you know it's no different than the
federal government the UN's one large
bureaucrat for sure any other questions
yes
particularly
seems to be kind of a split where
neither side or multiple sides for those
factions really care as witnesses around
wonder if you could kind of give some
additional
what you what you learn is it's never of
course black or white and even all the
research you may do before you enter
these places it's always gray and your
opinions would change and things change
on the ground and when you come out of a
place like this your opinions will also
change what you have to understand is
Iraq was different i was embedded with
the Marines during the invasion and i
had to go back when they actually called
Saddam and I guess it was december 2003
i was shooting for a book i should
mention i wasn't them it was one of the
few embedded people that was not a
journalist they're actually when we
first arrived they actually wanted you
there of course that's changed in Darfur
as well I think the civilians always
want you there they this is a very small
voice a very small light in this part of
the world it has absolutely nothing you
are that link to their tragedy and they
want to tell their story they don't care
if it's the new york times or it's
someone like me they want their voice to
be heard so you're always that
connection and you always get a lot of
respect and from that as well from these
people so yes
what were your Driving's from for that
like when you're sitting in the van like
in the desert for 10 hours waiting for
something to happen like
what keeps you going where is your
motivation come from an
yeah the well they label the war effort
I've done this for many years as Jeff
read and I tried to stay under the wire
and continue to make films under my bed
South of Market and small at a warehouse
I've been living in unfortunately they
have come to me I've never had this much
attention in with my work before and I
don't really feel comfortable by the way
there is a line between awareness and
you know exploitation with this kind of
work for me all my work gets funded but
there's no check at the end and I try
not to sell my images if I can help it I
work other ways to make a living in a
sense with photography and filmmaking
but this was something I think it's
sometimes it chooses you I see a lot of
people now doing it for the wrong
reasons that's for sure there was about
600 embedded in Iraq and about 2,000 on
the sidelines if it were between weather
and Jordan or quite waiting to go in
after Baghdad fell and I think if you go
in it for the excitement part of it and
then redlin which is definitely there
and you know you witness history from
the front lines sometimes too close you
will burn out either physically or you
know psychologically so you better have
a really good reason and be committed
because this step doesn't leave you as
you can see and it goes with you every
part of your life so yes Emily's our
fathers you were recovered this book to
do a good question I was going to get
that with them handouts of you may have
know that our government the US
government has called this a genocide
some people have called it crimes
against humanity like the UN I was
saying this is a lunch you know the the
United Nations after Auschwitz the 48
mandate never again they've never
enacted that by the way the UN has never
called a genocide a genocide if they use
that word they really have to act they
play semantics like they did in Wanda
and the Balkans you can say that about
Cambodia East Timor it goes on and on
and on so a for me I have little faith
in them by the way in some ways
to really act on this and then you have
to look at who's on the Security Council
it's a lot of politics you need to call
your local editors newspapers media to
have them cover this I mean if an
unknown photographer filmmaker you know
from South of Market in San Francisco I
should say by the way with a total
budget of twenty four hundred dollars
that included airfare from San Francisco
to Chad can do this there's no reason
why these other companies can't cover
this also the local representative
Senate's get this pushed on Capitol Hill
that there's a couple bills the dark for
action bills that have been passed or
locally senator sam Brownback is working
on it from Kansas he had me on the hill
to speak and Senator Barack Obama
barbara Lee has been there maxine waters
has been there and Nancy Pelosi has been
there and Condoleezza Rice as well as
been there and was roughed up her people
which was the best thing that could have
happened to her I thought in khartoum
they could do this to high officials in
the White House what are they doing to
their own people in Darfur so go online
Save Darfur org punch Darfur into well
google it comes up quite a bit how to
get involved there's deer Sudan
campaigns but then again contact your
politicians in the media into thin in
the film and see the feature length of
the film we purchased 26 minutes ABC NBC
CBS combined in the year of 2004 the
height of the the crisis gave only 26
minutes in 12 months to this broke down
to 11 minutes five minutes in order of
three minutes and we show this as well
in time-lapse they gave 10 hours to the
Michael Jackson trial and you know on
and on and on so you know yes
is that my second question is
what what we do the return
those are two very good questions yeah
it has changed more of a proxy war now
where you have the central government of
Sudan Khartoum backing the Arab militia
Janjaweed and now you have openly Chad
supporting the SLA since of last year
there's been some border skirmishes at
one relatively safe sanctuary in the
east border of Chad un camps now that's
been taken away the Janjaweed have gone
across and they have tried to murder
what there was a left murder and are
four of the refugees the second question
is what can they rebuild is you here
Samantha power in the film she'll tell
you this is not one stop shop in a sense
for genocide is going to take decades to
bring this culture back just a
psychological trauma the women have gone
through from you know publicly being
raped multiple raped the children went
is seen there are family members
murdered in front of them so and if you
saw from the countryside there's nothing
to go back to the water wells or poison
their homes are destroyed it's going to
take a lot of work I said they need
somebody to real lead maybe President
Clinton the Clinton Foundation or
something like this some people get
involved in microcredit to help these
people in the beginning but first and
foremost you need security for the
people in Darfur and secondly you can
sort out the protocol situation with the
rebels in the government but you need
security medical aid and food as of
today so yes
relationships and all varies
this area and the dominating I get out
of the sensors confusion about what do
you think that there is a sense of
clarity and big sort of the high levels
of our governments just a lot she will
however many people not really add
clarity about what we might well I think
there again I think a lot of governments
around the world need to ask themselves
do they have the resources and the
logistics to help this situation and in
five years time from this day it'll
probably be a lot worse the numbers then
Rwanda and they can ask themselves that
question again it's not too broken that
it can't be fixed it is extremely
complex you have John Prendergast was
just done 60 minutes two weeks ago you
may have saw that he stated right out
that it's in one hand that you know the
White House is calling a genocide on the
other hand they're flying in some of the
main perpetrators of this into DC to get
information on the war on terror you
have to understand that osama bin laden
in bin laden and the al-qaeda lived
there from 92 to 96 now they were
foreigners and you better believe that
the Sudanese government kept an eye on
i'm outside of Khartoum also you
remember President Clinton sent to
cruise missiles of 98 to bomb what was
supposed to be a weapons manufacturing
plant it turned out to be a
pharmaceutical company and if you think
about it you know I was there during the
elections in 2004 with the carrion bush
and of course I'm a little transistor
radio and of course my politics it
didn't go my way but if you look at it
the SLA share the same common enemy with
Washington and that is the Khartoum
government they've always been on the
list of terror there's sanctions they
never really had good relations but now
they're sleeping with it to get
information about what bin Laden did for
those five six years and so that's you
know resource they can give up and then
at the other end you have China and
Russia the set of the Security Council
they have economic interest in the Sudan
China more so with petrol oil Russia
cells all the weapons to the government
some more military ties and as you know
China is rising in the world
economically and they need fuel they're
going to do it with
cheap feel just like we did it was cheap
feel that's no other way yes yes it is
it getting worse yeah there was recently
a man who was just a Pulitzer
prize-winning journalist who had just
arrested I think it was kind of was kind
of not well planned in my opinion the
way he did it for his experience they
turn you over the government I spoke to
a spy one time they got quite upset um I
when I was in DC last to hang the photos
in the an April thirtieth this year I
was with Brenda grass and others and
they told me that I was I'm officially
on the list of state of the enemy of
Sudan since my touring of two years so
they're welcome to come down to South of
Market by the way if they wish there's
no way I could I had actually last week
I was supposed to be on a plane to Chad
and I canceled because I'm too involved
to finish my film but I will be going
back soon I could never go back with
that government that's for sure they
would be arrested at them at the airport
Scooby's gonna think without getting
persecuted
that's a good question as well it's kind
of out the topic but yes there's more
journalists being killed today than ever
before back in World War two and there
Robert Capa era or Vietnam if you got
too close to the action you or step a
landline you would be killed now you're
in their sights this has been something
happening for the last 20 years which is
very dangerous to work it's another
question was
attention
you know
we do doodles on the homepage
and Robinson up on a tree and she like
this
do you think is whether we do
that could sort of bring attention to
the issue
such as an appropriate
I yeah I think I mean this is my first
time here and I want to thank you again
if I having me I'm really impressed with
this building and the lunch was great
and this is a nice so you know and I it
was free as well I hadn't expected but
having said that you have a lot of very
obviously a lot of very bright and in a
bit of people that have been here since
the beginning and they could perhaps
focus a little bit that energy and what
you're talking about I think I know my
space is one of the sponsors for Darfur
gar for exhibition and part of six
photographers that were traveling to
2040 of museums and galleries we opened
in New York their digital projections
next week we're doing the US holocaust
museum in DC which these images will be
projected on the outside of the building
but myspace is one of those corporate
sponsors they've ran PSAs on their site
with our images you could do that I'd be
more than happy to give these to free of
charge of course or just even a link to
10 steps how to get involved you know
who is how to write your senator how to
write the White House how to send aid I
should mention Doctors Without Borders
if you want to give money they are by
far the best NGO I have a lot of
problems of NGOs in the world but this
one is definitely the real thing so yes
okay some go back further in the late
80s but basically in more recently and
in kind of a paraphrase version is there
was a small rebel movement started in
February of 2003 in the Darfur region
there again they wanted to demand their
rights be counted as suiting citizens
the government had practiced squashing
these rebellions they did in the South
for 20-some years and so they went and
they attacked right away and try to take
the wheel from the people in a sense of
course the SLA got will very organized
and very powerful and then at first they
unleash the Janjaweed to do their work
because some of the members in the
Khartoum government military were from
this region then that course is not
going to kill their own tribal people so
the Janjaweed the Unleashed which is
very hard to rein back in if even
possible now and so that's pretty much
how it started and then the ethnic
cleansing started on top of that so you
have a civil war on top of a genocide if
you were and then what the UN called in
2004 is one of the worst humanitarian
crisis in the world is still continuing
so you know this is the first time it's
a genocides mancala genocide as is
happening and it's the first time that
these student groups have organized to
the fact since that has been seen since
apartheid in South Africa and just that
there's a movement allow around this is
even though small it's it's something to
look at so yes put your images anywhere
in front of anyone who would that be
would that be the Senate would that be
my space
but that's a regular question as well
because it's one of the kind of the
themes of the film what had more impact
showing these images to this to common
people on the train or to the Congress
definitely the people in the train you
just we had three people break down in
tears one they don't see this kind of
work especially by someone who's done
that in detail two of they have seen
this work it's in Time magazine they
turn the page and you know there's a BWW
address something like this so I really
brought in a kind of a personal
perspective I told the people there for
that I would get this work to the
highest level I did not expect to speak
to Congress or you would have my images
selected to be hung in Congress so it's
good when you talk to groups like this
and others but I spoke to the people
that actually have the phone to do
something if they can't do something
that you know then we have to look at
other alternatives so so one more
question or anybody in the back if we
give to savers are going to go how much
actually gets refugees that's always a
good questions well I'm not feeling
which yes okay if you give money to one
of these student groups let's say save
darfur org what percentage of the money
goes to the refugees in Darfur that's a
good question these groups have hosted
me throughout the country the last two
years whether it's at universities or
other groups the genocide intervention
network raised $250,000 these students
and they are asking me should we send it
to the African Union which is small
force definitely not there again the
World Food Program i think is is a is a
good start you could write you should
send the email to save darfur over there
based in DC they're the ones who had the
big rally April thirtieth in on the
public square and also met with
President Bush before this happened you
can ask them they probably have a
spreadsheet for you to send so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
