professor sinister Sturbridge from the
university of zagreb and his group who
are today with us and giving the Gepetto
talk you may have read about this joint
consumer approach to programming from
the talk abstract we will have a nice
demo today so you know like the talk is
a bit on the long each side I'm going to
shorten my introduction and let them
take the podium now so please welcome
them to Google thank you and I will be
giving short introduction to this
presentation that will explain the
motivation for our research and later on
here with me are Marlene Miro and Clem
oh and all of us are coming from
university of zagreb and since south
part of europe and we are from school of
Electrical Engineering and computing the
research that will be present today is
supported by our creation Ministry of
Science and as well for Google research
award program through these two projects
here I want to especially thank to our
ministry of science that support this 10
brilliant young researches these are one
of the best students in our school and
give me a chance to be their supervisor
and help them through their PhD program
so let me at the beginning explain what
motive a motive 8us you know to do this
research and later on claim and and
Marlon will more deeply explain the
results of our work as we know the
number of job openings in application
development exceeds the number of
professional programmers and although
the number of graduates in computer
science increase is increasing worldwide
it is not enough to satisfy the
needs of Industry and what the future
brings think about all of these
sophisticated devices that need to be
customized and future application that
needs to be personalized and imagination
will be the only limit for your
consumers to personalize and customize
their devices and applications
this opens the question who will develop
all of these applications do we need do
we have enough professional programmers
nowadays no and even in future we'll be
worse you know think about all of you
know these applications which will be
dynamic in nature and probably will
happen that for all this application we
will need to one professional programmer
for each consumer so this open you know
the question how can be this done the
only way how can be this done is that
each consumer you know starts doing and
programming their urban application so
can we do it or what is now this
happening is that consumers are educated
and educated through formal schooling
system that's a one-way how couldn't be
this be done another way is that we
should you know provide them appropriate
tool which are appropriate for their
knowledge skill and habits and what is
our point here in this presentation is
that the average consumer
the tablished consumer knowledge and and
state of the art of Technology reach the
point where it's possible to develop
tool which is appropriate and which
consumers can use it okay so in next
slides I will explain very shortly where
the consumers stance with respect to the
technology as we know that consumer
knowledge and skills is increasing
nowadays and this is not only because
there are you know
educated through formal school system
but there are informal educated by
exchanging the experience with other
consumers and at the same time the
complexity of programming is decreasing
because of higher level abstractions
that enables rapid application
development as we know that introduction
of graphical user interfaces in
operating systems led to a widespread
use of personal personal personal
computers actually PC's becomes consumer
electronics but on another side although
now the scripting language is seems to
be the programming languages of 21st
centuries and we can agree that they are
much easier to use then system languages
but they are not still you know simple
enough to be used by come by consumers
what we see as solutions is software
gadgets as we know that software gadgets
become more popular each and every day
and since consumers are familiar with
the software gadgets we have an idea to
use this software gadget as a basic
semantics intuitively blocks for
application development and with this in
the mind with the design
Gepetto a consumer programming tool
so since the consumer approach to
programming should not be different that
then using any other device they use or
application nowadays which means that in
other words it should require minimal
training and based on it should be based
on trial and error experimentation and
yeah and to feel fulfilled these
expectations consumer expectations we
and to encourage consumers to start
programming we developed this graphical
user level methodology which uses
software gadgets as built basic building
blocks for application development so
through the rest of the presentation
modern and clay mobile press will
present or explain what will be the
basic programming elements based on
which you know the application will be
developed how the programming process
for consumers will look like and in the
end they will show how the consumers
will develop applications since all of
us are programmers then we will compare
that programming process consumer
programming process with a classical
programming process and we will show how
instead of building applications out of
objects the consumers will build
applications out of out of software
gadget software gadgets Martin please
continue the presentation ok thanks
professor hi everyone my name is Mary in
the next few slides we will describe
programming elements that are used in
Geppetto and we will compare those
programming elements with programming
governments in general purpose languages
in order to show that Geppetto is
equally powerful as any other
programming tool so while
general-purpose languages use objects as
basic building components
applications are built out of objects in
Geppetto we used software gadgets as
basic building blocks so those objects
in general-purpose languages they
provide methods for example object code
has a method yet next code on the other
hand on the gadget methods are presented
with the action elements on the gadget
furthermore method invocation it's it's
equal to to button click on the gadget
those methods in general-purpose
languages they have input and output
parameters for example method to get
next quote has a parameter outer on the
other hand on the gadget there's an
input area that's used for entering
daughter's name so we can say that input
output parameters on the API level are
equal to input and output elements on
the gadget in addition passing those
parameters when the meter is invoked
it's equal to filling out the input
elements on the gadget well in
general-purpose languages those objects
they have to communicate sometimes with
each other by calling methods and
exchanging data through variables in
this simple example we get the quote
from one object and then we pass that
quotes to another object that data
exchange on the gooey level is done by
selecting text on one gadget clapping
text from that gadget and paste text to
another gadget so we can say that data
exchange between objects on the API
level it's equal to copy/paste action on
the gooey level to summarize we compare
all the basic elements
in general-purpose languages with those
in Geppetto and we can see that all of
those that can be found in
general-purpose languages are also
present in Geppetto and that makes it
equally powerful for application
composing in the net in the second part
of representation we will show the
programming process in Geppetto in order
to show how entertaining and lightweight
that process is we will compare it with
classic programming process so in
classic programming process these are
like ordinary first steps you do in
order to find the right components and
to compose them into new application so
basically you search for libraries you
carefully examine the api's and then you
just shape complex process in consumer
programming in our tool Geppetto
consumer needs to find the appropriate
gadgets and to perform glue level
actions in order to create new
application in this example consumer is
using two independent gadgets driving
directions gadget and weather gadget and
he's creating an application that will
provide driving direction from source to
destination and weather forecast at the
destination point and now we go back to
classic programming process so once the
application has been designed the next
step includes process of coding and once
you've done with that you probably get
something like this do you understand
the code is logic the programmer needs
to be familiar with both syntax and
semantics of the given programming
language and sometimes it takes for a
while to understand the behavior so
instead writing statements of code in
consumer programming consumer is using
Geppetto context-sensitive menu to
define GUI level actions in the
beginning consumer is selecting the
button that we start the execution so I
want my program my application to be
executed when this button GU is click so
that that's the reason why I choose when
clicked I use that same menu to define
all the other actions for example type
Los Angeles and also actions type type
all right so we wanted to our
presentation to be entertaining and fun
so we have a little demo my colleague
glamour will show how this process
actually looks like in our tool and then
we will keep on with the presentation so
please clear okay thank you marine hello
everybody my name is Clem oh and I will
share a couple of demos during this
presentation so first I will switch from
PowerPoint to web browser and now you
live in iGoogle your own familiar with I
Google Google's gadget container page so
to start with demo first I will select
the button that will start in the
application execution and now I will add
the rest of actions that constitute
consumer application so first action
will type in source location
okay second action will type in
destination location let's say for mine
and third action will trigger map
rendering on driving directions gadget
so all our directions are needed to get
weather information at destination so
we'll enter settings we'll type in the
same destination or location and start
searching okay now we're done with this
little application when I click go we
see the Gepetto execute our application
driving directions are displayed from
source to destination and weather is
displayed for destination arrive so
marine will continue with presentation
now show how much I searched okay thanks
once again we go back to classic
programming process so once the code is
written the next step includes analyzing
structure of the hood and correcting the
behavior before the code is saved into
the text file so what we want to say
here is that programmer needs to use
text editor for program representation
and editing and if he wants to make any
changes in the code he needs to
manipulate with files on the other hand
while consumer is using Geppetto menu to
define Google elections those actions
are recorded and stored into a list so
when I define the action that will type
our wine a new action is created and its
stall ready at the end of the list those
actions they can be stored from top to
bottom in this case time goes from top
to bottom and the action that types Los
Angeles its above the action the types
Irvine in this means that it needs to be
executed before the error approach would
be to store those actions one just right
after another in this case time goes
from left to right and the action the
types Los Angeles is left to the action
the types Irvine and this means mean
that it needs to be executed before so
keeping this in mind we can place those
actions in a two dimensional grid and
what we get its consumer representation
program consumer program representation
in Gepetto and we would like to
emphasize that all those diamonds are
kept so all the consumer programming by
using Gepetto menu providers produces
only single sequence sequence of actions
our tool enables consumers to rearrange
those actions in any possible form
within the grid simple relation of time
proceedings just described enables
consumers to create diverse forms which
can define even sophisticated order of
execution in this example the presented
form synchronizes the first stream of
actions those three with other two
streams that are executed in parallel
which all of you as experienced
programmers she recognizes for
programming structures so this is an
important moment and we would like to
point out Gepetto provides consumers not
just ability to program but also ability
to create parallel programs now we have
a demo gained claim we will show how
consumer program representation and
parallel programming works in Geppetto
please okay again I will switch to the
web browser so editor button when your
fighter Gator takes us to Geppetto
program editor you'll wait for editor to
load okay
I'll select Geppetto program I resize
this a little okay so this is Geppetto
program for our previous demo in current
version of our tool we will simplify
textual representation for GUI actions
so all actions here are initially
executed sequentially but as Marie has
shown they can be reorganizing grid so
for instance I will move actions for
weather gadget in column two and in
column three just as in presentation I
will do the same with this one okay now
when I click close Geppetto reloads with
new program and when I click go we see
the Geppetto execute this program a
little bit faster because we introduced
parallel actions in program ok
Marian will continue with presentation
and the final step wants in classic
programming once once you remove all the
bugs and once the code is compiled the
new logic the new application needs to
be deployed somewhere on an appropriate
place so everyone can use its
functionalities on the other hand in
Geppetto a new application is
encapsulated into into new gadget to use
that gadget consumer needs to define
user interface for that gadget to
simplify the whole process consumer is
reusing the elements that are present
present and available on the gadgets
that are used as basic components and
clamo we will show how that process
works on the fly in Geppetto found new
gadget is creep how simply new gadget is
created please okay thank you marine so
now I will demonstrate the entire
process of creating a new gadget in six
simple steps presented on a slide so in
first step we will create the user
interface for our gadget in second step
we will define the start button is the
button that will start the application
tree we will map user defined input from
Geppetto gadget to all other gadgets we
are using in fourth step we will define
the application logic in fifth step we
will take those outputs from gadgets you
are using back to Geppetto gadget and
finally step six we can try that
application so again let's go to Google
so we have driving directions gadget and
world weather gadget so in first step we
will create user interface I will take
those two locations so I select add and
these text boxes appear on Geppetto
gadget I will also take this button and
in step 2
I will select this button as a start
button and now we can create our
application first we will take user
defined inputs from Geppetto gadget to
driving directions gadgets will do the
same with destination okay
for world ready gadget first will enter
settings and will take the same
destination location here okay now we're
done with input mapping so in step four
we will define the application logic in
this demo this is simple we just have to
trigger map rendering and start
searching on world weather gadget since
all output elements are on driving
directions gadget and world weather
gadget we will skip step five for now
that involves output mapping and we can
try this application will enter same
destination and when I click go Geppetto
executes our newly created program but
that program is now encapsulated into
this gadget okay I'll go back to
presentation so now I'll create a little
bit more complex application in Geppetto
in this demo we will create an
application for browsing popular books
divided into different categories but
book details will be displayed with
localized content our application will
have a book category target language and
target currency as inputs and book cover
book title box syllabus in target
language and book price in target
currency as outputs book browser
application can be built using three
objects bestseller subjects for finding
popular books in selected category and
since we want book details displayed for
non-us customers we need translate
object for text translation and currency
converter object this is how our
application my books might look like
first we select category on bestsellers
gadget in which books will be retrieved
and best gadgets batterers gadget
returns titles covers syllabuses and
prices next we send syllabus along with
source language and target language to
translate object and translate object
translates book syllabus key to target
language and returns each two are my
books application finally we will do the
same with price we invoke convert method
of currency converter object we send
price with source currency a target
currency and currency
narator converts boot price from source
currency to target currency okay and
this is something you'll recognize you
have to actually write code to implement
this kind of an application and now
let's build similar application with
Geppetto I'll switch the web browser
select different tab so milling an
application in Geppetto is simple as
creating a new gadget you just have to
follow the previously defined six steps
for this demo we prepared best sellers
gadget with popular books google
translate gadget for text translation
and simple currency converter so in
first step we will create user interface
for our new application for inputs we
need a book category we'll take this
button we need target language and
target currency for outputs we will take
book title book cover we'll take this
book price and here we have book
syllabus object okay so now we are done
with templating our user interface for
application so in second step I will
select the button that will start the
application execution and in third step
I will map user-defined inputs from
Gepetto gadgets to all other gadgets you
are using so we'll select category on
bestsellers gadget we'll select target
language on Google Translate gadget and
we'll select target currency on simple
currency converter gadget okay in step
four I will define the application logic
for this demo so first we will read our
new books in new category and next we
will take this syllabus originally
displayed in English to Google Translate
gadget and will translate it here to
already selected target language we'll
do the same with price we select price
and to currency converter and we'll
convert it to already selected target
currency so now we are done with our
application logic and in step 5 we will
take new outputs from these gadgets we
are using back to the protagonist
so we need new book title we also need
new book cover
we'll take now converted book price from
here to here and we'll take the
translated syllabus from Google
Translate gadget to our Geppetto gadget
so now we're done with our application
we can try it I will select a category I
will select target language and target
currency and when I click go we see the
Geppetto executes our application new
book details are displayed here but book
price is displayed in Croatian currency
Kuna and vogue syllabus is translated to
Croatian language so we're done with our
demo now I will invite professor to
conclude this presentation to conclude
this presentation let me stress out the
basic characteristic of our Gepetto tool
it implements trial and error consumer
approach to programming it uses gadgets
as consumer semantics into two building
blocks it provides graphical user level
programming techniques it it uses
graphical programming actions
independent of gadget semantics and we
introduced to the to two dimensional
time grid for programming representation
and editing and at the end it it
encapsulated the consumer program into
the new gadget what you are doing
nowadays is that we want to you know
that representation in two-dimensional
grid table we want to be visualized we
are working on a set of gadgets that
will be used for common functions you
know during application development some
common gadget which are even needed to
know for very frequently used tasks when
we are doing you know the application we
are working on how to manage instances
of the gadgets which is very important
and then working on some consumer
debugging tool which will enable to
maybe to be this process you know more
friendly and to enable actually you know
to check what's going on this
application during the execution we want
to make it be portable you know on
different kind of browser and gadget
containers and once we will have
building you know possibility to build
gadget out of gadgets which is actually
you know composed from other gadgets
then we will probably run into the
problem of scalability so we are working
on to make that a large to be large
scalable system so at the end you are
all welcome to visit our page and to try
programming with our tool and all you
know comments and any kind of feedback
are welcome thank you for your time and
attention and if you have any question
we will be glad to answer thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
