who's going to talk to us about
expertise which is something that she
has in great quantities herself she's
been a mentor of mine in the social
software world for a long time she's
teaches at the Roslin Institute of
Technology and she's organized the
Microsoft social computing symposia for
the last few years so what I would say
is this this talk is being recorded for
the public so if you're going to ask
questions don't ask Google internal
questions Liz it short and sweet
introduction okay so i have this clicker
here i do work at RIT I teach in the
information technology department the
very first year that I was there I spent
trying to convince my students that I
actually knew something that I was in
fact an expert and not just an authority
and there's someone here who actually
can can provide testimony to whether or
not I was effective at that i wrote a
confessional blog post a year or so ago
saying that i had spent the entire first
year essentially trying to get my
students to believe that this is not the
professor you are looking for and that
that of course i know all of this stuff
and anne frank's like two lovely note on
my blog post saying boy you had me
fooled i thought you knew what you're
talking about so so expertise is a topic
that I'm really very interested in on a
lot of levels on I'm interested in not
just expertise but other topics that are
directly associated with expertise which
includes authority does not the same
thing as expertise and Trust which is
related to both of those things but
again is a separate issue altogether and
this is a talk I have not given before
always a risky thing to do in front of a
new audience I should have taken
something and recycled it that would
have been the smart thing to do but you
know what this is the topic that I think
is so relevant and so interesting
particularly in the space having to do a
search and I'm hoping that I'll get some
feedback from you as I go through this
in terms of your thoughts on some of the
things that feel still like open
questions to me so let me start with
how this talk sort of had its genesis
how many of you have read this book
Andrew keen to the cult of the amateur I
can't bring myself to buy it I've read
the reviews and I've heard him talk and
in fact I heard him talk at the
supernova conference that i was at this
pest was the summer I think it was june
or july and he did a debate with David
Weinberger and I'm not going to play the
video for you you can find this online
it's it's easily accessible but it but
at the end they allowed for some
question and answer and what they're
doing there is there looking at me where
I'm i'm making a somewhat strident
comment they don't actually ever move
the camera to show the people who are
asking the questions but you can hear my
outraged tones at the microphone where
I'm saying to andrew Keen you know how
can you say that we already have all the
authority that we need and that this
explosion of the voices of amateurs is
somehow watering down the quality of
what we already have that that yes of
course you know there's currently vested
authority but it doesn't have a long
history of always being vested in the
right people we have a long history of
voices being shut down of women's voices
of minority voices of you know the those
who are not in power not having a voice
and you know basically what he said to
me is oh that's not true I thought okay
he is so deeply into denial that there's
no way I can even have a conversation
and that's okay but so many people came
up to me afterwards and said thank you
for saying that that I thought well
maybe some of this stuff isn't as
obvious as it feels to me and maybe I
need to expand a little bit on how it is
that increasing the number of people
whose expert voices can be heard doesn't
necessarily water down what's already
out there so you know I want to start
with comparing and contrasting expertise
and authority and I wanted to pull some
examples that were sort of at the far
end of this so
when I put these slides up I'll put them
up on my blog and i'll include the links
to all of the the sites and sources all
of my images are creative commons
licensed images so so all is good on the
left-hand side is a site having to do
with expertise shoelace tying is one of
my great frustrations in life and about
five years ago an old friend of mine
showed me how to tie his shoes in the
way that the nuns at his catholic school
had taught him and they don't ever come
untied and it's amazing and it works but
it's a real pain to do and then i
couldn't remember for a little while how
to do it so i looked around online and
if you search on how to tie shoelaces
you get ian's shoelace site this is an
amazing and remarkable sight this is a
site that has 17 different ways to tie
your shoes color-coded step-by-step
instructions that show you how to go
through he's tested the robustness of
each of these not so he can evaluate
them both on speed and on security how
likely they are to come untied and there
is no question in my mind that ian is
the expert on the topic of shoelace
tying i've never met another person and
I probably never will who has that level
of expertise in a very narrow field
before the internet what I have been
able to have found the person who knew
exactly how to tie a shoe in every way
no you know the chances of my stumbling
across Ian would have been miniscule
okay so ian has expertise but he has no
authority he has no authority vested in
him nobody has said this is the expert
shoe tire right there's no cultural
institution that has vested in him a
title or a sense that he is the
authority his expertise is based on
popular recognition of what he knows and
about people spreading the word that
they found this great site and you
should go look at this great site on the
other side we have a bishop I'm sure he
has a name I didn't look at the name I
just grabbed the picture I have no idea
if he has any expertise in anything
right but he has all kinds of authority
he has cultural authority he is vested
with authority which tells us nothing
about expertise when I taught a class in
basic networking I had authority I was
the professor of the class I was vested
with authority and power power to grade
power to assign all kinds of power but i
did not have expertise okay i gained it
really quickly but i didn't come in with
expertise and so think it's important to
differentiate between the two and it's
something that i think andrew Keen tends
to confuse that that his concerns have
to do with the crumbling of authority
with the authority of institutions like
the mass media like libraries like
universities and seeing this explosion
of expertise makes him think that as a
result authority is being challenged
well authority is being challenged but
it's not necessarily a result of the
explosion of expertise it's very often a
function of the authority itself losing
trust and so all of these topics end up
being really deeply interconnected this
is the most words I think I've ever put
on a slide I hate putting a lot of words
on a slide but I wanted to share two
quotes and these come from a debate that
took place on slate.com between malcolm
gladwell and James Surowiecki Malcolm
Gladwell was talking about some of the
things in his book blink having to do
with how people make judgment and about
some of the problems with expert
judgement and expert assessment and Sura
wiki wrote the wisdom of crowds which is
often cited these days as the defense of
web 2.0 and social software often cited
wrong saying we don't need experts you
know because we can just pull the crowd
and they will know the answer so on you
know sir wiki says first of all I always
assume that in most cases crowds will
include experts as well as amateurs and
he's not saying that we shouldn't have
experts he's saying
at experts alone that the single
individual decision maker model is often
flawed but the important piece in this
for me was in Gladwell's response you
know how many of you have read blink
okay not to me there's there's a there's
a great anecdote or you know example
that he provides in blink where he talks
about symphony orchestras and how for
years and years year you know decades
symphony orchestras had very few women
in them now symphony orchestras had
always used auditions and so the
argument was always these are open
auditions anyone can audition if women
aren't in the orchestra it's simply
because they didn't audition as well and
then there came a point where they
started using screens in auditions for
symphony orchestras where the people
listening could not see who was actually
playing and the number of women playing
in symphony orchestras exploded to an
astonishing level and he tell you know
he drives a much longer much more
convincing case with all of this but his
argument is that even with expert
decision-making often the more detail we
get the harder it is for us to narrow in
and make good assessments and that by in
fact taking away some information from
those decision-makers they made better
decisions you know and this is why he
says here we can put up the equivalent
of screens that's the example he's
working from but the really important
line here look I'm learning how to do
all this cool stuff in PowerPoint it
makes me so happy we can find ways of
editing out non-essential information
this to me is really the critical piece
and when I say expertise is evolving I
really believe what it's evolving too is
the need to better edit out
non-essential information it's no longer
an issue that the expert can find scarce
information on a topic it's now more
important for an expert to be able to
weed out the information that's
relevant that's not appropriate and
there are lots of ways that this happens
there was an article published in
nineteen ninety three Allison want to
say home but that's not right I'll dig
it up but the the name of the article is
the sage on the stage if you search if
you search for that in Google Scholar
you will find the citation to it was
published in college teaching magazine
in 1993 and the it was about the whole
idea of participatory learning of active
learning and about how the role of the
college professor was moving from the
sage on the stage and this is a podium
at an auditorium at RIT looking out at
the audience before a talk is about to
begin to the guide on the side and that
that yes there's still an important role
for the expert but the role for the
expert isn't to be just communicating
that information in a passive delivery
mode the way we're doing right now okay
this is one of the worst ways to
communicate information in most cases as
what we're doing right now but we're so
tied to this model of expertise and
authority okay it's also very efficient
from the standpoint of the presenter as
a professor it's much much easier for me
to get up and give a lecture and leave i
have now transmitted the information to
all of the waiting containers and i'm
done and whereas the guide on the side
the person who has to work with and
coach and encourage and evaluate that's
a lot more work and i do it but it's a
lot more work and so but my in those
cases my expertise has more impact
because i'm making a direct connection
with people all of this for me is
interesting because before I was a
professor I was a librarian my master's
degree and my doctorate are both in
library and information science I worked
at the Library of Congress for several
years I worked for a large publishing
company for several years that catered
primarily to librarians I gave a keynote
talk on Wednesday
at the internet librarian conference and
so I'm very vested in the idea of the
role of librarian tonight you know I got
my library degree my first one a long
time ago you know 1987 in fact which
gives you some sense and the internet
was not exactly the same kind of thing
back in 87 as it is now but i can
remember talking to people then and
they'd say well now that we have all
this information on the computers we're
not really going to need librarians are
we and you know clearly that's not
what's happened hey the library
profession is not going away it's
evolving their role is changing but they
continue to play a role as gatekeepers
and which is how much information do we
want to bring in one of the most
important roles that a librarian plays
the most organizations is what's called
collection development what do we choose
to bring in because if you bring in
everything then it's too much people are
overwhelmed they can't focus in on what
they want it's the the problem with you
know the two broad search in a search
engine that brings in millions of
results and how do you narrow it down to
find what you really want and librarians
is gatekeepers and other roles as
gatekeepers become really important now
whoops that one isms haven't quite got
my skills where I want them to be but
here we go will do this and I'll work
backwards okay so yeah I really don't
want to work backwards I want to just
ignore the one on the right I'll get to
him in a moment you recognize the
Merrick yes so on the left it's a Sherpa
hey a Nepalese Sherpa and if you're
going to climb a mount everest generally
you want a guide to come with you now
why why do we need a guide right we can
look it up online we can probably find a
great guide we can look at videos we can
read books we can probably read
Illustrated how-to manuals but at the
end of the day we feel a whole lot safer
when someone who's done it before is
walking next to us and helping us in
this
next and that's important because it's
not just in that context in the climbing
of a mountain that these human filters
of knowing what information is important
for you to focus on and what can you
discard is important Jenny Levine the
shifted librarian and this is a
librarian trading card I was in the has
in the airport the other day and I was
looking at the pool of photos of
librarian trading cards and someone
looked over my shoulder and said you've
got to be kidding me librarian trading
cards and you know but they're lovely
and you know they're it's a really
interesting group dynamic that's emerged
many people are now creating these Jenny
does an amazing job of sorting through
new and emerging technologies and
communicating them to the library world
and now librarians know how to find
information they could look up stuff on
RSS and they could look up all the kinds
of things that they need to note but in
fact Jenny does a really good job of
letting them know what's relevant and
what's important and they trust her she
has not only expertise but also
authority and trust in this space and
given a choice I would much rather have
Jenny say to me look at these three
things then have to sort through a pile
of hundreds of possible links hey that's
me giving a talk at internet librarian I
still get asked to do keynotes I didn't
say anything in that talk that you
couldn't find online I didn't say
anything in that talk that you couldn't
you know find someone who's already
written and yes I'm wearing a costume
I'm dressed as my World of Warcraft
character that was see you got to be
really careful what you say to people I
was talking with the conference
organizer last year she said I hope it's
okay the talk is on Halloween and I know
you have kids you know what my kids are
11 and 13 they're not really going to be
broken up if I'm not there I said I
should come in costume and then totally
forgot I had said that until two months
before the conference when the program
arrived with a big banner thing in the
printed conference saying come see our
keynote speaker Elizabeth lolly dressed
in costume you won't believe your eyes
so then I had to come up with a costume
you know the things that we do for our
profession so that's my guild Tabard
here which is in fact a crying care bear
took me several hours to make in the
hotel room but I'm quite proud of my my
accomplishment there at any rate they
asked me to come out and talk they pay
to fly me out to Monterey they put me up
in a hotel hundreds of people come to
this conference and pay thousands of
dollars for me to stand up on a stage
and tell them things they could find
themselves let's look at what's in this
room right now you all have busy jobs
you know why are you here now why are
you here listening to me when later on
you could watch a video of it or you
could just read about it on the internet
because I'm sure it will be searchable
soon hey within hours of my giving this
talk someone had written a wonderful
summary and in fact this picture is one
that they took and posted with the
summary so why do we even bother going
to conferences and why do we want to
talk to people I'll tell you one reason
that I go to talks like this is not just
to hear the person talking is to look
around the room and see who else wanted
to see the person talked because that
tells me something about who else is
interested in the topics that I'm
interested in so there's a huge social
component for me to the live performance
to the live interaction Chris Anderson
editor-in-chief of Wired magazine hey he
gets to decide what goes in the magazine
he's a human filter and people still buy
magazines and read them even though
there's all this stuff online is all on
the internet but you know what i like
that wired picked some of this stuff for
me because chris is really smart and he
knows who the really good writers are so
he saves me the work of trying to figure
out that Julian Debelle might be someone
who writes really great stuff on a topic
I'm interested in and he does this for
me and the last one hey so you know I
play World of Warcraft World of Warcraft
is a relatively complex game in terms of
the higher levels and things like what
kinds of gear do you need to collect
huge amount information out there right
there wit
is there are collaborative information
websites there are class specific guides
the people of written saying if you play
this kind of character here all the
things you should do but you know what
I'm just not willing to read all of that
stuff I'm just not because it takes too
much time and I'm just too busy and
sorting through 17 different guides to
what kind of gear a priest should wear
okay is just not high on my priority
list on the other hand I really want the
good gear right but I just don't want to
do all that work to find it so this is
Eric Ellis who I didn't know until I was
looking for a picture of him online last
night is actually the dean of student
services at a community college it's
also a doctoral student at Pepperdine
University and he's also an awesome wow
player who plays in my guilt and who
plays a priest and has for a long time
and Eric said to me I could do a gear
check for you so he went through all of
my gear and compared it to the guides
and figured out exactly what the best
upgrade stuff would be for me and sent
it to me hey that was so much better
than searching for it yeah because it
came from someone I trust it came from
someone who I know plays the game well
it came from someone who took the time
to think about the context in which I
would be playing the game so so these
kinds of human filters continue to be
extremely important and valuable now
there are a whole bunch of tools out
there that that try to leverage the the
kind of trust and value so you know
PageRank is an obvious one right and I
love Ridge my page rank all the time one
of the best ways to leverage it is to
shut people up now that when I'm dealing
with annoying PR people or you know
difficult people at my university and I
say well you know if you just search on
Liz I'll be in the first five results
and it just shuts them up immediately
they're like oh okay yeah don't talk to
me about search engine optimization yeah
so and you know I didn't know I'm on
there not because I used SEO tactics but
because I'm seen by a lot of people as
an expert and so they link to me and so
I have this high page rank and it's a
social filter but it's an implicitly
social filter doesn't say anywhere on it
733 people think liz is an expert in
social software all right it's implied
on some level in the high page rank okay
there are also explicitly social filters
for finding information based on what
other people recommend so library thing
is one of these library thing is a
collaborative book you know what how to
call it it's it's you know you you put
your books into it it allows you to
track your own library of books but it
also allows you to get recommendations
of books one of the things I
particularly love is the unsub euless
you put in a book in there and it tells
you all the books that if you liked that
book you really don't want to read this
book it's a very very funny tool but
it's based on looking at other peoples
book preferences and trying to sort
people into groups of like-minded
readers and this is a very powerful tool
for finding book recommendations okay
this is my homepage this is what I start
my computer up with every single day and
it is probably the single most valuable
resource that I have and this is my
delicious network and my delicious
network for those of you who haven't
delved deep into delicious is a list of
these 22 people whose bookmarks I find
to be consistently valuable and what I
get here is an aggregated list of
everything that they have bookmarked in
delicious in a time you know reverse
chronological order and this is without
a doubt the very best way for me to find
out about the things that I care about
because all of these people are people
that I trust as filters of information
they are my army of information seekers
so much better
than any algorithm that I could create
because it allows me to expand and
contract my my social filter in ways
that are very carefully arranged so
Howard Rheingold Clay Shirky my best
friend and office mate Eloise oyes on on
this list also are several of my
students and former students several
graduate students who are currently
doing research on topics that are near
and dear to my heart and then a couple
of people who I just know always find
the most delightful and interesting
things people whose job it is like
Merlin Mann from 43 folders you know
part of his job is to go out and find
really cool software tools so i don't
have to now i can wait for him to blog
those or i can just have it in my river
of links that comes up on a regular
basis and takes me to what the zeitgeist
is in my social network I don't want to
know what the popular links are i don't
think i've ever used delicious 'as most
popular links page because most of the
world isn't interested in what i'm
interested in and I want my domain of
information filtered based on a very
idiosyncratic set of criteria and that
criteria is for me best expressed
through other people so this idea of
social filters I think is one that that
has been greatly underserved thus far in
many of our search tools the things that
allow us to tap into the minds of the
people we consider to be expert and the
people in whom we vest specific trust
Facebook in some ways provides something
similar which is I'm always interested
to see what applications and what groups
people are adding doesn't necessarily
mean I want to add them but I'm
interested in seeing you know is my
social network starting to aggregate
around a particular topic or a
particular place and as a result you
know is this something
that I might want to be a part of Josh
shouts and Nancy white joined the group
the New Media Consortium that's
interesting to me and it's interesting
to me because it's a very unusual
overlap one that is difficult but not
impossible to find in an algorithmic way
I know Josh and I know Nancy I know they
don't move in the same social circles
and I know that if they both at the same
time joined the same group that
something interesting is happening there
that there's a kind of overlap there
that that isn't generally easy for me to
find but I have to do all this in my
head right one of the things that i
really wish i had was a tool that did a
much better job of looking at clusters
in my social networks and finding the
unusual overlap it's not surprising if
two of my students both join the same
group it's not surprising if two people
that are mobile social software
researchers join the same group it is
interesting if my friend from Nokia and
my friend down the street in Rochester
both joined the same group because how
did that surface for both of them at the
same time and what's going on there
that's interesting enough that it would
cross over those boundaries i think at
this point almost nobody is doing a good
job of looking for those kinds of
unusual overlaps now this is a line i
have yet used over and over again in
talks on mid-1980s i went to a library
conference and one of the speaker's
there was a wonderful wonderful
gentleman by the name of herb white
Eastern European accent very
curmudgeonly fellow in the profession
wrote columns for years and years for
library journal and this was in the
1980s when dialogue was the big way of
doing online searching and in fact
that's how I ended up in library science
as I was working as a secretary while I
tried to figure out what to do with my
life they sent me to training at
dialogue information services because
there was an engineering firm and they
needed to do online database searching
I was so fascinated by the searching in
the boolean logic and the ability to
extract this information and I said what
do you have degrees in and they said
library science I said no what do you
really have degrees in and and they said
library science okay so I went got a
degree in library science and at that
point in time librarians were among the
very few people who could search online
databases who understood how to search
them who could use the really arcane
boolean syntax that was necessary to get
information out of fielded databases
with complex information in them and
they would talk all the time at
conferences about how they wanted to
teach people the joy of searching right
you know we could search for them but
wouldn't it be better if we taught them
to search themselves you know so that
they could experience the joy of
searching and her boy got up there at
one conference and he looked at us and
he said I have no joy of searching I am
joy of finding yeah you know the point
being most people aren't like librarians
I love looking for stuff I love this the
process of trying to find something of
narrowing a search down there there's
all the process of actually doing it is
something I love I am not typical and
the problem is too often the people who
designed search systems love search hey
they think search is cool they love that
feeling of putting in just one more
modifier to the search query and poof
exactly what they want turns up but most
people don't want to do that they don't
have joy of searching they just want the
stuff they need when they want it and
the more time they have to spend
learning how to search the less
productive they're searching becomes so
this is yeah I want to tell you a story
okay because I was thinking about this
last night when I was trying to come up
with some examples of how social
networks influence our search behavior
and how trust and expertise and
authority and knowledge are all sort of
vested in different ways I hope my
family doesn't kill me because
that's my stepdaughter in the middle and
that's my son on the bottom right but
those are their myspace profile pictures
so I figure if they're willing to put
them on myspace they can't really give
me a hard time about showing them here
so in the middle is my stepdaughter
Aaron delightful delightful young woman
who lives with us right now and in the
top left corner is one of her very best
friends that's a picture taken right
after the best friend's husband had been
killed in Iraq which happened in March
you know that and during that time erin
was wonderfully helpful to her friend
and a few weeks ago it was aaron's
birthday and heather up in the top left
corner wanted to give Aaron a gift
certificate to a spa we can go online
and you can search for spas but heather
was a little worried because you know
she could look at the spa and a spa
might look like it was a nice place but
she said I don't know if it's in a good
part of town I don't know if they've got
a nice website but really the place is
scummy you know I need some way I don't
want Aaron to know that I'm getting her
a spa gift certificate but I need some
way to vet the location of the spa is it
an okay place for her to go so she looks
at aaron's myspace network and she finds
my son Aaron step brother who's 13 now
13 year old boys are not typically
experts in spa services right but she
figured that she could at least find out
from him if it was the right part of
town so she emails my son she says if
you tell anybody I'll kill you yeah but
I need to know here's a list of spas
that I found online is you know are any
of these they look like they be in a
good place and my son who has zero joy
in searching says yeah whatever they
look fine and so you know here's the
process that that they went through
which is she said you know I'm looking
for a good spa for a gift certificate
for Aaron and he clicked on this first
one cuz I actually asked him to walk me
through this process I was interested to
see how a 13 year old answers the
question
where do I get a good spa gift
certificate so he pulls this up
Rochester spas that's pretty
straightforward search he clicks on the
first one on which I don't have a
screenshot for here but when he clicks
on that first one there's no list of
spots it's like how to pick a spa blah
blah blah is like that's no good he
backs up he goes to the next one in the
next one is in fact a list of spas and
the first one that's in big letters says
bonsignore studio in spa he looks at
that he says penfield road we know
somebody who lives there that's a good
place and he tells her go to that one
day that's the entire extent of the of
the research that he was willing to do
because he has no joy of searching right
he has joy of finding he just wants to
find it he wants this woman to leave him
alone she scared him now and I'll tell
you he pulled it off beautifully because
the day she got the gift certificate
from from bonsignore which turned out to
be a very nice place she calls him in
and she says you're in trouble Lane he's
why you know she said I know what you
did you've been talking to Heather
haven't you and he said no why would you
say that and I couldn't believe that he
managed to maintain that until the point
that she said you know what I already
talked to her and she told me he said
well she told me not to say anything
said it boy you're good that's a little
scary to know that your kid can like
white that clearly you know luckily we
you know got a pretty good relationship
with him anyways that's this all comes
back to the she didn't want to read
reviews she wanted to talk to someone
that she trusted that she personally
trusted to assess and she would rather
ask a thirteen-year-old boy is this a
good spa than to read a review or to you
know any of the other tools that were at
her disposal because she trusted him she
trusted him to have a personal knowledge
a contextual knowledge of the
environment that that particular
question was based in and I think that's
really important that's not going to go
away no matter how good our search
engines are we still want to know
Oh what the people we know and trust
think and this is where you know I find
myself in in this topic still working on
trying to pull the threads together yeah
I know this is important I've been
thinking about social search for a long
time I've been thinking about the
concept of how we leverage the people
that we know when we trust I love what
delicious does for me in terms of being
able to see how the people I trust as
experts in their domain not necessarily
authoritative sources and but experts
nonetheless how they find information
and what they find but I haven't found a
good way yet to make this accessible for
other people I want it to be as easy for
somebody like Heather to get a
recommendation from somebody that she
trusts about a spot in Rochester as it
is for me to find information about good
spas except I'm willing to put in all
this time and energy and search and ask
questions and all of these things most
people aren't I get my hair cut in
Rochester at a place I found through my
blog and the way I found it through my
blog as I posted a note on my blog that
said I have thin fine hair I need to
find somebody that will cut my hair for
a reasonable price can anybody make a
suggestion and I got about 15 responses
on my blog but one of them was from a
woman in Maryland I a professor in
Maryland who's married to a professor
that I know through my blog who got her
graduate degree in Rochester and she
said I have hair just like yours here's
the person you should go see tell her I
sent you and I went and I've been going
back for three years because she does a
great job but the kind of recommendation
I was looking for I couldn't have found
online I wanted somebody who I knew was
enough like me who I had enough of a
level of trust in because there was some
connection to say I liked this person
and I think you will like them too okay
it's not the same as reading reviews
it's there's a difference between
aggregated information which is valuable
and important and individual
recommendations from someone you trust a
given a choice if you needed to find a
really nice restaurant to go to for
dinner tonight would you be more likely
to trust the person that you know who
says you know I had dinner the other
night at this place and it was so great
you should really try this or would you
be more willing to trust the restaurant
guide with the star reviews with you
know 150 reviews you know personally I'd
rather ask a friend okay not because I
don't think those star reviews are
valuable and I use them all the time
okay but because given a choice I'd
rather have the personal recommendation
I'd rather have the personal connection
with the person and I don't think that
that is a unique experience and I think
the the story I told you about the
search for the spa is an indication of
that that in general we'd rather talk to
somebody hear from somebody get a
recommendation from somebody that we
know when we trust who we believe to be
expert in that particular area
regardless of whether they have larger
Authority associated with them and I you
know there's a lot of mental work for me
left to go in this whole teasing out of
trust and authority and expertise and
recommendations all of which I think are
really closely tied together but the one
thing that I would you know that I would
really implore you to do is to not strip
out voice to not strip out personal
voice in the kinds of recommendations
and tools that we provide to people one
of the reasons that blogs have not been
replaced by wiki's now despite the
attempt of many people to do exactly
that all wiki would be much better is
that blogs prioritized voice and wiki's
strip out voice by intent and the idea
is that a wiki is a collective voice
it's a collaborative
it's more authoritative because it
brings information from a variety of
sources blogs are biased their
individual their anecdotal but they have
a voice and the voice gives them weight
and the the sense of an identity behind
it and it doesn't it can be a
pseudonymous identity it doesn't have to
be a real person but it has to be a real
sense of a voice and I think we need to
hold on to that sense of voice that
sense of personal trust and recognition
and find ways to leverage that in our
tools when I do a search for medical
information I want to know what my
doctor thinks is good not just what the
internet thinks is good and I want both
hey I want ways to build in the
expertise of my social network into the
tools that I look at on an everyday
basis and on that note I am done trying
to be the sage on the stage and I'm
happy I don't know how we were doing in
terms of time Kevin with all right so
there's plenty of time for questions and
discussion dan one of the framework some
poppies authority
and this this sort of discussion at the
end about the personal blog boys versus
the collective allowed me you know you
know you know
is interesting because what are the
things that happens in all library
situations and how do you judge
authority that is judge the how much I'm
willing to trust this complete decision
or choice it's free
that's expertise right that's the kind
of personal expertise that you develop
and what are the challenges I always
have when i'm teaching internet speeds
is how to teach that f king so what do
you say I mean you just given this the
blog chris is picking distinction and
team versus an expert decision how do
you teach that relatively advanced
skills since many ways passing
one of the things that I teach my
students is to always look for the
source because that does come back to
voice right who is this from don't just
look at what it is but look at where
does it come from and what do you know
about the source that it comes from and
that's something that they often so even
something as simple as you know
stripping back on a URL to see you know
what else is in that domain sim you know
to sort of say where does this live who
owns it you know what sense of you know
and I know Kevin hosted a talk on
Providence you know what's the
provenance of this information and i
asked them to to pay close attention to
that that's the the most important thing
that I can do the other thing I do is I
tell them that they don't necessarily
need to be one to make the assessment
that they can also learn to ask right
that that if they're not sure the best
thing to do is to say to me can I use
this as a source in my paper and I'll
tell them yes you can or no that's
really inappropriate but I don't
necessarily think this comes back to the
joy of searching versus joy of finding
most people don't want to become experts
in how to search and how to evaluate
they want someone to make it easy for
them they want my students want me not
to say go out and find a good HTML
tutorial and of course there are
millions of them right they want me to
say go to this HTML tutorial because as
an authority I'm telling you an
authority that you personally know and
trust and that's important I am saying
go use this like my classes is exactly
that but one step farther when you're
trying to
driven to provenance of something you
may get a Christmas Day your novice in
that area like pitting my students are
who is robert johnson well with respect
to Y he's a big cheat rather than okay
but how do you figure that if you're 21
and haven't drunk lunch money right so
Google the Kristen try to figure that
out
so that's another aspect of this is how
you then tip beyond
it's one petal
well in it I think that's where
increasingly we need to surface not just
the sites but also the people who are
trusted sources of information that that
if I needed to know you know is this
person who's who's well thought of in
the wine world I'm not going to turn to
a search engine most likely I'm more
likely to ask the guy who runs my local
wine store because I trust him and I
know him and and they're they're going
to be there i'm going to have far more
skepticism about the stuff that i see
online and how much of it is
commercially motivated and how much of
it is google bombing and you know how do
i know that this constitutes a
legitimate source and increasingly you
know and in fact the older I get the
more I want to rely not on aggregate
sources and more on the expert network
that I've taken the time to build but
there are ways for us to expand beyond
that I mean the whole idea of you know
going one level out in the social
network if my students know me they
should be able to find out who I trust
and there should be some way for me to
be able to and in some ways people
already know to do this by looking at
things like my delicious network all
right who are the people that I have
said I value their input I value their
links this tells you a huge amount about
me but it also gives you a really good
jumping off point to other experts and
other knowledgeable people in a
particular field right now however there
aren't good ways in most social
networking tools for me to to you know
do an expertise vote right there's a big
difference between you're my friend and
I trust your opinion on X and I'd love
for there being a way for me to say to
people you know through the choices that
I make online Fred Stutzman and you know
Danah Boyd are two people that I
completely trust and respect in terms of
their views of social networking tools
there are other people on this list
where I'm interested to see what they
link to but I don't necessarily see them
as authoritative so how do we start to
reflect those choices that people make
in ways beyond simple link tracking how
can we explicitly start to identify
trusted sources and social networks
without only aggregating them sometimes
I want to know who you think is
interesting and who I should be
following I want to know who Kevin
thinks is important and interesting
because I already believe you're
important in interesting in my sense of
what's you know what my professional
sphere is absolutely that's a huge
problem the tension between who I feel
like i should say is important and who I
actually do believe is important we
already have this problem with are you
my friend yes or no right you know that
all of these social networks create all
kinds of implied responsibility do I
have the solution on this absolutely not
that I want there to be a way I mean we
already do this to some you know large
extent in scholarly work because that's
what citations are right citations are
an acknowledgement of work on which your
building what you do and we all know in
academic work that some citations you
know are in there because they have to
be there and some citations are in there
because they're really important yeah
but nonetheless despite the fact that
not all citations are created equal
citation tracing citation tracking is a
hugely powerful search tool that most
people don't know how to use hey this is
a key thing that librarians learn very
early on in their work i mean the social
science citation index is my most
favorite tool in the whole world and my
favorite part of google scholar is the
cited by component except most people is
back to the joy of searching versus joy
of finding most people don't know to use
that so or how to use it or why it's
important so you know I'm not here so
much with solutions as with areas that I
think right now we're ripe for solving
the problem of which is how do we better
reflect those networks of expertise
those networks of trust the who do you
recommend kinds of things so I lost my
favorite experts long before I set my
first game and part of me now when I
hear the word expert one of the
association's that comes up for me is
corporate shell
we're talking about expertise versus
authority I think we can talk about
attention between late people and
experts and saying how the rise of
technology has created this tension I
don't think that this solely because
divides the technology but rather
because over the last few decades we've
seen increasingly experts prostitute
themselves essentially so there's a
whole industry of foundations and
Institute's who's just like pseudo
science is an attempt to claim the
authority of science without the error
checking so you have a kind of suit of
scholarship now see I think though that
you're collapsing those two right you
haven't lost your faith in experts or
you wouldn't be in this room right now
right because you believed that coming
here you might hear something of value
because Kevin said I was an expert in
something okay it sounds to me like
you've lost your face in expertise that
is that is primarily a function of
authority that you've lost your face in
the the institutions that that claim to
convey Authority and I'm saying that
part of the tension of this debate that
we're having out is in reaction to this
prostitution of expertise
you know I I'm not entirely sure that I
by this idea that it's the prostitution
of expertise and I really you know I
keep coming back to wanting to separate
out expertise and authority I think
you're right that that the damage that's
been done to authority is not a function
of technology that in many cases as have
damaged that these organizations and
institutions do to themselves and that
they tend to collapse under their own
weight over time and can't live up to
the ideals that they tried to claim that
they represent but I don't think that
that that's a function of a problem with
experts think that we all acknowledge
that expertise is all around us and that
almost everybody we know is expert in
something you know and that expertise is
something that is a function of
knowledge now an authority is something
that's more a function of trust and
Trust is much easier to to mess up you
know then the knowledge I think I can I
can hold on to my knowledge more easily
than I can hold on to my reputation as
somebody who's trusted that would be my
argument in response
meet Beatles about the oddness of
entrusting the river access to producing
these negative mm-hmm what used to be
expensive to do in there
because it staffers are Peter
place was that get some cultural
shortcut the trust and credibility that
piece that's being undermined when
Andres getting around it it is that it's
that shortcut is this has obvious
anymore because
can a publisher
and you don't set it for the atomic all
right yeah I think I think that's
absolutely true that for a long time one
of the ways we have judged value is
based on how expensive something was and
you know anybody who's ever been a
consultant knows this really well that
if you price yourself too low you won't
be taken seriously if you say I'll do it
for free people won't touch you with a
ten-foot pole because they figure it's
worth what they paid for it you know and
that there's a real art to pricing
yourself high enough that people take
you seriously but low enough that they
can still afford to hire you and and
this is you know for a long time been an
issue in many contexts I mean who
doesn't go into a wine store you know if
they're a wine drinker and say well I
don't really want to buy the three
dollar bottle of wine because it must be
awful you know but but on the other hand
we also know that the $90 wine isn't
necessarily better than the ten-dollar
wine so there's this calculation that we
do all the time in terms of what
something is worth and worth to us you
know what the cost says about the work
that went into its manufacturer I mean
the fact that people still go to
universities is a pretty good indication
that they still believe there's value in
paying for knowledge right and that
paying a lot gives them something that
paying nothing doesn't I mean you can go
online you can take all of those classes
at MIT you know and yet people are still
paying tuition to go to MIT and they go
not for the expertise but for the
authority that's vested in MIT the the
Diploma that they get at the end the
sense of institutional approval that
says we have vetted you you have done
the work and as a result you have this
credential to show for us so I don't
think that's gone I think it's weakened
I think you're absolutely right that
that scares and routine half to death
but but it's not I think going to go
away yeah it's it's going to be added to
and that was the point I made at the end
of supernova is that this is not the end
of expertise and authorities as we know
it it simply means that now there are
more choices it's wonderful that anybody
can take these classes from MIT
online that's not the same thing as
getting the degree getting the knowledge
and getting the credential are connected
to each other but they're not the same
thing and I think we're a long ways away
from the point where credentials don't
matter I think credentials will continue
to matter because credentials come back
to trust and you say to me you took all
those classes at MIT you're an engineer
now and I say how do you know that you
really know that stuff that you really
learned it you know I want the
transcript with the grades with the
diploma that says that you accomplished
these things not simply you're saying to
me I have the knowledge because if it's
just you saying that then all the work
comes on to me to vet your your
knowledge right I don't want to have to
test you I don't want to have to do that
work I want MIT to do that work for me
okay so we still there still value for
us in credentialing because somebody
else is doing the hard work and at the
end of the day it all comes down to how
are you going to make my life easier mit
makes my life easier as someone who
hires people because they do the
credentialing for me and I don't have to
sit down I mean yes of course I still
have to ask them questions but they're a
whole lot of questions I don't have to
ask them all right there are a whole lot
of things I don't have to test because
the credential is already there anybody
walking around with the google badge
knows that there's institutional
Authority that that carries with it and
that there are people who treat you
differently because you were hired by
google hey they just do now there's an
immediate thing that's conveyed along
with that that you must be really smart
right and it doesn't have anything to do
with the conversation that they had with
you it has to do with the fact that they
believe that Google hire smart people
and so therefore Google's institutional
Authority tells them that you must be
smart or at least gives them a starting
point for saying you're probably not an
idiot you know I may not think you're
that smart but there's already a
credential in place there's already a
bar that you've crossed that I don't
then have to set for you and I think
we're going to have more and
more of these ways of credentialing
people on in both formal and informal
ways I don't think that makes these the
authority and institutions go away
that's Andrews fear is that they'll go
away I don't think they will go away I
think we can have both I don't think
it's an either/or I don't think it's
either you know the great unwashed
masses telling us what to do or you know
the the ivory tower you know telling us
the right thing to do I think we need to
have a mix and I think we're getting
more of that every day for which I'm
grateful if I thought institutions were
going away I'd be in trouble because I'm
a tenured professor and you know my
livelihood depends on institution
staying in place for another 20 years or
so so looks like we're probably about at
a time but I happy to talk with people
afterwards thank you so much for coming
and thank you Kevin for inviting me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
