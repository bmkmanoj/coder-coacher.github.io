florin is India another one of these
people who doesn't really need much of
an introduction um he's uh let's see
formerly from the the computer gaming
world of macromedia Apple computer
decided that it was more important to
save social discourse journalism and
civilization at large and has embarked
on this mission by founding news trust
and i'm not actually kidding about those
ambitions and he's not the only person
who thinks that this is the way to do it
he has let's see backing from macarthur
foundation craig newmark of craigslist
and i don't like half a dozen lighter so
um a lot of people are convinced that
that this is the right way to go and
Fabrice is here to enlist some more of
us as true believers welcome for beasts
thank you very much and thank you all
for coming here I'd like to to thank our
hosts first and foremost David Pablo
cone who's believed in us since the
beginning and it's it's great to have
his support as well as a shock parikh
who is also our co-host really
appreciate your help I also like to
thank Mike Dixon Mike was kind enough in
2005 when we're just getting started
with this project to help us out and
provide some advice and through the
years every once in a while he'll give
us a little tidbit little pointer that
will help us improve the service and I'm
very grateful to Mike and to everybody
else on the Google News team who's been
helping us out along the way Josh Cohen
is another one too has been very very
helpful I'd also like to introduce two
members of our team the first one is
David Fox who is our technology director
David single-handedly coded a lot of
what you're seeing today the so this
this wouldn't exist if it wasn't for him
since since then we now have a larger
engineering team but we're extremely
grateful there would there would be no
news to us if it wasn't
david and then kazar can't wallow we're
here is our associate editor kazar is
the one who every day makes sure that
the site looks great that it's filled
with content keeps a vigilant eye on our
members make sure that they understand
the basic principles of news review and
overall I want to thank probably another
eight people on the team who even though
they often work on a freelance basis as
a second job that little team is what
makes this dress happen and I want to
thank you for taking the time and your
busy day to come and join us what we're
going to do today is a couple things
first before we start I would encourage
any of you who haven't been to the new
stress site to go to New straße net and
to perhaps if you if you don't mind
click on the sign up button and sign up
as a member will make it easier for you
later to be able to you know understand
how the site works if you're signed in
as a member a lot of the site's
functionality is invisible until such
time as you do sign up the other thing
is for those of you who are interested
in adding news trust to your iGoogle
page just go to this URL go / news trust
that gadgets and you can add the new
stress gadget to your iGoogle and hope
hope you'll add the value to your page
this is what we're doing today now some
of you are just here for the tech talk
which is only an hour long from 22 to 23
but some of you are actually staying for
the second part which is at three
o'clock we're going to do a small groups
along where we're going to take an
article and we're going to review it
together reviewing an article as a group
is a really fascinating experience we
all always learn something from it even
those of us who are seasoned reviewers
so if you have a little bit of time and
you'd like to really see how it happens
I encourage you to stay
for the three clocks alone but in the
meantime what we're going to do is we're
going to do a little presentation for
about a half an hour and then we're
going to do QA and we're you we don't
claim to have all of the answers in fact
we we only have some of the answers but
we have a lot of the questions and so
we're looking for feedback from you with
this we're only a couple years old so
with these first few baby steps that
we've taken you know how do we expand
how do we extend the value of the
service so look forward to discussing
that with you later but now as far as
the presentation the first thing is that
we're social news network that means
that we're an online community of people
who care about good journalism good
journalism we think is important because
in a democracy citizens need quality
information in order to make the right
decisions when they go and vote and the
way they get that information is through
journalism so unlike other social news
sites we do not focus on popularity is
it cool or is it not cool but rather we
ask ourselves is this article good
journalist and we have a methodology for
figure out if it's good or not so it's
much deeper evaluation that what you
might find on your typical social news
sites we're nonprofit which is also
quite unusual and the reason is because
we care about the public's interest we
want to help the public first their
shareholders are not our primary focus
and we offer three primary services
first one is the quality news feeds
which essentially are the top rated
stories that you find on our sides or in
our RSS feeds on our gadgets in our
email newsletters it's basically a
digest of interesting stories that we
think would help you as a citizen the
second one is the news literacy tools
essentially our review form is like a
little checklist that guides you through
the evaluation process by asking you
some questions so that you for yourself
can tell whether you're dealing with
good information or dealing with
misinformation and last but not
East the entire service helps build
trust between factions of the public
that have been pointing the fingers at
each other or between the public and the
media by having this thoughtful exchange
and evaluation process based on facts
not just opinions we believe that we can
rebuild trust has been lost in recent
years we're very lucky to have such a
wonderful team and again we're you know
some of the names are listed here just
it's just a partial list but you'll
recognize many of the names so we've got
a mix of experienced journalists great
technologists educators and and other
digital media leaders so whether it's
you know Craig Newmark or our own Mike
Dickson or Howard Rheingold all of these
advisors have done you know wonderful
work with the with us to help us develop
this project my own background is I was
at Apple computer at the Apple
multimedia lab where the first ones to
do multimedia in the early 80s we helped
launch quicktime and HyperCard and did
high-level partnerships with the BBC and
National Geographic Lucasfilm
Smithsonian to help use multimedia for
education purposes then I subsequently
was brought in to macromedia to help
monetize their traffic they had all
these people downloading the flash
plugins but they were just sending them
back to where they came from and not
doing anything with this and so they
asked me if I could help and that was a
really easy one what we did was
aggregate all the best shockwave games
and flash cartoons and interactive music
pieces all in one place and it was just
a wonderful experience after two years
we had 15 million registered members
huge traffic profitable and all with a
team of six people so we've been able to
apply some of these lessons to this
venture and when I a couple years ago
when I turned 50 I asked myself you know
this was a wonderful career I've been
very lucky you know how can I give back
the
Society and I asked my friends I said
can work pro bono for a couple years how
can I be a value and everybody said
journalism journalism is going through a
rapid transformation and we need people
with good organizational skills to help
out so why don't you look at that and
from that came new stressed and from all
these wonderful people our partners were
more and more starting to partner with
the media organizations like frontline
WGBH globalvoices often post instapundit
on the right we try to bounce it out so
that different people and scientific
american slate and more and more
universities again a partial list very
very lucky to have the support of
macarthur foundation multi your support
and google there again you guys have
this wonderful Google Grants Program
which is really really helpful and we're
really blessed that companies like yours
of the foresight to support nonprofit
like ours and we're very grateful for
all this all this support even though
we're still a little nonprofit startup
we're starting to gain traction now here
is the challenge that we all face in
this sector we're facing some huge
transformations some big market forces
like the explosion of new media the
consolidation of big media and the
decline of public trust and these big
market forces have all sorts of
different effects you know the you know
having you know so many websites and
blogs out there feeds into the problem
of information overload the average
citizen is deluge with so much
information the rise of amateur
journalism although we we like it in
general think it's a great thing can
also introduce some issues for example
more misinformation can be fed into the
system by by people who are new at the
practice of journalism and who make
mistakes due to you know lack of
discipline the big media consolidation
is clearly we've all heard about the
newsroom
axe is certainly a very concerning issue
for a lot of folks and even more
concerning is the rise of opinion news
it turns out an opinion news is a lot
more profitable if you're operating a
media business then just doing this old
fashioned objective journalism then you
do is we'll get you a lot more traction
because people basically prefer to to
hear what they want to hear so if you
give people what they want to hear
something that matches their opinions
your profit margin goes up so it's it's
inevitable that with all the pressure
from Wall Street that many media
organizations are now trying to support
opinion news and we see that as feeding
another problem which is the problem of
mistrust and then the decline of public
trust co citizens are just faced with so
much change and so much turmoil that
they're not sure how to act and so
either they'll join the culture wars
feeding more mistrust or they'll
disengage completely they'll say well
I'm just a one person I can't make a
difference I'm just going to tune out
and the problem of civic apathy is a
serious one and we find it to one degree
or another news trust offers some
solutions to each of these problems you
know for information overload we offer a
news filter to address misinformation we
give you a tool so you can tell for
yourself if you're dealing with bad
information to address mistrust we have
a reputation database where we keep
track of all the sources and that we
review on our site and you can find out
whether you can trust this blog or knots
if you don't know about them and then
the whole service help citizens find
their voice a lot of people say I'm not
a writer I'm not a blogger but anyone
can be a reviewer it's not that hard and
we we coach you would drain you we
encourage you to do that and in the
process you can find your voice as a
citizen a voice of reason we hope rather
than a voice of hate and division more
and more as we go deeper and deeper into
this project we're finding that news
literacy is a very very important issue
all of us in our little brain
have lacked some of the tools required
for dealing with the rapid evaluation of
so much information coming at us every
day and there's a tendency for all of us
no one's immune as far as I can tell is
a tendency to take a lazy shortcut you
see an article your scan it in seconds
because you don't have any any time and
you see something in the article that
quote somebody saying something that you
happen to agree with immediately we say
oh well I agree with that therefore it's
got to be a good article and we we
skipped the the steps of weighing the
evidence examining the sources etc and
we just go straight to it matches my
belief therefore it's going to be good
therefore i'm going to email it to 100
of my friends to say see I was right
that's the attitude that we're trying to
tone down we're trying to encourage all
of us to become good at rapidly
evaluating information on its own merits
not necessarily by comparing it with our
pre-existing beliefs and so that whole
process which is essentially the process
of critical thinking is the one we try
to encourage and we try to find ways to
make it quick but still make it
effective this is the homepage of news
trust on a typical day you can see that
the the top-rated stories surface to the
top and those are stories I've been
evaluated by our members we have a new
topic every week could be presidential
election could be the environment and
you can see who's reviewed recently and
if you want to you can click on any of
the titles to go straight to the article
on the original content providers site
but should you be interested in
reviewing the article you can click on
any of the green review it buttons and
that makes our review form pop up so we
have on the left the review form and on
the right we have the original article
on the site that it came from now you're
seeing the full review form if you're
just getting started we're going to give
you a much shorter form which just fewer
questions but the purposes of
presentation I'm showing you all the
questions here
and the first one that we ask is do you
recommend the story and what we're
trying to do here is basically capture
the popularity metric the thumbs up
thumbs down just to get it out of the
way the second one is you trust this
source turns out that if we trust the
New York Times it greatly influences our
judgment and so we want to know that if
the person trust the source in the first
place and so we can later calibrate
their rating based on that information
next is this story informative did you
learn something you didn't know and all
of them are the same scale one to five
is a story fair is the reporter taking
sides or they presenting both sides of
the story how about the sourcing are
there multiple sources are their primary
sources or secondary sources are they
named or not named those aren't sourcing
is very important context does the
reporter zoom out and show you the big
picture so you can understand why this
news article is relevant what about
evidence is this based on factual
evidence is it length is it verifiable
that's also really important one and of
course importance is it is this a topic
that's important for the public interest
are the key viewpoints represented as a
story relatively balanced and how about
the style presentation matters so these
are the key questions again we only ask
a couple when you're just getting
started but by what we're finding out
from our research is that the more
questions we answer the better our
rating is and I'll show you some of the
research based on that so we encourage
people to answer you can add a comment
hit the submit button and your review
appears on the review page along with
others now there is one difference
though is that we have the concept of
featured reviewers our best reviewers
the most trusted reviewers always get
quoted first so instead of being a
chronological comments we try to
emphasize the reviewers we trust the
most and I'll tell you more about this
later so that helps reduce some of the
comments spam that you find on
any sites you can see our collective
ratings here you can see that in this
particular case this story was really
well rated with a 3.9 average almost
four stars it's only weakness was on
style and we can forgive that that's not
always the case so 3.9 is a it's hard to
get on news trust now not only do we
rate the articles but we also keep track
of all of the story ratings for
particular sources so the huffington
post for example has earned a 3.3
average for about 280 reviews that we
had done at the time that this screen
shot was taken you can see that overall
their ratings are pretty good but
there's a weakness with balance and
there's a little bit of weakness on the
fairness as well and maybe the context
and if you look at this the source info
our reviewers sixty-seven percent of our
reviewers feel that the huffington post
leans left and generally speaking we
think that they're correct it also is
useful information about the fact this
is a private corporation ownership
issues are really important and so this
is a great page to go to if you want if
you just write a blog you had never
heard about and you want to find out if
it's a trustworthy blog you go to news
trust and see if it's reviewed they'll
give you some information that would be
helpful we hope not only do we rate the
articles normally do we rate the sources
and publications but we also rate the
raiders and that is essential to this
process so here you see the member
profile for Mike Labonte who's been on
the side for two years and during that
time he has earned our trust you can see
he's got a 4.5 average member level and
the way he's earned it is his activity
level is really good so he gets the site
his experience level mmm not so strong
he's an engineer but he does not have I
mean he's not a journalist or special
content expert but he makes up for that
by the fact that he gets very high
ratings from other members
who find his reviews thoughtful his
transparency level is also quite high
he's telling us a lot about himself and
his politics note that we require
everybody to identify themselves with a
real name unless there's a real strong
reason not to we think that too often
people will hide behind a pseudonym and
they won't act in the same mature
fashion than they would if their real
name was was was provided so we
encourage everybody to use their real
names and in the last rating here which
is probably the most important is
validation by our staff as soon as
someone becomes active on news trust our
staff will validate them we do a 15 to
20 minute check we look to see that
there are using their real name we check
the email address the website that
they're giving us and we look for
partisan gaming is this person
consistently giving five stars to
liberal publications and one starts the
Conservatives in a systematic way if we
catch any issues like the partisan
gaming we'll send them a nice email
saying thank you so much for reviewing
on the side we really appreciate but we
note that there seems to be a
misunderstanding about why we're doing
this we're not here to pursue eight each
other we're here to try to help each
other find quality information so please
let's check our ideology of the door and
let's just look at the information on
its own merits and often that little
email is enough to see a market
difference and if it's not normally
email again or will then call them on
the phone etc etc the reason this is
important is because every time a news
trust review of our rates a story on our
site we weigh their rating based on
their member level so if you have a high
member level your vote counts a lot more
if you've got a low member level you can
rate all you want you have a negligible
impact on the system and that's one of
the methodologies that we use to reduce
the impact of gaming community at a
glance right now the we're only about a
year and a half old and we're still in
beta
the types of people we've attracted tend
to match Public Broadcasting
demographics fairly high levels of
education a fairly mature audience
although we're getting more and more
young adults we're very lucky to have so
many journalists in our midst that makes
a huge difference every time you get a
journalist and a citizen to work
together there's a really wonderful
win-win situation going on the politics
are tilting to the left we this is not
intentional we're trying to restore that
we've already brought it back a bit and
we think over time by partnering with
large media organisations will be able
to be more representative of the country
we serve and the population as a whole
here's the structure of our trust
network it's a pyramid shape everybody
starts at the bottom as a visitor then
you sign in as a member and then one day
you say you know what I'm going to try
to review a story you see what all the
hoopla is about at that point you come
on our radar and we start validating you
if you get a validation level of three
or more and the quality of your work is
consistent you may get invited to become
a host a host is a special member of the
news trust community that basically has
editing privileges a little bit like
Wikipedia you can go and edit any page
on our site that has a factual error for
example let's say we miss categorize the
story as an opinion when it's really a
news report or say the information on
the huffington post page was incorrect a
hose can go in and correct that error
but they have to earn our trust first as
opposed to just doing what wikipedia is
doing to open it up to everybody we have
a validation process a hose can host a
topic can also host new members they can
host a source or publication and they
can participate in our biweekly phone
calls we have nationwide conference
calls where we get host to talk about
what should we cover next week and
answer any questions that they have and
someday they may even become an editor
for an entire section and our little
teeny staff orchestrates all this
now a little bit about the science
behind news trust we wanted to find out
is it possible to trust citizens to
conduct this kind of thorough evaluation
in what we did is conduct a series of
blind tests a thousand reviewers at a
time would receive an email from us
saying please review this article by
using our tool and answering these
questions and we divided a thousand
reviewers into four groups the first
group shown in green was given the
original version of an average news
report and lo and behold collectively
they gave it an average rating the
second group unbeknownst to them was
given a degraded version of that same
article we removed a couple facts we
introduced some inaccuracies we
introduced a conservative or liberal
bias we took some name sources and
turned them anonymous and by and large
even though the difference was subtle we
would make put all the flaws in
paragraph four five six and so that
maybe we might not have caught it on the
first read by and large the the citizen
reviewers were able to tell the
difference and we've done this test over
and over again and we always get that
pattern so this suggests to us that it
is possible to trust citizens to
accurately evaluate the quality of
journalism well of course will conduct
more tests to see if it holds with the
general public yeah the question is were
the people running this test aware that
they were participating this experiment
and the answer's no we did not tell them
that there was a degraded version we
didn't tell him that there was a placebo
we just said blazing common behavior do
they usually get emails or do they
usually do down the side anything people
do this was even before there was a site
before we started building it we wanted
to find out can we actually trust this
so we did extensive research for about a
year before even doing a single line of
code to find out whether whether the
field was ripe whether it was even
feasible to do this
no they did not know that that was the
case and you know i think the later in
some cases we let people know what what
actually happened but in most cases it
was truly a blind test now here's an
interesting chart where we again it's a
thinking tools of snap based on
scientific data but it's our
interpretation of where all the
organizations that purport to filter the
news or evaluate journalism where do
they stand against these two axes the
vertical axis is the depth of the review
is the organization doing a full review
or they're doing no review at all and
then the second axis is the expertise of
the reviewer is this someone who's a
professional or just someone who really
doesn't have that much expertise and
when we try to distribute all the
various organizations in our universe we
ended up with two bubbles on the top
right is what we call the quality bubble
and there we have organizations like ap
Reuters in the New York Times who do a
fairly thorough evaluation of their own
content before they publish it you know
they get a lot of grief but in reality
their editorial processes are pretty
advanced but they only do their own
content so that doesn't really help the
rest of the content you have a few
nonprofits like fact-check or journalism
org that will occasionally do a you know
a check on someone else's content but
they employed paid for paid
professionals usually a small team of
just a few people and so although the
quality of their work is fantastic they
really can get it it doesn't scale up
you know journalism gorg will do once a
year top 10 markets three newspapers
three TV stations it's just it's not it
it doesn't cover the universe of news
that's coming out so as good as it is
it's not scalable now on this and we
have what we call the popularity bubble
and the this is where you find sites
that do just a short review like dig or
you
or reddit or delicious which is
essentially a bookmark in you get
results from that but the results are
essentially a popularity metric what you
get is a lot of people seem to like that
story but it doesn't tell you a lot
about the quality of its information so
although it's hugely cost effective
because you've got millions of
volunteers working for nothing and
you're getting a lot of data from lots
of people the quality of the data is not
necessarily useful to a citizen trying
to figure out whether they can base
their decision on that particular piece
of information so what we try to do at
news choices we try to bring the best of
both worlds together by basically taking
the best practices of these professional
organizations bringing them into the
mainstream taking members of the public
they have no expertise and encouraging
them to gain some expertise as citizen
reviewers and we believe anyone can be a
reviewer now more and more what we're
doing is we're doing partnerships with
media organizations in this case we're
showing the huffington post which with
whom we're going to be working in a few
weeks but other organizations include
for example Scientific American a couple
weeks ago we partnered with scientific
american for one week and together we
encourage their readers and the members
of our community as well as students
from the University of nevada-reno to
join forces to find great journalism
about the environment so for one week we
all went around look for great articles
about the environment a week later on
earth day we announce the results and
everybody got something out of it
Scientific American got a little bit
more thoughtful web two point O activity
they engage their community the students
at the University of Nevada got a chance
to kind of practice their skills and get
their chops on you know identifying good
journalism and news trust got a lot of
new reviewers and it gets good the whole
community engaged so every week we try
to do this in a couple of weeks we're
going to do the Middle East we're going
to do it with the Council on Foreign
Relations prestigious think tank and
with global voices an association of
bloggers from around the world so we try
to reach out to a variety of
different communities often post
obviously will be really interesting and
what we typically do with a with a
partner like this is we encourage them
to support the collaboration I just
described to support the news hunt that
we do together to add their review
buttons next to dig and delicious so
that their own work can be reviewed more
easily and to also ask at our widget on
the particular topic that's being
reviewed so the widget essentially acts
as they stole a scoreboard of which
stories are top-rated on this particular
topic at this given time other partners
like slate are just happy to take our
full page widget and just make it a
little mini section on their side they
keep the advertising we get some of the
traffic so we have both hands on
partnerships and more passive
partnerships and the purpose of all
those is to keep growing the community
and expanding the service making it
available in different locations if a
site does not have our buttons or
widgets as in the case of fox news for
example it's very easy for one of our
members to still review their work by
simply adding our bookmarklet dragging
it into their toolbar wherever they are
on the web they just click the news
trust bookmarklet little pop-up window
comes up they can either submit the
story for review or rated right here and
there and they don't they never have to
go to our site ever again you know
unless unless they want to so taking
news trust with you as your older
companion is a very useful idea someday
when we grow up someday we hope to be
able to add value to Google News in very
direct ways either by feeding our
metadata to you or maybe providing our
ratings maybe you might want to display
some of this to some of your users you
know user preference or something like
that and so that's our hope you know
it's like maybe in a couple years when
we've grown to a sufficient level that
organizations like Google News and
others will will say you know these new
stress guys are really getting getting
to a point we really should get serious
about working with it and that's how we
can have a huge impact on a really broad
audience
and just a few little things here it
says coming soon but we just launched on
Monday our Google Gadget so you can see
the google gadgets pretty cool it the
different one of the differentiators for
the Google Gadget versus say the the dig
gadget is we separate news from opinion
we saw that that was something that none
of the gadgets on I google offered that
so we thought well that's that would be
our contribution will separate news from
opinion and of course you can access a
variety of topics and if you already
signed in on the site you can just
review the story right off the review it
button right here so it's just a
basically a little piece of our site
that you can put on your iGoogle page
right here at this URL here's what's
next later in the year we want to have a
news literacy guide which will be like a
little fun little quiz that will give
you a statement or a quote and we'll ask
you simple questions to test your news
literacy so is this an opinion or is
this a factual report so you can look at
that quote and try to determine for
yourself you know whether or not you
think it's an opinion and if you want to
you can still review the whole article
but we realize that people's time is
short and not everybody has ten minutes
to review a story and this is something
you can answer in less than a minute and
hopefully if if in the process we can
help members of the American public tell
the difference between a factual report
in an opinion that's a huge win in fact
it's central to our mission our mission
remember is to help citizens make more
informed decisions and one of the ways
that towards that goal it's knowing the
difference between opinion in fact huge
difference and you'd be surprised how
many people actually are not completely
clear on that concept we keep we keep
streamlining the review form and
simplifying it even this is it actually
it's an old screen uh probably shouldn't
be showing it anymore but the new review
form they'll come out later this summer
will be will have all sorts of wonderful
capabilities you'll be customizable
instead of asking you so many questions
we'll just
ask you a few questions we'll have a
version it's really really small so it
doesn't look overwhelming we have the
concept of separating your personal
views on this issue from whether or not
you think that we're dealing with
reliable information so all sorts of
innovations are coming up stay tuned for
more some of our educational activities
so we typically will go to a university
partner with them for a week dual a
presentation like this one get the
students to participate actively roll up
their sleeves and then publish our
findings will often invite the students
to blog on our site as well so very
healthy and then more and more we're
doing news trust salons which are group
discussions with small groups of people
where we try to review a story together
we're finding this to be invaluable
complement to the online experience
online we're all separating our little
isolated locations we don't communicate
as well as we can when we're face to
face and every time we have one of these
salons we all learn tremendously so I
hope some of you will consider staying
for the second part and to summarize we
see a real need for this there's no
question you know initially we're not
sure but now we think that we add
sufficient value that it's this
worthwhile more more people are adopting
our services the big finding so far is
that whenever you put a citizen and a
journalist together it's a huge win for
everybody concerned because the
journalist has unique information
gathering skills that they've developed
throughout their career they can impart
some of those skills to citizens who are
new at that practice and the citizens
can therefore become a lot more
effective and they can amplify the
journalists expertise by applying it to
much wider content area so as much as
possible we try to get citizens and
journalists to cooperate rather than you
know be far apart and this is part of
the trust building that we do in very
simple ways so it'll sir summary pitch
of ways that if you think that this is a
worthwhile goal ways
could help the first one is go to our
site and sign up and we have a special
sign up for google employees I recommend
you use that one because we're giving
you a higher validation level right off
the bat just because your google
employees we do certain level trusted
you come all the way to here to the
arrows so sign up through here if you
want I think there's still a message
right now that talks about the so long
you don't have to stay for the salon
just sign up so that you can become part
of our community the second thing get
the this is the the internal URL this is
the external URL get the gadget third
thing is review often and for those of
you want to stay stay at three spread
the word if you think it's worth well
let your friends know if you want to
volunteer say you're an engineer and
you've want to spend a few hours a month
helping out we can all use some help or
you might just post a topic and just
send us an email and host at News
Trustnet if there's a topic that you'd
like to host doesn't take much you can
be very effective with a an hour or two
a week and then those of you who feel so
inclined we depend on to the generosity
of our donors and sponsors and always
appreciate a little bit of help so I
think I'm going to leave it at that and
open this up for four questions at this
point for Asian pop you use the word
citizen
well a citizen is essentially you know
someone who's part of our democracy and
who gets a chance to participate or any
democracy you're an international is
there is there a nationalistic bias to
news evaluation I'm sorry if we if
though it's not intended to be
nationalistic at all we're all citizens
of the world first and foremost and I'm
sorry if we gave the idea that that we
we don't intend to be nationalistic but
we all have ways as citizens because
we're almost all of us are citizens of
at least one country we have ways to
participate in the democratic process by
voting and all too often we find
situations where people go and place
their votes without having the full
information required to make an informed
decision and we just want to help people
get access to better information so that
together we can make better decisions
but we don't we're not trying to be
nationalistic and a want to make that
very clear but you do distinguishing
left and right so maybe one suggestion I
would have is it might be useful in the
profile of each reviewer to record what
their various citizenships in yeah
that's a very good point that's very
well by the way just to make it really
clear I'm French and I'm an American
cities of the same time just to make it
very clear I'm not favoring either
country but I vote in both democracies
and I'm very grateful to new stress
that's helping Bates of difficult
decision I mean I mean I just think
you'd be interesting to be able to see
how the reviews broke down on on that
it's a great point for practical reasons
we're putting more emphasis in the u.s.
right now because we're still developing
the site and we will roll out
international versions and different
languages but probably not until 2009
we're just still debugging the platform
and so we can't x
board the platform until it's finished
but as soon as we do you'll see a much
more into international scope and we'll
definitely take your recommendation of
finding out the nationality of the
members thank you when people review and
they say whether they press source or
not I do you find any correlation
between the quality like average quality
of articles that is publishes and that
is trust that people put into it there
sometimes is we're all influenced by
whom we trust and there is often a
tendency for someone who trusts a
publication to want to favor that
publication but we find that the process
itself will often cause if you're
genuine about it and if you're
thoughtful as a reviewer you will
sometimes find that although you really
trust the New York Times that in this
case this particular article is not well
sourced and so although my initial
intention was idle I trust the New York
Times therefore it's got to be a good
article that's my initial assumption I
go in and then I answer a couple more
questions and lo and behold I find way
second the prestigious New York Times
didn't do a very good job in this little
conservative blog which initially I
didn't trust so much did a very good job
multiple sources very factual so often
we have epiphanies where we discover
that a source we didn't trust is in fact
trustworthy and vice versa so every time
you answer an additional question you
get closer to the truth and our goal is
to get you to ask yourself these
additional questions yep
hi I had a question about audience both
you know it in in sort of two different
buckets you're taught the people who are
reading this your viewers as he said
sort of the bottom level who aren't even
necessarily registered members and then
up the next level as to how did people
graduate to become actual reviewers
because I think this is sort of a you
know a cycle where the part of the
reason we're in this this predicament is
that people there's so much information
and people don't have time that they are
not willing to invest the time to even
read an article closely enough to
determine whether or not it's biased or
well reported so who do you see as your
target audience for people who are
actually willing to put in the time to
take the time to review these articles
how are you reaching them you know and
yeah that's basically well initially
we're starting with concerned citizens
that have a an interest in democracy
because it's a good it's a good starting
point for getting early adopters but
eventually we hope that as we come up
with many review forms and funnel quiz
and little applications that are not so
daunting we hope to attract the general
public in bigger ways and this is why
it's so important for us to be talking
to organizations like the Washington
Post and others because they have the
potential to basically open the process
to a much broader audience and so for
that audience we instead of asking them
to do a full review will most likely
give him a fun little quiz or just a
little gadget or just something
something easy to just get him to maybe
I'll maybe I'll read this article but
you are correct that reading the article
is eighty-five percent of the total
review time so in fact the review
process itself is not that lengthy but
it's reading the article or watching the
broadcast or listening to the audio
story that takes the longest but if we
can cause more people to do that and to
read or watch or listen to thoughtful
material then we all we all
there are number of groups online that
believe in various sort of either
conservative agendas or the
environmental lobby or the lobby or
water your political philosophy is right
like how easy it is for these groups to
sort of gang up and game or poison the
reports they can all go in and say let's
look at fox news reports and give bad
reviews to things coming out of Fox are
other agendas like that how do you see
our difficult do you think it is well
the obviously gaming is a is a big
obstacle to to our success it's one that
we need to get really good at we think
that our current validation process is
this very serious obstacle to people who
want to gain the the process because you
can sign up if you want to but your
validation level is going to remain at
one until such time as you demonstrate
to us that you have the qualities of
objectivity and thoughtfulness that we
expect from a review so even if 10,000
people sign up if they have a validation
of one it's they're not going to have as
much influence as the trusted members
who have a for the other thing is we're
looking to developing the algorithm
further to introduce the concept of what
we call balanced ratings which means
that for ratings are really important
and particularly when there's lots of
reviewers involved we will take you know
equal amounts of people from the left
right and center to prevent any party
whether it's you know an extremist on
the right or an extremist on the left
from gaming the system so the balance
rating will be a bit similar to what the
pollsters used to balance their polls
and we hope to introduce this by the end
of the year as a further prevention of
course we'll keep adding new and new
ways to prevent gaming and we realize
that that's probably our largest optical
but the good news is our methodology is
based on a thoughtful evaluation
not only of the journalism but also of
the reviewer our goal and if in fact are
the most important part of our mission
is not to be a news aggregator that's a
means to an end and the end is to get
all of us to increase our news literacy
skills become more discriminating
readers and to become more informed
citizens and we have methodologies for
accomplishing that goal that most of the
first generation news sites or social
sites do not have yes typically at least
eighty percent of a day's articles will
be reviewed by some of our most trusted
reviewers in other words they they're a
little bit like Wikipedians you know 200
wikipedians so so they say built the
bulk of Wikipedia English and in in a
similar way that news trust we've got a
couple other people really really active
and these guys are avid news readers and
they'll they'll try to get as many as
they can so we're very lucky that we
almost always have one trusted reviewer
on one of the reviews since you have
information about users and their
profiles and you guys looked at doing
like news trust recommendations things
like these are sources you might like
these are articles you might like based
on things you've reviewed they based on
your political leanings your you know
whatever information you provided yeah
we should we're starting to do that
already today's picks is the beginning
of our recommendation service it's part
algorithm part editorial meaning our
editors stuff can nudge stories up
there's an editorial priority and also
one of the things that we hope to do is
hopefully sometime in the fall to have
on our topic pages the list of
recommended sources for that
topic so we'll say based on our
experience on the topic of war in Iraq
there's been very thoughtful coverage
from the following sources which in
itself recommending sources is not a bad
way to go and actually if you go to our
site and you click on you click on the
sources you'll see how most trusted
sources also recommended so those are
sources that by and large have held up
pretty well you know throughout about a
year and a half of evaluation and then
so we'll recommended sources but we'll
also recommend stories
so I assume that you're getting your
initial stories for the reviewers using
some sort of automated process or is it
all ultra submissions it's all manual
submissions believe it or not I know
it's a laugh about Google that the we
could we currently do not have an auto
submission process however one of the
things we're talking to partners about
is starting to do some auto submission
to make it easier to submit because
right now even though I'm pretty fast or
kazar is pretty fast we can submit a
story in about a minute a person was
just getting started it could take them
two or three minutes to submit a story
and so obviously that's that's a lot of
time so we will look at Auto submissions
now that we have trusted sources that's
you know we were starting to get some
some guidelines that would make it
possible for us to auto submit something
for review not auto rate but auto submit
and so that's on that's something we
hope to have at least a first instance
of auto submission by the end of the
year does that answer your question yep
our hope is that we can generate
sufficient traffic with the help of our
partners so that we can monetize that
traffic in a traditional manner through
a combination of online sponsorships a
little bit of online advertising
judiciously done premium memberships so
that people can donate like they do for
NPR and then return for that they get a
few bells and whistles like a
personalized news feed and b2b licensing
where we license our news feed and
customize it if need be for big partners
that have a need for it or do a rev
share like for example in a year or so
from now we're going to go back to slate
we're going to say hey you've enjoyed
the freebie for two years how about
splitting a little bit of that ad
revenue with us so right now most of the
most of the revenue sources are traffic
based so we need to first build our
traffic through our part
once we got enough traffic that we can
monetize it and in the meantime we're
lucky enough that MacArthur and a couple
other foundations are willing to provide
us essentially the startup capital to to
build a non-profit up to level but we
will try to even though it's a
non-profit we we want to apply some
business techniques to the extent that
they don't conflict with our mission to
operate it like a business so it can be
sustainable so you mentioned at the
beginning that one of the challenges
today is that more and more publications
are seeing opinion based reporting to be
more profitable now assuming that by
driving more traffic to talk based
articles you can help change that little
bit but if that's the direction we're
moving won't that be a problem to
something that gives troughs given that
they're just be less and less
stock-based articles being published
aren't you too late in the cycle already
well it's it's it's a very interesting
question are we too late in the cycle
given that the rise of opinion news is
already on the way to make a difference
I I don't think we're too late and I
think in fact even if the entire medias
Ferrier the entire news and information
industry were to become one large
opinion news or system I still think
that the news trust service would be of
value because you can use the news truss
system to evaluate an opinion not just a
factional report and being able to
identify the opinion pieces that are the
most factual is is it itself valuable so
say listen you've been gorging on
opinions from this source and time after
time every time we check these opinions
we fact that we find that they're not
based on facts that they're in violation
of some core principles of journalism we
recommend you stay away from that
opinion source but this opinion source
is in fact generally factual generally
well source that
we present the other sides of the
argument respectfully it is possible to
have an opinion piece that's thoughtful
in fact based opinions by nature are not
bad but certain opinions who ignore the
basic tenets of information gathering
those of those opinion pieces are on
Alfie by the way another really
interesting thing that this pot is going
to become possible for us very soon is
because we keep track of what you're
reviewing what you're clicking on we
actually quite aware about what your
particular news habits tend to be and we
thought that at some point we may be
able to offer some some type of a weight
watcher service well you know you know
our view is that you know many many
Americans are intellectually obese you
know particularly nowadays you can get
whatever you want whenever you want
through the magic of the internet and so
we might be able to observe to someone
and say listen we've noticed that you've
been gorging yourself on opinions comedy
news and the lowest of the lowest form
of the factual information might you
consider adding a little bit of spinach
to your diet not too much candy is ok
but what we might propose is maybe if
you add a ten percent factual thing and
ten percent of this news analysis you
might actually be able to broaden your
perspective with in all due respect of
course it's not up to us to recommend to
people that do you think but still the
information as food metaphor is actually
useful for thinking about this problem
in the internet for all its wonderful
blessings has made it possible for us to
get only what we want to get and not
what we need to get and it's nice to
have a neutral authority just like when
you go see your doctor the doctor
suggests you know a slight adjustment on
your diet it's possible that news trucks
could play a role should our members be
interested in that service yep
reason in the long run to to restrict
yourself to just news sources or like in
general website evaluation that sort of
thing would be very useful it's it's
quite likely that we could actually add
value in many other fields we started
news because it has such a huge
influence on how citizens vote but
obviously in the financial field and the
health field in the travel field the
same techniques could be applied the
techniques of journalism I really the
techniques of good information gathering
and in fact many of the principles that
I just pointed out to you are the
principles of good citizenship you know
as a citizen you know it's important for
me to be fair it's important for me to
try to look for factual information it's
important for me to look at multiple
sources in order to reach a decision so
even though we have started with news
are the potential impact of the system
could be much greater but you know we've
got to start with small steps and we've
got our hands full already with news but
if in fact we are successful in a couple
of years it's quite obvious that we
could apply this this in other areas as
well yep you quickly say what you're
marvelous for review of reviewers like
do that top level guys give you the book
next time guys and so on and so forth is
that how it's happening yeah the idea is
that currently the way it's going on
because we've got a small community is
we have a small staff of nine people and
about a third of us are involved in
member of validations so we take turns
validating people but we're starting to
train some of our most trusted host to
potentially start taking taking on that
role so that eventually the trusted host
will do the validation for new members
that are just mildly active and then
eventually we'll be able to you know
even extend that even further but we're
being very careful we're pursuing just
one step after another on all these
opportunities and also the the sad thing
about nonprofit and the nonprofit sector
is there
so little funding in this sector that we
move a lot more slowly than a for-profit
organization where we're out spent at
least 20 21 by the nearest for-profit
competitor and this is why we depend on
the generosity of our partners to help
us out and it take a little bit of the
workload so it's not all on our
shoulders but that said it is possible
to to operate it and even though we take
us longer to get there than if we were
for profit because we're very focused on
our mission we don't end up to be so
dependent on the vagaries of the market
we just stay the course we've been doing
the same thing for three years and it
keeps getting better all the time so on
well thank you so much for your great
crashes your great attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
