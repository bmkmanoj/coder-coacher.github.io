wonders of the modern world 40 so
October 21st 2011 google techtalks
are designed to disseminate a wide
spectrum of views on topics including
current affairs science medicine
engineering business humanities law
entertainment and the arts disclaimer
the views or opinions expressed by the
guest speakers are solely their own and
do not necessarily represent the views
or opinions of Google Incorporated but
you will see a completely different
perspective to what you can do with a
device that's running an open platform
and has the ability to control other
things and be controlled by other things
they've been working on Android in the
context of being shed users they have
some they've done some fabulous work and
they also have some great ideas on what
they could do in the future
so rather than stealing your thunder I
let her here until use the rest of this
project and it was with the wonderful
work they're doing thank you
thank you thank you TV Thank You Charles
that's very very kind and with Stevie
was mentioning we've been collaborating
on an accessibility initiative that I'm
personally very oh this one's working
right okay yeah thank you so yeah I was
saying this is a very exciting
opportunity has been a very exciting
opportunity exciting opportunity to be
working so closely with the
accessibility team at Google and this is
a project that I'm personally personally
very passionate about I'm here
representing two two organizations
one is the inclusive design Research
Center at OCAD University in Toronto and
the other one is a startup company
Komodo Openlab
and the those two organizations
basically span the the full breadth of
what we've been able to achieve through
through this project and with the help
of of an open
platforms such as Android so I'm going
to talk a little bit about that and as
you can see here in the in the slide I
borrowed this from the rapture
Historical Museum and this is an ass for
plasmid that people the citizens of
rachet can purchase and will allow them
to control matter with their thoughts
right and apparently this particular ad
is targeted at people who are just too
lazy to put sugar on their own coffee
there's another there's another ad this
one for a later version near an improved
version of the same plasmid and of
course this has a little bit more of a
mainstream appeal right it's not just
lifting spoons now it's the ability to
lift a couch and and clean up back in on
the vacuum under the couch and you know
of course for those of you who haven't
realized this this comes from a
fictional storyline about the West
created for the game
Bioshock which one of them was one of
the most played or popular games in 2008
spanning as well to 2009 wouldn't it be
great to to be able to control matter
just using your thoughts and you know
what what why wouldn't be why wouldn't
we we be able to do anymore I mean
controlling matter is cool but what
about controlling atoms controlling
interfaces controlling screens every
every user interface that you find out
there you know walking in walking to an
ATM and not having to actually push any
buttons at all just with the power of
your mind the ATM guesses that or knows
that you want to check your balance or
you want to
get some money out of a part of the bank
and without actually any significant
effort you can just do so well of course
this is a fictional storyline this is
this is of course impossible however on
September 28th this year David Thomas
who is Quality Assurance analyst for a
company in in a game developer
development company based in Vancouver
created this tweet I'm just gonna read
it for you David Thomas says just
installed HootSuite is that the right
pronunciation yeah I guess sometimes my
English fails me I just installed
installed HootSuite for Android and
typed this without physically touching
my phone and then he refers to a couple
of hashtags accessibility Tecla and this
is actually the result of work that that
started at the inclusive design Research
Center in the summer of 2010 as part of
an experiment that was made possible by
the google Summer of Code program with a
student that started working on you know
could we actually control a phone
without actually touching it and I mean
in one year or a little bit over a year
it has evolved all the way into a
product that is about to be commercial
is released and I'm going to explain
what how this all works and and what
this all means but before I do that I'm
gonna I'm gonna go and explain a very
odd very bizarre world which is the
upside-down world of disability and this
is a world in which power wheelchairs
which are you know basically robotic
chairs that you don't have to make any
physical or any significant physical
effort to to drive
cost more than the last car you you
bought right maybe a couple of times
more maybe up to three four times more
even this is social world in which
single purpose assistive devices can
cost over ten thousand dollars with
failure rates of 50% in the last three
months and this is real data from the
centralized equipment pool which is a
program by the run by the province of
Ontario in Canada that provides
assistive technologies for people with
disabilities this is the actual failure
rate for one of the most popular
products they have and we're going to
say they the name is that's not the
point but its main purpose is to
generate speech for people who cannot
actually speak by themselves so this
would be a machine that basically shows
a flat screen and a bunch of icons that
people select and they go through a few
different menus until they composure and
complete sentence and they press play
myself sentence and the gadget speaks
for them so they can go to coffee shop
and order a latte or they can you know
request a ticket at a movie theater and
that's exactly the the that's exactly
the case right this this thing can cost
up to ten thousand dollars and it fails
quite and quite a bit and this is also a
world in which all this is requested all
this expense is requested from people
who on average have only 72% of the
income that they're able-bodied peers
have that's again data for the for the
province of Ontario in Canada and is you
know more or less very similar in most
of the developed countries in the modern
world so you know obviously as you can
see this this bizarre world of
assistive technology and the bizarre
world of the civility is expensive is
completely unsustainable and it provides
it's buggy right basically and it
provides better than nothing
workarounds are supposed to real
effective fixes for for what people
expect or for what any of any of us
would expect so why is this well I've
heard over the years I've been working
my region I have been working with
people with disabilities for about ten
years now and we've we've heard all
sorts of reasons why this is the case
you know you can say well the market is
kind of small right like there's a very
few people using these things so it's
going to be complicated specialized
equipment is required and that's
expensive you have to you have to
customize things to fulfill the needs of
these users and you know that takes time
and that takes effort there's also a
high risk there's a lot of liability
issues involved but I think with all of
that is is kind of looking at looking at
the problem from from the wrong end of
the of the of the spectrum right if
you're looking at the problem once it's
already there right once this once it
has already been created yeah so of
course yes if if people can't use a
particular interface if people can't
have access to a specific building of
course it's very expensive to do it
because you did into it and in the
beginning right so just us is not
necessary for for for wheelchair users
nowadays for instance to carry around a
piece of plywood if they want to go for
a straw justice it is not necessary
because there's already many cities that
have Corker curved curved cuts it
shouldn't actually be necessary to have
a ten thousand dollar piece of equipment
of dedicated hardware
there will be no need for that if
mainstream devices such as you know the
Android platforms such as iPhone
smartphones tablets all those products
if those products were accessible then
they wouldn't be need any need for a ten
thousand dollar piece of dedicated
hardware right so yes if you look at it
from the perspective of the context in
which things are already inaccessible
there's a lot of justifications for that
right we're not actually making it
accessible but if you step back and and
realize that it that these values are
actually caused by the fact that in the
first place it wasn't made accessible
then you realize what a what a
significant gap that can be and what it
what a significant gap this kind of
context can create and I'm gonna talk a
little bit more about this as I get into
them into the talk so we are the
inclusive design Research Center decided
well this is this is not acceptable
right this is not the way it should be
and we try to figure out how do how do
how do we do it so that people with
disabilities say power wheelchair users
can access the same functionality the
same power that is expected that not any
of us expect from mobile devices from
the new technologies from information
technology how do we do it so that they
can access it without having to go to
these bizarre extremes of charging
thousands of dollars and creating
segregated spaces and markets that you
know play by their own rules and all
that and and we decided we realize at
the moment that the emerging
technologies emerging mobile
technologies offered significant
significant opportunity for so solving
all these issues so we went to all of
them at
at the time and looked at which which of
these platforms can provide the most
natural built-in way of accessing or on
or tapping on all that potential without
having to to to create our own thing
from scratch right so right right from
the beginning we realized there was a
couple of a couple of devices or a
couple of platforms that we could just
not use they were still trying to to get
their act together it was just
impossible to consider we later consider
the the iPhone and iPod fly from the iOS
mobile platform but it was just too you
know it it has too many limitations for
what you can do as a developer at the
time you couldn't you couldn't run
background processes you couldn't you
couldn't enhance or substitute the input
method which was essential we wanted to
be able to control the phone or control
these devices through alternative input
methods not just the touch screen or the
or the keyboard we wanted to be able to
to allow people who can't actually use
their hands to to control these devices
so for that we needed to to have a way
to to either enhance or substitute the
input method and at the time the iOS
simply didn't have that that option
didn't offer that option we also looked
at Java there were some neat things that
we could do written in Midlands but at
the end of the day mid let's run on
foreign operating systems and if we
didn't have access to those operating
systems we wouldn't we wouldn't be able
to achieve what we wanted to achieve
Semien was interesting they were also
going through a big transition and at
the end of the day they also
you know it was possible to to
substitute the input method and enhance
it but we will have to deal with
upstream pressures right to to their to
the project and it was unlikely or we
didn't know whether we were going to be
able to to influence the development of
that project at all the Maemo platform
was very very attractive because it was
already open source it was based on
Linux you know he had all the all the
right ingredients and allow these kinds
of platforms to be enhanced by the
community but all of a sudden they
decided to drop keyboard access keyboard
access to their platform there was no
more focus highlighting there was no
more basically he bored access right so
there was nothing we could do for the
first version of mingi that that came
out of that the accessibility team at
Research In Motion being Canadian it was
very very eager to get this working on
their platform we had a few technical
discussions about how to do this
and we ended up with a with a possible
solution the only disadvantage was we
had to rewrite the entire input method
from scratch and we didn't have to we
didn't have access to the to the to the
built-in input method on on BlackBerry
devices would have to be a separate
application and and try to do a bit of
hacking to hide their input method and
and half-hours come and come up to the
front so it was possible but it was it
was a bit a bit more than the necessary
the work that was was a bit more than
than what we were looking for and
finally the only the only real real
option for achieving this ended up being
Android and that was a very very of his
choice by the end so the Android
platform could at the time and still can
or still allows background processes to
run on the device which are essential to
be able to you know get information from
alternative devices which is what we
wanted we didn't want to have to ask the
the alternative device every time you
know pull it and say hey are you are you
still there are you okay do you have any
news for me
Android would allow us to just simply
send notification directly notifications
directly to the operating system and and
go with it
we were also like blackberry and Symbian
and memo we were also able to either
enhance or substitute entirely the input
method but the the the real thing that
made us go for Android was we didn't
have to start from scratch right so we
could just fork the import method that
was built into the Android platform and
then add the features that we required
and then republish as a new as a new
application which is actually what we
ended up doing and the result if this
animation works is this is the Tecla
access project and the Tecla access or
the tickle access system this system is
composed of two or it has two main
components I'm gonna I think I forgot my
my laser pointer but I'm going to show
you here with the with the pointer in
the screen the one of the components is
a hardware component is called the Tecla
shield and the other component is a free
app downloadable from the Android Market
right now we just pushed the latest
version on Wednesday which has a lot of
really neat features and and basically
what what the application does is more I
guess I'm going to have to I'm going to
go the other way actually
is a little bit awkward compartment so
we have a user say you know in a power
wheelchair and something I should
mention here is there's a lot of there's
a lot of resources are going to making
sure that a power wheelchair fits the
user there's a lot of things that you
you know don't usually think about like
seating for instance so these are people
that are going to be sitting on their
wheelchairs for 12 14 16 hours so they
straight many of these people don't have
the ability to adjust you know when one
side of their leg gets tired you know
usually if you're sitting around you're
moving around you feel a little room
comfortable you change positions well
this is not the case in in many cases
with people with disabilities so the
seating there's a lot of attention and
resources and money and people that are
invested just in making sure that people
won't get what is called pressure sores
which is you know you use you state too
much with an unevenly distributed weight
on a single part of your body and then
the blood flow gets cut off and then
there's infections and then you know
they can be even open wounds so that's
that serious stuff right so there needs
to be a lot of work invested in in
making sure that doesn't happen there's
also a lot of work in making sure that
the whatever interface the person uses
to drive the wheelchair is the best they
can do so some people for instance have
difficulty controlling gross movement
say if they want if they were to to go
and try to push a button there will be
all sorts of unwanted movements and and
then hitting the button is like a it's
like a crapshoot kind of thing right
sometimes they hate it sometimes they
don't so some of those people will use
their heads for instance so there's
going to be header race mounted on the
wheelchair so that they can with the
movement of their head drive drive the
wheels around some of them will use
shoulder
switches tongues which is sip-and-puff
switches with a straw and they just blow
on in
they blow higher there and we'll do
something else so there's this really
quite a quite a this is really quite an
art form to actually figure out what
works best for these people and this is
all done in in most of the developed
countries at least that I don't know
that I know of and Canada a lot of these
cost is subsidized by either government
agencies or not-for-profit organisations
but the point is there's literally tens
of thousands of dollars that go into
this and hundreds of hours or man-hours
going into making sure that this one
person is going to have the ability to
drive around right because mobility is
one of the first and most essential
needs that you will have as a person
with us moderate to severe mobility
impairment and then once it's all done
in many cases that's all that's all you
can do right you have you have the
perfect interface feed it to your body
you have wheelchair that that you're
driving around with with a 12-volt car
battery on it and that's that's it right
you go in front of an ATM and you can't
use it you go in front of an iPad or an
Android device and you can't use it
right so we were we were wondering well
can we tap into this into this effort
right there's a lot of people that have
already solved that problem so why don't
we just stop into that provide some kind
of interface some kind of mediator and
then people can't just do whatever they
whatever they want to do like anybody
else right and this is what the Tecla
access project attempts to do so we see
here a power wheelchair user what you
can imagine to be a power wheelchair
user and the this the Tecla shield is
connected
to their power wheelchair or can be
connected to the power wheelchair it can
also be connected to two standard on/off
switches like this one this is a very
standard switch that occupational
therapists and rehab centers all over
the world use this is actually a sample
you know one of the product the latest
prototypes of the of the Tecla shield so
the Tecla shield allows allows these
people to control the device with the
interface they're already familiar with
or they already have right so there's no
need to fit anything else or create any
other special equipment you get the
Tecla shield which is a bluetooth device
and then be a Bluetooth the signals are
transmitted to the app that is running
on the phone that has a background
process reading the the Bluetooth input
and then it uses that to to allow people
to control the phone with as little as a
single switch so I can actually control
the phone and I think this is connected
yeah so I can actually control a phone
with a single switch and this is
significant because you know the single
switches are probably the minimal unit
of access in in mobility impairments so
there's you know no matter how severe
the the impairment is in most cases or
there's going to be a way to fit at
least a single switch right now it's a
little bit hard to show you how that
works it's it's easier to show you in
person so we have a set up here and I
can show you later after they after the
talk perhaps so what I'm going to try to
do is do it with with the emulator with
the Android emulator and oops let's see
let's go okay so I have a I have a stock
Android API level seven here running and
let me see if I can it doesn't have the
application I'm going to uninstall the
application just very quickly where it
actually want to run this top five
because I know that when no one does
have it let's see do you have any any
questions any comments until now are you
comfortable you're following the they
talk yeah that's good to know
okay yeah so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you the application on the
Android emulator as I said the
application itself has a mode called the
full-screen switch mode which basically
turns inside the entire screen into a
single switch so you we use it for for
demoing it and for testing in practice
this is not necessarily a very good idea
these these things this switches get
abused pretty pretty badly so it would
be a bad idea or well in many cases it
would be a bad idea to just have the
phone there as a single switch for for
someone to use but it does go as far as
showing how how this can work although
the simulator reset the memory I guess
it does okay so let's install it install
it quickly on this talk five let's see
okay so he's installing now it's done so
there's gonna be a use the mouse here
there you go
take my axis it's not showing the icon
for some reason but then the next thing
is I go into settings I go into language
and keyboard Tecla axis enable it and
then I have to go and select it because
it's an input method so I have to
substitute the in the stock input method
sure
and of course as it should happen
maybe I'm installing the wrong version
okay so let's try let's try that
installation again oh geez it's not
let's try that again
French there you go
so we said stuck live nygma so I'm going
to stop five let's see what's going on
I'm gonna I'm gonna try just one more
time
let's let's try Wittstock seven
do you
okay so again I go into settings
language in keyboard select the Tecla
access input method and then substitute
the substitute the input method here you
go
take the axis I'm wearing and then the
last thing I want to do is going to the
Tecla access settings and then activate
fullscreen switch phone so there you go
so this is how fullscreen switch mode
looks like and as you can see there's an
always-on on-screen keyboard at the
bottom the keyboard is self scanning is
the the cell scanning feature has been
activated and now whenever I wanted to
do something I just have to wait for the
highlight to get there to get to the
command I want to send and then press
anywhere on the on the screen so if I
want to go back to my home screen for
instance I will wait until back button
is highlighted and there you go then I
wait maybe for the down arrow I'm going
to try to open the browser so it's
highlighting and then I wait for the
okay highlight hit it and now the
browser is opening right so this is so
using a single a single switch even in
the browser I don't know if I have a I
don't have a wireless connection now so
it's not gonna do much but even in the
browser I can use this same the same I
have a monitor here I've been trying to
I can use the same
- go and browse all of the active links
so you can see even there in the in the
404 page I can go into the link itself
and then just keep browsing right from
there I'm going to go back now maybe to
the phone to the phone application so
again this is so using a single switch I
go into the phone application press ok
I'm doing it slowly enough that I know
I'm not going to make any mistakes the
actual usage of this kind of application
tend to go really really fast because
you know we have to remember these are
interfaces that are specifically
designed for them the interfaces they
use to switch interfaces they use I made
a mistake there so I'm gonna go back and
then I started dialing the phone number
for instance so I'm just gonna do a 6
for 7 thing which is the area code for
Toronto cellphones
there you go 6 4 of course it's gonna be
easier if I already have my contact and
in the contacts list and I can just go
to the list and go down down down and
select it all right but that's it that's
a basic idea
this is just so you get so you get the
idea of this and as I said we can we can
try it out after they after they talk
with the with the actual device and then
we're gonna we're gonna move on to the
next slide and I'm going to show you a
video of the first the first user of
this first actual user of this system a
Guan is a master's engineering master's
student at the University of Toronto he
was actually the first student that
started the codebase as part of the
Google summer
you can see there how his well the video
is not great quality but you can see
there how he's moving their highlights
in the keyboard in the first version the
highlights were very faint grade now we
as you saw in the emulator we made them
a bit a bit more clear and he's
basically in that particular case he's
trying to open the half drawer
so even though he finally gets her open
and yeah that's that's actually not
single switch because if you you
probably saw him backing out and there's
no self scanning so he actually has
access to three switches a day I believe
and he uses he drives his wheelchair
with a with a sip-and-puff
interface so he blows and sucks for for
the switches to be activated there's
soft soft shift so soft path hard save
heart puff so in total he has for access
to four switches I believe he has a
separate head switch if I'm correct to
switch between the wheelchair and the
phone right because that's the other you
don't want the wheelchair to go while
you're using the phone of course and
then once he's in the in the application
he goes in and starts typing hello I
think I remember exactly what he was
typing there it's not very clear but
that was the first prototype this was
completed after the Summer of Code 2009
No 2010 so about a year ago and and
since then that's Erik won again he's
doing I'm he was starting the Masters
then I think he said he's going to be
done next year and in one year with
we've come all the way to to this this
is a this is the the first logo you saw
there is a startup company that is or
has been set up to commercialize this
this technology it's open-source
technology there
hardware is based on the Arduino
prototyping platform this particular
video shows Carolyn who's an intern in a
magazine company that edits magazines
and she's talking about her experiences
and her hopes as they bury the first
better beta tester of this particular
device this one is particularly
interesting because even though Eric one
was actually you know using a straw and
touching the straw to be able to to
control the phone Carolyn doesn't
actually touch anything because here the
head switch heads which is her head
switch array is composed of proximity
sensors so basically she just leans to
one side and or to another and that's
how she activates or she has access to
the to the phone so if you if you think
about the initial slide that I show you
the couple initial slides that I'll show
you I think this is pretty pretty close
to something like telekinetic control of
Android ran like Carolyn is is
absolutely not touching any interface to
be able to control this you can see here
again in the first session we were
trying to - what she was getting used to
the interface and getting used to how to
control it she uses two switches she
does use cell scanning the second switch
is for canceling whatever action that
she that she did that that she did not
want to do for correcting mistakes and
so I'll leave that video like that and
then I'm going to go back to
the slides so this is just a sample of
the kinds of things we've been we've
been hearing this is a mom of one of our
beta testers she she came into the
office the other day and I mean is it's
not it's just it's great I guess to have
someone like here with a green in her
face saying you know my son text me now
every day from school
that's Carolyn I feel that Tecla has
given me even more independence and
there's also one of the rehab engineers
that we work with at the Bloorview
McMillan children actually it's not a
living Macmillan anymore Holland
Bloorview kids rehabilitation and God
about what he thinks the hope for these
kind of technologies now beyond this
point I really want you to know that
this is is you know regardless of what I
say next this has definitely been
possible in a great part because of
Google and because of the Android team
right so the Android team is there
anybody here from the Android team not
here well you should let them know their
work has made this possible and no other
no other platform no other company has
been able to provide these kind of
facilities to do this with that said
there are some issues and and and this
is actually why I came to I came here
I'm more interested on saying what are
the remaining barriers that exist this
is a screenshot of many options that is
coming on top of a input method so you
can't actually see the keyboard there
this is the standard behavior for any
Android platform the problem is
not only that users can't see the
keyboard but the keyboard events are
sent to the activity in the background
or in the back behind the keyboard
therefore this particular menu is
completely not accessible to these users
and just to give you an analogy of what
that means you know with the Android
platform users are able to browse the
launcher and open applications and maybe
you know open up the browser follow a
few links so there's a lot of work
already done here to to mitigate that
very significant barrier then you can
even go further and you know there's
there's lots of things there's a lot of
barriers that this source but then at
the very end we have a little bit of a
problem there right so there's there's
no way to get around that and it's and
it's just it's just the way it is right
this is another example this is actually
a little bit worst because at least the
other one you can you can somehow escape
from this is this one is a temporal
breaking of the phone earlier dialogues
and spinners also come on top of the
keyboard so when they when they appear
and there's no way to tell or to predict
when they will appear the user is
effectively locked out of the phone
right there's no other way to do it we
in the software we have workarounds for
this but it's not a fix it's a
workaround we basically call home allow
them to call home and they press a
switch for a really long time and then
it just goes back to the launcher but
this particular top of the dialog
basically has or is equivalent of you
know it's great I'm going to go down I'm
gonna go in my ramp and I'm so glad that
this thing is accessible and then all of
a sudden
there's no way to go and it and in this
one you can't even go backwards right
you're just stuck waiting for someone to
get you out of there out of that trouble
all you know however you know if I was
to do a completely arbitrary scale of
you know whether the this Android system
is either a paper waiter or all the way
from a paper way to to awesome I would
still put it very close to awesome right
like it's great it's just great that
people can make phone calls can you know
going to Twitter you do whatever the
hell they want to do same as anybody
else would right there's a few other
minor issues but you know of course this
is just a first try or at least with the
milestone with well in miles from was
branded in Canada was implanted in
mouseland this is the Droid here I guess
that was the first really successful or
what people see as a first really
successful commercial example of the
Android platform working on a mainstream
device and and it's also the first try
of something close to to full
accessibility right so to get that high
that soon it's pretty pretty impressive
the the later releases Froyo gingerbread
did a few a few fixes on a couple of
applications so for instance Gmail if
you use Gmail in in the Droid it was not
possible to to look at different
accounts because that was part of the
options menu he was also not possible to
go into different labels because I was
also part of the inaccessible option
options menu but then they there was a
fix and there was the the Android team
creating a nice Android bar and then you
had your labels and you accounts at the
top and they were so highlighted and
keyboard accessible so people could
could use the phones and the other thing
is something that that hit Android in
general I think and you know it was
definitely not googles or the Android
the Android team fault which is they
started the platform exploded and there
was all sorts of broken built out there
and you know the the wireless carriers
in Canada said oh we don't like the
designers at Google they make ugly
interfaces so we're gonna make our own
and it's gonna be great and that's great
except they broke everything that the
accessibility team had worked on there
was no highlighting there was no
keyboard accessibility so it happened
first with the with the Samsung Galaxy
the Sony Ericsson phones you could make
a call but you can't actually hang up
because the button for hanging up is not
highlighted their sole source of all
sorts of issues we had LG LG phones
Turin fits with with when bluetooth was
shut off because they wouldn't they
wouldn't close the socket the Bluetooth
socket cleanly so that the phone will do
all these crazy things before before
killing the socket all sorts of worker
workarounds we had to write in the
software but you know if if you stuck
with the the Google evaluated next
success for instance you still had a
pretty good a pretty good experience
there was a few issues here and there
but you know that that problem of the of
the fragmentation broken builds just
just really did impacted the whole the
whole experience so I would put it a
little bit lower right it's not in this
particular case is not Google's fault
and it just it just happened to be like
that the problem is I was really excited
about the the Ice Cream Sandwich
release this week and I was I was very
eager to see the keynote was it this
week earlier this week I think yeah and
I saw the video I in the video people
mentioned something about accessibility
they mentioned that there were
enhancements and I was really excited
because I said well they're so close
right Google and Android are so close
and if they are mentioning enhancements
then you know I'm pretty sure they're
already there you know for for for
making sure that those pop-ups go behind
the keyboard there's actually just one
flag right it doesn't cost too much it's
not too much trouble to just turn it on
or turn it off maybe they realized it
you know within BC working on this
project we haven't had time to spam you
with bug reports and all that but you
know maybe they already realized by
themselves so I went ahead and and tried
the Ice Cream Sandwich bill where they
named oh this one did like it I went
ahead and tried in and the first screen
that I encounter here is the launcher
you know we have highlighting not not as
great as the previous versions but you
know it works people people know where
they are I go up I don't know if you
notice I'm already in the Google bar in
the Google search part not highlighting
is a little a little less a little less
obvious but you know people maybe can
get used to it that's that's not it's
not the end of the world right so let's
go and into the hop drawer and then I'm
going to try to select to select
an application and actually I have no
idea now where I am I guess I am in the
in the apps we think I'm going to go
into widgets see what I can do there
nothing no highlighting really well
maybe maybe is just low I tried it at
home a few times and and the highlights
never appeared and I don't know like I
really felt how do you say it when when
you feel there's nothing you can do
you're at the mercy of someone else
these are worth more than in English and
this is basically what what happened so
I did a bunch of a bunch of tests the
app drawer as you saw is unusable this
custom use now some of the settings for
instance in the in the keyboard the
keyboard options were a little bit
awkward before because they were divided
into you had to first select it in the
checkbox and then go to the settings and
the settings had the same name and
people got a little bit confused
so the Ice Cream Sandwich sold that
solves that problem really well because
then they create a custom view that has
a checkbox the name of the keyboard and
the icon for the settings on one side
right great if you actually go into the
into that with a keyboard you can't
actually access the settings you can't
actually uncheck the check box so that's
a lot of those setting boxes are
unusable now there's broken apps now and
and those are the built-in apps so if I
go I tried going into the contacts
manager I think is called
for now you go into people and then the
first thing you ask you is to create
your profile there's a little button and
yeah if you touch it it works if you try
to go in with the keyboard again it
doesn't work it highlights you press ok
which is the d-pad Center event on the
keyboard and nothing happens right so
that's now unusable the one thing that
it seems to to be aiming to fix though
is the broken builds right apparently my
understanding is that the bills are of
Android shooter it should be a lot less
fragmented now well I guess we'll have
to see but this is the first time that
this is actually something we can't use
right like we we went all the way
backwards so now this excitement about
about being able to control the phone
about you know people in wheelchairs
being able to telepathically or
telekinetically command their phones to
do water well but what they wish is gone
right in this in this particular version
and I can't help to think I'm I know
there's there's must be there must be a
plan for this I can't imagine there's
not a plan for this but I can't help
thinking was this just an accident but
this but this accessibility level of
accessibility really just accidental
like maybe maybe they under treatment
and the Android team didn't even know
that and I talked to my supervisor about
this and my supervisor said make sure to
let them know that there's others out
there that are starting to get in the
kind of work in accessibility that the
iOS 4 did for people with visual
impairments was phenomenal phenomenal
and now in iOS 5 they're mentioning
switch axes right so now we're what
what's going to happen then and
this one this one here apparently the
green one was accidental right this one
is purposeful so I wonder I wonder what
will happen and the question is what
what you wanted to happen
what does Android what does the Android
team wanted to happen I meant to call
this slide the silly the silly it's
called stealing math but it's more like
the silly argument I could stay here and
talk to you or I could like I could talk
to you now about the hundreds of
thousands of people just in the US and
Canada who are depending on this kind of
technology to to be able to eliminate
the virus that that currently exists to
mobile devices I could also talk to you
about you know the fact that
historically from anywhere from
Alexander Graham Bell to recurse will
any of the developers that know any of
us are developers as developers who work
on technology that solve some kind of
accessibility problems has a really high
probability of creating the next best
technology that Ray Kurzweil invented a
flatbed scanner trying to figure out how
to read characters from from paper right
so that people with visual impairments
could read them Alexander Graham Bell
you meant the phone trying to figure out
how to or trying to understand how the
human ear works to try to help some deaf
children in a school that he was working
on and you know the the the one that I
think is the silliest one of all you
will make some money doing this right
like this there's gonna be more people
buying or using Android just because
it's accessible right but I I just feel
this these kinds of arguments are very
silly I was talking to him to a PhD
student at
at the entire institute of studies in
education it's called they have a human
rights program there and I started with
a with a very bad question which is
usually the worst question you can ask a
PhD student I asked what are you doing
right and and you know was who I was
I was waiting already for the full hour
just nodding not having any idea why he
was gonna say and he said well do you
know you have heard of this term
systemic racism right have you heard
about them and I said yeah yeah I've
heard that term well I'm trying to
figure out what makes it systemic I'm
trying to figure out what is it that
makes racism systemic because we all
know about about that that term right
but what is it that actually makes it
systemic and that's what that's why I
feel these arguments are silly it's like
to me is like you know trying to try to
tell the Montgomery City Transport
Authority that they're gonna make a few
bucks if they let Rosa Parks it wherever
they were whatever she wants right I
guess just like should we really are we
really doing this this day is it not
just the right thing to do to make sure
that these things are accessible and
it's not like you know there's a lot of
a lot of work to be done
remember the Android team was already
here you know very close to very close
to awesome I want to I want to see it
there and I'm sure and I know they
inclusive design Research Center wants
to see it there and I'm positive Komodo
Openlab the startup company that was
created to commercialize the technology
wants to see it there too and it's not
it doesn't seem like it's like it's too
hard especially if you were already
there so I'm going to talk about and I
want to close off with with an example
of just beautiful beautiful inclusive
design and beautiful design
that is existing now in the Android
platform this sir these are a couple
screenshots you have on the on what is
it my left your left - yeah you have a
screenshot of the Android of the droid
phone which is the to this day the one
that works best with this crown of
technology and on the right you have an
example of voice actions the boys
actions and voice search app and the
very interesting thing about voice
actions is that is a is an alert
dialogue that actually comes below the
keyboard I have no idea why come speaker
below the keyboard but it's actually a
fully functional it makes it fully
functional it makes it fully functional
with with alternative inputs my guess is
the Android team is trying to anticipate
the market of the distracted driver
right so drivers are people like people
are in wheelchairs that cannot handle
the phone they're in a context in a
particular situation in which in some
cases is illegal to actually be holding
the phone in other cases they just can't
because there they should be paying
attention to the road right so if I'm
trying to create an application that
allows them to send an email with their
voice for instance I have to make sure
that they can use it without ever
touching it right and that's that's my
guess of why that the dialogue actually
exists and it works the way it works so
if you want to go for it if you want to
let the Android team know that's that's
the that's the beauty of inclusive
design right you design or you try to
design for people who can't handle the
phone and you end up benefiting a lot
more people than you think right and
just to just to close off and I guess it
just follows naturally from this
disability is still nowadays is
considered some kind of deficit or
illness but it is very obvious I think
as far as I as far as I can tell from
what I try to to say here it's very
obvious to me that it is more than
result of basically inaccessible
environments and most of all
discriminatory context right
so you know that's that's about it for
me and hopefully well both of us
Mauricio and I are completely committed
to working with whoever we can work and
whoever is necessary to make sure that
Android goes all the way to the awesome
side of the spectrum right so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
