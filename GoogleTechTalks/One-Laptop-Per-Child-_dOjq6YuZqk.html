pronounce his name is ahead chief
trouble maker at OLPC I'm sure he
brought one I have an XO a couple other
people here probably have one ah there
is one let's all play the match game
afterwards in the meantime one request
since this is going to be life on google
video and they're actually visitors in
the audience as i think i can see here
please keep your confidential your
google confidential questions to
yourself or ask them quietly afterwards
not while it's being videotaped so i
give you even kristich thank you hi so
it's a pleasure to be here thanks for
having me in terms of the structure of
this I'm going to there's a lot of
things that I want to tell you about and
I'm going to try and run through this
pretty quickly and then have a sort of
an ask me anything segment at the end so
helo tells me that that people here are
very technical and if you guys are going
to have technical questions so I've
tried to make a talk technical and if
it's not technical enough for you you
know by the end by all means you can ask
questions that are as technical as you
could possibly like them to be we're
also i know a bunch of us are having
lunch afterwards so you're welcome to
join us for that as well and you know
bug me more with questions so i'm going
to super briefly tell you you know who i
am i want to before we get into the
technology i want to tell you what it is
that all pc is actually trying to do
because we because there is so much cool
technology that we're working on there's
a there's sort of a real risk that when
technical people see the project they
just get carried away by the technology
and they don't actually pause to think
what it is that we're trying to do and
why does any of this matter and you know
the project was not started because of
the technology so i'll tell you about
how we're actually doing this laptop and
how we're building it and then you know
hopefully i'll tell you how you are
building a laptop and helping us out so
my my position in addition to being the
chief troublemaker at the OPC which is a
prediction position i i'm i'm proud of i
run security I've I've been designing
the security architecture for OPC which
I'll talk about a little bit later it's
sort of a pretty pretty different take
on security than what most of you guys
has suspect are used to and my
background this assistance so when I
start talking about the gooey stuff etc
I get a little fuzzy on it and you can
probably find questions that I won't
completely be able to answer if they're
about the graphical sort of soft and
fuzzy things so obviously came to me
sometime in the middle of last year and
in the first five minutes of talking to
Walter bender who is the president of
all bc he asked me the following three
questions first can you make a hundred
million laptops secure can you rewrite
our file system and oh by the way can
you make this usable by six year olds
now I you know I here google has pretty
tough job interviews but as far as job
interviews go I have to say I haven't
really heard these kinds of questions
before so you know I was I was I was
hooked but I didn't really know that
much about all bc i mean i've heard
about it i'd seen it in the news I
without sort of the end of my exposure
so I sort of set out to to figure out
more what what these guys are actually
trying to do here is the goal of all pc
forwards right change how kids learn and
you'll notice that the word laptop is
sort of conspicuously you know missing
from from that goal well you know change
how kids learn why you know why bother
right most of the people who are here
have gone through the normal sort of
formal learning process and you know
we're for the most part all turned out
okay some some more insane than others
but you know in general we're okay so
why what's broken about it and why why
fix it so here's something strange and
and you know normally I have a lot more
to say about this so if you if you're
curious we can talk about it afterwards
but
I'm trying to compress this part here
here's the here's the weirdest thing
that that I sort of found about formal
learning right by the time you're three
or four you will have learned what what
I call the fundamental principles and
these are the sort of very deep truths
that are that are completely non-obvious
if you haven't learned them as a kid
things like you know the Sun goes up and
goes back down and if you jump you fall
back down and water is wet and fire is
hot and I mean these are deep things
that you learn as a kid and then never
really you know think about ever again
because they're just sort of second
nature but you learn these things by the
time you're three or four and at five or
six you come into school and and the the
learning process thats taught you
everything you know up to that point
goes out the window just you know just
like that I mean there's there's pretty
much a literal flag day where where it
just stops being actual and changes
completely how does it change right well
up until then until your three or four
the way you've been learning is you get
curious about something you don't decide
to say well today's I'm going to go and
do some learning it's it's you know you
you go through your day and you have
hundreds of questions and you ask them
to parents and and friends and peers and
you get answers and you keep integrating
this into your sort of vision of how the
world works and this happens sort of all
day everywhere and when you enter school
this this completely changes to the
point where learning starts being driven
by an authority figure not not by your
curiosity it happens for particular
hours it's unidirectional and there is
one guy like me basically you know
trying to impart knowledge on you and it
happens in a particular place and you
know we know that this can actually work
great I mean it can definitely work very
well if you have a great teacher if you
have a lousy teacher it's it works not
so well and if you don't have a teacher
at all it doesn't work at all right so
this is a this is not a stock photo this
is a picture that we took either in
Argentina or Brazil I forget but you
know this is a staggering number there
are 1,000,000,000 kids of school age in
the developing world
I mean we're talking one-sixth of the
entire world population so what are
these kids lack it's it's a hopefully
clearly not ability right i mean i
actually get people telling me asking me
things like well how do you know these
kids are really capable of learning the
same way that we all are and that that
sounds like an outrageous question to me
but I've actually gotten asked so i won
one way I've come up of trying to
convince people that that kids black
opportunity and not ability is that if
you take China and you rank people by IQ
and you take the top 25% that top 25%
there's there's more people in there
than the entire population of North
America so clearly it's not going to be
a matter of ability clearly it's a
matter of these kids not having
opportunity so you know I I think we can
agree that that that certainly education
in developing world leaves a lot to be
desired and at this point the people who
founded the OPC later said well how do
we fix it right what can we do to make
this better one way you could try and
fix this is to some kind of you know big
top down rethinking of how schools in
general are supposed to work you know
develop into some kind of global
curriculum it's sort of this this big
operation that you know if you're very
optimistic could take 50 to 100 years I
personally think it would never happen
but you know if you're super optimistic
maybe in a hundred years this can happen
a hundred years is a long time right i
mean think where we were in 1907 google
certainly wasn't around we are way too
impatient we being all pc right i mean
we this was discussed and and people
said well can't we do something now I
mean can't we just try and make this
better right away so if we were trying
to do this what what how would we fix it
right well one thing we'd want to do is
try and get peer learning back into the
picture I mean it worked until you were
three or four it worked phenomenally
talk to you most of everything let's
let's do that again let's let's get
learning driven by curiosity again
you know kids should be able to have
some kind of way to get curious and get
answers regardless of whether their
teacher can provide them or doesn't know
or isn't there so it was only at this
point in the thinking process that
laptops really entered the picture and
we said well you know laptops would be
one way that we could try fixing things
right now and then let schooling in
general schooling mind you being very
different from education fix itself over
time so I'm going to dive into the
technology but because I've caught the
education part so short you know if any
of this is unconvincing by all means
come come and talk to me afterwards so
after we decided fine we're building a
laptop we're going to do this how do you
build a laptop for kids how do you build
a laptop that kids are supposed to carry
around with them everywhere they go
they're supposed to use in climates like
Libya where there's fine sand and
extremely hot temperatures in places
where you know there's there's a lot of
rain the laptops can get splashed and
and wet you don't want to have tapped
replace parts every three months you
don't want the laptop to break if
someone drops them how do you do that so
I'll tell you about the DxO one laptop
that I know several people are holding
so there we go so that's the laptop and
I'll we can pass them around a little
bit later so here's what what's in those
particular laptops and here's what
previously we were trying to trying to
ship with its a little geode low-power
processor running at a wat 266 megahertz
you know no l2 cache a very small amount
of a one cache we've actually done a
significant hardware update this is
pretty recent news in the last in the
last couple of weeks we've gone up to a
433 megahertz processor with massively
more cash which actually speeds up
Python about two to three hundred
percent in in certain cases I'll tell
you a little bit later why why we're
curious about Python I mean
we care about this a lot but it's now
actually a quite a reasonable hardware
configuration and because we also jumped
from point 15 microns CPU which was the
GX 20 point 13 micron LX we can we can
do all of this and use twenty percent
less power so this is a point eight wat
processor we doubled the amount of RAM
to 256 Meg's we doubled the amount of
NAND flash storage to a gigabyte there's
no hard drive there are no moving parts
so our primary storage is a piece of
NAND flash that we can wear level in the
kernel and make sure that it's it's
utilized equally across the board and
that's a file system called jffs2 when
we say ultra low power consumption we
really mean it our peak power
consumption is for 25 watts the big
power consumption of your laptops go up
to you know 40 to 50 watts our standard
power consumption if you're not if
you're not pegging the CPU is closer to
1 to 2 watts and quite a lot less if
you're in any kind of suspend mode we
are trying to do probably the most
aggressive work in linux power
management of anyone anywhere ever we
would like to be suspending this device
into s3 every couple of seconds if
nothing on the screen is changing we
want to be suspending the entire machine
that's that's sort of radical right I
mean your laptop's take 10-15 seconds to
suspend and resume we want to be doing
this every couple of seconds so you know
what what gives well the first thing you
do is you ditch a CPI and you roll your
own power management and the target we
have for power management is suspend and
resume at the edge of human perception
meaning we want to be able to suspend in
about a hundred milliseconds and resume
in another 100 milliseconds how do you
do that well you get help from your
firmware we're using something called
open firmware if any of you guys are
familiar with Sun machines and open boot
the person who developed open boo 20
years ago is our firm
engineer and we're running open firmware
on on our system so it's a fourth based
piece of firmware and because it plays
along with our power management we can
actually get it to be initializing the
devices that take a long time to
stabilize in parallel with the colonel
initializing a bunch of the other sort
of quicker devices and the kicker is you
know you can suspend your laptop even if
you can somehow get it to suspend
quickly if you were suspending at every
couple of seconds so nothing was
happening you would lose an image on the
screen so we put in a little ASIC that
we engineered called the daikon the
display controller which is basically a
hardware frame buffer it sits in front
of the LCD and we can essentially tell
it to freeze frame the daikon and the
LCD sit on separate power rails from the
rest of the machine and so we can
suspend basically the entirety of the
machine and keep the display active and
showing an image and as soon as you hit
a button or move the mouse in a tenth of
a second we can be back up and running
and processing whatever you need us to
process our display is a dual mode
display it's it's a technology we meant
then house it's something that does sort
of normal medium resolution color mode
but if you turn off the backlight and
flip it into monochrome mode it the
effective resolution jumps up to 1200 x
900 which is essentially 200 DPI it
looks like a book it's maybe we'll do
when we will do some some demos for you
guys a little later but it's really
quite a thing to see and the the great
thing about the LCD is that with the
backlight off it's sunlight-readable so
here you see two laptops showing the
same image on the screen and ours is a
you know the cute one we're we're
pushing the frontier on networking we're
doing mesh networking mesh networking is
another another name for sort of ad hoc
multihop networks and we're implementing
were one of the first people to
implement 802 dot 11s which is an i
triple e draft that is amending its
schedule to amend attitude at 11 and
provides multihop ad hoc networks on top
running on on top of normal 802 11 we
have rotating little coax and 10a so if
you guys see the laptops and see the
little bunny ears sticking up right the
bunny ears are actually much more than a
marketing gimmick it turns out that when
you put up the bunny ear so we get about
three extra decibels of antenna gain
which is which is significant we we have
a volunteer in the Australian outback
who does some wireless testing for us
and so we sent him a bunch of laptops
and the way that he's come to do testing
recently is he and his wife each grab a
laptop he sets up his wife's laptop to
be streaming music wirelessly to his
laptop and then they turn and face
separate directions and start walking
and when when he loses the streaming
music when he can no longer hear it they
look at gps coordinates to figure out
how far apart they are any guesses as to
what the latest numbers are two
kilometers
so this is this is real I mean this is
not lab conditions right this is actual
testing that someone other than US has
done it's still draft for those of you
who are interested in in ad hoc and
multihop writing we can happy to talk
about it more a little later but
basically it's a very simple amendment
it it provides a mandatory routing
protocol that's based on aodv but you
can also be using different protocols
for this the standard lets you as long
as you also implement this one so
because we're the first to really be
pushing this you know we're discovering
sort of all the older carry
implementation issues that you run into
only once you actually deploy something
on the software side the way that the
mesh works is we're using a ba key which
is the the free software sort of mdns
responder but we our use case is sort of
pushing the author brilliant guy by the
name of leonard tutoring to have
developed something that's not in dns
it's something called mesh dns and it's
a it's a dns SD compatible replacement
for mdns that that is built especially
with the use case of mesh networks in
mind meaning it scales a lot better it
doesn't run into many of the problems
that normal mdns runs into when you have
multi-hop networks etc and for people
who are totally software people and
aren't familiar with ad hoc networks and
multihop networks here is what here's
what essentially our use case looks like
so you know here is our school server
and you know this laptop can't hear the
school server but he can hear this
laptop and you know this laptop can
forward packets here and here and
finally they can reach a school server
and go out to the internet in the sky
yes
play with the two seconds then what the
question is what happens how does this
play with the fact that we're trying to
suspend our laptops every few seconds
which is an excellent question and after
we triumphantly decided that there's a
chance that we can get the power
management working the way we want to
that was the question that we asked yeah
well that's a great idea except now the
the mesh doesn't work so what we did is
we're using a unique networking chip in
these machines it's a chip that actually
has its own little arm 9 processor on
board self-contained and it can keep
running when the entirety of the rest of
the laptop is powered off it contains
routing tables and can do l2 forwarding
even with really nothing else in the
entire laptop functioning you know we
have all the sort of standard goodies we
have a bunch of USB ports we can take
power from almost anything that produces
a reasonable DC you know solar panels
car batteries pull cords outboard cranks
pedals you know you name it we have
stereo speakers we have a pretty fast
vga camera you know surprisingly good
picture quality we can take external
storage with the SD card slot in
addition to you know USB drives etc we
have a microphone our touchpad is it's
something that's pretty weird if you if
you look at it and you can look at it
later it's actually very wide and the
reason for this it contains three
segments the middle segment is a normal
touchpad like like what you guys have in
your laptop's that's capacitive you can
use your finger on it but you can use
all three segments of the touchpad as
essentially a resistive tablet so you
can grab a pencil or you know anything
blunt really and and use the entirety of
the wide touchpad as a tablet if you're
trying to keep teach kids how to write
you can imagine this being you know
pretty incredibly useful in addition to
sort of all the other kinds of
interesting uses you can come up with
for that in terms of batteries we were
we were pushing the envelope not on how
long one charge lasts but how many
charges we can actually get out of the
battery
we don't want to be having to replace
the batteries frequently so we were able
to do some some pretty significant
progress there but then something
interesting happened a completely new
chemistry sort of appeared out of the
blue this is a lithium faris phosphate
chemistry for batteries you can't find
out of the market yet and it's looking
reasonably likely that we might be
shipping this chemistry yeah i should
say the reason this is particularly
interesting is it's safer the nickel
metal hydride which is otherwise the
safest battery chemistry you can find
it's burns colder and it's quite a lot
lighter i did a little i don't have the
batteries on me i did a little show tell
at at PyCon and i passed around the
normal nickel metal hydride and then a
lithium faris phosphate battery of the
same size and people were pretty amazed
i mean it's almost twice the weight in a
nickel metal hydride battery we we have
normal audio that you would expect but
we hacked the the microphone port to
also act as a sensor input port meaning
we can actually read the direct line
voltage from the microphone so for fifty
cents or or dollar you can build sensors
for things like temperature or humidity
or light and hook them up directly into
your microphone jack and read the sensor
values from the laptop and have sort of
a little portable physics lab as you as
you go we're running a linux
distribution that's based on a very
stripped down almost unrecognizable
fedora core and you know one thing that
became very obvious to us is that that
we need a machine that is based on open
source and free software only why
because what you want to do here is is
you build a glass lego box right you you
give it to kids and it's worse they can
they can play with it and and see what's
what's on the inside but then then it
gets really interesting because they can
take the thing apart and change whatever
they want and put it back together and
and be able to use the things that
they've actually changed so one thing
that we were sort of in a brainstorming
session
sort of thinking about was well how
great would it be if you had like a
button on the keyboard and you pressed
and you could see the source code of the
software that you're running and it just
worked right so that's what we did so
here is our little gear key that is a
view source button and you can actually
see the source of almost anything that's
running now the problem was that after
we put the button on there we figured
out that we didn't really have any idea
how to implement this well um luckily we
we suckered heat up into doing it so you
know it we figured if anyone is smart
enough to do it the guy that wrote
Python probably is and luckily he didn't
protest too much so we're still sort of
looking to him to help us out here we we
have you no more issues I mean drive
space on this machine is it's fight it's
hard to ship the source for everything
recompile stake a long time it's not
clear we can shape the entire compiler
tool chain so you know one thing that
also started becoming clear is that you
want some way to have the the programs
that you actually run be the source code
and you know the act of running should
be the same as the act of compiling and
man if you could only program
interactively so you know the solution
is Python everything that we can
reasonably implement on in Python on
this machine will be implemented in
Python and I really mean almost
everything we're talking GUI window
manager presence communications system
boots in a demon security service
platform crypto you know file system
search basically almost anything that
runs in user space if it can be done in
Python will be done in Python there are
exceptions of course we're not going to
be reimplemented x.org in python as fun
as that would sound you know the Java he
demon is is not something that we really
want to implement the way we do sound
the way our system bus for IPC works
these are things that are going to stay
pretty much intact and we're not going
to be reimplemented that and when I run
through the list of stuff that we want
to implement in Python I sort of
mentioned the file system in quotes and
you know people usually go ha you're
going to write the file system in Python
and the short answer is yeah we're
trying to do something pretty different
here we're we're creating a centralized
storage for user documents on the
machine that that's essentially a big
object store and if you do this you get
some pretty incredible things that then
the operating system can do for got your
documents right you get version control
on all of the user documents that you
have on the machine you get efficient
anyway synchronization you can get delta
compression you can track all the
metadata really sort of like putting
your entire machine under under very
advanced version control that can that
can sort of do the right thing and in
addition to this you get you know you
get sort filter and timeline for the
things that are happening in your
machine you can ask the computer show me
everything I did yesterday which you
can't really easily do on your computer
but but one particularly cool thing is
you get pervasive search right and this
is something you guys should be excited
about what i mean by pervasive search is
that the moment something comes into
your machine it's searchable right the
moment you visit a web page it's
searchable the moment you open up a file
from somewhere it's searchable so really
you get you get search as as a much more
powerful way of dealing with information
you know if you know that search will
find anything that's that's on your
machine and you didn't have to have an
indexing run or anything then you know
maybe you're not going to be using your
file manager nearly as often because hey
what's the point the way this is working
by the way is we're exposing the object
store as both a d bus service d buses
are our IPC and as a as a little web
server that that things can connect you
and access files and the cool thing is
what happens is even though you're
interfacing with the central central
object store for for all the user
documents the way you actually operate
on on files is still eunuch semantics so
you still have your open and right NFC
cans and such syscalls and the two don't
really club or each other what I just
described array is called yellow it's
we're going to have a duck preview
release very soon and we have open
problems with it things that are still
being solved things that I'm still
working on things like smart anyways
synchronization for large repositories
it's really hard drop off yes okay
Russia is what happened what happens
when you put a fat SD card into the
machine the answer is you can grow your
object store to it but it was there
something in particular we're asking
about so I don't think there's a super
quick answer the best answer I can give
quickly is it'll just work okay we the
way that why I can sort of i can try to
answer this quickly okay the way that
this works is you talk to the object
store service and you say i would like
to i would like to open a file the
operating system draws a little dialog
box deezer chooses a file and you know
the user can choose a file based on
search or anything else and what happens
is the object store will then basically
make that file appear in your
applications directory space okay so it
doesn't matter where it's actually
backed you don't care that the file will
always appear in your applications
directory space yes the question is will
be able to read a file that's already on
the card and the answer is yes okay if
you had so one of the things that that
we're looking at is you know we have
limited storage on this machine and we'd
like to do something that that we're
calling drop off which is the idea that
we let you will let you star things that
you really care about like like you
would do in gmail to say you know this
is something that that is important to
me but then if you think about it right
if you're if you're writing a paper
you'll do I don't know you know 200
revisions in in an hour or two hours or
something and while you're writing it
you want to keep all of those revisions
for things like undo and to be able to
see what you actually did but then you
know a month from then you
probably don't care about all three
hundred divisions and six months down
the line you almost certainly don't care
about more than you know one revision
for every hour you spent working on
something so would you'd like to be able
to do is for the system to be smart
about figuring out basically that the
things that you haven't starred you can
you can sort of drop off when you start
getting low on space and if you've
backed them up somewhere then you
particularly don't care because if you
really want it back you can get it back
but if you don't have backup you want to
be you want to be clever about this for
instance i mean if if the oldest hundred
documents are all little text files but
then there is a six month old video
that's that's five times bigger than the
oldest hundred text files well you kind
of want to drop the video rather than
the text files right but it's not clear
what the heuristics should be for them
so that's that's still somewhat of an
open problem if you have ideas on how to
do this come come talk to me I'd love to
hear them our GUI is it's called sugar
it's something you can play with today
it's running on the laptops you can you
can download it all the sources all the
sources up and it's it's based on
technologies that are somewhat familiar
the toolkit is gtk+ but we're not using
it to draw widgets we built our own
canvas that lets us draw the widgets
called hippocampus we're using d bus for
IPC and sugar is a different approach to
to gooeys we're we're ditching
overlapping windows we're going with
full screen windows we want to provide
much more context as you're actually
doing things and using programs and
we're building collaborations sort of
into the operating system what I mean by
this is that that network and presents
are things that we're we consider sort
of fundamental to how obviously supposed
to work as an educational program so
there is a a present service that we
expose to you as an operating system
level service and what that means is
that if you're an application developer
and you want to write programs who are
where people can work together yeah you
want to write a drawing program where
people can work together etc it's going
to be fairly easy to do this because
will give you the api's where you know
the operating system keeps your buddy
list
essentially right and applications have
access to this and applications can
depend on there being a standard for
what presence means and be able to use
it for to do collaboration etc and
because you know all this is based on
completely open stuff like XMPP and
jabber you can do neat things like mesh
extrusion right which which means if
you're part of a mesh in in say your
village but then you know maybe you go
away for on a field trip somewhere or
maybe you know your maybe someone comes
and visits your village for for a couple
of months and then goes back to to their
country they can actually join the mesh
sort of remotely which has some really
nice implications so this brings us to
what what what I've been spending much
of my time on which is security so
security for OPC is sort of a very
different ball game than most security
that that people who do security are
even used to I I'll tell you in a second
what the sort of the couple things that
constitutes security for us but one
thing that should be obvious to you guys
is that you know if we succeed and we're
putting in five to ten million laptops
out there this year alone possibly you
know up to 50 million next year we are
creating one of the largest computing
monocultures in the history of computing
and there are several sort of doomsday
scenarios that you really don't want to
see come to pass certainly you don't
want someone who dislikes old pc and
there are plenty of people who dislike
OPC being able to write a worm and you
know kill 10 million laptops for kids
that are using them to to further their
education you you guys in particular
don't want to see someone writing a worm
that that you know DDoS s gmail right i
mean in what once you have 50 million
machines connected from all over the
world well maybe that's a real threat
maybe it's not for google but it's going
to be for almost anyone else pretty much
certainly right so we're taking security
very seriously
probably the only project that I know
where a vendor that's that's trying to
make mainstream mass-produced computers
in large volume is actually willing to
priority security and say this has to be
done securely from the start so I was
involved as a security person from
essentially the get-go of the project
which which doesn't happen very often so
let me tell you what security is for us
we have parts of this machine that are
hardware but you can damage it from the
software to the point of requiring
hardware replacement or repair two chips
right the Nance the dance flash which is
primary storage has a limited number of
right to raise cycles if you if you run
it down that machine is not going to be
doing anything until we replace the nand
flash the BIOS chip is is rewritable
because you want to be able to do BIOS
updates but you know if someone over
writes your bios chip with a string of
zeros you're not going to be getting
very far booting so that's sort of the
the first thing we want to do we want to
provide recoverability and openness so
we're going to this effort of saying
well we'll have a view source button on
the keyboard because we want the kids to
get curious and be able to change things
etc but you know it's very easy to say
that and and leave it at that and what
will happen is the first time someone
screws up their machine because they've
edited a piece of source and you know
deleted a bunch of lines in their
machine now either doesn't work or
doesn't work as well or doesn't boot you
know if the kid has to now take this
computer to an authority figure of some
kind and say well you know miracle up I
screwed up please please do something so
it works again you know and they get
yelled at for damaging their expensive
laptop etc I mean kids are pretty
quickly going to not really feel free to
experiment with their machines anymore
so you have to be open you want the
machines to be open but you have to be
recoverable in a way that doesn't really
depend on other people right you should
be able to screw up your machine for any
value of screw up that doesn't involve a
soldering iron essentially and
and be able to get back to running state
we want to prevent permanent data loss
which sort of goes hand in hand with
this because if all we can tell you is
well we've built the mechanism in so
that if you screw up your machine you
can you can press some buttons the
operating system will get restored but
all of your data is gone right it's it
flew out the window then that's some of
the same kind of disincentive for
experimentation and we're trying to fix
this and this is one one part where
Google comes into the picture because
the rumor is you guys are pretty good at
storing big amounts of data right huge
privacy issues right kid kids as young
as five or six in front of machines with
microphones and video cameras you know
you can sense any number of potential
disaster scenarios here and it's
absolutely critical that we sort of go
out of our way to make sure that that
privacy is protected we want to make
sure that that it's difficult to use
these laptops as a platform for tax and
you know you can't as long as long as
you're providing this much openness to
the users you can't really prevent them
from being used as an attack platform
but you can do things that make it so
that they're not very attractive if
you're trying to launch massive ddos
attacks or if you want to inform all the
kind Google people of the deposed
dictator that you know left a large cash
deposit with his you know general etc so
which is mind you a something that gets
brought up quite a lot since Nigeria is
one of our launch countries um and you
know one of the most controversial
things is we want to keep the laptop on
the control of its owner meaning both
that we would like to make sure that
software can't do things that that the
user doesn't want to have happen but it
also means that that these laptops
should not be in at attractive target
for for theft you really don't want you
know tens of thousands of these being
stolen and put on ebay
so this to start with is is is really
hard I mean I was i I was mildly
depressed after putting together that
list for the first time and ends then it
got worse right so our goals while doing
all this security wise is we can't have
passwords these are five and six year
old kids they don't remember passwords
it doesn't work you can't expect them to
read a because they might not be able to
read yet and be because because you know
if all the security system does is put a
dialog box on the screen that expects
you to know the internals of tcp/ip and
how your machine works to be able to
make an educated decision as to allow or
deny something that's not actually
protecting anyone right it's maybe
protecting the vendor or legally but but
it's not actually getting anything done
you can't depend on on massive amounts
of updates being pushed to machines on a
frequent schedule you might not have
connectivity when you have connectivity
you might not have a lot of bandwidth
you know right now my my favorite linux
distribution which is the same one that
you guys use if you install their latest
long-term support release from CD and
you connect to the internet it will
happily tell you that it has to download
316 megs of security updates right
that's not something that we really want
to do for these 10 million machines and
fifty million next year you can't well
you can but we're not going to depend on
secrets in hardware or in software to do
any of this right we're not we're not
going to do security by obscurity it's
simply not an option and finally we're
not going to lock the machines down
right a lot of the machines that there
are sort of the managed and embedded
machines they only let you run software
that their vendor signs
cryptographically and you know you've
heard you've heard my my position on on
the educational value of this project
and what we're trying to do clearly
that's not an option right I mean we're
not going to be locking these machines
now so we we built something new it's
called bit frost you can find a complete
specification on
wiki there's a Wikipedia article that
links to the specification and there's a
big shift here in that we're instead of
trying to make sure that untrusted code
never runs which is what antivirus
software and anti-spyware tries to do we
actually try to protect the system while
under the assumption that any code
that's running could be untrusted and
malicious you know there's there's 48
years of capability systems research on
how this works and the way that we're
actually implementing it is real
virtualization on the indio s so each
application is essentially running in
its own vm and only has the permissions
it needs to get the job done the
interesting thing is that if you have
this approach the the definitions of
what virus and spyware mean no longer
really apply because you know if all you
can see as an application is your little
application space then if your virus
what are you going to infect right there
isn't anything else in your application
space then then you and you know I'm
necessarily glossing over some of the
technical details I'm happy to talk to
talk about the more or see the spec
because I'm trying to move move quickly
here but what this comes down to is we
were protecting against hardware damage
by doing some pretty pretty clever token
bucketing on the on the nand flash we
have crypto protection for the bios we
can restore the entire factory system
just by a an operation that is
essentially regenerating some links on
the file system we can do that
restoration without keeping a separate
partition that that contains the OS
image by the way so we're not actually
paying a price to be able to do it
because all the data lives in a
centralized store and is revision we can
we can do trivial backups that actually
work right we can get backups to the
point where as soon as you come in range
of a server that you don't even
necessarily have to trust all that you
care is that it says I provide backup
service you can start dumping encrypted
backups to it and get them back later
and the user doesn't even have to be
involved with this process we're putting
in LEDs that are actually wired in
series in the hardware with the
microphone in the camera so even
the colonel is compromised and the
firmware is compromised you will
actually be able to see a soft glow
telling you that microphone camera are
on and you know if that happens when
you're not expecting them to be on
you'll know that something's up the way
this works very briefly is there's a big
colonel patch it's it's 40 thousand
lines of code but that covers every
architecture that Linux builds on so
it's actually quite a lot smaller for
just x86 it's something called vserver
it's an existing patch it was built for
isps that want to offer sort of virtual
linux servers the customers and I'm
twisting it to do something that that
it's never been used to do before which
is due desktop security and so we're
putting in a bunch of code adding the
bunch of code to it to let us do some of
the things that we care about the
interesting thing about this by the way
is you know people are terrified of how
are you going to do virtualization on
466 megahertz CPU turns out that with
Linux vserver the the overhead you pay
is 32 k / task struct but there is
zero-percent masher measurable CPU
overhead with up to 65,000 virtual
machines running I'll let that sink in
for about two seconds right it lets us
do full network stack isolation lets us
completely isolate the filesystem it
lets us do this this copy and write mode
with just a twist on what immutable
links do so we can actually do this set
at no overhead on the file system it
provides various folks that we can use
you know we can we can add scheduler
bias for system services etc on you know
directly in the colonel now there are no
policies with this so the mental model
is very simple we tell our application
developers essentially the mental model
is you are the only application
executing on the machine and you you can
use a number of the interfaces that we
provide to interface the rest of the
system but essentially you are the only
application that's running on the
machine one of the things we do is we
have these immutable application bundles
meaning that installation is essentially
dropping one file into the directory
tree and suddenly you've installed the
entire program and the application when
you
this only gets three writable
directories a temporary directory
configuration directory and the data
directory so the application can't
change itself it can't change its own
binary you get some nice security
benefits out of this we have a
system-wide update service and we can do
atomic file system updates when we want
to update the core operating system we
want to have that same system service
doing updates for the individual
applications we don't know how exactly
that should work it still still somewhat
of an open question so I want to very
briefly tell you you know I've told you
about a lot of a lot of cool technology
I want to tell me where things are right
now most of most everything of the
hardware that you've heard about is done
and works certainly it works in the be
two laptops be three laptops are
entering production I think today and
the be three laptops have the hardware
improvements that I was telling you
about sugar which is the gooey piece it
works it runs there's a lot of work left
here to implement our entire human
interface guidelines which are available
on the wiki and d/d the guidelines keep
evolving which sort of you know makes it
very much of a moving target our
bulletin boards which are sort of our
shared spaces the idea that you know
this entire room could open up their
laptops we could all connect on the mesh
and have a single space where we can put
objects and work on them etc this is we
we have some preliminary design it
hasn't been it hasn't been implemented
yet on the security side the colonel
patch is ready to be merged but we
haven't merged it yet because the power
management work has been dominating the
colonel work the user space work hasn't
been started because it basically is
blocking on the colonel patch being
merged the tech preview of yellow which
is the centralized object store is just
about ready it'll probably go live in in
a matter of days there are there are
parts of this that are really hard
yellow is something that I've also been
implementing in addition to the security
and there are parts of this like the
synchronization like the smart tuning
that I've mentioned in to drop off etc
like being able to do smart caching that
are still very much open questions and I
keep sort of turning out designs and
trying things
but I'm sure we can get it a lot better
in thirst of the colonel suspend resume
work today and take about 200 33
milliseconds we want to have that
firmware work there's plenty of its
remaining we need to integrate some of
the crypto stuff that we need there's a
lot of the power management work is
happening in the firmware because
there's no acpi tons of profiling and
optimization to do it gets started
pretty frequently but we don't have
people who are just performance people
on the team so you know every time that
some some other fire pops up that people
get sidetracked into helping out with
that so that gets interrupted a lot the
server side of things are school servers
just now started there are a bunch of
software needs we have here something
that's that's fast and sane with multi
cast as a web cache and there are some
people who are maybe going to be working
on that that hasn't really been started
yet lots of lots of work with python
python is memory hungry yeah the the
Python community you know there are a
lot of people who care about optimizing
Python but there are people who
generally care about optimizing CPU
meaning you know runtime performance not
not memory footprint and it turns out
that we're not alone in really wanting a
memory leaner python nokia has this
issue because they're actually trying to
they're trying to put Python as the as a
plug-in language on on their cell phones
and the the symbian colonel doesn't do
copy and write for for memory pages so
they can't even do the trick that we can
do which is run a Python interpreter in
the beginning and then fork it off when
we need to start activity you know
applications which which for us on linux
of course gets copy and write going and
a bunch of pages get shared and so it's
not as bad and memory it they can't even
do that so this is something we'd really
like to see happen more python we would
love to be able to do some of the more
sort of small talk ish and lisp ish
things like being able to interrupt a
running program when it hits an
exception change code and continue from
where it started this is
think that that I understand we can't
really do with with Python right now
because the the stack gets unwound
completely etc so you know it's
something to look at I mean maybe it's
doable canned modules the idea that you
would be able to load the module and
look at the look at the objects that
that module created that initialization
and stick that basically serialize all
of that so that when you're loading the
module the next time you can just sort
of load the memory image instead of
actually rerunning the initialization is
something that we're also looking at i
think the nokia guys are actually
working on implementing this plugins are
something that we we deeply care about
we think they're one of the only
promising ways at this point to manage
software growth and there's there are no
good standards on how plugins should be
designed and how software should be
designed to accommodate plugins and it's
something that would be really nice to
have four for the wider community not
just for all pc lots of questions about
how plugins should work with security so
I think we're really sort of we're
working with a set of pretty fantastic
technologies there's a ton of work that
that needs to still be done here and we
are we're shipping in less than six
months OPC i think is proof that even in
2007 you know there are people who
deeply care about the fact that there
are other people who care about writing
beautiful and clean code you know really
this will matter to 10 million kids this
year and it might matter to 50 million
kids the next year and you know all the
technology asides we think that that
what's going to happen if OPC succeeds
is there's going to be a generation of
kids globally that are going to grow up
with access to knowledge and learning in
a way that really has never been the
case in the history of the planet but
you know this is a really dangerous idea
and I don't think I have to explain why
although I'm happy to talk about it but
it's also an idea that that that we
think you know has to happen so in
closing one of my favorite quotes is
it's Thomas Edison who once said how
there are no rules here we're just
trying to accomplish something and
that's I think that's the best summary
of OPC that that you'll find anywhere so
if all the strikes a note please come
help out we have a development live CD
available now with sugar and all the
development tools that you can just
download the run either in parallels or
q emu or you know on a separate little
machine and you can help out that way we
can get you laptops if you're if you
want to be helping out with any of the
hardware work or the colonel work all of
our code is is free software its public
it's on dev laptop that org along with
our entire list of bugs there are no
private Bugs there is no you know
backroom watercooler bugs and and secret
discussions on all pc we're completely
transparent and you know one thing that
that we have very little people from
google helping out and the reason i find
this troubling is because i see two
explanations for this right one
explanation is that you guys simply
don't know that we're doing all of this
or have found it you know too hard of a
barrier to entry or that collectively
you guys have some of the smartest
people you know anywhere in the world
have decided that what we're doing is so
completely wrong that you don't even
want to get anywhere close to it and if
either is the case i would really like
to hear about it so again you know
please do help us i think we can we can
get you hooked up with with really
exciting things to work on that will
also make you feel good about about what
you're working on and we have lunch
afterwards you know come come up talk to
me or use any of the resources that i
mentioned our wiki our dev our dev site
or find us on IRC and help out so thank
you and i'm happy to I think we have a
little bit more time I'm happy to answer
questions about anything including why
the sky is blue but OPC questions are
preferred so thanks yes
so we the question is what happens when
we handed this to kids the first thing
that happened is that the adults who
handed it to the kids got really
frustrated because we have not found so
far a single adult who can open up one
of these laptops in less than a minute
and we have so far not yet found a kid
who can't open them in less than 30
seconds right past that the you you
better sort of give give five hours to
the kids and go away the kids dive right
in the GUI which is unfamiliar to all of
us that grew up with normal gooeys you
know it takes them five minutes to
figure it out we have a music program
that lets you play you know with all
sorts of samples and play the piano and
what not and you know you better have a
soundproof room when you when you give
the laptop to them because kids will
just you know bang away at this for four
hours so far we've been exceedingly
pleased with what we've seen one we've
actually handed laptop to the kids and
there's a story just yesterday in cnet
about actual classrooms in Nigeria
getting fast laptops for the entire
classrooms you can find pictures online
at i think it was seen it and you can
see i mean the kids are ecstatic yes in
the back
very exciting education sorry kids but I
guess I'm happen silly for anything
about how I mean it seems like there's
also a need for adults to use technology
and you're rolling is with blood
photographer is that may not have that
may not happen is ready ready access to
laptop search to how are you prevent you
know parents from stepping in and say
well i'm going to use your laptop is
that letting you use okay so the
question is how to adults come into play
and more specifically how do we keep
parents from just taking the laptops
away from the kids there are a couple of
answers to this the the first sort of
unofficial subtitle to one laptop per
child is one laptop per teacher as well
right so teachers will also definitely
have laptops and we want to get them
involved and have them see that this is
something that's important we want to
exercise a lot of sort of community and
social pressure on parents do not take
away the laptops and we've seen that
this works not not just with OPC I mean
there are places like extremadura in in
Spain where admittedly it wasn't laptops
that were used these were these were
desktops but there were there was a lot
of resistance initially to to sort of
the disruption that that the
introduction of many computers in
schools created and after a while
because of the the social pressure and
the community pressure that was exerted
throughout the state for for parents to
really understand that this is something
that's that's important to their kids
the story came around completely it's
it's now up from principals and parents
and everyone sort of being really afraid
of this and not wanting it to come
anywhere near their kids to it now being
sort of a matter of pride for principals
and schools and parents that their kids
are using computers etc so we know this
works and we're hoping that we'll be
able to do the same
I you prevent a crisis or a timeout the
question is how do you prevent the left
us from being sold there is an
anti-theft system in this laptop if the
contrary chooses to use the anti-theft
system these laptops are going to be
pretty hard to sell I'm happy to explain
more about how the anti-theft system
works maybe over lunch yes so you're
just concrete that
question is do we sell to anyone or just
the country's right now just the
countries you know one thing that that
surprises people when we when I talk to
them about 20 pc is that the the core
team at all pc the people who actually
sort of designed most of what you've
bought you most of what you heard it's
it used to be a 12-person team it's not
updating 14 people but that's tiny right
I mean we were essentially reinventing a
computer with 14 people and part of the
reason we've been able to do it is
because we've done it with so few people
we've been moving very quickly but it
also means that if you want to handle
logistics it's a lot easier handling
logistics for five crates of a million
laptops each than it is to handle
logistics five million crates one laptop
beach right so it's just right now is
just a matter of us not having the time
and energy and people to be able to do
logistics for smaller orders and it's
something that that hopefully will
change in the future yes
types of things
making wonder why he didn't think
something like this for small talk which
have a history of dynamic i we perform
with machines small Walker's faster
closed right so you know interestingly
if you do i'm sorry the question is why
not you know because we want to do more
lesbian small talky things why not just
use less poor small talk and what about
you know with machines and things like
this so if you guys have you know pay
attention while i was saying that we
really want to implement as much of
everything in python that comes very
close to sort of the generalist machine
idea now we're not running python on on
the bare metal as less machines did with
wisp but we're coming pretty close to it
i mean if you if you take away the
colonel and you look at everything else
you're essentially given a complete
python you know if everything is Python
we are also shipping squeak on these
machines so there is a small talk
implementation that's going to be
available but i think right now for any
number of reasons such as size of the
community momentum of the community I
you know I certainly think list for
instance has a much higher learning
curve a steeper learning curve then then
Python does for for kids you know there
are a lot of the same reason supply it's
a small talk I mean I really think that
right now the best thing we can do is
use something like Python yes I'm sorry
I'm pay no attention to the man behind
the curtain who is informing me that
we're done with questions so join me for
lunch if you'd like to talk more thank
you
