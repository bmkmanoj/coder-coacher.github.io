pleasure to welcome today dr. Craig
Mello the Nobel Prize recipient last
year for the co discovery of RNA
interference and welcome to google
thanks it's a real pleasure to be here
and you know I never never really
thought about what Google looks like on
the inside you know I just see that
interface and you know it's sorry
someone's on the phone alright so I'm
going to talk about today information
storage and how it's stored inside of
ourselves how do you make a an organism
like a human being or even a simple
little bacterial cell and there's a
really remarkable as you can imagine a
really remarkable way that that's
accomplished and we're still trying to
understand it I mean just looking at
what what organisms are capable of like
ourselves you understand of course that
there has to be a really remarkable way
for that information stored in the DNA
to be accessed in to interface with the
environment to produce such things as
thoughts and ideas and so I'm going to
start by talking about this RNA
interference mechanism and tell you a
little bit about how that's shedding
some new light on how information is
stored inside of our ourselves here's
Andrew fire and I and I like to show
this picture because I don't know if
there's a here it is because of this is
taking place on the stage in Stockholm
can have the lights down in front and
what we're doing here is not talking to
each other
and that's that's pretty remarkable
because Andy and I always talk whenever
we're together and I'd like to show it
because people always ask well how do
you win one of these prizes and the
answer really is by talking to people by
sharing your ideas and i'm sure you guys
do that a lot but it's it's particularly
important especially talking to somebody
like andy who is you know wonderful
person full of great ideas and without
whom I certainly wouldn't have been
there on the stage but it I like to just
remind you that when you have an idea
it's really good to test it out on your
colleagues and your friends and a lot of
people I've found are much too reserved
or afraid of getting their ideas out
there and they tend to be a little too
conservative about that I think if
anything had a big impact on my career
it was being willing to speculate and
throw ideas out there brainstorm and
that that is really the way the great
discoveries are made because the ideas
don't necessarily come from inside your
head they come from the dialogue from
the discussion and almost no one in the
room can to claim they they thought of
that because it was the dialogue it was
the discussion that generated that idea
and so RNAi is a really really
remarkable story and it has there's so
many people who've been involved in not
only the laying the groundwork for the
discovery that Andy fire and I made but
also in the work subsequent to that that
brought out the significance of the work
that we had done and I'm going to not
spend a lot of time on the discovery
process today i'll talk a little bit
about that but i just want to launch
into a this following little clip from
Nova ScienceNOW what have I told you
that recently scientists made a
discovery that's so surprising and so
powerful not only are we about to know
much much more about how all these
geezuz work Alzheimer's and asthma and
arthritis and cancer and HIV and all the
others there's a chance it's a real
chance that we can treat many of these
diseases much more effectively all
because of this one discovery called are
in a I was little I at the end which
I'll explain later you don't hear much
about it but RNAi is a really big deal
and the curious thing about it is the
discovery of RNAi was an accident it was
a puzzle that appeared in a petunia it
was a purple platoon now I I like this
guy Robert Krulwich because he's so
enthusiastic and it really is true irony
I is a big deal now it it the mystery
did first appear in a petunia although
we didn't know that it was related to
RNAi until much later what happened was
researchers were trying to make the
petunia more purple and when they put a
gene in that encodes the that one of the
enzymes involved in making the purple
pigment instead of getting more purple
the flower became white it lost all the
pigment so there in that case they were
adding an extra copy of a gene into the
germline of the plant this is a very
powerful technology because it allows
you to change an organism the only thing
is the organism doesn't like to be
manipulated and changed and so it has
ways of blocking the activity of genes
that are added and that was totally
mysterious at the time no one had any
idea how it worked and it turns out much
later that now we know this is related
to RNAi and I'll come back at the end of
my talk to work on how we think it's
related but remember this is adding
double-stranded DNA to the organism and
I'll talk a little bit about DNA and RNA
because you guys probably aren't all
that familiar with what they are I'll
just give you a little bit of a
background on that
in a minute but first I have to
introduce to you the the worm and this
is what C elegans looks like it's
fortunately only a millimeter long it's
not quite this big it has a total of a
thousand cells whereas you and I have
about 10 trillion cells okay so this is
a really simple animal and yet it has
neurons it has muscles it has got it has
basically all the major tissue types
that a human has the other thing that's
remarkable about this animal is that it
has won five Nobel prizes so far okay
and the pace is picking up because the
last one was in 2002 and now this 2006
but I I think they'll be more for this
organism and one of the reasons it's
such a useful organism is it's compared
to us of course remarkably simple it
lives six days roughly it produces 300
progeny during that time it eats
bacteria you can grow it very rapidly in
the laboratory you can do genetics which
is basically introduce mutations using
chemicals that will randomly mutagen
eyes the genome so that you can look at
what genes are important for the various
pathways that work in the animal so it's
a great little model system now you're
probably asking well how can a worm tell
teach us anything I mean I should point
out that the prizes we're all in in
medicine essentially then so how can a
worm get five Nobel prizes for medicine
now the answer to that really goes back
to the very beginning of the universe so
this is a picture from one of the
gentlemen George Smoot and John Mather
actually from the Kobe project which is
the mapping of the background radiation
from the Big Bang and I throw this up
here because when we were in Stockholm
together they they won the prize in 2006
for their work on this project what they
had done was measure very carefully the
temperature of the background radiation
that's all
through outer space and this is a
picture of what they got this is the
Milky Way galaxy which is basically in
the way sort of they measured the
background the heat from that as well so
they subtracted that and that's what you
get wherever you look out into outer
space you can see remnants here where
you can measure the background radiation
temperature and that can give you an age
for the universe and the age they got is
13.7 billion years so and if it fits
beautifully with the big bang theory so
the reason I'm throwing it up there is
because we had to think of you know they
all that we were talking to the media
and they all wanted to know well what do
you have in common you know tell us
about science and you know so we were on
the stage together and one of the
concepts that became clear to us that
was I think really striking about this
is that life on this planet has a arose
about for three-and-a-half to four
billion years ago almost a quarter of
the age of the universe living things on
this planet are all related to a common
ancestor that arose about
three-and-a-half to four billion years
ago and so what I'm showing here are the
history of animals here's the ancestor
of worms and humans and as they diverge
here worms end up over here on this
branch humans over here they split and
there were these events that occurred in
the history of life that caused massive
extinctions and these were glaciation
events that extended all the way to the
equator based on the geological evidence
they can piece together that these
events probably generated a planet that
looked pretty much like that covered
with snow and ice right down to the
equator and those events the last of
them occurred about 580 million years
ago right before the Cambrian explosion
that some of you probably heard about
where there was a rapid and Matt and
massive diversification of animals with
all kinds of interesting body parts that
appear in the fossil record and what's
what's very interesting about
this and the reason I show it is it
points out that this rapid
diversification of life can be
interpreted as resulting from the
presence of an already highly
sophisticated animal that existed prior
to these events but this animal was
limited in its environmental range it
could not expand onto the land it could
not possibly evolve into anything like
us because there was no land there were
no land plants there was no land
nevertheless the organism that existed
prior to this event already had RNAi
humans have it worms have it flies have
it just about everything animal has it
remarkably even the common ancestor of
plants and animals has RNAi and if you
look at the basic functioning of the
cell the genetic code for example the a
bacterial cell can read the human
genetic code so for example my daughter
has type 1 diabetes her insulin is made
by bacteria the human gene for insulin
is put into the bacterial cell and the
bacteria makes functional a functional
human protein that is remarkable okay
really is I mean nobody could have
predicted that when we started doing
molecular biology you know 50 years ago
so I show this because it points out a
few things first of all the reason worms
and are useful model is because the
ancestor of worms and humans which
probably looked a lot like a worm is all
was already a highly sophisticated
organism it had muscles like our muscles
it had neurons like our neurons it
probably there's speculation that even
had an i sensing sensor of some sort so
these animals were highly evolved highly
sophisticated creatures and so as we
study how these simple organisms work
we're really learning about ourselves
and how we work
and that's just a picture of what the
earth might have looked like at the
equator about 580 million years ago now
here's what DNA looks like I promise I
give you a little bit of a primer I know
you had Watson here too so maybe you
don't need this but here's the the DNA
shown here with these base pairs there's
basically four different nucleotides and
that's all you need to encode genes
which are read out three nucleotides at
a time and made into amino acids through
a system also illustrate to you in a
moment so the discovery of DNA was a
really really major breakthrough for
molecular biology because it told us for
the first time how the genetic
information is encoded in our cells and
it explains so much it explained how the
information could be copied and
inherited because those two strands can
unwind and each strand can serve as a
template for the production of a perfect
copy of the other and so you have this
really really amazing discovery that
tells us how genetic information is
stored copied and transferred from
generation to generation and I think the
reason of course that I'm telling you
this is that it became essentially this
huge paradigm this huge idea that we
sort of went back and we interpreted
everything in terms of the DNA the DNA
is controlling everything it's the brain
of the cell and now I'm going to say
that we really are returning to this
notion of an RNA world and I'll I'll
come to that in a moment this is a cell
dividing and it's marked with a green
fluorescent protein from jellyfish so
this is a recomp is a worm embryo and
that's a for cell stage this is the
germline cell and its dividing and as
you can see there are these Pro this
protein that's tagged with this green
fluorescent
is localizing as we watched their
directly into one cell at each division
so that's two cell stage and the protein
appears here now this cell is the
germline cell and the protein that's
localizing is required for the germline
to develop what's remarkable about all
these divisions is they're occurring
without any transcription the DNA is not
doing anything all of these events are
programmed by products that are put into
the egg so these a cement these unequal
cell divisions in which that protein is
localized those are all occurring
without the DNA having any input at all
in any of the decisions if it had any
input of course it had to be by
expressing the gene products that were
then put into the egg and controlled all
these events now there was a time in the
evolution of life when very likely
hopefully it will come back to the slide
show here in a moment where where life
was essentially molecules that were
replicating the origin of life of course
is mysterious because it's not still
happening living things aren't still
evolving from scratch on this planet
because they to do so they would have to
compete with existing organisms that
already occupy the types of niche that a
molecular organism would have to occupy
so in the history of the earth there's
there was a time when molecules are
thought to have replicated and had
enzymatic capacities of their own and if
you look at DNA DNA is essentially an
inert molecule it can't under you can't
catalyze reactions it can't copy itself
it could never essentially provide a
mechanism for molecular evolution but
RNA can do that because RNA can fold up
into structures that can catalyze
reactions in fact there were Nobel
prizes awarded for the ribozyme for
example which is an RNA based enzyme so
that's sort of the notion of an RNA
world is a world in which molecules were
evolving based on an RNA like nucleic
acid now what I'd like to say now is
that this return to the RNA I world and
I like this RNAi for RNA interference
but I like to say that that little I can
also mean information RNA information so
DNA is not the only source of
information that that was a beautiful
model but it's probably wrong there's
actually information stored in our DNA
that's in the three-dimensional
interaction between the DNA the proteins
and the RNA and the RNA can actually
encode information so I'll tell you
about that again toward the end of the
talk now when you when you're trying to
explain something complicated like our
any high especially if you want to do it
on the nightly news you have to do it
very quickly because everybody knows
that there are hundreds of channels and
whoever's watching is going to be
flipping through them if they get bored
so it's really interesting to see how
the news media handles something like
RNAi how do you get this message across
about what RNA interference is in you
know 15 seconds because that's what the
attention span is for the average
American viewer so this is what CBS News
came up with and this is hilariously
funny to scientists but i think i've
noticed when i give a talk to people who
are not biologists quite often they
don't laugh so i'll explain to you why
this is funny here comes
this aired on the news at seven that's
double stranded RNA now watch carefully
those are defective genes flying into
the RNA I actually had to loop this part
a few times because I think they
actually did it in five seconds so
what's what's wrong with this picture
well genes don't really look like cheese
curls and RNA cannot chew so that's a
little they've took a little bit of
license with this so they literally have
the double-stranded RNA now you you
probably know DNA is double-stranded
well RNA can form a double-stranded
helical structure also and as I'll show
you in the next slide that can be seen
as foreign or as a viral replication
intermediate inside cells so the
double-stranded RNA would actually be on
the same scale as the DNA so DNA would
actually be at least the same scale as
the RNA in terms of its size so they're
not they're not going to look like these
little cheese puffs flying into the
mouth of the RNA and RNA really cannot
chew it does not have muscles it doesn't
have the ability to do that but the
funny thing is that as crazy as this
seems there's actually an example now of
RNA interference guiding the elimination
of DNA in a really amazing way where the
aren't the RNAi marks the chromatin in
the cells of an organism called
tetrahymena it marks the DNA for
deletion or for removal and that that's
a really remarkable of examples actually
in which RNAi like mechanisms can
actually guide the elimination of genes
but that's not how it works so here's
another model this one is again from
Robert Krulwich
novus I so the hurry is that long ago
cells develop a secret defense system
which we will call the cop what the cop
does is when viruses invade and creates
showers of murderous recipes the cop
looks and thinks hmmm some of these have
a very fishy shape it's a chemical
difference which comes down to some of
the Bible recipes are two pages instead
of one and one side is a mirror image of
the other but the point is to the cop
there's something not right about this
shape so when they see in that shape
they say virus eric lander oh and the
cop destroys the recipe what you see it
destroys is this what should we think
like a kung fu kind of thing is it like
sort of deal yeah a little enzymatically
little thermodynamics in somatically
enzymatic come fool maybe yeah the cop
destroys not only about the shape
version whenever he sees that recipe
oddly shaped regular shape that recipe
in any form must be destroyed to defeat
the virus and the interesting thing is
until 1998 nobody knew that sells had
this defense mechanism so there you have
another model this model is actually one
that I I like a little bit more because
even my six-year-old doesn't believe
there's actually a little cop inside of
her cell and so what you have there is
those little messages that we're
floating around RNA is essentially
thought of as a message sometimes as a
copy of the DNA information so inside
the nucleus you have the DNA which
encodes jeans and that is expressed in
the form of RNA so copy of the DNA is
made into RNA the RNA can then go out
into the cytoplasm they'd be made into
protein and the next movie I'll show
will actually show you some sort of
science science fiction like pictures of
how that that would look but the the
nice thing about the cop is again that
people won't mistakenly believe that
there's really a cop inside there's
dolls although my six-year-old does say
to me whenever she's sick she's like why
isn't the cops stopping this virus you
know she gets upset at it the cop isn't
doing a very good job so let me let me
just go on now to this next movie this
is from nature and now we're going to
fly into the cell so the theory is that
looks I went back sorry we're going to
fly inside of a cell and fly along into
the nucleus that's the nucleus now
that's the DNA all coiled up I'll come
to that in a moment later on in my talk
now here it is unwounded to that
beautiful spiral structure now here's
when the polymerase jumps onto the DNA
it has to unwind and it makes a copy
that's RNA and RNA differs only very
slightly from DNA really in its chemical
structure and here's the RNA coming off
the DNA it gets modified and this is
splicing that's another interesting
process but it's not that important I
can answer questions about that if you
want then probably a dental ate it and
it exits the nucleus comes out into the
cytoplasm where it's going to encounter
the translation machinery so this has
the information in it for making a
protein this enzyme called a ribosome
goes along and it makes the protein
encoded by this RNA the protein then can
fold up and do what proteins do now
here's the scientists just injected some
double-stranded RNA it should really
look like a spiral to it's it's a
helical structure it gets processed by
this enzyme called dieser then it gets
loaded onto this enzyme called slicer
and that will go away it's not going to
chew I think that's where CBS got its a
idea now this is what slicer does it
hunts for perfectly matched targets and
then it Cleaves them and once they're
cleaved they can be destroyed and turned
over and the thing that's amazing about
this slicer complexes its catalytic and
it can hunt down rare targets in the
cell and cleave multiple different
targets so it's a way in which the
the animal can or plant can turn off
genes that have already been expressed
it can find them using this small RNA
it's like it's like when you do your
Norton AntiVirus you know the the
antivirus software has pieces of virus
code that are there and as signatures
and the program will run a search for
those on your computer if it finds the
middle it will remove the code that
contains that sequence well the cell has
a mechanism like that too it uses a
piece of the sequence to hunt for any
RNA that contains the same sequence in
20 nucleotides or 21 nucleotides which
is how long those little pieces are is
long enough to find almost any sequence
unique gene sequence in the cell so it's
it's really an interesting and
relatively elegant mechanism now when we
got interested in this mechanism we got
interested in it for a couple of reasons
but first of all this is a worm being
injected what we noticed was that the
silencing effect the introduction of RNA
into the animal resulted in a heritable
change so not only were we affecting
causing silencing among the first
generation progeny we're actually
generating carriers that transmitted
silencing via the egg war via the sperm
through multiple generations so the
heritable nature of the silencing that
we were achieving it's like you're
trying the mechanism I just showed you
would would involve silencing a gene
essentially for a that had already been
expressed and you'd expect that to be
transient because the DNA has not
changed but instead what we were seeing
was silencing that lasted for multiple
generations and could be passed as like
a dominant silencing factor we also
noticed that the silencing effect was
systemic so when we injected into for
example the intestine the silencing
effect spread throughout the animal
entered the germline and then was hicken
hair
and and so these kinds of mechanisms
inheritance and the systemic spread
indicated there was an active organismal
response and that that to us was what
made us Andy and I want to work on this
the fact that the animal was responding
to the information and doing something
and so we did genetics in C elegans to
find the genes involved in this
mechanism and that the genetics worked
very well I'm not going to take you
through the mechanism the genetics but
the one of the gene we found encodes the
cop and this is what the cop actually
looks like based on the crystal
structure of the protein which was just
determined in lemoore Joshua Torres lab
at Cold Spring Harbor the structure of
the protein is shown here the small RNA
guide it's about 21 nucleotides long is
here and that is held on to at both ends
by this protein and there's a groove in
this protein which is shown here in gray
and the protein guides the search that
leads to base pairing between the purple
RNA and the the blueish RNA and by
virtue of the base pairing pushes the
RNA up against the catalytic center
where the cleavage occurs so this
process leads to the slicing of the
message and I showed you earlier in that
little movie that the longer
double-stranded RNA first it gets diced
so it gets made into little pieces of 21
nucleotides and then that RNA can slice
and so it's like one of those late-night
commercials you know it dices it slices
and rnai really is like that because
just like those commercials right when
you're ready to buy the Ginsu knife or
whatever they always say but there's
more right and they then they throw in
the steak knives well that's how r nei
has been like it's been like that to
work on this because we thought this was
so totally cool so amazing we were
extremely excited by all of this but
there really was a lot more and there is
a lot more still coming and that is sort
of illustrated in this slide where this
represents a tree sort of a
most like a family tree of the the the
Argonaut proteins or the slicer proteins
are d1 is the first member of this
family that was identified as a
component of RNAi and when we will clone
a gene nowadays the first thing we do is
search on the databases for all the
genes that are related to that gene and
this is this is revolutionized molecular
biology i mean the database is you know
the genome sequences would be worthless
if we couldn't search them quickly and
so what we do is we clone a gene like
RTE one and then we blast it we call
blasting against the genome sequence and
it comes back with all the genes that
are related to this gene that we started
with and this is always very exciting
for us because you basically get your
foot in the door with the first gene you
clone and then by studying the family of
jeans you can really learn a huge amount
about what the functions are of this
family so our t1 has a huge gene family
and just in C elegans there are 26
members of the family and there are also
members of the family that are in humans
there's for human members here and
they're closely related to to worm genes
shown over here with the blue X through
them there's four more human genes over
here that are related to C elegans genes
as well in fact this green branch of the
family and this black branch of the
family were both present already in the
common ancestor of worms and humans so
way back there below the Cambrian there
was a common ancestor animal that had
two copies of this gene already at least
and so these here are also found in all
other animals including fruit fly for
example members of this family are very
ancient they also appear in plants so
our t1 is sort of right here in the
middle on this diagram and then there's
a big group of genes that are only
present in C elegans that have been an
amplified family of genes whose
functions that were also analyzing so we
got our t1 and then we we asked what
what are these other genes
for so when you knock out already you
one there's no RNA interference left you
can inject double-stranded RNA all you
want there's no silencing that occurs
that's how we found it as a mutant
defective in RNAi and and so we wondered
what are the what are all these other
genes doing could they be involved for
example in endogenous mechanisms that
might be important for you know gene
silencing mechanisms that might be
important for development and so we
knocked them we've all actually knocked
out all these jeans now from C elegans
in and we're currently analyzing their
functions but to tell you about sort of
why we were very excited when we knocked
out those two with the ex threw them in
the last slide I have to mention work
from Victor Ambrose who identified an
endogenous gene that makes a hairpin
molecule like this so this is a gene
that's expressed just like any other
protein encoding gene in the nucleus
it's a piece of DNA it has what we call
a promoter where the polymerase can land
and start making that copy but instead
of encoding a protein this this gene
encodes a little RNA that folds into a
hairpin and it makes a double-stranded
structure that can be essentially
recognized by the RNAi machinery and we
knew about this gene because it was
discovered in 1993 and a second member
of this family this is Lynn for let
seven was discovered in about two
thousand by Gary revkin screw and the
remarkable thing about these genes is
that they're processed into short rnase
of 21 nucleotides in length so in the
maturing in the in the wild type animal
the mature form is what you see in cells
if you extract the RNA and you probe it
you see this short 21 nucleotide RNA
this is a gel in which the nucleic acids
have been separated according to their
size so you can see the small RNA down
at the bottom and the precursor up at
the top and so what we what we found
when we knocked out members of this
Argonaut fam these are d1 homologs is
that the precursor accumulated and the
mature product was depleted and the
phenotype that resulted was very similar
to knocking out the let-7 gene so this
why was this so exciting well from RNAi
initially we had thought it was some
sort of a viral or defense mechanism in
the cell these jeans are regulators of
other genes that function in the process
of controlling development and in fact
what they do is they base pair with the
with other target genes that we now call
the micro RNAs and in two thousand when
let-7 was first described these were
thought to be essentially a C elegans
specific phenomenon just another weird
thing that worms do but it turned out
that let 7 was identical at every single
nucleotide in its twenty one nucleotide
length to a human gene now called let-7
so humans have let seven that means that
common ancestor of worms and humans of
close to a billion years ago but 700
million let's say had already a micro
RNA gene like let 7 and indeed the
target of let-7 is conserved in humans
as well but even more remarkable we
thought we had the whole genome sequence
there we thought we knew where all the
genes were well it turns out that about
1% of the genes are actually these short
hairpin encoding genes so there's at
least a thousand of these genes in the
human and we didn't even know about them
until 2000 so that's an example of how
all of a sudden there was more and so it
turns out that these these micro RNA
genes as we call them now drive gene
silencing during normal development and
interestingly this I just learned
earlier this year they're turning out to
be extremely important in cancer so
here's an example of again a profiling
profiling work that's been done where
these are tumor samples from a couple
hundred patients and on this axis are
different micro RNAs so these are
different human genes including
micrornas and what you see in red are
their relative red or green
shows the relative levels are they up
regulated or they down regulated in
these tumor samples and you can look at
the different tumor samples and you can
see that there are very different
profiles some these patients have lots
of red as you can see these have a lot
of green so these indicate that
different tumors have different levels
of micro RNA expression and through this
these patients can be correlated in
terms of their their outcomes with the
profile of micro RNA expression in some
cases micro RNAs through this type of
work can be linked to a phenotype and
I'll just quickly a phenotype in the
sense of how how the tumor responds and
just briefly and some experiments
recently it's been shown that if you use
a micro RNA inhibitor you can prevent
the growth here's one that received the
inhibitor here's the control you can
prevent the growth of a tumor in a mouse
this is this is another example of the
great technology we have now this is
whole body imaging where you can
actually look inside the animal using a
machine that can detect the fluorescence
right through the body of the animal
imaging techniques that allow you to
look at the tumor inside the animal you
can see that this animal the tumor
growth has been inhibited whereas in the
control it hasn't so that's an example
of how there's a lot more there's a lot
more coming from that because we just
learned about these kinds of RNAs and
now it turns out that their micro RNAs
that are involved in suppressing tumor
growth and there are others that become
activated or turned up in tumors and
those actually are essentially oncogenic
they turn on cell growth so now there is
just like those late-night commercials
there's still more and i'm going to show
you this gel here this is this is what
RNA looks like when you run it out on a
gel and stained it with a dye you can
see these abundant RNA species these are
actually structural RNAs that play a
role in
protein translation process tRNAs are
primarily what are here and these are
involved in trance in reading the
genetic code so these are very famous
RNAs we've known about for a really long
time but way down on the bottom of these
these kinds of gels there was always you
know little bands of RNA that everybody
thought was just junk and it was like
running down near the bottom of the gel
so everyone ignored it of course then
micrornas came along and people started
paying attention to the bottom bottoms
of these gels and it turns out that way
down here in wild-type worms you can see
an a band that's present and what made
us take notice of this band is that in
these mutants shown here that are
defective in RNAi that band goes away
and it's it turns out that that band is
22 nucleotides long and it's it's
interesting in that unlike in this pride
as a mediating to you but it has a 5
prime triphosphate instead of a mono
phosphate which distinguishes it from
the micro RNAs for example and other
types of dicer products we were very
intrigued by this this small band and
wanted to know what it was there's
another one there as well now what we
found was that these types of small RNAs
are detectable also by when you make a
probe you can detect these small RNAs
this is looking at the small RNA itself
in a wild-type worm and what's
interesting about these is they are a
complementary to target genes in the in
the cell and here's an example of a
target gene k 02 messenger RNA k 02
silencing RNA and you can see that in
wild-type animals there's a high level
of the silencing RNA and a low level of
the message so this gene is being down
regulated by this SI RNA and this is a
naturally occurring silencing RNA this
is not experimentally induced this is
derived just naturally from worms that
are just living that's how they live now
if you knock out RNAi this target RNA
goes way up and the
this small RNA goes away so these these
mutants have upregulation of this
message and a doubt and these by the way
are sterile mutants as well so it's an
essential gene so way Fung in the lab
recently cloned this RNA species he made
thousand thousands of copies cdnas we
call them copies and then sequenced them
and we're this is something that's still
ongoing because these are even though
they're kind of faint on this gel they
are incredibly abundant and I'll just
show you them a little more clearly here
in this procedure that radio labels them
so you can see this 22 nucleotide SI RNA
species its present and wild-type and
it's absent in this dr h 3 mutant and
way fung essentially isolated this band
and cloned it and so some of his
preliminary data is shown here we have
many more sequencing reads that are
coming in now because we're doing these
high-throughput sequencing techniques
among eleven thousand of these that he
that we've looked at they're all 22 were
of the of these forty eight thousand
reads eleven thousand or 20 tumors
ninety-eight percent for some reason
start with a G residue and we don't
really know what the significance of
this is we've blasted a set of these and
we're still analyzing this data some
more but approximately half of these are
complimentary to genes in the in the
animal and of those approximately up
well almost all of those that are that
are target genes are anti sense to the
genes that means that the RNA that we've
identified would base pair with the
target RNA just like the silencing rnase
do during RNAi so they're behaving like
you might expect for an RNA that would
regulate those thousands of different
genes so we have three thousand
different small
rnase that target almost 3,000 different
genes just from the small amount of
sequencing we've done so far and some of
them most of them will only have one hit
as you can imagine because we've only
sequenced 3,000 and we have two thousand
seven hundred different genes identified
but some of them stack up on targets
this gene for example has I forget how
many something like a hundred different
micro RNA or small RNAs these are not
micro RNAs that hit all along the coding
region of this particular gene so some
genes have multiple small RNAs others
have only a single small RNA what's
going on why why are we seeing an
abundant small RNA species that is
complementary to most perhaps if we
extrapolate perhaps most of the genes
there's 20,000 genes in the animal we
sequenced about six three thousand that
of these that identify genes and so far
we've hit over 2,000 different genes so
what's going on now this is the DNA
again and I'm just showing you this
because this is how the crystal
structure of DNA looked when Watson and
Crick determined it 50 some years ago
but that's not how it looks inside the
cell inside the cell the DNA is is
bundled up and very compacted otherwise
it just wouldn't fit inside the nucleus
so the DNA in your nucleus and the
nucleus of your cell is bundled up into
these fibers called chromatin and the
chromatin actually is when you unwind it
a little bit you can see there's these
little balls which we call nucleosomes
blowing up here and the nucleosome
consists of a protein core in the center
and the DNA wrapped twice around that
core you can see it in this other view
here so here's the genetic information
wrapped around these protein cores and
sticking out from the central protein
core there are
these tales of amino acids essentially
protein tales that our sites for
regulatory modifications of the
chromatin now what has been emerged from
the analysis of these tail structures
that stick out is that the a lot of
information can be put into those the
amino acids there that control how
compact or how open the the DNA is and
how accessible it is to to be expressed
in the cell the more compact generally
the less well expressed that gene will
be and so here's just sort of a model
for the the way the DNA is stored in an
active gene the DNA is in a more open
conformation allowing the polymerase
complex to get on and make the messenger
RNA now what's emerging that's very
exciting from the RNAi studies around
the world is that even the silent
regions of the current of the genome are
not really silent that there's actually
RNA expression that goes on to regulate
the DNA and so we call these kinds of
rnase surveillance RNAs and there's a
couple of ways they can enter the RNAi
pathway one way is by making
bi-directional transcripts from the
chromatin chromatin eyes door silent
region to make these dsrna s that then
get processed by dieser loaded on to
slicer and then go back in tart and and
in this case recruit a chromatin
remodeling enzyme this complex here that
can put these silencing marks on to
those tails so in the active region
there are very few of the silencing
marks and in fact there are other marks
that are involved in activating gene
expression within the silenced regions
there's lots of these silencing marks
and there's enzyme complexes that can
put them there and so you have this
feedback loop where these silent regions
can generate silencing RNAs that can
feed back and re-establish silencing now
what they can do what can be
accomplished with this is that all of
the copies of a
family can be coordinate ly regulated in
this way so if you have multiple copies
of a gene that are distributed over many
chromosomes you can you can see that
these SI RNAs can go back not only to
this target gene but to other genes in
the genome and achieve regulation
furthermore what's accomplished is that
you can achieve some degree of silencing
even within the active region so a gene
that's active might generate a little
bit of si RNA by virtue of having lower
levels of this surveillance
transcription and so this is actually
what we think these small RNAs we've
detected might be participating in in
other words essentially genes that are
more active have low number low levels
of these genes that are more silent have
very high levels of these SI RNAs and
perhaps this type of feedback regulation
allows the the genome to be regulated in
this heritable way and so this is where
the RNA in the idea of RNA information
storage comes in you have a not only
gene expression to express the gene but
I a is synthesized to silence the gene
and those mechanisms allow the organism
to essentially produce variation in gene
expression levels that are not
correlated with any change at the DNA
level so think about this for example
when when your cells differentiate you
they become different for the whole your
whole lifetime if you're lucky you'll
live you know 80 years and your skin
will stay skin your neurons will stay
neurons otherwise you know you run into
trouble but if you if you look at what's
going on inside those cells even though
they have very different phenotypes that
are very stable over many many years the
DNA is still the same and the the best
examples of this are like Dolly the
sheep and these other organisms like
mice which are now routine
we clone we can take a cell that's from
the soma somatic cell from the body a
skin cell or a blood cell and we can
change that back into an embryo or
essentially take the nucleus from that
cell put it back into an embryo and the
nucleus gets reprogrammed and so that it
can make a whole embryo again so the
idea is that this mechanism that these
small RNAs exist in the cells of in the
germ cells in particular in stem cells
in addition and that they play an
important role in programming the DNA so
in essence the the concept is that the
RNA basically can regulate the DNA such
that you can get heritable changes in
gene expression that are maintained
stable through hundreds of cell
divisions thousands of cell divisions
without any underlying change in the DNA
so there's information stored in the
interactions between these proteins that
the DNA is spooled around and the RNA
molecules that can feed back and modify
those those tails by virtue of these
proteins that they interact with so in
other words it's not as simple as your
genes are all in your DNA if you
sequence the DNA of a skin cell it's
going to be the same as the DNA of a
neuron but obviously those two cells are
very different in their in their
functions in their phenotype and so what
we've learned I think from the RNA I
world is that RNA never really gave up
control of the DNA the DNA is like the
hardware and the RNA and the proteins
are the programming so you're
programming the computer in many many
different ways and you're able to
achieve all these sophisticated
different types of cells and it's it's
changes that are occurring without any
underlying changes in the DNA now one
other thing that's interesting about
this concept is it can help explain
differentiation of cells during
embryogenesis but it can also
potentially explain evolutionary change
and that's something that's very
exciting right now that's also very very
speculative but I think exciting from
the stand
point of explaining how organisms could
evolve rapidly without waiting for
cosmic radiation or whatever to change
nucleotides in their DNA they can change
this programming cycle this feedback
loop could be enhanced or suppressed and
that can achieve heritable changes much
more rapidly perhaps than actual
mutations in the DNA sequence so and
right now another project that we're
doing in the lab is sequencing from mice
we've identified this is a bad blot but
there's a band here in the mouse ES
cells these are embryonic stem cells
from mice and you can see this band as
present in the mouse and where we're
analyzing the sequences of those RNAs
now as well in the mouse and I think
I'll these are just some of the people
in the lab I mentioned the people whose
work I talked about already this is the
RNAi crowd here in the lab let me just
skip over them quickly I'm going to show
you a few slides from Stockholm this was
a great time in Stockholm this is Hans
yarn ball who makes the phone call and
that's my wife at it and Andrew fire
with his wife Rachel and when when this
nice gentleman called my wife rudely
hung up on him at 4am and fortunately he
called back so I told him to call me
anytime it was very nice guy these are
some of the other people i talked about
George Smoot John Mather that's ed
Phelps Roger Kornberg this is a
representative from the Grameen Bank and
this is muhammad yunus and Orhan Pamuk
the author these guys won for the Peace
Prize they didn't spend much time with
us we only saw them this one day but we
had a great time with the rest of these
guys mostly waiting in line to shake the
hand of the King in the Queen and stuff
like that and this is my some of my
family up on the stage in Stockholm
that's my little brother Roger thank
goodness he was four years younger than
me
they're there we are with the royal
family this is talking with students
there at the one of the events these
students won their respective science
prizes from their countries so that
they're quite bright interesting kids
kids from all over the world just more
pictures with the prize and all that
kind of stuff here's my wife getting
some economics advice and here she's
giving some advice probably how to spend
money do you think and here's George
Smoot explaining the Big Bang to me and
I you can tell from my look I'm not
getting it this is my daughter Victoria
collecting prizes of her own and these
are really nice prizes because they're
filled with chocolate and I we're
dancing and you can see it what a great
dancer she is so expressive now here's
the danger about getting one of these
things is this is signing the bottom of
a chair for some reason and you can see
what's happened here the head is much
bigger than the rest of the body this is
some this is a major danger but I'll
tell you right now that it really as
much fun as it was to be to be
participating in this it was really a
celebration of the science it wasn't it
wasn't about us and it was really really
a wonderful experience but coming back
from this there was another side to this
and I showed this picture because this
is Tara bean who was in that a normal
third grader in 1998 the year that Andy
and I published our paper but
unfortunately in a routine eye exam she
was had a vision loss and vision that
was detected and she went into our
hospital at UMass where she was
diagnosed with essentially an inoperable
brain tumor and she died shortly
thereafter in that you
so that was about eight years ago I was
recently at the high school in our town
where I I showed this slide and a lot of
the kids in the room actually knew this
this girl when they were in third grade
and it was a really emotional experience
to be there and to feel that the
quietness in the room now it took this
slogan together great things are
possible from the terror beam foundation
website they are now a charitable
organization which is dedicated to
treating brain tumors and cancer and
children and the family of Tara have
become good friends of ours now and what
happens if when you get a prize like
something like this for rnai is all of a
sudden everyone in the world has got a
sick child or a sick family member
starts emailing you and calling you
because rnai is seen by many as an
opportunity to intervene in and cure
genetic diseases and it is an
opportunity but at the same time it's
one who's it hasn't really been realized
yet how to do it there are many problems
many barriers so when you come back from
this experience wonderful experience you
have you really get this also this other
more serious side of wanting to get
involved and help make a difference by
doing more research by developing RNAi
as a therapeutic umass word we're
beginning to do develop an RNAi
therapeutics Center I think I'll just
end by saying a little poem that I read
at the terror beam foundation fundraiser
because i think it's pertinent for all
of us it's called anything is possible
and you know kind of funny i found this
poem by googling it okay so and the
author is anonymous so somewhere out
there there's a google there's an author
that we need to find if there was ever a
time to dare to make a difference to
embark on something worth doing it is
now
not for any grand cause necessarily but
for something that tugs at your heart
something that's your dream for someone
that you love for someone who inspires
you for Tara you owe it to yourself to
make your days here count have fun dig
deep stretch dream big know though that
things worth doing seldom come easy
there will be good days and there will
be bad days there will be times when you
want to turn around pack it up and call
it quits those times tell you that you
are pushing yourself that you are not
afraid to learn by trying persist i lost
my slide oh there it is persist that's
what i'm going to do right now I had a
hard copy persist because with an idea
determination and the right tools you
can do great things let your instincts
your intellect and your heart guide you
trust believe in the incredible power of
the human mind of doing something that
makes a difference of working hard of
laughing and hoping of lazy afternoons
of lasting friends the start of
something new brings the hope of
something great together great things
are possible thank
be happy to take questions if you have
any
do you recommend any set of popular
science books on maybe this or other
recent advances in molecular biology
sort of like Brian greens book on string
theory that kind of thing there aren't
any books yet so you'll have to wait a
little while there are a lot of good
reviews though so if you want to look
for sort of lay in written in layered
terms and so on you can find a lot of
sort of short reviews that talk about
the RNAi they don't really there's not a
good one yet that really goes into all
the different ramifications so hopefully
that will be coming soon I'm thinking
about writing one but we'll see
it's not on hello I'm pressure about
this fingerprinting the 22 nucleotide
yeah it seems like a really small number
and how how is it that that matches
we pursued bad
which fingerprinting the one where I
showed you the heat map the colored
thing or the matching arm ah the number
of sequences so far is small only
because we haven't increased the number
it's very expensive to do these
experiments we don't the older
technology was ten thousand dollars for
a sequencing run so when we did one run
we actually split it in two different
samples so we don't have as much data as
we need yet but you're right i mean this
this could be a much larger amount of
data to analyze ultimately because not
only talking about maybe millions of
sequences instead of 40,000 you're going
to be looking at different sequences
from different tissues you'll want to
look at neurons for example and and
muscle and different cells and look at
what there are any small RNA composition
is and you'll want to look at tumors or
you'll want to look at diseased tissue
or so there's a huge amount of
information that's going to be coming in
the form of not just the DNA sequence of
a person but of their of their various
tissues that might be affected by some
pathology so you'll want to look at not
only the normal patient but also the
tissues that have the disease state that
you're interested in studying so
there'll be a huge amount of information
that will come from this kind of
analysis in the future the machines are
now much cheaper too so we can actually
buy one and use it ourselves instead of
having to pay 10,000 for one run
next question I have a question about
the sort of the cop and the 21 length
signatures does have anything to do with
vaccines and how they work no it doesn't
have any so far to do with vaccines in
that vaccines are usually pieces of the
viral protein so in order to our bodies
have a really great immune system based
on formation of proteins called
antibodies that can bind to viral
surface proteins those proteins cannot
bind to or react to the viral RNA itself
so if the virus succeeds in getting in
and setting up shop inside of our cells
there's really no way to fight it using
protein at that point it's already in
your cell so there's another mechanism
that involves this kind of RNA level or
silencing the code of the virus and the
virus is also have ways of defeating it
so you can imagine that's why you still
get sick yeah it seems like there's a
lot of databases and a lot of good
software out there already although it's
kind of fragmented what do you think
Google can do to help out well that I
think Google could have a big role to
play in that you know the the whole that
there's a future coming where the amount
of information it could be that you know
we have one genome sequence now or maybe
a couple from the human but it could be
that in the future we'll all have our
genome sequences done that'll be part of
your routine checkup it's I think it's
coming if if we don't screw up something
else like global warming or whatever but
I'm you know if it's it's possible and
then they'll also be information that
you can get from the micro RNA
expression profiling like the tumor
samples I showed you as well as small
RNAs of other types like the ones
involved in regulating the DNA that i
told you about so remember there's the
micro RNAs that are encoded by the
genome and then there's the small RNAs
that are present that that seemed to be
regulating the DNA that's a different
type of regulation what we're going to
have a huge amount of information from
those various sources that will need to
be able to search through and I was
suggesting when Peter visited my office
earlier that we named it name a site
Google genome or something where you can
basically take your flop your disk from
or your your information from your
checkup and plug it into your computer
and load it onto Google genome and it'll
tell you what vitamins you need to take
and you know that you better get an
appointment with a doctor for this
condition or that there's a lot of
possibility it's a huge amount of
information and you guys are the best at
handling information so I think it's a
great opportunity for you to take a
leading role in that next question hi um
you talked about the flower in beginning
of the petunia right do you have any
thoughts about gene modification for
props crops and how that's gonna make a
difference yes it can make a huge
difference it's already being done you
know Monsanto took a license to our
technology I know they're working on
some interesting stuff there was a news
story recently about cotton in which the
cottonseed oil is now edible because
they've used RNAi to turn off a gene
involved in producing the some sort of a
Turpin hall or something that makes it
taste horrible so whether or not that
cotton plant will do well in the wild is
possible that that also makes it taste
bad to to predators or not predators but
to animals that would otherwise eat the
cotton seeds but it's possibility
there's tremendous opportunities to
change living things now not only using
rnai but with genetic engineering to
make more productive crops crops that
will grow in areas where there
so you know less water and so on it's
tremendous opportunities and again it's
that horse race you know do we really
want to be going there you know the fact
is we're going to have to go there if we
don't do something about population
growth we have so many people how are we
going to feed them so science again can
come to the to the rescue maybe but you
know who knows what problems the new
solutions will cause down the road so
it's one of those interesting sort of
potentially very beneficial applications
of RNAi is in agriculture but again to
be much nicer if we could just
organically grow food and feed the whole
world but I don't think we can do that
unfortunately any other questions okay
