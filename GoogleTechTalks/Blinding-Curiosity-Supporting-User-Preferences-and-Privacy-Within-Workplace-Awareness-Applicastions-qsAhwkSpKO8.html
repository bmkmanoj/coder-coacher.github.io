in supporting privacy within workplace
awareness applications and there's a
very general question which is that
massive amounts of information are being
collected about each of us and that will
only increase as centers become cheaper
and more powerful analysis of all this
data can support many really good things
from advances in medicine to improve
software and services to more efficient
economic mechanisms but there's also
potential for misuse of such data and so
a really challenging long-term research
question is how best to support
beneficial uses while inhibiting misuse
we're going to look at that question
within awareness systems awareness
systems are an emerging class of
technologies that enhance communication
and connections between people in both
business and social settings they share
information about a user's location what
they're doing at least to the extent of
whether they're available and what
communication channels might be best to
reach them so you've seen some
lightweight examples so for example just
whether you're online or offline in an
IM client is a type of awareness
application and a little more
sophisticated are things like Google
Latitude Foursquare or Facebook places
that make it easy for you to share your
location with your friends we designed
and deployed my unity a prototype
workplace awareness system so that's
what we will concentrate our talk on and
we will look at how we handle some of
the privacy issues that come up there
but we hope that our work in this
setting generalizes to other awareness
systems and maybe even to some other
settings like the medical or user
studies or things like that
so within awareness systems there are
two main concerns
one is there's informations that being
shared right at this moment and their
privacy issues connected with that
there's also issues with what data is
stored longer-term we've looked at both
issues and we'll talk some about
addressing the moment moment data
collection and in particular how my
unity provides user control over sensor
channels but the bulk of the talk will
talk about the question of storing data
initially we did not store any data
because we were concerned about misuse
but not only did the researchers want to
analyze what was going on with the
system but the users started to want to
analyze their own behaviors their
colleagues behaviors things like that
but they continue to have concerns about
misuse and so this talk will concentrate
on our secured histories approach so
first we'll give an overview of the my
unity awareness system and I'll be
handing that part off to Jake this led
that part of the project and he'll talk
in particular about the controls that
are given to users and a few results
from the user studies and also an
amusing issue we've had to deal with
within the last week which is some
popular press articles which well we're
glad for the attention some of it is a
little bit misleading so I'll let him
him discuss that then I'll come back up
and discuss the security histories part
and particularly our approach that lets
users have more control and provides
what we're calling need-to-know security
where each end
vidual has full access to her own data a
third party can help her process the
data but learns nothing in the process
and an analyst can have the third party
help out but will only learn pooled
statistics and will then present a
family of protocols to achieve
need-to-know security in our setting and
then we'll finish with a summary and
open questions so I'll hand it off to
Jake we just started speaking until I
get to the microphone so thanks Eleanor
what we're gonna concentrate here with
unity has given you sort of the
one-dollar tour there's a lot more to
this system than what we're able to
present in this time period but in order
to understand the privacy applications
and innovations that we've done you
really need to have a baseline
understanding of what unity is why we
built it and what we've learned from
using it so far so our work with unity
has been primarily motivated by some
fundamental changes we see going on in
the world the first is that the works
place is becoming much more fragmented
in fact the United States President's
Council of Economic Advisors put out an
article actually a full report in March
of this year saying that US companies
one out of two US companies have
established formal flex work policies
and what this means is that they're
breaking away or allowing their
employees to break away from the Monday
through Friday 9:00 to 5:00 rigid
schedule and the report also indicates
that about a quarter of the employees so
far exercising these policies to work at
least one day out of the office
similarly in our own research at FX
Powell we've looked at how the use of
communication tools has been evolving
over time and we've actually been
collecting data on our employees for
about three years and how they're using
different communication tools and how
they're choosing which tools to use and
what we found over the progression of
time is that it's no longer just phone
and email that our toolbox of tools that
we use is increasing we're not dropping
tools and we're also becoming more
sophisticated in choosing which tools to
use for what type of communication are
with which individuals
at the same time we're also seeing at
least within our company and what we're
exposed to an increased globalization
effort in fact the United Nations now
says globalization is an irreversible
trend it's going to be a part of our
economy for times to come at the same
time we also see still huge dependence
on interpersonal communication to
complete tasks we're not working
independently more now than we were
before we're still working together and
we need to communicate in order to get
tasks accomplished in fact recent
studies have shown that we have about 50
to 60 interactions per day when we're at
work for worker
well this accounts equates to is an
interruption or an interaction with a
colleague about every eight minutes so
that's a lot of interaction that we're
having at work and most of these
interactions are unscheduled and
impromptu so when we're distant and not
working co-located it makes these things
very difficult so all the Spoils down to
us a central realization when we look at
the future of communication tools in
that we can no longer take for granted
in the office place of the future
workers location availability and
preferred communication methods and
channels and so as we move forward into
this new era we're really going to need
new tools and services that will address
those challenges that I mentioned on the
previous slide and an epic spot on our
research we believe that presence and
awareness will really be a critical
building block in these tools of
tomorrow so that's really motivated what
we've done with unity and at a very high
level what unity is is it's a prototype
system that's composed of three
components there's a data and sensor
collection component where we have a
bank of sensors that are collecting
various information about users and
their activities we have some services
that are in the cloud that are analyzing
this data and forming higher-level
descriptions of people's present States
and then we have some interfaces that
allow users to access this information
on their desktops laptops and mobile
devices now the system that we have has
been evolving over a period of about a
year and a half at FX Powell and we've
had it in continuous deployment for
about a year with
most of our employees and we're now
beginning deployment with our peers that
our parent company in Japan so what is
it
here's a diagram that sort of
illustrates the overall system
architecture over here on the left hand
side you'll see that we have various
sensors that are feeding information
into the unity system these are showing
what we have currently in our system
although we are continuing to expand it
we have Bluetooth sensors that can
detect which building people are in what
part of the building they're in we have
cameras scattered throughout the
building including in people's offices
these cameras look for motion to
determine if people are in their offices
in their office with visitors etc we
also have various external data coming
in to the central server this is things
like I M status internal and external
calendar information as well as some
software that we have running on our
end-user clients as well as in the
network to determine where people are
connected from and their accessibility
like I said all this information goes
into our central server and we use some
algorithms to fuse this information into
higher-level present States which is
then portrayed on these dashboards that
run on end-user clients and what you're
seeing here is the dashboard that we
have for the Windows desktop as well as
the Android smartphone and what you'll
notice about each of the interfaces is a
tile based display which we call the
dashboard which resembles sort of a
business card metaphor where you have
people's names their photos and then you
have the present state provided and then
color coding to reinforce those present
States so in this figure that I'm
showing here the green people represent
people that are physically in their
offices there is one person that's red
dawn down here I I'm not red I'm sorry
it's a purple if you're purple it means
that you're in your office was the
visitor blue indicates that you're
working off-site so you may be at home
you may be at a cafe working but you're
not physically on the Conn campus yellow
color indicates that you're somewhere in
the building but not in your office and
orange indicates that you're out and
about but are making
yourself available on your phone if your
colleagues need to contact you you'll
also see that there are additional icons
and decorations on the tiles that
indicate planned appointments so either
vacation time for certain individuals or
appointments like giving a talk at
Google so at the very beginning when we
started building unity we had users
privacy concerns in mind and we were
really focused on the data collection
side of privacy initially so built into
unity is a bunch of controls that allow
an end user to control not how the data
is being shared
but what data is being collected about
them so in these dialogues which I'm
showing you from the desktop app users
can go in and turn on and off different
sensors and what this will do is it will
prevent the system from ever collecting
information from that particular source
and what I want to highlight here is the
the camera control although you're
seeing a live camera feed of my office
here at FX Powell this view is only for
me and what it allows me to do is
designate different regions of my office
that belong to either areas that I
inhabit as the office owner or areas
that are inhabited by visitors when they
come into my office so we're exploiting
the sort of static nature of how people
use their offices what comes out of this
system is just a 0 a 1 or a 2 Plus which
is used at the higher level of
understanding people's state so like
I've said we've been studying this very
carefully and our deployment at FX power
and we've really found some really
useful and interesting results one is
that we've found a greater increase in
the opportunities for effective
collaboration we had we've performed one
study where we actually had people carry
around Diaries and every time they had a
communication event they would log on
their diary the form of communication in
the medium that they used and who with
and over the four week study we found
that before compared to before unity was
in use we saw a 17% increase in
face-to-face communication and a 21%
decrease in email
conversations and this was important to
us or a positive result for us because
when before we deployed unity we asked
users what was their preferred method of
communication and overwhelmingly for a
research lab its face to face
interaction and so by allowing people to
use their preferred method of
communication and offset those methods
that are leaked less preferred we've
increased the overall effectiveness of
collaboration or we believe at the same
time we've also seen a general sense of
improved awareness so when we asked
qualitatively how people are using the
system it wasn't just for finding
somebody to interact with them but it
was getting an overall sense of what the
behavior of the entire organization is
or feeling a sense of community with
lens peers and we've got a lot of great
quotes from our study on this but the
one that really hits home for me is that
one of our users said that it feels like
everybody's office is right next door so
they feel much more connected with their
peers at work a study that we did over
the summer where we were looking at how
the different clients were being used
compared to the desktop and mobile
client we found a very interesting
result in that 83% of our users were now
consulting unity when they're initiating
contact with peers so it's become a real
staple of their day-to-day interactions
and what's important to note here is
that for people that also have the tool
on their mobile client the percentage
was much higher so they become more and
more dependent as the accessibility and
availability of the tool becomes higher
now we've had a lot of success with
unity and we've attracted some popular
press on the system we had an MIT
Technology Review article published last
week on the work and the article is
actually very fair and very informative
but the author of the article did not
set the headline of the article which is
someone's watching you which is
obviously a part of the work that we
don't really want to emphasize but it is
certainly a concern well this of course
has been picked up with meta articles
and each time it's reposted or re
reported the system gets a little bit
more extreme
and the best one lately is you know this
one can tell if you're talking about a
system that can tell if you're slacking
off at work if you read into the details
of the article it actually says that
we're able to tell if you're using
Facebook and talking with your friends
or if you have slackers in your office
not visitors so it's certainly
sensationalizing some of the concerns
about tools like this so the question
here is what's really sensationalism and
what's genuine concern and there is
obviously some privacy concerns of this
tool now the big letdown for these
journalists is that we've been thinking
about this from day one and we've
actually had a pretty aggressive
research agenda to figure out how what
are the ways that we can maximize the
utility of a tool like unity while
protecting the tool from being used for
purposes we didn't intend or for misuse
and one of the things that we have been
doing is as Eleanor intro'd for us the
beginning is a way to secure the history
so that nobody can tell you know what
someone was doing last week you know on
Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. but we get a
general sense of their behaviors and
activities and I'll hand it over to her
as I said earlier my unity didn't store
any data but researchers like to analyze
what goes on with the systems they
deployed and even more important the
users of my unity started expressing
interest in seeing personal trends for
themselves analyzing their own behavior
or activity patterns of co-workers or
long-term data pooled across groups of
users for example when is the best time
just contact somebody in the support
group so when our users asked for this
as well as having interests ourselves in
doing the analysis and actually this was
prior to my joining the project this is
sort of what got Jake talking to me so
that okay we want to support this
how can we support this and users while
users wanted these things they continue
to be concerned about the misuse of
stored data so the research challenge
was how to support the users desires
while respecting their concerns so just
to give you an example of the sort of
feature we wanted to support here's a
graph that gives summary data for a user
averaged over a month for the five
present states colors are similar to
what we had seen in on the little tiles
and you can also do similar some
summaries over a group of you users so I
just wanted to give you a picture of
okay this is something we'd like to be
able to do and show that to appropriate
people but without them being able to
dig in to individual more details about
individual data so just to set up the
terminology I'd like to say who the
players are here so there are a bunch of
users of the system and each user may
use number of clients so they may have a
desktop computer a laptop or two bunch
of mobile devices and they can all run
my unity there's an untrusted third
party server who can store data for us
probably encrypted process things we
trust this server to carry out the
calculations we ask but we don't trust
the server with our data we're concerned
that the server might be accessed by
somebody who's curious about what's
going on in the organization in a way
that we do and we don't want to reveal
that information on the analysts maybe
users of the system who want to look at
their own behavior or a group behavior
or they may be separate for example
researchers looking at how their systems
been used
so what we wanted to do with our secured
histories approach was to give users a
lot of control about who sees their data
so we want them to maintain control of
their own data but still be able if they
want to contribute the data
to group statistics so current practice
is that analysts are generally given
access to all of the data in order to
compute statistics so the researchers
are trusted with all these are data this
is true in our setting in medical
settings like and more and more often
researchers are using a third party to
at least store the data and sometimes
even process it so either the data is
not encrypted in which case a third
party has access to it or the data is
encrypted and the third party can't do
any process can't help out with the
processing so we want to do is provide
mechanisms to support what we're calling
need to know security this is where an
individual has full access from her own
data the third party can help her
process it but can learn nothing about
the data values in the process and the
analyst learns only the desired
statistics not the individual values so
what we want to do is store the present
States we're not going to store the raw
sensor values though that's an
interesting question in and of itself so
we're going to store one bit for each of
the five positive present States like in
office or with visitor and its time
series data at each time say each minute
a user contributes a present state so
five bits of information and then we
want to support data averaging so we
want to be able to support arbitrary
sums over single users data so a user
can ask any question she likes about her
data and have the third party provides
sums that will help with that
computation and analysts can obtain
arbitrary sums as long as it's pulled
over all the users and just as an aside
while averaging is very useful and our
current protocols just support sums we
do have extensions that are very fairly
easy to do that also compute variants in
the higher moments so you can get a
little bit more sense of the
distributions so we had some design
criteria when we started this so since
the present states are computed
frequently the input needs to remain
quick and on the other hand the analysis
of stored data doesn't occur as
frequently and is generally not needed
on a moment-to-moment baiban basis so
that can be a little slower furthermore
the computation over stored data should
not require involvement of the clients
that sounds like sort of an obvious
requirement but most approaches prior to
this to having someone learn the
statistics without learning the
individual values require that the
clients all participate in that
computation and so for us in some sense
this was the one that presents the
greatest challenge how can we do this
without asking the clients without
burdening them at this stage and
furthermore the bandwidth between the
client and the third party and the
analyst may be limited especially in the
mobile cases so we didn't want to be
sending a whole lot of data back and
forth so here's the functionality we
provide all the data is stored in
encrypted form on an untrusted this
honest but curious third-party each user
can request encrypted sums over
arbitrary subsets of her own data from
the third party and the data doesn't
learn in the
third party rather doesn't learn
anything about the data values because
everything remains encrypted the
individual can then decrypt using her
own key or keys
this single summary statistics that this
returned so that's how we save a lot of
bandwidth and also processing so even
though each user encrypts oh and then
for the sums over whole data a
particularly interesting feature here is
that even though each user has encrypted
under her own key we can still pull the
encryptions into sums that can be
decrypted initially well I'll tell you
what we have a variety of protocols that
do certain things with different keys
but the important things are that in
enjoying this the third party can
compute without needing access to any of
the keys without decrypting any of the
data and without further interacting
with inian of the individuals so the
third party does their solve and again
doesn't learn anything doesn't learn
anything about the pooled statistics
either but does learn about but does
process the information so that they can
hand something off to an analyst who has
some keys who can learn the resulting
statistic and finally the we wanted the
protocols to be fairly easy to implement
and integrate with my unity system and
so one feature of this is that we were
able to put together basically
off-the-shelf components that you'll
find in like Java library net library
and a few things that it was fairly easy
for us to write on our own in order to
implement this functionality
so here are some of the ingredients what
we want to have is an additive
homomorphic encryption scheme I'll
explain what homomorphic encryption
schemes are in just a little bit but the
key property is that this is what
enables a third party to compute the
encrypted son and we're going to use a
symmetric key homomorphic encryption
scheme most homomorphic encryption
schemes are public key encryption
schemes but the symmetric he gives
particularly compact encryption which is
good for the bandwidth and also it has
this key feature that it makes it really
easy to compute sums over data encrypted
under different keys so in the simplest
protocol the keys for all the values
contributing to the sum are needed to
decrypt so the analyst can decrypt if
the analyst is able to decrypt the sum
the analyst
can also decrypt the individual values
and that still provides some security
because the third party hasn't been able
to learn anything in the product process
so we'll first present that protocol and
then we'll show how we can do some
variations on that to give more security
where the analyst can decrypt the
statistic but cannot decrypt any in the
individual values so in order to achieve
that next step so they'll get to the
point where it's full neaten of security
where the net analysts can only decrypt
the group statistic not the individual
values what we do is extend Chams dining
cryptographer problem based networks to
this to obtain a more complex key
structure and the family of protocols
will show is secure against collusion by
hey users so in order to decrypt your
value hey other users would have to get
together and pool their resources in
order to decrypt your back
so how amorphic encryption simply
enables you to do computation on the
ciphertext on what's being encrypted and
then decrypt afterwards so an additive
homomorphic encryption scheme you can
encrypt a message encrypted other--
message and then if you have those two
messages together
that's an encryption of the sum of those
two messages most encryption schemes do
not have this property so it's a very
special type of encryption
there are also multiplicative encryption
schemes again if you encrypt a message
and you encrypt another message and then
you multiply the two ciphertext together
that gives you a ciphertext that you can
decrypt to get the product of those
things what's interesting is that it's
hard to do both so algebraic or fully
homomorphic encryption scheme allows you
to do arbitrary combinations of both
addition and multiplication and that's
highly desired because that lets you do
general computation however prior to
2009 no such scheme was known ok all
homomorphic encryption schemes were only
partially homomorphic in fact almost all
of them could only compute sums or could
only compute products but not both and
there were a few recent advances that
allowed you to compute arbitrary sums
and a few products like a second-degree
polynomial like that so last year's big
result was quite Gentry's fully
homomorphic encryption scheme so that
was a very exciting result and from a
complexity theory point of view it
doesn't look like that bad because it's
just a constant slowdown however for
those of us interested in practical
schemes the constants a bit big so if
you want to do a computation on the
encrypted data its trillion times slower
than if you wanted to do it on
unencrypted data a little tough to you
at present so um there's that was a big
breakthrough there been some follow-on
papers and maybe eventually we'll we
will get there but for the moment we
have to stick with schemes that are a
little less powerful but we'll do what
we what we want so most of the remaining
schemes are based on public key
cryptography
which is quite a bit less efficient than
symmetric key encryption so we were
excited to see that Castelluccio had
recently developed a symmetric
homomorphic encryption scheme for use in
wireless sensor networks and a pretty
nice feature of this scheme is it is the
basic idea behind it it's very simple so
in preparing this talk I sort of debated
how much should I go into the technical
details here and then I thought well
this is one of the beautiful areas where
the technical lead the technical details
are actually relatively easy to
communicate so I want to give it a try
so the idea between the symmetric
homomorphic encryption scheme is Alice
has a message in and one and she suppose
she generates a random value or one then
she encrypts by adding those two values
together and because our one is random
this ciphertext is randomly distributed
so someone can decrypt if and only if
they know this piece of randomness it's
our one similarly Bob has a message a
piece of randomness and encrypts in
analogous way then they can add these
two things together and basically what
you have is the message the two messages
added together plus the two pieces of
randomness added together so anyone who
knows those two pieces of randomness can
decrypt otherwise it appears random
so the biggest problem with that simple
view of the scheme oh yeah
it's it's a mod a large factor yeah a
large with its power you can you can
choose it just just large yeah so you
want to choose a large enough so that
when you're when you're adding these
things up
you don't overflow but other than that
you can choose whatever you like so if a
power of two is convenient to to power
two if it's not convenient to something
else yeah
other questions
so the problem with that really simple
view is that if if allister's encrypted
values this way if she then wants to
decrypt she has to remember what all of
those pieces of randomness are so she
probably has to store them cuz they're
random things how do you remember a
whole sequence of random things while
storing them means she's storing a whole
bunch of stuff and also that's not very
secure she's storing all these paths
that will be used to decrypt so what we
want is a predictable and efficiently
computable source of something that's
like randomness so pseudo randomness
means that it's indistinguishable from
random unless you know a secret such as
a key and this bit what
indistinguishable means can be
formalized so what pseudo random
function families do is they provide the
capability Alice needs here so she if
she has a key that's used as an index
for this function family so she gets a
function f sub ka which is fir
pseudo-random function and she can then
encrypt by she takes her a message and
she adds to it the her pseudo function
her pseudo-random function evaluated at
a nonce which is just a non repeating
value or rarely repeating value so for
example a good thing to take here would
be the timestamp and the presents type
that she's encrypting so at this
particular time so what if she wants to
decrypt she knows what time and what
type of present state she can then
compute this past year and subtract her
off from the ciphertext and get her
message back her value back
so as long as her pseudo-random function
is truly indistinguishable for random
her message is safe from anyone who
doesn't know the key so we're getting to
where we can talk about these protocols
so the one on this slide is one which
enables partial need-to-know security
but where the analyst to decrypt needs
to know all the keys used to encrypt so
as usual you need to choose security
parameter a large modulus we use H Mac
as the pseudo random function family
being a length matching hash function H
and for key generation each team n
member generates her own key and then to
encrypt that team member uses her
pseudo-random function that's indexed by
that key to encrypt as we saw just by
adding what we're calling the pad this
piece of pseudo randomness and to
compute a sum you just simply have the
ciphertext and to decrypt anyone was
access to all of the keys can decrypt by
computing these paths for the nonces the
timestamp and presents type of the
values contributing to the sum and
subtracting them off from the encrypted
sum
so the issue here is that the analyst if
the analyst can decrypt the sum the
analyst can decrypt all the individual
values another issue is that decryption
requires the computation of a lot of
pads so a more complex key structure
that will present next completely solves
the first problem and reduces the second
so it's nice that by making the protocol
more secure we also make it faster that
doesn't always happen and again the idea
behind this is not too hard
so suppose each user had a set of its
own random values and then all of those
values plus are 0 which we're going to
give to the analyst add up to 0 then if
the users encrypt using these pieces of
randomness then so by adding these
pieces of randomness to their values
then when you sum all those values
you're going to get the sum of their
values plus the sum of all those pieces
of randomness
now if the analyst adds our zoom to that
because of this property here all of the
pieces of randomness disappear and
you're just left with the sum of the
values and so in this way the analyst
can just by knowing are 0 can decrypt
the sum but our 0 does not enable the
analyst to decrypt any of the individual
values so that's the idea then trying to
figure out how to actually implement
something like this was a little
trickier so the best thing I was able to
come up with early on was that
the users come up with keys and share
them in a certain way that give a
similar property so the analyst
generates a key k0 each user generates
her own key and then the analyst and the
users share keys as follows so a user
shares her key with her neighbor with
the index one higher okay so the analyst
shares her key with the first user
similarly the last user will share her
key with the analyst they're sort of
reading here and then to encrypt again
we're just adding pets but it's a little
bit more complicated as before we have
the pad corresponding a user adds the
the pad corresponding to her own key and
then she tracks off the pad
corresponding to the key she received
from her neighbor and the point of doing
this is that when you sum all those
cipher texts almost all the pads cancel
out and the two that don't cancel out
are the first and last ones which are
the ones that the analyst has so in the
end you get the sum of all the cipher
texts is the sum of all the messages
plus the first pad - the last pad and
since the analyst has these two keys by
how we did this sharing in the first
place the analyst can compute those pads
and can command can obtain the sum of
all the statistics however the analyst
cannot decrypt any of the values making
up that sum because she does not have
any of the keys
for the individual values so that's
that's our first fully need-to-know
protocol and then I'm not going to go
through this in detail but the same idea
can be generalized to get a little bit
more security so if you look at if you
look at this protocol a when a user
encrypts her own value
she's using a key that she has shared
with one neighbor
Aniki that she's received from the other
neighbor so if the two neighbors on
either side
clewd they can decrypt her value so we
want to make it a little bit more secure
and so we were also able to come up with
a whole family of protocols where you
needed to have K users collude instead
of just two and basically if you have a
graph structure in which the analyst and
all the team members have k plus one
neighbors you can do a similar key
sharing scheme and a similar encryption
where you add so in the paths subtract
off others of the paths and then when
you add them all together the tabs
cancel except for the ones that the
analyst has the has the keys for and so
in this way we get a family of protocols
that are secured against k clusion
users one comment is that this key
structure that we came up with his is a
little bit more complicated than this
original idea of finding random numbers
finding a source of random numbers that
add up to zero and I didn't see how to
do that and it asset as an open question
and Elaine she at Park thought about it
for a while and came out
with a way to get a series of random
numbers that have this property at each
time step and so we have a joint paper
coming out with that view it has some
advantages and some disadvantages it's
secure against any sorts of collusion up
to I mean nothing can be secured against
everybody colluding because if the sums
available then if everybody says what
their value is your value is not secure
but beyond that it's it's very elegant
in this respect and and doesn't have the
cake illusion issue on the other hand
because the decryption is much harder
it's restricted to a small plaintext
space so anyway there's I believe
there's a lot more work that can be done
both on need-to-know protocols that do
other things than just sums for example
other ways of obtaining these things I
did want to mention that in related work
as I had mentioned before most
approaches to this problem uses
multi-party computation where the
clients are involved in each stage
another piece of related work that
you'll hear in this space is
differential privacy and it addresses an
orthogonal issue it addresses the
question of if you obtain a statistic
what can you learn just from that
statistic about the individual values
and sometimes the answer is quite a bit
and so one a really interesting question
is can you combine our need-to-know
protocols with differential privacy and
in the standard differential privacy
setup there's an assumption of a trusted
third party who calculates the
statistics and then adds noise in a way
that makes it hard to figure out what's
going on with the individual values but
they saw everything and what and
what we're able to do is combine
differential privacy with the need to
know protocols to obtain both the
need-to-know property and differential
privacy without the need for a trusted
third party there was a previous paper
by Rastogi and NAT and Nath that use
secure multi-party computation
techniques to achieve differentially
private aggregation without a third
party but again that requires clients
participating at each point finally
there's a certain amount of work in the
wireless sensor network setting that
builds on Casa Lucia's work as well but
other than that we believe were the
first application of their symmetric
homomorphic encryption scheme outside of
wireless sensor networks so to wrap up
this is a really exciting area of how do
you support privacy and utility with all
this data collection and we hear very
frequently the cynical view that privacy
is dead and that there's nothing we can
do about it except to mourn its death
and that made it be fun to write about
but we think it's actually more fun and
certainly much more challenging to ask
well what can we do that do here that's
useful and one area to look at is just
having a better understanding of what
user preferences are with respect to
what do they want to learn from the data
and what are their concerns about the
data and then there's all sorts of
interesting questions about finding
mechanisms to encourage benefits and
reduce harm and these can be
cryptographic like the one I presented
today or they can be economic or social
and immediately the challenges are big
that's probably why the privacy is dead
slogan gets passed around on the other
hand that means that there's lots of
room for many people to work towards
interesting solutions to wrap up we'd
like to thank particularly Bill Van
Melle and Adam Lee who worked with us on
the security industry part of this work
and the entire my unity team bill
theater
Pernilla Crawford and Tony Dunnigan and
others and we particularly like to thank
all the my unity users and study
participants for their help with all
this work and if you're interested in
learning more please talk with us and
here also some references to look
so let me see if I understood your
question well enough but we use H Mac as
a keyed pseudo-random function family so
I make up my own key and that gives me a
pseudo-random function family basically
a version of H Mac and then in our
particular case we're interested in
encrypting each of these five bits of a
present state at a given time so
what the nonce is that the that version
of HVAC is is evaluated on is the time
stamp together with the presence type
okay so yes yes so that's all public
knowledge the only secrets are the keys
so those have to be guarded very
carefully but yeah absolutely this is my
understanding one which you already know
keep because of your t-shirt right and
then if you easy rover which the
analysts transcribe which ever seen urge
to zero this should be about the same as
if you are repeated over users all right
okay I didn't quite follow that last
part sorry
okay yes okay no it's it's the index
into a function that
right yes this is used with opiates
on poles or the south east use by the
other participants because it has that
algebraic relationship you don't use
that algebraic relationship to get it
but yeah yeah yeah yeah yes yes so any
cyber things would be one part of this
algebraic expression applause the number
right so basically zero is equivalent to
this multivariate expression right so so
not the key but the the function value
in the function the pseudo-random
function evaluated at that time yes for
the for that yep yep so any more than
creation and you'll do if not even
engage right function okay so we call
those paths by the way the animals
length that
each user's back crack right
so one of the pads but not to that
operation the yeah so no because there's
still there's still a random number
number so each user is in this way yes
so say it's the first user and the first
user is encrypting with it as you say k0
and k1 so as you say the analyst mean
okay zero and can commute this pad right
but
the the animals can't get any
information about this pad
yeah we might have to go to a blackboard
but anyone else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
