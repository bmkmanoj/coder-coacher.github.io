welcome to the open source developers at
Go
speaker series which is our speaker
series designed to give the general
public a better idea of what some of the
awesome open-source developers that
Google has hired are up to in their
daily lives it is my pleasure this
evening to present ben collins-sussman
and brian fitzpatrick two of the
engineers who work on Google's open
source team and in their evening Jobs or
subversion developers and I don't know
just generally awesome guys so without
further ado I shall hand you over to Ben
and Fitz who are going to be discussing
this evening what's in it for me how
your company can benefit from open
source and code Thanks huh so he's been
and I'm Fitz and we're gonna couple
different things this evening having to
do with companies and organizations open
sourcing typically existing code base I
think we should point out this is sort
of a follow up to another talk that
we've been giving for years about how to
manage an open-source community if
you've already got an open source
community but then we sort of realized
there's this other demand that there are
a lot of organizations and corporations
that are thinking of starting open
source communities or releasing code to
the world and they have a lot of
questions about how to do that so that's
that's where this talk is coming from
right so the standard disclaimers apply
these are our opinions if you disagree
with them we recommend you get your own
talk somewhere else
our target audience against their
organizations and companies that want to
open code and it's it's basically
different strategies for open sourcing
code beyond the fact that you're just
throwing a pile of source code out there
we're going to talk about the pros and
cons of each again our opinions and
prescribe best practices for for doing
so so to start off why would you go open
source in the first place why are you
going to open source part or all of you
a particular code base that you have you
basically want to do it not just because
you're a nice person although you may
very well be a nice person but because
there's some sort of gain for you your
company to get from doing this um
whether that's creating better software
or creating a real relationship with
your users especially if your users in
some case are developers which is often
the way that open-source projects begin
and what are your goals are there's
public relations or you're looking for
goodwill free labor is a big deal too
because a lot of times it can it can
absolutely be the difference between
releasing your product in five years
versus releasing your product in a year
if you've got
20 volunteers working on it it just
depends on how you're able to manage
that and then of course if money is not
necessarily an issue to you sometimes
people will release code just to disrupt
a whole area of market on purpose and
that's that's a great thing too if you
have the resources for it right it's
hard to compete in some cases with a
closed source product if an open source
one is available and sort of commoditize
is that particular area especially if
it's if it's really good so when we talk
about open source software one of the
things at least will not have talked
with fits our buddy Karl when we talk
about how good a piece of open source
software is we actually don't
necessarily talk about the software
itself the first thing we talk about is
how healthy is the community because it
doesn't matter if you have the best
software ever written if it's just
sitting on a server and nobody's looking
at it nobody's developing it or
supporting it it may as well not exist
and so that's always the first thing we
look at is you know how active is the
community how active is the user
community and the developer community
and that is ultimately the metric we use
for evaluating success when we talk
about releasing open-source software and
you'll see that in the slides coming up
that's how we measure that's our main
metric it's not users we don't want a
billion users if they use the product
once to go away and we want people that
are going to be heavy users and that's a
theme and you hear a lot here at Google
you want people who use the product so
usage is important howdy how is that
community healthy active developers you
can't just have people that say they're
developers you know show up and sort of
constantly moving forward in one way or
another and if you don't have a
community
you basically might as well not have a
piece of software because it's
eventually going to bit rot until
eventually some sort of community comes
and picks it up and make something
happen with it because remember if you
the way that operating systems and and
just the state of the art changes
there's gonna be incompatibilities that
are introduced and changes that make
your software no longer work over the
course of time unless you have someone
maintaining it right right and modifying
and changing it that sort of thing so
why don't we talk about the first do I
mean I'll do this one the zero the zero
of course we're counting by starting at
0 this is the first approach to
Oakland searching software and that is
you put out a press release that you've
just open sourced your code but your
license does not actually open source
this is not really a strategy but we
listed here because companies have done
this before and it's great because you
get a little bit of PR and you don't
have to do a darn thing but it's awful
because people will call you out and
you'll look like a fool and people may
burn your house down so there is a lot
of point in doing its unless unless your
goal is to destroy trust with your users
that's about the really the only
long-term effect this have basically
been trying to get some open-source mojo
without actually doing the work involved
and in some of its cluelessness but some
of it is actually I think somewhat
malicious but it's it's not a long-term
sustainable nor is it really going to do
you any good so that brings us to the
the initial approach I think that a lot
of companies did which is a throat code
over the wall you clean up the code you
remove names from it you get approved by
legal you put the licenses in the files
you push it over the wall and then you
go back to your poker game that's really
great you get you can get a PR splash
maybe but the public relations foo
you're going to get from that isn't from
developers or open-source programmers
that's gonna be you're gonna get that
from people that have no idea what open
source our development is from it's
gonna be sort of off out in the other
world that possibly management possibly
users that sort of thing it's pretty
effortless it's not that hard to do this
the cons are that you don't have any
community to keep your software alive
and if one does form it's going to form
somewhere and way far away from you most
likely so your software starts to get
rot real techies realize that you're not
doing anything really relatively
interesting and they don't give you any
credibility no you know a lot of
companies do this when they simply want
to stop maintaining software
I mean it's actually just sort of a
cast-off technique like well the
software is good it would be terrible to
delete a bit rot inside the company so
we'll let it bit rot outside the company
well you know sometimes sometimes if
they're lucky a community will pick it
up and walk away and run with it and
that's great but certainly as a
corporation you're left out you know
maybe that's what you intended but
usually not right unless there's some
revolutionary interesting
thing going on in the code that's
someone else can pick up and use or
codex or something like that but that's
not often the case so the next level of
I guess where we're numbering these
strategies in terms of goodness I
suppose and that is you have a public
code repository so people can actually
see what you're doing instead of a one
time push over the wall you're actually
pushing over the wall on a daily basis
all three developments still happening
in-house all your design decisions all
of your discussions but you know when
you actually make code changes people
can see it and this is nice I mean you
definitely get good better better PR and
you may actually get some volunteers
contributing because they can track the
code as it changes from day to day and
say AHA I see a bug or here's here's a
little enhancement let me mail it to you
guys so you get a little bit more cred
the problem with this of course is that
you're not really giving full
participatory rights to these volunteers
and this is this is a theme that comes
up over and over we talk about having
the bus keys meaning you're driving a
bus and we think about projects as
everybody sitting at a bus going in a
certain direction and if you don't let
everybody take turns driving the bus and
really having a kind of sense of stake
or ownership in the project you're not
going to get great participation you're
not gonna get really high quality
developers yeah you get no leaders and
and really what you sort of get drive-by
patches you know people will maybe walk
by give you a little patch walk away
there's no incentive for them to stay in
because they don't have any sense of
ownership and they're the followers and
they they tend and they tend not to be
so helpful I mean certainly not as
strong as developers who you might hire
and the same the same issues are as with
the the previous strategies in that if
they're the software is alive in the
sense that you're paying people in your
company to keep it alive but you don't
really have an open-source community
around it if your company dies and goes
under that software is not gonna live on
you don't really have an external
community that you're participating and
maybe a bunch of followers will pop up
somewhere sort of like a fan club but
it's not it's not particularly useful to
the project itself and there's a general
sense of distrust I mean I mean it's not
consensus-based organization it's a
corporation doing what it wants and
throwing little scraps to the public
trust I mean your decision-making in
your ideas about where you're gonna go
and what you're gonna do and your
general developments taking place in
house the only point people externally
can determine what where you're going is
by looking at your code possibly your
log messages and they have no idea where
you're going next so there's a little
bit of tends to be a bit of uneasiness
as well as general distrust what is your
agenda what is your company getting
about by doing this open source
development are you gonna pull the rug
out and change things up really quickly
one day is it gonna leave people users
or developers and alerts that sort of
thing so so there's always that so so
moving along but you have the open
monarchy so this open monarchy
development is where you have a public
discussion in public repository your
committees are mostly employees but
every once in a while you'll give a
volunteer the key is someone outside of
your company will get if they're really
extraordinary
and one one entity and typically in this
case we're talking about one lead
developer there's your project leading
the company that rules the project and
makes all the decisions so it's very
top-down organization the decrees come
from you know on high from this one
person and everyone else is sort of
implementers and doers this is
essentially the same as the previous
slide except that the discussions are
taking place in public the company is
still running the show it's making all
the decisions it's just at least it's
talking out in public about what it's
doing right and you can see them making
their decisions so the pros again is and
you can get public relations benefits
from opening this bit you will get more
credibility from techies because they
can see that you're actually starting to
do your development in public and you
you will attract better quality
volunteers because they can participate
more they can see more of what's going
on they have more insight into what
you're doing it's not a matter of hey do
this or that sort of thing they have a
better idea of where your roadmap is
they can pick up new features they can
pick up bugs they can participate
directly in the discussions now they may
or may not really be able to effect
those discussions in the sense that you
know the corporate agenda will always
win but it but at least they can
participate right right and that gives
them a little more sense of ownership
and this was we want to put better
software as a result with with somewhat
less effort from your part
internally engineering-wise the problem
is that that this isn't a long-term
sustainable thing what happens when your
company can discontinue the product what
happens when the person who is the lead
disappears
what happens to that leadership there's
a power void there and there isn't
anyone used to sort of filling that
spliff the corporation just takes the
software in a direction that really
angers everyone
angers all the users or angles the other
developers who are volunteering their
time and they're powerless to affect
this new direction then they that's
where we talk about angry revolutions
that may force the project and can walk
away because they've essentially they've
got no vote and you still find the sense
of general distrust there as well yeah
which leads us on to consensus based
development this is the one that
obviously we've been working towards
this is what we try to preach and
persuade companies to go with and it
might be obvious to a lot of people who
already work at open source software but
it's actually sort of shocking to a lot
of corporations that haven't thought
about open source and the theory is that
everything is public all of your
discussion all of your code all of your
decision making almost any well almost
everything well except maybe you'll have
an internal mailing list to talk about
you know private agenda such but the
point is all decisions are made based on
the consensus of the community in other
words the project is its own
organization it exists independently of
any corporation that is paying people to
work on it and the people who are
members of the project they're the ones
who make the decisions they may all be
wearing two hats right they may all be
wearing a hat of the corporation that
pays them to work on the software but
they're also wearing the hat of what is
good for this project in the long term
because you know I may not always be
working for the same company and I want
this software to live independent of my
employer and this is the shocking bit to
a lot of folks is that in order to join
the community you actually have to earn
your access and we have interesting
stories where for example Fitz and I
used to work at CollabNet which was a
company that sponsored the subversion
project and they actually did a good job
of building a consensus database
development and we hired somebody and
friend of ours named Mike pilato to work
on subversion full time full time
employee and he showed up the first day
and he said all right where do I start
committing the code and we said well
you're gonna have to earn
access well what do you mean well you're
gonna have to submit patches and prove
to everyone else in the project that
people that we boys have closed exactly
it's a bunch of people who didn't worry
that you have to prove to them that that
that you are gonna play by the rules and
that you're a good team member and you
know it's essentially like a second job
application right even though kleban
it's paying you to write this code it's
a it's a separate barrier but what you
wind up with is is is this isn't a
slight to the people who are working on
your project who are an employees of the
corporation these people can see oh you
know we've got they've hired someone but
that person still has to prove that they
understand how our community works that
they have a general clue and they
they're going through the same process
that these other people have gone
through but we have seen corporations
that write that sort of are driving open
source projects and they do commit this
I call it a big mistake though hire
somebody work on the software and let us
give them commit access instantly and
that breaks the social norms it breaks
the fabric that holds the community
together because suddenly it's not about
whether people want you in the community
it's just about whether some corporation
has happened to give you technical
access or not now sort of sort of a
digression on this is is a story about
our friend Carl a few years ago so the
subversion community we have a document
on our style guide we have a basically
readability access that you have you
have to write our code in a certain way
you document in a certain way about your
log message a certain way and it's
actually an unbelievably
obsessive/compulsive list of things that
people are required to but it's very
clear it's very it's very clear exactly
there's very little question about what
you should or shouldn't do as far as
formatting the code and that's and
documenting things are however this is a
way of inviting new people in our
community people understand once they
come in how things are done and we get
volunteers from around the world dozens
and dozens of them to follow this they
submit patches and for free they're not
getting paid and we say oh you know this
doesn't conform to this read that make
these changes they resubmit all doesn't
do that quite yet read and resubmit five
six times before a patch is accepted and
these people are doing this because they
want to be part of this community they
want to work on this project our friend
Carl went to a company he was doing some
consulting with and you know he was
talking about using our version control
system and giving
assistant log messages in that sort of
thing and they're like oh you know we
can never get our developers to write
consistent log messages we just can't
get to do it and Hart was sort of at a
loss of what to say think what you know
aren't you paying their salaries and
it's like yeah but just can't get him to
do this and because like I have 30
people throw across the world don't pay
a thing to and they do everything that
we tell them to do it's because these
people want to be part of this community
you're you earn being a member of this
community there is a barrier to entry
it's not a hazing process or some sort
of abuse but it's it's it just it means
something right it means it the
membership actually has a meaning
because you had to work for it a little
bit and prove that you were willing to
play by the rules just just as a sign of
goodwill towards the rest of the
community right it's not it's not so
much about hazing so this is a great way
to work you get PR slowly at first and
over time it gets greater and greater
and greater it's gotten to the point now
where I think CollabNet that that's
their entire business plan is basically
supporting subversion then and it may
disagree with they may disagree with
that but but I mean that is that is
their central marketing and the PR now
is like hey we are the founders of a
subversion project come to us we're the
experts and that was something it took
many years to achieve but it is a
long-term strategy and it's really
paying off for them now techies will
give you absolute cred you get the best
volunteers you get the the leaders kind
of folks that you would love to hire in
your company and in fact that is what
happens in fact a lot of the times
people who come into these projects they
get full ownership of the project they
really drive the bus and a corporation
will say hey we want to hire you to work
on this full-time instead of on weekends
it's a great great opportunity for them
everyone trusts each other there's a lot
of respect the software is as good as
it's gonna get I mean you have the
absolutely best people looking at it and
everyone's doing it because they're
passionate about it not because they're
being paid to do it necessarily right
that is that you're not gonna get a big
boost about this from this right away
you're not gonna get that sudden like
you know PR woohoo waving the flag we
were at least a bunch of code kind of a
thing but and also in the short term you
really have to put the focus of the
project first you can't sort of start
tweaking it and adding things to it and
making changes that are gonna suddenly
give your company some sort of benefit
if you're writing a piece of software to
accomplish a particular task or address
a particular shortcoming or need you
have to concentrate on doing that
results in better software but it might
not get you what you want as a company
it drives project managers crazy right
because a customer will say we need
feature X yeah well why can't we tell
our developers to write feature X and
the software and the answer is well you
can but they're gonna have to get the
entire community to agree on this and
usually it's not a problem sometimes it
is and you have to walk that line and be
careful that your own corporate agenda
is not coming before what the community
wants are nice and as our president say
it's hard work it's how you but you need
to hire strong leaders you can't just
take a bunch of engineers and throw them
at this project or this problem you need
to hire people who are designers
architects coders engineers understand
algorithm and they have to play well
with others and they hand and say
there's a weak market there and play
well with others
right so you're looking for people who
are working in a used to working in a
team environment and can work with other
people so why do we think this is best
one of the things that we've sort of
come to see over the past few years
working working in both internally at
Google and other places is that the in
the past companies have isolated their
developers from their users they their
developers can be more productive if you
lock them in a room by themselves give
them peace and quiet and some music or
whatever not and let them write code
well my argument against that is if
they're writing the wrong code it
doesn't matter how much code they're
writing so it whether whether your
consumers are our internal or external
the closer you can bring your consumer
the consumers of your code to the people
writing the code and get get a positive
feedback loop as opposed to the sort of
Slashdot you suck feedback loop you can
be a more productive engineers and
better software I think there's another
reason I believe to think that this is
the best of that is it is the most
long-term sustainable in the sense that
companies will come and go individual
participants in the project will come
and go but if the project is run well on
the community is really based on this
consensus driven system it will last a
really really long time and we've
watched this happen for a good product I
mean like like the Apache Software
Foundation right with
apache and web server project itself
it's been going out for years even
though 12 years people have come and
gone and companies have come and gone
and I guess in a perfect situation you
know there's a lot of similarities to
what people talking about government
models right a lot of people will say
the ideal government is an enlightened
despot the problem is you can't always
get one and if you can it's not
sustainable right so people settle for
democracy and this is sort of a similar
kind of argument ideally there are
projects out there where there really
isn't enlightened despot like Linus or
maybe that's not a good example but we
don't Guido exactly that's a good lesson
for the Python project enlightened
despot does a great job
not necessarily sustainable in the long
term maybe someone will succeed him or
maybe maybe somebody won't but yeah
exactly
but if you've really got a sort of a
consensus based system you're guaranteed
people will always step up and the
project will keep going so and if you do
this right that your internal developers
will see the benefits one of the things
about this is that internal developers
who aren't used to working in the open
source world they can have it we'll talk
a little more about this in a minute but
they can have a hard time understanding
why is this good I you know people
watching me work and it seems like a
waste of time but if if it's done right
you know we'll see the benefits of
actually doing this from a software
point of view this is where people a lot
of corporations get freaked out they're
saying wait you're asking me to
essentially take my product and throw it
to a bunch of random strangers and let
them decide what to do with it and
that's that's one way of looking at it
it's not very it's not a useful way of
looking at it the answer is no one's
gonna hijack your product no one's gonna
force you to do anything the way you
make sure that happens is you start the
project out with a really good small
core group of people who trust each
other who respect each other who are
humble who work well with others and who
are going to attract like-minded people
it's really that small core establishes
the culture of the product and the whole
project rather and and it becomes a
self-selecting group way but to address
the control thing when you talk about
community centric consensus based
software development people immediately
think that a bunch of weirdos on the
internet or start writing my software
and making decisions you know the world
is full of jerks except the internet
makes it seem like they all live right
next door
okay so the thing is is that what you
have to do there's a lot of things you
can do this to do this first of all is
you have to set the stage for your
software development you need to choose
a well scope mission of what your
software products going to do this is
again a lot of this just comes down to
communication things that probably seem
obvious to you and me but in general
people sort of look past them because
they're focused on the engineering
aspect so choose a well scope mission to
establish a culture of your project
preferably a respectful one not every
culture is respectful necessarily set
the tone of your discussion carefully
don't be afraid to tell people you know
we're not we don't treat each other like
that someone starts flaming and swearing
and screaming and cursing and like me
and then Ben tells me to stop it
but you know have a decision-making
process process and a talk that we gave
here last year that's up on a google
video as well is uh what is our
poisonous people talk it's how to
protect your open-source project from
poisonous people and that sort of gives
you a lot of tips and clues on how to
handle this sort of the chaos that's
surrounding you and the rest of the
world we're actually gonna go into
detail about how to sort of set up one
of these communities now I think that's
that's where we're headed so we do this
a lot of words like everything's a lot
of work I mean I I noticed you know at
least with the subversion project it
started out with just a handful of us
after three or four years I found that I
was spending half my time coding and
after my time managing the community and
and I don't think that was a waste of
time because it was necessary to keep it
going
yep so a lot of people people are afraid
of forking they you've put your code out
there and with a free lor open license
and people can actually take a copy of
it go somewhere else start working on it
rename it and just start doing things
with it companies are freaked out about
this however when you're doing consensus
based development this is actually
extremely rare because if the majority
of the people are happy with the
direction your software is going in and
a minority leaves well you know so what
you've lost a minority of your
developers certainly you don't want to
alienate people in your in your project
but if 70 percent of the people are
happy with what's going on in 30 percent
all right and they want to go out there
maybe it's best that they go elsewhere
and doose do what they want to do
why what they want to do GCC did this
many years ago with the eggs project
remember and what happened near any
years later they emerged again usually
forking as a sign of a dysfunctional
community at least many of the Forks
that I've seen and it's you can't
necessarily point to blame out any one
person but if your community is running
very well and healthy and things are
getting done and people are happy
there's very low chance of working so if
you're putting if you're putting energy
meeting developers and people working on
your project and and in general its
operating in consensus you're gonna have
to worry about forking so how do you
build a consensus based open-source
software project essentially these first
two slides are similar but they're
important you need to come up with a
goal which attracts people has to be
something that you can give an elevator
pitch and say wow that sounds exciting I
really want to get involved somebody who
might just volunteer their time on
weeknights or somebody might want to
join your company to work on this sort
of a project it has to be widely
appealing it might benefit your company
but it more a little more than likely
it's something it will benefit your
company in the long term not in the
short term there won't be oh we're gonna
get this little thing written for this
customer next week it's going to be hey
we're gonna change the industry in a way
that helps our company or we're going to
help our product in the long run clients
a good example of that they they were
shipping a product that used CVS and
they said well you know our customers
hate CVS let's write a replacement for
CVS it's going to take years let's start
an open-source project around that and
it many years later it did pay payback
but there was a lot of upfront
investment that they had to write and
Google has recently done this with
releasing the Google web toolkit which
is being done in a completely open
environment and in a consensus-based
model as well so the the next thing to
do is to write a mission statement
people kind of get all freaked out and
think oh my god MBAs are in the room I'm
not an MBA and you know business off
mission statement touchy-feely exactly
and we're not married that it's not to
each other but so you need some sort of
a mission statement again communication
communicate is short succeed sentence to
end to any prospective developer who
might want to join your project what
you're about and also non goals are
important you might want to list at the
bottom of this sort of
you've got what what's what what are you
not about what don't you want to do this
way when someone takes a look at your
project which is a version control
system and is thinking I really want to
hack this 3d OpenGL visualization tool
into the core libraries of subversion
you could say you know we're not about
that we said specifically we're only
about software version and if it's
documented on a webpage it carries a
huge amount of weight as opposed to just
replying to somebody on an email list
and saying no that's not really what our
communities is about really weird how
that works people if someone says I want
to do this with your project and you say
well no we really don't want to do that
they're gonna argue with you until the
cows come home but if you say actually
we don't do that if you look at our
mission over here it's on the page they
may argue a little bit but they're gonna
peter out and disappear this is how you
keep your community focused right you
don't want folks coming along and
diverting diverting attention and trying
to to take you off your work by changing
the route completely let when you
establish this community have a mission
before you go in with what usually does
not work and I've seen a lot of this say
on sites like source where somebody will
have an idea for something they'll start
a source which project they'll invite
people there'll be no code no mission no
goals nothing written out and the
mailing list just turns to a bunch of
people yelling at each other about what
they think the thing should be works out
a lot better if you have a small group
of people who write a good mission maybe
they have a little bit of code to
demonstrate it then they go to the
public and they say here's what we're
about if you want to join us great if
you're not interested that's fine but at
least it's clear as to whether this is a
community that you want to take part in
or not and you don't have to get spend
hours and days arguing about people
aren't typically typically malicious
about there are plenty of people out
there but people are there they're just
they want to participate they want to
get part of the great stuff you've got
going and they want to do what they're
interested in and what they're
passionate about and directing that or
deflecting that depending on what the
case might be is a really important sort
of skill to learn I would say for any
progress preserve time must prover focus
right that's the time another consensus
I mean the energy open-source projects
aren't about cash they're about time and
focus and energy that's what that's what
the sort of currency of the open source
world
if you like someone you pay them by
giving them your focus and time and this
is how you protect your focus right
so repair your team this book which is
written by our friend karl fogel right
here isn't actually a great book to read
it's also free on the net at producing
OSS calm it basically just discusses
sort of the social bits and the nuts and
bolts around building an open-source
project or free software project which
ever you have thickening everyone's skin
this this this is a bullet I think
that's pretty important especially if
you're working with it with a bunch of
corporate folks who have never done
open-source software before and that is
in the open source world it is normal
for people to review each other's code
to say hey you made a mistake here I
think this design is wrong and it is not
a personal thing it's just people saying
well let's make the product better so
I'm going to give you feedback on what
you just did or what you're about to do
in the corporate world of software
development this is not normal in fact a
lot of folks will say well this isn't
based companies in many in many
companies yes I it's hard to say whether
it's the normal we haven't worked in
thousands of companies but I've seen it
and some companies I worked in where
people own certain areas of code and
they make whatever changes they want and
if you dare to comment on what they're
doing it's taken as a personal offence
you've attacked them and you need to
teach folks that no this is you know you
are not your code it is normal to get
criticized or at least have your code
criticized and that's that's part of the
iterative development
I think it comes to being companies
whose primary focus isn't software
engineering they're using engineering as
a tool to accomplish something my friend
Matt went took started working in a
small company and engineering he was
really excited to work with this project
that was very it was very exciting thing
and he came in there and he did a code
review and someone submitted something
and he did another code review and
another code of view and then the
manager called them in and Psyche dude
you're really bumming people out by all
the incredibly I mean yeah people are
just really getting upset you're hurting
feelings and you know you're like you
shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff
he's like what excuse me you know so
it's open-source world is very different
for people who are used to being in sort
of the quiet calm collected non
open-source world internal prepare your
developers for them
so once you've done that it's time to
move your development to the public
launch public mailing lists a public
source code repository bug tracker again
communication tools minimize the
internal use of internal mailing lists I
often recommend to people that they
delete the mailing list entirely but
typically if someone's developing
something that might be a tool or
something else that other products
internally leverage they're going to
have internal users that need to talk
about it
it is really tempting to slip back into
the internal list though especially when
a project was getting started
what happened to us all right well I
started developing subversion there were
just maybe four or five people and most
of us were working for one company and
we said well why are we having all our
discussions on this mailing list
nobody's listening it's kind of and and
so we rather than wanting to participate
in the arguments the discussion we would
just go back to the internal list and
sort of make a decision then and we got
called out on this the CTO said you guys
are absolutely sabotaging the project do
not do this you know stop using the
internal list period and we fought and
kicked and screamed when we went back to
the public list and actually turned out
not to be so bad after all just quite a
little more work on our part we were
being lazy and seven years later we're
like oh man Wow well actually we were
kind of idiots a few months later some
of the best developers we ever had just
showed up because they could see there
was an effort I think going into the
discussion yeah it was really turning
into something special so so once you
got this develop a policy for working
with internal consumers of your project
so you don't have to if someone has a
question that can be asked and the
public lists it should be asked there
and do some public relations get some
volunteers don't be afraid of that one
of the things that I've seen I was to be
the vice president of public relations
at the Apache Software Foundation and
it's got to be the most thankless job
I've ever had in my life because most
engineers think public relations is a
waste of time they really do they think
they think public relations they
suddenly think all sizzle no steak and
it can be sizzle with steak you know
some people never want to learn that
however do some public relations get
some people interested get the word out
there about your project and when it
comes to stag mailing lists and whatnot
it's tempting to set up one firt bug
tracking one for commits one for users
one for this one for that you're just
never going to get any sort of energy or
critical mass when a project starts
usually the developers and the users are
the same people right there's there's
little difference between those groups
as a project gets bigger and bigger and
bigger and more popular eventually what
you'll notice is there are so many users
who are asking for help or asking how to
use the product they can start to help
each other in fact and it becomes a lot
of noise to the point where it's hard
for developers to actually talk about
the development of a software it's lost
in the user noise and there's nothing
wrong with users but at that point
that's sort of the point where you want
to split your developer and users list
and say alright if you're working on the
software itself come here if you want to
talk about how to use the software help
each other come over here and that's
fine we did that with subversion we just
finally split off our users for my
developers mailing list Ben was do you
know still answering a lot of users
questions and one day we told them we
forbad him from answering email for 24
hours and what happened is some of our
users started answering other users
questions and we realize well who needs
us it was great a bit moved to Hawaii
and sat on a beach for you no kidding
so the summary of this obviously is is
you you want to choose a strategy based
on your goals if your goals are just a
big PR splash and throw your coat over
the wall again o declaring something not
open-source when it's not open-source
could have your house burned down that
idea there's always trade-offs there's
no black and white involved into this
there's a lot of gray area in in what
you do and what combination of these
four different things but the more
energy you put into building a long-term
community the more long-term benefit
you'll get I think that's that's the
ultimate trade-off and the less energy
you put in upfront the more the project
is likely to just fizzle on its own just
fizzle out so it's a risk that you have
to calculate on how much energy do we
have how long do we want this together
how much time and energy do we have yep
I think that's yep that's it lose it so
move on to Q&amp;amp;A if anyone has any
questions or more helpfully any answers
that'd be great yes is it can use the
microphone please oh wow there you have
microphones cool
so you guys were talking about the
different kinds of open-source projects
they were I was wondering what do you
consider things like OpenOffice and
asterisk the types of systems that are
you know corporately controlled and you
have to sign over all of your rights to
the corporation I mean are those healthy
for the open source environment well I'm
not to do with Astra's and I'm vaguely
familiar with open or Open Office but I
don't think it falls I think it falls
somewhere in the middle of the zero
through four that we spoke about and I
think there's different ways there's
different ways of doing it and I don't
know if one sort of healthy or unhealthy
and signing over your right so to speak
I mean that's sort of a separate issue
because even like a free software
foundation ask you to sign them
copyright well in a lot of cases it
makes it difficult for other people that
would contribute otherwise to I mean
like people like the free software
foundation I may trust because they are
the free software foundation but Digium
you're signing over your right and son
also
I mean we can get an illegal stuff
forever but you can't sign away your
copyright this is a commissar you can
assign a copyright but whatever you give
those rights to another company and
typically what those companies are when
they deduce you know son is willing to
make staroffice out of it did um its
wanting to allow people to license the
code and do whatever they want with it
and they're probably philosophical
choice of yours okay it's like the big
there's a big argument I think between
open source and free software okay
and I I've seen people within our
company open source on the right and
free software on the left and big fight
in the middle but so that really depends
on what you're willing to do you know
which you're willing to be done with
your code if you don't want you know to
allow a company to realize as your coder
that's have a thing or a project to do
that you might want to go with the word
of the free software license actually a
lot of companies will do this just just
for legal sanity not because they're
trying to control the project but
because contributor license agreements
are actually just sort of a necessary
evil in our legal system requires a
contributor License Agreement you know
you're not assigning your copyright
you're saying hey this organization that
has the copyright on this code I'm
giving you permission to use my
contributions and
unlimited way and there are legal
reasons yeah and there are legal reasons
for that just because it's it makes it
easier to to defend the entire bar
entire body of code is one entity right
one but when it comes down to the
answers it's it depends on what you're
more comfortable with personally I
probably if there's something I wanted
to write you know I'm okay with other
people using my code and whatever way
they want some people are not some
people want the code to be free and
that's the people when the more the free
software side he did he did mention
OpenOffice I've heard stories that open
offices rewrite it's a lot of folks who
work for son doing most of the coding
and I've heard stories that they are
very comfortable working in consensus
based open source our ideal model and
that I've heard complaints about that
but it's all it's all hearsay so we
talked a little after if you feel
absolutely other questions Gary little
from Morgenthaler ventures once pointed
out that open source makes it easier to
couple the requirements from the
customers to the actual development
process that you don't have a big
heavyweight project management process
creating big heavyweight documents that
are then thrown over to development how
do you take something like a
consensus-based
development model and couple that to a
Salesforce that's coming back into the
office and saying we can close this deal
if we can just do this feature for this
customer this is what we experienced all
the time but what you want to okay okay
well I mean this is actually something
that's hard to explain the sales folks
you know I mean what do you mean we
can't have this feature done by this
date and the answer is well we can try
it depends on how much influence we have
in the community it depends on how much
credibility we have depends on whether
you know this is something that
everybody in the community wants for the
product and this this is what you're
right about it I agree with the
statement about you know it brings the
developers and the users close together
right you removes all those layers which
is fantastic in terms of speeding things
up and getting a software better on the
this is also that balancing act of
trying to maintain control and yet not
really maintain control your business
plan needs to be flexible enough so that
you have to give up certain things in
the short term like Gantt charts right
and specific schedules in return for
long term gain like well we know the
project is moving in a direction that is
going to help our company in the long
term we just can't make specific
promises and there's there's two sides
to this if someone is is requesting a
feature what say for example it say
you've you sponsored an open-source
project you've got an out there you've
got a bunch of people that don't work
for your company working in the software
and one of your sales guys comes up and
closes multi-million dollar deal if we
add this feature to the product well the
community involved in the in in the
software and your internal developers
will know this they can gauge whether or
not it's something innocuous or possibly
useful that the community will tolerate
if you contribute the development and
testing resources to make get it done
however if it's completely orthogonal to
the goals of the product the odds of
getting and in there or or antithetical
for example the odds of you getting in
there are pretty pretty slim you're
gonna wind up with a revolt on your
hands I think yeah that's the best way
to describe it if the customer says we
need X and X is aligned with the
project's goals no problem you'll get it
quick it's like it's not aligned you'll
never get it I mean locking subversion
Ben and I wrote the locking feature in
subversion 1.2 and most of the community
could not have cared less about locking
I mean they really like locking we don't
use it we reverse check Reserve
checkouts who cares right it was there
because colliding its customers said
well we really need this feature for
certain things right and it's we
implemented in a fashion that that's
useful enough for anyone to use it but
it wasn't there wasn't out of scope of
the mission right right it's not a scope
and people it's a version control
feature people accepted the feature
provided that CollabNet was willing to
work on it right and that's what we did
we wrote this we did have a couple of
volunteers to help us out and somehow I
don't know why but just because they're
great people other question questions
you Thanks well my question is about any
companies like Google they do most of
the things in-house but something's
open-source
but actually they give a gift today
other companies and they put a lot of
effort on time and money to people to be
involved in the open-source community
and develop but actually you're given
some gift to their competitors so what's
the question why do we do it yeah
where's the balance here I mean if
Google will put a lot of effort in open
source it's like giving a free gift
other companies well this goes back to
your goals why are you open sourcing
something right if you take the view
that all software is some sort of
competitive advantage then no you're
never going to open-source anything
right
but there are reasons to release things
as open source if you've determined that
is your company will benefit in the long
run by everybody having the software or
by changing the industry right saying
releasing something like Firefox
web-browser right
it changes the industry it makes
everybody use standards that's good for
a company like Google for example right
rather than here's our proprietary web
browser we're gonna keep it to ourselves
and try and sell it I mean it's it's
just a different way of helping yourself
not all ways of helping yourself are
necessarily you know all right and I
mean a lot of the stuff you've seen
open-source from Google you don't see a
lot of software coming out of Google
because that's typically driven by
engineers and would decide I want this
to be open sourced and we're like well
okay but you have to do the work and
you're like oh I don't know if I have
time to do all that work cuz it's a fair
bit of work to to get things out there
and again if you just push it over the
wall who cares
Google does a lot of other things for
open-source the product that Ben and I
have been working on for years project
hosting on code.google.com
we've got Summer of Code which Leslie
runs which is a fantastically successful
project we had 800 something students
this year you know nine hundred five
students excuse me it paid to write open
source code over the summer and many of
them were introduced to it for the first
time so there's a lot of different
things that we do when we do it because
open source is good for us well I think
a Google web toolkit is a great example
right so some company might have come up
with Google Google web toolkit and said
oh this is great you know we can make
millions of dollars let's sell it and
Google's approach was hey this is great
let's release it let's make it easy for
everybody in the world to write Ajax
apps and thereby increase the amount of
content
and information that's produced and just
make the web a stronger platform for
everybody which helps Google in the long
run because that's that's how Google
makes it does its business it's on the
web right so it's it's just a different
kind of strategy yeah any more google
specific questions that I asked you to
wait till the end of the talk because
this is more about open source in
general
thank you I had a question about your
take on the role charisma plays in the
success of an open source project
you mentioned leanness you're both
pretty charismatic guys would you say
that having people who have that have
whatever it takes to create a cult of
personality around the lead developer is
that necessary or just a feature I I
don't think the cult of personality is
necessary for a successful community I
think he can sometimes help can
sometimes hurt I think he can hurt a
community when the community is it
becomes dependent on that personality
right if that person get hits it gets
hit by a bus then suddenly the community
can't function because no one's telling
them what to do that's not really much
of a consensus-based community that's
sort of the enlightened despot model
that I was talking about earlier it's
not sustainable but I think there are
communities where there are very
charismatic leaders but the leaders do
not actually have any more weight in
decision-making than anybody else
they're more like figureheads they're
motivators they're you know I think I
think that any community at forms forms
is gonna start small
one two three four developers and the
community that grows around that whether
it's a open source product or company
light as large as Google and that
community is going to be a reflection of
those people that started it and if
those people are charismatic friendly
respectful and humble and that sort of
thing you're gonna wind up with a
community that looks somewhat like that
if those people are assholes you're
gonna wind up with a community of these
people the disadvantage to having
community built around sort of this jerk
factor I guess I'd say is that that
tends tough to turn off a lot of people
and it turns them away before they even
get to your door and I don't think it's
it's a wise decision
to form a community that's likely to
turn away a lot of people and people get
into a lot of why don't search some
people coming up with syrup we've spoken
about this at conferences
why aren't thermal women an open source
the average in the Kotaku engineering is
10% women in open source it's 2% and
there's a lot of discussion around why
that might be and and I personally think
that if you can have developer
communities that are more concentrated
on getting work done respecting each
other and working with people I think it
was likely to test something is it for
something yeah yelling and insisting
it's gonna be my way and everyone else
they're stupid and it drives people away
it does drive people away and or
attracts a certain kind of dysfunctional
person right exactly I mean so if a
community is built on a bunch of people
who you know it's a lot of hazing and
yelling and screaming and chest-thumping
you're gonna wind up with a reflection
of that that's gonna be your community
and you're gonna attract those people
and I'm glad that there's places for
those people to go cuz I don't want to
work with them my opinion we have other
questions and the questions in terms of
kick-starting a community so if you're
thinking about open sourcing some chunk
of code you talked about how do you
decide how do you decide who our
committees are not to you take existing
employees I mean you know cuz to try and
follow your best practice you talked
about the option for you know you're
gonna end up seeding it with employees I
guess to start with is that how you guys
did it yeah you just have to you need to
choose employees who you think are gonna
be not just good coders but good
community managers people who are nice
people you know trust each other with
others play well with others are
respectful of each other our humble are
not crazy tyrants I mean if you find a
small group of employees who are really
nice to work with people you wouldn't
want to work with right and you say hey
please start a community then you'll get
a good seed or things will grow well
from that and I've seen examples where
corporations will actually take one or
two people who are jerks and say please
start a community and the community
becomes less fit set a bunch of jerks
all yelling at each other so you'd be
very careful if we start with but you
find that to be there okay for
kick-starting it yeah that's they can be
employees or not you just need to make
sure you're very careful about who you
start with kick-started
most important to put the work in to who
who is this initial core team because
they're gonna define the team in the
future but yes giving all those people
connects just gonna start a sort of the
way you have to start you've got to
start some got a start you know but you
want to start probably narrower as
opposed to broader and and again choose
these same things carefully the other
disadvantage so one does advantage I
have a community of well points they
poisons people because that's their the
talk that's our favorite term of
poisonous people is not only that you
can you're going to turn a lot of people
away is that you're gonna have a lot of
wasted energy on arguing and yelling and
screaming and chest-thumping and it's
much better to divert and direct this
energy into writing sought writing and
designing good software so just
something communities usually don't last
very long
it depends sometimes they do I think
they fizzle was any other question well
we'll be around for a bit to check that
we've dropped it in here but thanks to
everyone for coming and for those of you
who are in the front row over here knows
yes questions we've got free signed
copies of karl fogel book thanks to
karma so thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
