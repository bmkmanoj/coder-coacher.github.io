started my name is Deb Henningsen and
I'm coordinating Bike to Work Day this
year and I'm just going to give a really
quick introduction for our fabulous
speaker mr. Dylan Casey
Dylan actually started all of our Bike
to Work Day festivities in 2003 when he
first joined Google and that first year
he was really ambitious we had a whole
bunch of different things going on a
bike to work day including free bike
tuneups provided by the Palo Alto
bicycles I believe it was and since then
a lot of people have asked me in
successive years how come you guys don't
do the free bike tune ups anymore well
basically the real answer is because
Dylan is way cooler than I am but the
other answer is because that first year
we found out that a lot of people were
driving their bikes to work and bringing
them out of their trunks and bringing
them up to the station just to get them
tuned up for free yes boo hiss on them
so this year we're hoping to see lots of
people out there riding their bikes for
real and I hope that each one of you
will take the time today to in
personally encourage your Kube mates or
people that you run into or folks and
meetings to come and show up on their
bikes having actually bike to work and
we really wouldn't have started doing
all this bike to work day stuff without
Dylan's awesome influence so please
welcome Dylan JZ thank you thanks I'll
add a little more context just in case
for those of you who don't know me and
dad mentioned I came to Google in 2003
and I think it was like a couple of days
before we're sitting around and it was
bike to workday and we thought oh well
we should do something for everybody
that rides our bikes to work and and I
think that's kind of how about although
I can't take all the credit but you know
so we kind of scrambled around and got
some people to put together an event and
it's kind of grown bigger and bigger and
and I understand that the there are a
significant number of Googlers that
commute to work and that's great
unfortunately I don't always ride my
bike to work but I try to every once in
awhile
definitely tomorrow but before coming to
Google I was a professional cyclist on
the US Postal Service team
and spent five years racing in Europe
and Deb asked me if I could come and
talk today maybe a little bit about that
share some more stories I know some of
you probably saw one of my former
teammates Floyd come and speak here
earlier this year last year so I'll I'll
kind of add my own color and
interestingly what's going on right this
moment is the Giro d'Italia which is the
Italian version of the Tour de France
and there's another one called the
Vuelta spon which is obviously the
Spanish version and it's a it's a race
that takes place in each country over
around 20 to 23 days depending on the
number of rest days or transfers that
they have but I thought it might be
interesting to share what a day is like
because for those of you who follow it
or our fans you probably see either a
snippet from the news or a 10-minute
highlight on some local TV station so
and the reason it's significant is
because these days are so demanding and
so overwhelming that you have to be very
methodical and it's actually quite
interesting to know that there's a lot
more that goes on during the day than
just the race itself so each night and
of course this this all begins on the
night before the race you actually get
there to wherever the start is maybe a
week ahead of time because you have to
go through all of these health medical
checks and they do some doping controls
and you have to do some media
appearances and you kind of take some
time to get settled in and get all of
your equipment prepared for the race but
the night before the director will come
to the dinner table and he'll hand each
Rider what we would call the start card
and on that start card it was basically
like a carbon copy on the start card it
would detail out exactly what time you
get up what time breakfast starts what
time your suitcase has to be in the in
the hallway because the Swan years and
the mechanics would come and take your
suitcase and put it in the truck and
then what time the bus would leave and
then it would indicate what time the
stage starts
what how long the stage is where the
feed zone is how you get from the finish
to the next hotel whether you're going
by car team bus or bike and then it
would also indicate what time your
massage was what time dinner was and
what time you'd go to bed
so that's your whole day and there's a
bike race stuck in between there so I
remember the first Grand Tour that I did
it was the the Tour Spain and in my
first year on the team and I like most
Americans started racing on a small
small teams here in America and then
made the big jump to go to race in
Europe on the division 1 team and I of
course had this whole suitcase full of
all these other clothes and you know
every other thing that I could possibly
fit into it and then I realized after
about 2 days that I only wore I wore
basically the same thing every day it
started you know because you had you
have all this like team official
required outfit that you have to wear
all the time so of course I had the
heaviest suitcase and thus I got the
most flak from the swan ears or the
mechanics because they would have to
carry him down to the truck but each day
so you start wake up breakfast everybody
has their own little routine I was
notorious for being first at the
breakfast table trying to make my own
coffee I always brought my own coffee
that was kind of my my little trademark
trademark addition to the team and then
we would get everything packed you'd run
out to the truck get make sure all your
equipment was in place and then get on
the team bus and it's funny because
getting 9 riders and all of the staff
and probably three team cars a handful
of mechanics handful of sworn years
which is French for like massage
therapists the the team doctors and
everybody all organized to leave a hotel
at exactly the right time is actually a
pure science and for the riders
specifically you know that we would all
kind of have our various personalities
some of us being
very early very punctual and slightly
late and on one of the stages we we left
quite late probably 15-20 minutes after
the scheduled departure time and we
actually missed the start of the race
and had to spend the first I don't know
15 20 kilometers chasing on as a team
and it was it was actually quite
notorious that evening on the the news
highlights but from that was born the
what I like to refer to as the hundred
dollar a minute rule and that rule was
basically coined by Lance that for every
minute that you were late to the bus
passed its official departure time you
had to give a hundred dollars to the
kiddies so to speak so that that helped
us to all be on time a lot more often of
course of course
Lance somehow was not held to that rule
but we figured since he was the boss you
know it was okay but anyway so we took
all the money from that year oh I think
we had like a couple thousand dollars
and I we we had a nice party at the end
of the year
so anyway bus leaves you get to the
start it was always kind of like ritual
to get there exactly one hour before the
start everybody would you know you
typically you're dressed already you get
to the start you go and meet it's
immediately to the stage where you sign
on and if you have to do any press stuff
that usually takes place right at the
stage you go back to the bus you get
kind of you know your various food items
whatever you want whether it's some sort
of like Clif Bar or power bar and then
the Saunders would also make like the
little panini sandwiches or ham ham and
cheese sandwich is you know kind of
regular food because trust me buy the
like second second and especially the
third week of a Grand Tour you're so
sick of like race type food you just
want to eat like you know sandwiches
filled with Nutella and and things like
that that are really easy to get down so
you grab all that you jump the race
starts and normally the first they have
what's called a neutral zone which is
nice because you don't it doesn't really
matter where you start on the start line
so everybody kind of rolls up they they
start the races usually some
sort of ceremony local town dignitaries
are there and sponsors on and so forth
you start the race and then they have
what's called a zero K banner which is
where the actual race officially starts
and it'll be a big banner with a zero on
it and the commissaries car will be kind
of driving right in front of the peloton
and he'll have a flag and drop it and
sometimes on nice days everybody just
kind of chills out for a while before I
really get down to business and on other
days you can hit the zero K banner at
like 60 K a with riders on the bumper of
the car waiting for him to move out of
the way and those generally tend to be
longer type days but so you know you'll
come to the feed zone you know that's
typically most races almost every stage
even if it's a one-day kind of has a
rhythm the first part of the race will
kind of be flat out everybody you know
the breakaway will get established or
the first kind of hurdle of the day will
get passed and then everybody will kind
of take a break generally involves a
bathroom break and it's very common
riders just pull over to the side of the
road do whatever they need to do and if
you time it correctly you're ready to
get back on the bike before the last car
has passed in the caravan so that you
can use the caravan to make your way
back up into the field and this is legal
despite the rulebook actually states
that you're not allowed to draft off of
cars but you know there's certain
nuances that the commissaries overlook
because it really wouldn't have an
outcome on the overall race so you know
you want to time it perfectly that you
get back in the race and then the feed
zone comes along and each team it's
interesting that I learned this after my
first year each team has a very specific
and designated spot on where they like
to be in the feed zone whether it's at
the start of the feed zone in the middle
or towards the end and for some reason
our team like to be at the very
beginning which I thought would be you
know kind of cool so what that means is
that you're your team staff is actually
standing there in the feed zone which is
this designated zone that you're allowed
to take food and water and stuff in a
bag that's called a musette and your
swan gyro would stand there with nine
bags and hand them out one at a time as
you came by so you had to make sure that
yours
based out evenly with your teammates so
that you didn't get there too fast but
then I realized that the problem with
being first in the feed zone because
typically feed zones are on a slight up
rise or a hill is that you grab your
mousette bag in the beginning and then
you have to carry it you know all the
way to the top while you're trying to
get stuff out of it and there's riders
in front of you going all over the place
and typically there's always some sort
of crash but I was always frustrated
like why can't we be at the ends but it
was something I was never able to
overcome so so Anya's at the beginning
you grab your bag
and typically each musette bag has two
bottles one with water and one with some
sort of sugary you know electrolyte
related drink if it's a hot day they'll
generally include a can of coke and if
it's a cold day they'll include like a
snicker bar or some sort of candy bar
because those are generally easy to eat
a couple of regular power bars or
whatever kind of cycling bar some gels
and maybe like a ham and cheese little
panini sandwich or something like that
so you get quite a bit it's funny
because everybody will take this
specifically what they want no one ever
really takes the whole bag and then you
throw the bag to the side of the road
and there's there's like if you're near
a town there's like a million kids all
waiting to grab them and it's kind of
like bowling because sometimes you're
throwing these things buys you'd go
pretty quickly and kids are getting
knocked over
crawling all over each other trying to
grab bags and it's always quite amusing
so but then you reach the end of the
stage hopefully you win you go back to
the the team bus and get cleaned up if
there's podium presentations you go and
do that and then it's immediately like a
mad rush should go straight to the hotel
when you get to the hotel they'll be
like you'll have a team roster which
with each riders name and then next to
it a line and it'll indicate what your
room number is so you look and find out
where your room is you go there your
suitcase is already in your room because
the swon years and mechanics have have
brought it there from that morning in
the hallway there's the the snack table
which is which is crucial and it would
have like boxes of cereal cookies you
know of course water and drinks and a
cooler full of drinks
and depending on which Swan your was was
which was with you on the race they
would make musics with yogurt or on
really hot days like like like a jello
or something like that mixed with fresh
fruit and stuff like that so it was
always snack time straight to the shower
and then you would find out what your
massage schedule is goes and by the time
you go and get your massage you come
back it would typically be dinnertime so
then you go to have dinner and you come
back and you have roughly like an hour
for personal time which means you know
email whatever kind of various you know
life things that you need to do like pay
bills or you know stuff like that
believe it or not it doesn't come to a
screeching halt during the tours you
know a 10 or 15 minute phone call to you
know whoever whether it's a girlfriend
or wife or mom or dad and then lights
out and you start all over again so you
do that for 23 days and it's quite an
experience so anyway so I thought talked
about grand tours the tour schedules the
musette s-- what might be interesting to
some of you is our equipment it's
interesting that when you at that level
it's almost kind of like what our
laptops are to us like you just kind of
show up somebody gives you a laptop and
you go back to work you don't really
think about like you know what what the
resolution of the screen is or what kind
of keyboard it has or how fast the card
is or anything like that and it's kind
of the same with your bike you don't
really even think about it you just you
show up there it is it fits and
hopefully all the wheels and everything
works and and you go off to race and
what's interesting is that you
everything starts off when you show up
at training camp which is typically in
January you show up and you get what's
called a race bike in a home bike and
they're identical and you set them up
over the course of a first couple of
days because you'll tweak things raise
the saddle push it forward whatever and
the mechanics will typically have like a
chart for you with all of your specific
measurements and they'll try to get set
up
so then after training camp you're your
home bike comes with you you take it
home and the race bike stays
the team and the time trial bike as well
and that stays with the team so the only
time that you see your race bike is when
you arrive at the race when you get out
of the team bus all of the team bikes
will be lined up and each you know
typically you have to look and figure
out which one is yours based on the name
tag and then at the conclusion of the
stage your race bike the mechanic comes
up grabs your bike and it disappears and
you never see it you see it the next day
and I always thought that that was
interesting because before I was always
so you know fascinated and meticulous
about all of my equipment and what you
know how many links were in my chain and
you know how what kind what kind of
grease was in my were in my bearings
stuff like that but eventually you know
when when the racing was that hard and
you know the transfers and all that
stuff you just you just don't even think
about it anymore so it was kind of it
was a it was an interesting experience
for me of course now that I'm retired
and now I'm back to figuring out how
many links are in my chain and what kind
of grease I'm just kidding so that's
that's kind of the you know the typical
day and and some of the ideas about the
tools of the trade so to speak I figured
I'd leave some time to answer questions
hopefully you guys have some you can ask
me anything that you want to ask or I
can elaborate on anything specifically
sure what drugs and doping are an
everyday part of every race and Wonder
sure interesting world war two white
world worse the question is to
paraphrase for you you know is is doping
just an everyday part of cycling so but
I'm curious why World War two yeah well
you know to be honest I think what's
interesting about cycling and this this
is this may be relevant to why how I
arrived at Google I'm sure that's
probably a question you're a bike racer
had now your work at Google how's that
work in a cynical kind of perspective
cycling is just real estate for
advertising right just like almost
everything is I mean it's interesting
because at the time you know I was off I
was focused on training and trying to be
the best athlete that I could be and and
I had all these very you know specific
personal ambitions go to the Olympics
win national championships race on the
best team in the world and towards the
end of my career as an athlete when I
was starting to think about what I
wanted to do next I came I'm like this
is just all advertising and it turns out
I wasn't the only one that had that
epiphany because so did the ASO which is
the amory sports organization that is
the owner of the Tour de France the
Gazzetta dello sport Oh which is the
Italian magazine that owns or that are
Italian newspaper that started the the
the Tour of Italy and they too said hey
this is a great vehicle to sell more
newspapers and to sell more ads and one
of the reasons is because it was such a
prolific sport it had so much exposure
and so it was a great venue a great
piece of real estate to sell more
advertising sell more newspapers and by
the way ASO also owns l'équipe which is
the French sports magazine and so over
the years to sell more newspapers they
figured out that more drama you know the
more exciting the more scandal the more
like controversy because it wasn't
enough just
talk about who won or what the time gap
was or what size chainrings they were
using because you know that was kind of
boring and for a sport wood that's
unique in the sense that anybody can do
it for the you know not necessarily the
professional level but anybody can ride
a bike anybody can go out on a hill and
ride as hard as they can up it most
people can buy the same exact equipment
that's used at the professional level
which is not necessarily the case for
like NASCAR or Formula One and so it was
like had this common person sport I mean
recycling in Europe has always been very
blue-collar you know it's not often that
riders and up until recently we're
making enough money to have you know
huge fortunes and retires so the short
answer is I personally believe that the
reason it's it's prevalent and it has
this perception is because the media has
decided to make it a big story and it
sells more newspapers I mean I guarantee
you l'équipe which is the French French
newspaper involved with the Tour de
France has sold way more in the last
couple of years than they ever did
before so that hopefully that answers
your question
yeah of roads they always say like
riders the Tour de France consume an
average of 8,000 calories a day
sure 20,000 calories a day and from what
he does at par doesn't seem like there's
enough time to eat food that's metal
I mean part of those numbers even
remotely accurate and if so sure sure so
so your question is is basically you
know how many calories you need on a day
and you know day during that or or one
day and and is it realistic so
interesting you know I think some are
somewhere in the mid 90s this German
engineer designed this computer called
an SRM and it's actually quite popular
now and it's basically a set of strain
gauges
inside your cranks and it measures how
many watts you're putting out and then
they determined that based on you know
some variables that they can say okay
based you know the number of watts that
you are generating per hour average we
can figure out how many kilojoules that
is and roughly we're gonna estimate that
the human body is about 25% efficient
yadda yadda so about four kilojoules
equals one calorie and then you know and
then based on that they they actually
put it to one to one so based on wattage
output they can determine that over if
you're per your doing 700 calories or
kilojoules per hour
that's about 700 calories seven yes 700
calories so if the stage is five hours
that's roughly 3500 calories so you can
you can start to get a basic
understanding of exactly how many
calories you burn and then and then you
can take your basal metabolic rate and
you know start to extrapolate some of
numbers and figure out how many calories
do you need just to exist per day right
and so I used to know that my basal
metabolic rate was around 1700 calories
per day based on my weight you know my
activity gotta so then I would take 1700
add whatever my little SRM would tell me
and I'd say okay well that's how many
calories I need today so it's true that
there are some stages well you know
there's this moat there's this period of
time where you're trying to lose as much
weight as possible while still consuming
enough calories to kind of be somewhat
you know awake
you know it's it's not uncommon for a
lot of elite athletes to you know have
these weird eating disorders but and I I
myself had my own but you would actually
calculate exactly how many calories you
needed and then how many you burned and
then try to deficit that number by you
know two or three hundred calories per
day maybe five hundred if you were being
aggressive and you could you know over
seven days lose at least a pound a week
but during the during the actual race
you do not want to diet so that's a bad
time to try to diet so the the answer is
yes you actually do need roughly five to
eight thousand calories a day and what
happens is over time as your body
becomes fatigued your systems start to
shut down so you don't process food as
efficiently you don't you your system
doesn't work as quickly it takes longer
to digest food you don't digest certain
foods as well as others I mean I can
remember some stages where the first
hour does being in complete misery
because my stomach was still full of the
food that I was forcing down earlier
that day in fact just on a tangent in
especially in the Spanish races that
would start so late in the afternoon
because of siesta and they wanted the
finishes to be roughly like five six pm
when everybody was coming back from
siesta or whatever the races wouldn't
start till one o'clock which was in the
heat of the day in September and then
but if you get up for breakfast you got
to eat again before the race starts so
you would come down and have first
breakfast and then second breakfast or
lunch so you basically are spending all
day long eating as much as you can in
fact the director would come over the
radio sometimes and say okay guys you
know don't forget to eat because when
the race gets hard you know the race
it's not just flat-out right a race it
can be you know 250 kilometers in
roughly 6 to 7 hours so there's a lot of
time where you're just kind of hanging
out doing whatever and so that's when
you need to eat because when you get to
the crunch time you know what we call
the finale you got to make sure that
you're not
have the opportunity to eat so you got
to make sure that you've been eating
throughout the day and then sometimes
depending on what the weather was like
and you know hydration was a real issue
as well especially during the summer so
you'd have to make sure that you were
hydrating all the time and had to pay
really meticulous attention to all those
little details yeah and if so how would
you think about them differently and
then say that or sure so the question is
did I ride the classics and and how do
they differ from the from the Grand
Tours or even just stage races you know
there's a lot of different little five
to ten days stage races that happen
during the year as well and the answer
is yes
I rode most of the classics I think the
only one I didn't ride was San Sebastian
although I'm trying to remember but
one-day races are totally different
because the the you know they're there
aren't all of these other races going on
at the same time like for example
there's there's no general
classification there's no mountains
jersey there's no points jersey you know
the only thing that matters is winning
the race and so the approach would be
slightly different depending on the
course depending on what the day the
weather all of that stuff and you'd kind
of have an idea of who the team leaders
were the day before and we would have a
meeting in the morning and and designate
exactly who would do what is there a
particular classic I can tell you like
some of the yes
so Perry Bay it's funny the the first
year I did Perry Bay it was porn it was
like quintessential pouring rain you
know freezing cold and the first hundred
kilometres of Perry bear on kind of like
standard roads you know nothing special
and there's the first cobble section
comes and it's really vital that your
team leader is near the front during
that first cobble section because if
they have a crush or they're not near
the front or you know you don't want him
to have to waste a bunch of energy in
the beginning so the first half of the
team that you start with eight riders in
and our designated leader was George
Hincapie on that day and we had guys
like Cedric Wester and VHS avec come off
and a handful of other guys on the team
and my job was the basically the first
hundred Ches
like I didn't even think about the other
150 and so on days like that we're where
your job is is very finite and specific
you think about exactly that portion and
and that's the same for the other guys
to you know their job is to kind of be
relaxed in the beginning let the other
guys on the team take responsibility for
whatever's going on and then their job
comes up towards the end and so that
race it's interesting the first hundred
K and on that specific day the first day
that I did it was pouring rain and it
was just really important to keep George
near the front of the race using the
least amount of energy required to stay
there and then just also look after him
to make sure you know if you got a
puncture that you know there was a
couple guys with him to help him come
back to the to the to the race and then
if he needed any food if you wanted to
take off clothes and take them back to
the car that's something I would do or
bring them back stuff like that yeah
but more about what the different roles
indicate words with the strategies for
success of
with the bracelet esteem goal yeah so
the question is about kind of the roles
of the different riders on the team and
it was always really clear we would go
into every race whether it was a one-day
race or a stage race with specific ideas
on who was going to do what you know it
was it's interesting because at that
level everybody is very specialized and
very good at what they do you know
everybody's a rock star for whatever
reason whether you're an excellent
climber or really good on the flats or
flat stages or flat parts of the stage
or you know a really good time trellis
or you know just really really good at
the overall which was you know obviously
Lance was the best on our team at that
and so you know each race has its own
characteristics
obviously the tour is broken down into
you know three basic areas one there's
the time trials which is you know up to
the individual leaders two or the flat
stages and third are the mountain stages
and they typically come in chunks and
it's interesting because if each stage
kind of defines how the race is going to
develop so the first week is always
challenging because there's everything
you know the the the general
classification hasn't really started yet
and most of the emphasis is on the
sprinters or the the riders going for
individual stage victories and so the
priority of the team is one to keep your
leader protected and have them use the
least amount of energy as possible and
then the other is to kind of maintain
and watch your adversaries and to make
sure that like for example they don't go
get away in some breakaway that gets
twenty minutes and so if your role is is
like is that to help you know to be what
what we call it domestique you would
either make make sure that breakaways
that go away you either work together to
chase it down or that you're in the
breakaway so that the
gets to to sit back or you know your job
might be specifically to stay with your
team leader at all times so that when
they're maneuvering around the peloton
they don't have to use any excess energy
so it's pretty well defined who's doing
what based on what your characteristics
and specialties are and then as the race
goes on you know the director will help
kind of determine who does what and you
have a game plan that's set in the
morning before the race but it then it's
also very important to be flexible you
know you have to read the race and
constantly adjust and change and react
and respond or try to be proactive as
well yeah yeah yeah yeah so the training
leading up to two big races and you know
I'll turn you answer from more general
perspective because you race probably
roughly between you know sixty to a
hundred days a year and you know the
rest is training but races often serve
the purpose of training as well so as an
individual you generally sit down and
look at the calendar and identify
specific races that you want to be you
know at your peak for and you identify
other races that are just for training
and then there's you know training
blocks in between but leading up to a
Grand Tour and it's interesting because
Grand Tours have this this interesting
for at least for the teams you start
with like a long team guys that are kind
of have a shot at making the the actual
start and you work your way down
and generally the race results and
training camps that you'll have leading
up to the Grand Tours will determine who
makes the team but with all of that said
you generally identify that so for
example if you're going for like the
Tour of Italy which just it was just
started this last weekend you know your
preparation is going to start in January
more or less you know with this target
of May and so you look at certain races
that you want to use for training and
then certain races that you want to try
to show yourself so that not only can
you show that you're good to the team
but then also to see
how how your training is going you can
test things and push things and it's
it's become over the years very
methodical in the training camps that
you have leading up in the weeks and
months right before the Grand Tours you
you basically look at the overall
profile of the race and like for example
if there's a team time trial not all
Grand Tours have team time drills but if
there's a team time trial you want to
take some time and really practice
because that's a it's a very specific
event and you have to be you know it's
it's like an orchestra you know you have
to everybody has to work perfectly
together and that that even goes to what
are we gonna do the date the morning of
a team time trial like what's our
preparation what time are we gonna get
there how long is our warm-up gonna be
what time are we all gonna go over to
the start house you know yeah yeah I
used to the night before time trials lay
everything out and make sure that I had
everything and and I would look at my
start time and count backwards you know
cuz 11 o'clock is my start so I want to
be there at the race venue at 9:30 start
my warmup at 10:00 get off the trainer
at you know 10:45 etc so you think about
all those little details and you use you
you start to prepare in the training
camps and so there's a there's a period
of time where you'll really really
stress yourself and go way way over with
the idea of trying to rebuild the
systems and then you know you slowly
starting to lose weight and arrive at
the start in the best condition and
maybe just close to your ideal way or
maybe just a half a pound over a pound
over
somebody some people say I got watering
for example hands very telling but he
didn't rain it off yeah it's funny you
know
I'll tell I'll tell a story about Yann
as it relates to his training from my
own personal experience you know it's
interesting and and I always pushed just
tangentially I always push that the
riders give more information to the
press you know be more open and talk
about what's going on you know kind of
this almost an MTV real world mentality
because I would much rather have the
press talking about you know what podium
girl I was dating versus you know what
they found in my garbage can and and
what that revealed about me because I
think that's much more interesting and
I'm all for for you know having drama
and scandal but like make it about
something that's that's you know more
valuable than then some you know yeah
it's just it just it seemed you know
dumb to me but anyway so Yann I can
remember in the beginning of the season
my first race it was this race in Spain
called Samana catalana and it was in the
Catalunya region of Spain and Yann Yann
was also there it was his first race of
the season I think it's in March roughly
in March I myself had already been
racing since January and you know what
thought I was in pretty good condition
and Yann would show up and this is 99 or
2000 or something like that he would
show up and he would be so overweight I
couldn't believe it
and and we we we would like hit the base
of a climb or be going up a hill and
Yann would be coming backwards so fast
that you would almost have to get out of
the what you know like swerve around him
and it it's really interesting because
day by day you could see in the race he
would get better and better and he would
actually lose weight like visually be
getting skinnier in the race and I was
I was always so like envious of that
because that for me as the race went on
I'd get worse and worse you know and
probably even gain some weight because I
would be drowning my sorrows with you
know tasty cakes or whatever the local
pastries were but Yohn he had the most
amazing genetics and he you know Lance
would say all the time that he was the
most gifted talented amazing rider in
the peloton and I think he I don't
necessarily I don't think young didn't
train I think that this perception the
perception that he didn't train was born
out of the idea that he was just so
genetically talented that the only
reason the only like justifiable reason
that he wasn't winning the Tour and all
the other races is because he didn't
train enough I don't necessarily think
that was true I would see him actually
in a race III know this this tour of
Holland in 99 I beat him in a time trial
by it was a short time trial and I don't
know how much I beat him by but the
first time trial on the tour Spain which
was a much longer one maybe you know a
week into it and about two weeks after I
had beaten him he beat me by like 2 or 3
minutes you know and so yeah that's a
little it was a longer time trial but
the point point is is he just got that
much better and he just responded that
much better than I did to training and I
think that was you know just due to his
genetics so there's a long long answer
to your question sure
during the race like did you have like
to get vibe from other teams like
they're like candy breaking away yeah so
so the question is um you know we're
there ever any breaking away moments and
in the races I can think of a few
altercations and you know just to give
you some scope there of the there there
must be over 200 races a year on the
calendar and you know there are there
are divisions there's like division 1 2
&amp;amp; 3 and and every year they probably
change names you know before it was the
the division 1 and now it was now it's
called the Pro Tour or whatever but you
know just think of them as like major
league and minor league and in the major
league races you pretty much race
against the same 150 or 250 guys and
while that sounds like a lot it's not
when you're you know racing with them
every year year after year and you get
to know everybody pretty well and and
because of that I think there's a
certain amount of respect that you
develop and so you're less likely to
throw you know throw a punch or whatever
although there are moments where things
get pretty heated up and I have seen
riders on the side of the road and maybe
even a few and in ditches and you know
that stuff just happens and you know I
think typically like the the kind of
protocol is that you're supposed to do
you're talking with your legs and not
with your hands you know the the kind of
unwritten rule and it's probably
actually in the UCI rulebook as well but
as long as you don't take your hands off
the bars pretty much anything goes
for some reason that whenever you take
your hand off the bar that kind of
crosses some sort of threshold but you
know maybe some of you recall one of the
stages in a recent tour where Robbie
McEwen who's a famous and notorious
sprinter actually took his head and hit
the rider next to him and he was
relegated for that but it was just so
blatant that you couldn't not but you
know there a lot of that goes on when
when riders are trying to jockey for
position and it's funny because in the
race and you know sprinters two other
sprinters they hate each other but then
sprinters to the climbers you know
they're like best friends all day long
and is like this mutual respect that
goes on you know like lance and
Cipollini we're like would get along
great but but Cipollini and Zabul you
know it was like oil and vinegar but you
know that's just how it goes
yeah you get when you go from here and
all around on the train ride on your
home and like you know the speed
theme great so what's the difference
between riding around yeah yeah yeah
it's funny I remember this is all very
nostalgic for me but I remember one of
my first races that we started out
pretty easy and it was a 200 kilometer
stage and we were rolling around at
about 35 kilometers an hour and I
remember seeing somewhere that the
average speed is typically because they
you get a race Bible I should have
mentioned that to you get a race Bible
with each race and it indicates like you
know the course profile and where the
corners are where the climbs are and
then it'll have like projections on like
a timetable based on average speed and I
remember seeing the average speed being
around 40 kilometers an hour I'm like
well that's not too fast you know 24
miles an hour for 200 kilometers and
there's only a few mountain stages or
mountains in the stage that doesn't seem
that fast but when you start out the
first two hours at an average of 30
you're thinking to yourself oh wait a
minute something's gonna happen in order
for us to achieve this 40 kilometer an
hour average and the truth is the last
two hours or you know when you hit the
finale or the the hardest part of the
race it's going you know full blast at
55 kilometers an hour for two hours or
something like that so the the
difference between you know riding
around here and actual race speed is is
significant but you know that's a lot
there's a lot of factors there you know
the the the peloton itself is is this
you know this beam but I it's funny even
in the group Eddowes which is the group
that kind of forms on the climb that's
not trying to contest the wind but it's
just trying to get to the finish to
survive what they have is called the
time cut you have to finish within a
percentage of the the finishers time in
order to qualify to race the next day
and the group arrow would II would
calculate exactly what that time was and
you'd have guys that were responsible
kind of self-appointed to determine what
the correct speed was to make the time
cut and I was always amazed that the
group arrow speed was like sometime
as fast as I would ride on my training
rides around some of the climbs up here
but you know it's it's you kind of have
this group mentality so it's hard to say
but the short answer is a lot faster
yeah when he looked at
was that a pressed thing or how
important was that psychologically Oh No
so that was totally pressed and and you
know to hand it to them that that's that
was a great story as a great moment you
know that's the that that exact example
that you're bringing up is what makes
cycling so so cool at least in my
opinion so so to give everybody some
context for the for this specific
example I can't remember which year but
going up to the ALP d'Huez which is a
climb it's about 13 miles long and it's
in the Alps and it finishes at the top
of this mountain and there's roughly the
stage itself on this day was about a
hundred and twenty miles long and had
you know three or four climbs before it
I don't maybe the go Libya in the tormal
a these are all these famous climbs in
in the Alps region of France which are
all very hard by themselves but what
happened on this particular day and this
is very common for mountain top finishes
is that all of the domestiques of each
team leader will will like go as fast as
they can to the base of the climb and
the idea is that you just want to string
it out and make it so hard for everybody
that the only guys that are left are
your team leaders and in this particular
stage that's exactly what happened and
Lance had said I want I want to hit the
base of ALP to us at full speed like you
know 55 kilometers an hour and they did
that the whole team on the front and you
expend every single guy so the only guy
that's left at then at the bottom is
Lance and so they did that the last guy
did pull was Jose Rubio as nicknames
chechu and he pulled so hard at the at
the at the base and the first kilometer
of ALP d'Huez is very steep he pulled so
hard that when he pulled off Lance was
so SH you know kind of like oh my god
and one he was basically wanted to look
behind him to see what the carnage was
and and that's when this look you know
they turned the
happened and ullrich happened to be
right on lances will when that happened
and so he looked over his shoulder just
to see what had happened and when he saw
that you know basically the whole
peloton was blown to pieces
he decided well I'm gonna go for it this
is my chance and it worked out he won
the stage and I think he put some time
into to auric but he didn't do it to try
to like psych all work out and it's
funny because I remember hearing Lance
talk about it and joking maybe I should
make a big deal about it but the truth
is you know they were such good friends
he didn't Lance didn't want to like you
know pour salt in in the wound so to
speak yeah sure so the question is how
do you make the team and what's
interesting is that in other sports
especially kind of well-known sports in
America like football baseball and
basketball there's kind of like
traditional path you know you go you
play college and then you get recruited
and yada yada for cycling you know there
is no real clear path other than just
winning races and for Americans you
typically start racing in America if you
start as a junior which means under 18
then you have opportunities to go race
in Europe with the national team and if
you're older you there's some
opportunities also with the national
team to go race with this other group
but the team's the professional teams
are always looking for new talent excuse
me and so they'll pay attention who's
winning what in my own particular case I
started cycling a little bit later than
most of my peers and and had this one
year where it was basically I was barely
making any money and you know living off
prize money and I decided that okay this
was the year I was gonna accomplish
these two objectives and try to get a
real job racing my bike and if I didn't
do that I was gonna quit and so in that
particular year I decided that I was
going to win the national time trial
Championships and I was going to win the
national championships for this event on
the track
and I did both of those things and and
kind of caught the attention of the the
directors and bosses at us pulsus
service and I called them every day and
eventually you know they called back and
offered me a contract and that was that
specifically as it relates to the
Olympics there was very there's there's
like qualification procedures that you
have to do and you have to set like a
time standard or you have to win X race
or you have to you know have a certain
ranking on the International calendar
and I was able to do all of those things
and and made the Olympic team yeah
that's a great question so how does how
does some competitive cycling influence
all of us to ride our bikes more and
it's been specifically ride our bikes to
work I think that I'll try to answer
that on a couple different levels first
on a technology level I mean that was
one of the things that I I kind of got
into cycling or that got me into cycling
is I was kind of fascinated by the the
equipment and the technology and I
thought it was cool to have this part of
that part and I think that professional
cycling because of how competitive it is
and the requirements it really fuels
innovation of the equipment and I think
that trickles down and so I think bike
companies should really try to leverage
that innovation to get people excited
and passionate about cycling and I think
that will kind of have this ripple
effect to get people to ride their bikes
more and I and then on another level I
think we need to get you know Google is
is amazing in how that they promote and
and try to reward people that ride their
bikes to work I remember a story about
how I everybody used to leave their
bikes in the hall you know in their
cubes and in the hallways and either
security or facilities said oh we got to
get these out of here
and Eric our CEO said no no I want
people to feel like they can have their
bikes in the hallways and who knows if
that was a cultural you know that was
for cultural reasons or if that was just
because he wanted people to feel like
they could ride their bikes but you know
those are the types of things that
encourage people but I think also at the
city and government level you know we
need more bike paths we need we need to
make it easier for people that commute
to work you know I I live in Menlo Park
and I don't ride my bike to work all the
time and I don't know if that's a if
that's because you know I don't want to
spare the extra time required to ride my
bike versus just driving in or whatever
but you know everybody kind of has some
hurdles to get past to do it it's not
the easiest thing but I think the
innovation is how professional cycling
can encourage it but I think we also
need more help from our local
governments yeah
a lot of the cyclists race directory
servers and such how you what are the
backgrounds yeah what's what's
interesting some many of you may not
know this like cycling is a business and
that was something that I always
actually tried to get like everybody to
understand it's like you know we're here
to do a job right we're here everybody
has a very specific role whether you're
a rider or you're a mechanic or you're a
massage therapist or you're the team
director or you work in what I call the
back office right each team has an
organization that runs the whole the
whole team and you know it's just like
any sporting organization or whether
it's NASCAR or the 49ers you know you
have this office of people that do
things that that are required for the
team to run just like we do here at you
know at Google we have people that
handle all of our equipment and handle
all of our benefits and handle the
facilities and you know we couldn't do
what we do if it weren't for them and
vice versa so on our team specifically
one of the things that and I think Lance
did really well and was one of the great
leadership qualities that he brought to
the table is that he he celebrated each
individual for what they did and what
their contribution was and I think
because the expectation and perform was
so high and our expectations of our
peers were so high we had this personal
commitment to each other so it's like if
you're a mechanic like you know you
better be the best damn mechanic there
is and and each person kind of took on
that personal ambition and that personal
commitment but to give you a sense of
context I think on that in our
organization there were roughly a
hundred people and that consists of
roughly anywhere from 16 to 30 riders
and then you'd have depending on how
many programs you would run because you
know there's 200 a racing and there's
oftentimes three or four different races
all going on at the same time and so you
might send a team to each race so you
have three or four programs all running
at the same time so and each program
would have typically a team bus a
handful of team car
a team mechanic truck which is like a
big semi so you'd have so think of each
one of those as being about you know 10
to 15 people and then you'd have a whole
service course which is basically a
facility to handle all of your equipment
you know each each rider has roughly
five bikes and maybe two backups and
then you know a million different wheels
and you know all of the equipment
derailers I mean it's like going into
the candy store when you walk into the
service course in fact the riders
oftentimes we're not allowed to go there
but then and then we would have a main
you know infrastructure in each race and
sending in all the forms so it was
actually a pretty deep organization and
each team has this so hopefully that
answers your question yeah
sure so typically you'd have your home
bike like I mentioned earlier and you'd
have your race bike and then you'd also
have your spare bike so when you showed
up at a race there your race race bike
would be there your spare bike and your
time trial bike so I think that's four
and then you typically have like another
backup and what would happen is about
halfway through the season your your
race bike it was like a rotation your
race bike would become your home bike
and you'd turn your home bike back in
and then the back the the bike kind of
waiting in the wings so to speak would
become your new race bike so you spent
you use a race bike for about half the
year and then it would transfer over
yeah people who are very you know famous
like Lance yeah so I would typically
kind of like sign up for one good crash
a year you know that was just kind of
the cost of doing business and you're
just hoping that however about it was
you could recover as quickly as possible
you know I had my fair share I you know
broke my pelvis my scapula and my
collarbone a couple fingers an arm you
know I probably smashed my head a
handful of times and gone through a fair
share of helmets and that was just kind
of you know part of the job so to speak
some riders were notorious for crashing
all the time you know specifically in my
team I had a teammate Tyler Hamilton and
for whatever reason I swear Tyler would
crash all the time and when he crashed
he would really get hurt
Julian Dean you know he's a sprinter and
sprinters tend to crash a lot that's
just kind of the nature of their
business they're kind of at a higher
risk profile than then other guys and
you know Lance for the most part only
had a couple crashes that I can actually
remember it and that's actually
significant because people most people
don't realize how challenging it is to
show up on race day healthy and prepared
and have everything ready to be able to
perform at your absolute peak and the
reason that that's significant is
because there were a handful of
where I you know was trying to prepare
and show up for a race and whatever
would happen either illness or or a
crash would happen but there are just
some riders that were better than others
I also think that there are certain
places in the bunch
that are more dangerous than others and
that's also at specific times in the
race and it's there's a real skill to
knowing exactly where to be and win
because also remember racing is like
economics you know you you have a finite
amount of energy to expend and you want
to make sure that you expend it exactly
the right time so it you have to manage
all of that with the hopes of getting to
the finish line first yeah
some of the things that were hardest for
me to learn I think some of the biggest
challenges that I had especially my
first couple years of being in Europe or
how to adjust to just a completely
different lifestyle how to adjust to not
being able to go to my home after the
race you know whereas most of my peers
and the people that are competing
against we're at home you know at the
end of the race especially you know like
for some of the Belgians and we're doing
the Belgian classics at the end of the
race they get in their car and drive
home like it's like going to the office
and for me I had to go to the airport
and then I'd fly back to Spain which is
where my home base was and you know that
was kind of lonely at first so I I that
was my biggest challenges how to
overcome that and you know I had this
home life here in America that I also
had to maintain at the same time and so
that was a challenge and I remember I
used to joke that the off season was
about two months long and I would have
to fit an entire year of life into those
two months you know do all my taxes and
and kind of deal with all my personal
business and all of my friends and
family and make up for all the weddings
and birthdays that I missed and stuff
like that so you know how to manage that
that sacrifice was a big challenge yeah
anything else
oh yeah two questions so yeah I totally
miss it I mean I I missed the most my
teammates you know it was like I went to
war with these guys every day for a long
time but we still keep in touch and the
it's interesting because when I when I
retired and came to work at Google I
didn't really ride my bike that much and
I realized the thing that I missed the
most on a day-to-day basis was having
that time every day to like think and
process and and for whatever reason work
out issues and so now I try to ride more
regularly because it's kind of like
shower time you know what I mean it's
like this interesting zone that you're
in so yeah those are the parts I miss
the most that's right so the question is
what is the bet for the ride in July and
and lance's is is holding a LIVESTRONG
challenge for his foundation here in San
Jose and he he and I you know he was
kind of ribbing me that Google wouldn't
be able to raise the most money of all
the other corporations here that we're
gonna set up corporate teams for the
challenge and so he and I kind of had
this running bet I'm like no no no
Google's gonna raise the most money yada
yada and so the bet is basically that
either he has to go to or either I have
to go to Austin and do something or he
has to come here to Palo Alto and do
something and so I'll leave it at that
so but you know I really hope that you
guys can help me win the bet so if you
go to livestrong.com or org I can't
remember which one it is you can read
about the LIVESTRONG challenge it's a
great event there's 5k runs 200 mile
bike rides and we can all all ride as
Googlers and and raise money for a great
cause
so anyway I'll end it with that thanks
everybody for coming I appreciate your
time and your questions were really
interesting and remember to ride your
bike to work tomorrow
