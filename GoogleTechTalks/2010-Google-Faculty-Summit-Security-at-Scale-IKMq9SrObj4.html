round tables is by Eric gross who is a
director and engineering director in
charge of the focus area for security
and privacy here at Google before he was
at Bell Labs director and fellow thank
you I like meals I I'll be very happy to
take questions all through this right so
feel free to speak up I think any
security talk needs to start with what
is the problem we're trying to solve so
let me be very clear upfront what it is
we're trying to defend from whom the
thing that keeps me up all the time is
protecting our user data that's
absolutely the the top thing it's a very
hard problem but it's absolutely central
and and there's broad agreement across
the company all the way to the to the
top that this is what we're really
trying to get F is user data and I mean
by that certainly the contents of your
mailbox if you're a gmail user but it
means more than that it means search
logs because that tells us something
about you and from that we may have
deduced some information like we think
on the basis of your search logs you're
interested in buying a car we we provide
some way for you to tell us whether
that's true or not right we try to give
you those privacy controls of telling
you what we know about you and unless
you correct it but that's the kind of
thing I mean by user information so
that's the main thing that I care most
about protecting and then of course
there are some control systems that have
to be in place nor to do that if if we
just had all our systems wide open
everybody obviously there's there's
nothing else to do at most companies
actually this is a little bit reversed
they're not in the same position we're
in so probably the company financials
and the source code or something are at
the top of their mind and we care about
those too but it's actually second to to
keep them user data and I think that's
probably a key reason I mean we really
feel like our business goes away if we
don't continue to earn your trust so
that's the top of my mind the the second
part of the question is
well who are we trying to protect it
from and of course that there's always a
whole lot of things never what did they
say never forget that in competence is
one of the main risks so of course we
were trying to even protect it from
ourselves but mainly here we're thinking
about all kinds of adversaries across
the world and even friendly governments
even may ask for user data right so we
have to think very hard about a whole
spectrum what what happened recently to
us is we had thought that say foreign
governments would not be that interested
in Google right they go after other
governments and after defense industry
and so forth what we've certainly seen
very clearly now is all companies not
Google but even pharmaceutical companies
and banks and you name it are the target
of state-level adversaries so when it
comes to what are you trying to protect
and from whom the from whom means you're
up against a very sophisticated
adversary today and it doesn't more and
more or less doesn't matter who you are
even if you're a little Enterprise
you've got that kind of an adversary
okay so it's a challenging problem
what's also interesting at Google you've
heard this through a number of these
talks now is everything we do has to
work at scale things that you might have
tried if you only had 10,000 customers
just don't work for us in the
authentication space a good example
right so we're dealing with a lot of
people and the culture here is to take
on all kinds of gutsy things to try to
do so it's challenging for a security
team looking at so many different
products constantly coming along
engineers pop up with all kinds of crazy
ideas wild new directions and it it's
very challenging to think through all
those figure out how it will scale and
its global so you saw that at the in the
storage talk for example right this is
this is not a traditional system where
you get this one data center remember
that bet nicely well defend
building one data center and if you
protect that you're done know if you're
going to give people high-speed access
to their data no matter where in the
world they're traveling then you need a
global system right and so so we also
have the problem it has to work
everywhere and there's a mantra around
here that everything has to be fast
speed is the top teacher for any product
so if you're going to do all that there
are some architectural consequences
first of all the main way we've seen you
can actually deliver that kind of thing
is through the web okay so a browser is
a fantastic way to deliver those kinds
of services at that kind of scale and
obviously we care a lot about speed and
that comes back to security in the sense
of things that you might want to do to
protect the data like run SSL are a
non-starter in this in this world if you
can't make it run fast enough so we put
a lot of energy into that and then the
next set of architectural consequences i
see is it's hard to make any product
work with that many people if you have
to answer the telephone you just can't
take phone calls from 100 million people
so if it's not usable enough for them to
basically deal with on their own without
any help then it's again not going to
fly the other interesting thing which is
not quite as clear is this model of the
world is mainly interesting if the
product your building is useful for
people to collaborate if it's a
completely single person thing it's it's
okay this may be a good model but the
really killer feature is when you get
people working together so those are
some and then at the more technical
level behind the scenes the only way you
can build systems that work the scale is
to make them absolutely uniform so we
don't have the same kinds of patching
problems in our production systems that
we have in our regular desktop systems
because in production the only way to
run this is to stamp these things out
absolutely the same every one of those
machines is absolute hammered down to be
identical
and final thing if you hadn't already
figured out google is run by the
engineers here and that's just that's a
fact and that's sometimes challenging
for security will get why I get back to
why so given the that context of what
we're trying to do and roughly why it's
hard at scale the way we've chosen to
organize security here google is
basically to put it in the hands of the
teams that are building products so
gmail team basically worries about
security of gmail and I think that's the
right way to organize this you make the
people who are writing the code
day-to-day actually be the ones who care
there the data custodians they're the
ones that are thinking about what kind
of days we're saving what stuff they
should just never have because they
don't want it to ever be subject to a
subpoena or whatever they worry
day-to-day line by line code reviews and
everything the security team is a
centralized organization that acts as an
advisor to them because there are a lot
of things like the browser the world's
browsers today are an unbelievably
complicated programming environment I
mean it's I remember the web in the
early days and mosaic was really cool
because you could write a little bit of
HTML and get this stuff to happen that
that those days are long past so to
securely deliver a web application today
requires you know a lot about a lot of
different browsers in each of their
versions and very subtle features that's
not a thing that engineers could be
expected to learn so we have a central
team that advises on that kind of
esoteric knowledge and provides some
tooling and so forth to make that
writing that stuff easier and builds
infrastructure to make it possible so
Dirk is telling you about authentication
infrastructure that he gets involved in
building so the rest of Google can use
it correctly and then we have an
operation side that is an arms race with
the bad guys just as nails was talking
about
we have a kind of waterfall model of
software development here you remember
waterfall right at the beginning
somebody has a good idea and it's
downhill from there that's traditional
traditional idea so as you expect that
most places it starts off with someone
who's got a clear enough idea they could
actually write it down they have a
coherent design and what the practice
here is they first send it off to the
security team to take a look at that
design review so we will tell them up
front if you don't change the protocol
in the following way it's going to
always be possible for somebody to break
in so we'll give them some heads up
early on when it's easy to make changes
in the design and then I will point them
in some direction we might say you know
if you're going to go down this path you
really ought to be using these Auto
escaping templates over here it'll just
save you a lot of time if you can tell
people at the beginning of some tools
proper library or something to use and
their implementation will sort of by
just fall into being right so that's
that's good along the way we also give
them some tools to be checking that
their code has a problem or not tho
those you know when it finds a bug we
call that an educator ested in learning
what's this crazy cross-site scripting
thing all about so we send them off to
some documentation on what that is and
then at the end when they think they're
ready to launch they come back to
security team and we hammer it we have
all kinds of fuzzing tools and will
pound around through manually with a
proxy in between the tribes variations
and so forth and we've made a lot of
these tools open source so if you're
trying to write web apps you ought to
come take a look at some where we hand
out and then that's traditionally how
the software lifecycle is described that
actually leads out a lot of the most
important part even if you try really
hard many many layers here of trying to
get the software right you're going to
still have bugs so the important thing
is to have a team ready to be listening
to the community you know will monitor
various blogs we we're one of the few
groups that will actually
email from the outside world and respond
I mean we tried very hard to listen and
when we hear something's wrong to
actually respond rapidly track down the
person whose code that was get it fixed
get that push to production and then get
back to the to the report and explain
what had happened and then after that's
done we we look hard at what happened
you know why is it that that bug slipped
through all these layers of checking are
there things that we can deduce from the
logs well that bug could have put
someone's data at risk of having been
scooped by an outsider let's look
through our logs and see whether that
potential loss actually happened or not
and is there something we can do to fix
that so we work very hard on that and
since that's not enough we also try
breaking into our own systems of course
so I thought it would be interesting to
people trying to research in this area
to see what Google's perspective is on
what are the main open problems in
security today in a very pragmatic level
and certainly number one is
authentication so we just you heard a
fair amount of detail about OAuth and
open ID and informed consent and so
forth it's not that these are the
world's most sophisticated
authentication protocols you know I
certainly would prefer that we were
using client certificates in all those
SSL connections but again usability
comes in the sense is we don't yet have
browsers that make client certificates
usable so that's not yet an option maybe
we'll get there someday we'll certainly
we certainly do research in all areas
including usability but for today open
ID seems good enough to if I can follow
up on one of the questions from the
previous talk the way i would use open
ID to avoid that fishing problem you're
talking about is when i open up the
browser in the morning I go to my
preferred supplier in this case gmail
and authenticate there so I'm following
a bookmark in my browser so I know I'm
getting to the right place and it's
it's got all the SSL protections on it
so I'm pretty sure that I'm really
talking to the real server and I
authenticate there and then I never type
my password again after that at least
theoretically that's what we're trying
to get to hear if I were to go to an
open ID relying party that's trusting
Google to do the authentication when I
click on the Open ID signal it should
never ask me for a password and that's
the way I solve that fishing problem for
myself so if we can train people to
follow that practice that works or even
better if they don't even know of a
password that'll work even better
there's there's so many problems with
passwords today this is the number one
way that Google users lose their
information they they do things like use
the same password at multiple sites I
mean you know if you hear if your google
password is the same as your facebook
password is the same as your password X
tubes and so you'll find that one of
those sites gets hacked even if it's
storing your password in hashed form
there's enough computing capacity out
there in the world today that people
without even massive resources behind
them can crack those hashes and now
they've got your password and the first
thing they do with that is run around to
all the other sites in the world and see
what they can get so that's happening on
a massive scale today so that's why we
had the severe password problem that's
not the only reason that passwords are
problem but that is today a big big deal
so I you know not everyone uses exactly
the same password on every site but if
you're taking the same password and
varying it just a little then the bad
guy only has to crack your password in
two sites and he can probably generalize
from that and we see that kind of
behavior where they they've seen one
password and they can they say ah i see
a digit there let me just try
incrementing that digit over here and
see if it works and it does so you'll
see that kind of thing where their brute
face brute forcing the password in like
five or ten tries and they get in okay
so authentication is the biggest problem
we face don't know what to do
we're trying various things we're
experimenting with simple second factor
methods that everybody has likes we send
an SMS to your phone or we let you
download an app onto your smartphone or
something so we're playing around with
those things it's just as important for
employees as for users by the way and we
really do believe in multiple personas
so I if anybody google tells you that
you're not allowed to have multiple
accounts please send them to me i will
i'll explain to them why it's important
that we change the wording and on that
all right there's also a bit of a
problem on server authentication this is
a real life example if you happen to be
in the wrong part of the world and you
try to go to Gmail you will get pop up
you should not click pass certificate
warnings don't do that we find eat we've
even found in meetings of this kind
someone was able to put up a little
Wi-Fi hotspot and and sir you know put
in a proxy that was intercepting
communications so don't click pass the
server one certificate warnings are
there for good reason because this does
come up we actually are also looking at
ways that Google could use some of its
resources to help you find that kind of
a problem what if we collect all the ssl
certificates from all the servers in the
world as we're crawling and make it
possible for your browser to notice that
the hash on the certificate you're
getting is not the same as the hash that
we got when we crawl the web that's that
could be a useful warning okay so we're
trying to figure out how we can deliver
that to you okay so the first one was
authentication the set yes question yes
it's frustrating that's that that's why
what you know when Neal's was saying how
many people click past warnings about
fifty percent well I i I'm you
understand you know you really need to
see your email right and what are you
going to do so many people will click
the warnings and many people have their
account hijacked I don't some of the
browser vendors have gone so far as to
just make it hard to click past the
warning and that's probably one approach
but least is somewhat effective really I
can't I can't admit I mean I know and so
I don't know about that particular hotel
I know in many hotels you will first
have to you'll get redirected to another
page so let's say you want to go to
gmail so you type in gmail you'll get a
certificate warning because its first
redirecting all traffic to their terms
and conditions hotel agreement so the
first thing you do perhaps in that
situation is go to google com you know
not hsl just a plain old go to the New
York Times or something be allow it to
redirect you to their site where you
click yes and after that you should be
able to even restart your browser if you
want and then you should be able to get
to gmail without a warning i hope but
but don't yeah i hope someone else in
the hotel yes okay that's that's how it
works good okay so problem number one is
authentication problem number two
classically is web application
vulnerabilities and I this was certainly
the vast bulk of our effort I would say
I've been here at Google three years
first couple years I would say this has
been the the vast bulk of our effort we
finally feel like we're making some
progress there just like you know it
used to be buffer overflows we're just
the Boehner existence for software
developers and then that hasn't been as
much of a problem I don't languages have
improved and libraries have improved so
forth cross-site scripting is still the
main problem for
most web application developers we see
that when we go to outside vendors you
know just as we're a cloud provider we
use other companies to to be providers
to us and before we sign a contract you
know we go check out their site a little
bit and almost always we find just what
seemed to us egregious web application
vulnerabilities so what's a cross-site
scripting bug here's a typical search
page you search for kittens and bingo
you get back some nice pictures search
for a different string that includes
some stuff like this if the if our
search engine we're not properly
escaping the input when we return the
search results it would include some
JavaScript which would execute on the
page and because something here it's
doing its merely putting up a pop-up but
malicious JavaScript would do all kinds
of things still your cookies you know
still your account send them off to some
country somewhere okay so how do we get
around that we have to make sure that
all user input is validated that's a
standard principle and security right no
big deal the trouble is it's sort of
like they say about flying you know it's
not hard to land a plane it's just hard
to land a plane perfectly every single
time so it's hard to write 100 million
lines of code and never get it wrong
when you're echoing the user input back
to the browser so what we've we've tried
a whole bunch of things over the last
few years what we found works is to
provide the developers with an auto
escaping system so if you're developing
in the Google template system you don't
write any escaping code you just declare
what what context you're in use declare
up at the top of this template that this
is HTML and our parser will parse this
HTML and notice where the variables are
are being inserted and insert the right
kind of escaping for it so we know the
difference between a plain user string
and the url url escaping is a slightly
different JavaScript escaping is
different CSS files you know Jason etc
so that's what's really made a huge
difference for us and then the third
problem that I'd highlight is malware
you know this is what happened to us in
December there was some social
engineering somebody got a link that was
from you know that the hijacked account
of one of their actual friends
suggesting they look at some photo site
and bingo right they they clicked on
that with a browser and instant drive-by
download their machine was infected it
was done in a very silent way and that's
the way bad things happen to your
company right it's very hard to bypass
this you know we try to educate people
you know don't click on things and so
forth but it's just very hard this icon
here is a nice example it looks
plausible right you say open folder to
view files that looks like a plausible
thing you might click on but actually
it's in the wrong place you see that
should be down here under general
options up here it's an installer run
program so you click on that and bingo
you're there compromised right it's
really hard today to avoid getting
yourself compromised so we do lots of
things we try to train people we have
the Safe Browsing effort that Neil's was
talking about that whole arms race with
the bad guys were we trying to you know
flag things for you of course we're
running antivirus systems here but those
are not those are effective maybe
two-thirds of the time that's really not
good enough right so I mean the
antivirus guys are very good they work
very hard but you know this is a tough
problem especially in cases where your
company's being targeted for attack as
as nails was describing the bad guys the
the people at our writing now we're know
about all the antivirus packages that
are out there and they will carefully
recompile their software until it passes
all the different tests that are
available so it's tough there's a more
radical approach that people are
thinking about now where you actually
whitelist antivirus and safe browsing is
blacklist it says well we recognize that
this particular executable is dangerous
and we don't
have you run it whitelisting says we
know which executables are safe and you
don't get to run anything else that's a
very painful world to live in for a
software development company so this is
hard but this is the the bad place we're
in today the important thing is keep
everything patched up to date I mean
this is the main lesson of the Chrome
browser I think from a security
perspective if you can as soon as you
listen to people reporting
vulnerabilities fix those fast and then
push it out to a hundred percent of the
user base in a matter of days then you
get a much more secure world and and you
saw those plots earlier and one of the
talks right at how quickly we can push
things out we put a lot of energy into
that right even to the level of how can
we compress the update files so that
even Google with lots of bandwidth can
afford to push those updates to lots of
people very rapidly yes I agree with you
this this topic has just been one of
considerable discussion we just did a
blog post where we said we think 60 days
is a reasonable upper bound for critical
patches by critical I mean you know
remote code exploit if the bad guys
found out about this they can own any
machine they they want basically right
60 days seems like a really long time
but then you know put on other hat of
when it actually comes to you know we
got a vulnerability report typically
this is a very confused report it's very
unclear what's going on so it takes a
little while to figure out what the
problem is and then it typically takes
maybe a few hours to a few days to
figure to fix the code and then it takes
awhile to test that fix and then it
takes awhile to push that out to
everyone so there are enough companies
with say 30 day patch cycles that we've
well okay 60 days it's sort of a
reasonable balance and that's what we've
picked as our new standard we try it
within Google to be
much faster than that but there are
legitimately times when the only way you
can fix this bug is to simultaneously
patch 5 or 10 products running on you
know data centers get around the world
that have their own periods outages and
so forth and it is that genuinely hard
sometimes to push this stuff out
everywhere and that's the good case
that's the cloud computing case where
we're much better off than the default
you know the customary enterprise
software case where you're trying to
update laptops that may be powered off
for weeks at a time I mean this is fast
patching is not an easy thing and so
again we put a lot of energy into that
but finally I this is just a hard
problem I think with most any of the
platforms available to today if you're
surfing the net more or less freely
you're probably at strong risk of being
compromised I mean it's just the way
things are today you know we do our best
but if you're going to be going to lots
of websites and having them work there
requiring so many plugins that you're
you're in you're in a big problem so I
think that's a major area for research
I'm very encouraged that there are new
designs coming out where well there's
Chrome OS that I'm using and there's
other designs where we try to have a
hypervisor and multiple virtual machines
on top of that extend that notion that
chrome has of you know some sandboxing
and separation to a much more radical
level so that's a great area for systems
research I believe okay let's see how we
do it in time we have a general motto
around here trust but verify we have a
very open culture so we trust people a
lot but we know that people need some
safety net kind of help the way you see
this if you're a gmail user today is
we're keeping track of where you're
logging in from and if we spot something
weird will pop up a little red bar and
say you know there's something funny
here we can't really tell we don't know
you could just be on vacation but
there's something funny about the
pattern of logins here we think you
ought to take a quick look
if you don't recognize that well then
you need to be very worried because it
means you've already your accounts
already been hijacked your own it's you
at that point you need to go back and
try to think how did they get my account
and what have they done with my account
etc so at least giving the user some
indication like this you know we do the
best we can staring at our logs to try
to recognize this it's hard this is an
active area of research for us you know
what are what are the right clues what's
an anomaly so for question it's it's
another area where I think we're trying
to figure out in in the account recovery
kind of a situation in addition to
figuring out who's the true holder of
the account and how to give it back to
them what additional information can we
give them about it you know it appears
that things started going funny with
your account back on that date here's
what's happened since then big things
you worry about in gmail is you know
there are forwarding filters you know
you can arrange to match certain kinds
of mail and send it off to that email
address that's a cool feature I use that
but a clever adversary me go in very
quietly very stealthily right they took
over your account they go because I got
your password they only logged in once
they set up this filter they ford's off
some of your mail somewhere and that's
all they do they back away that it's the
kind of thing you want to be looking for
but if they sent mail as you write or or
maybe even just receive meal maybe they
figured out that your gmail account is
the secondary for some bank account and
they went to the bank instead here i
want to reset my password the bank sends
a password to your gmail account if all
they can do is read the mail that may be
enough so it's it's hard to give a
complete answer to that it's something
we think about a lot what kind of
forensics can we do on a hijacked
account so we're doing the best we can
with this and this is just the start I
think of more we experiment on our
employees first right we figure we can
be a little more in true
on that and and try out lots of things
and ask them and and even more in terms
of experiment employees again trust but
verify we do have a fantastic set of
engineers here at Google there you know
they I think they're really well
motivated they are well compensated
they've got interesting work to do they
feel that they're doing something that's
worthwhile in the world so so we have a
pretty benign environment compared to
most enterprises in terms of the insider
attack however even if every engineer
was perfect the existence of malware
means that what what a traditional
enterprise would think of as an insider
attack is still a possibility at Google
so we're constantly looking for what
kinds of anomalies can we see in our
network records or access patterns or
something so the way only way you can do
that is to cut the noise level down so
we try to make the right way of doing
things internally the easy thing to do
we log everything and crunch the data
like crazy looking for anomalies and
then because you never get clear cut
patterns when we see an anomaly just
like with that gmail example we would go
into your say hey were you really
accessing that data set at three in the
morning you know seems sort of weird
right so that kind of thing works there
are some additional crypto techniques
and and fun finally they're always can
be a roegan to engineer and they know
that we have zero tolerance for abuse I
mean that's that's just go browsing
through user data and you will get fired
so that that helps to people to know
that yes a couple times but
unfortunately that's very very rare here
yes so kind of summarizing a lot of
security is not the really sophisticated
crypto that we're used to studying in
graduate school right we have a ton of
PhDs and the staff and we still get to
publish some right it's certainly
encouraged but pragmatically day-to-day
the the severe problems that we see
people have
often not solve a super sophisticated
crypto a lot of security is just just
doing it right so there is this model
you heard earlier put the user first
that's absolutely true we follow that
there's a sense that okay you don't have
to use super sophisticated crypto SSL is
a good thing you don't need to write
necessarily you won't get papers out of
just implementing ssl but it actually
takes some engineering effort to
implement ssl so well you know you get
the session resume rates up you do the
set in the other make sure you're not
adding extra round trip delays to
properly implement it so well that you
can afford to then turn it on by default
for everybody all the time that's that's
been our goal and we've we've actually
finally gotten there so you know if
you're using gmail you're using SSL and
you're protected you're in a Wi-Fi
hotspot it's hostile doesn't matter
they're not reading your mail we talked
about the importance of fixing fast I
didn't dwell very long on log everything
but that actually turned out to be what
really rescued us in this big incident
you know we've had one big incident
security incident in Google whole time
as far as i know of course the really
severe ones you probably never know
about but we know of one big incident
that we had in december and we were
after talking with other companies that
we discovered you know we we discover
the company's we're also under attack we
called them up and said by the way did
you know look here right and it usually
came as a surprise to them so we're
pretty sure that the thing that saved us
is google's absolute belief in in using
data we massively log everything and
crunch on it and besides that just
eternal vigilance okay and the final
most important rule in security is get
the best staff you can and i'm very
pleased with the people i've been able
to hire Oh far as one of our latest
hires and so forth that's fantastic so
all of you who are cranking out students
please the best students send them here
