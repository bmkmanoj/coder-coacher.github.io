honor
and pleasure to host this morning the
venerable Rubina curtain Rubina has been
a Tibetan Buddhist nun for over 30 years
and during that time is well reputed for
the unique and very impacting and deep
style with which she teaches I believe
that you will find this talk to be
engaging and enlightening and fun and
all of the best things that you can do
at work on a Friday morning so
Rubina is working with a group called
the it was actually the executive
director of the liberation prison prison
project which has sort of provided a
spiritual foundation for more than
fifteen thousand prisoners worldwide and
this is a very big undertaking and has a
staff and staff requires you know
funding so to help with that until draw
funds to the liberation prison project
Rubina is leading a conference in San
Francisco coming up soon at which our
very own
chade-meng tan will be speaking our
jolly good fellow the goal of this
conference is to of course bring about
happiness in its causes and to cut
suffering and its causes and one of the
other benefits that it will have will be
to support the liberation prison project
financially Robina is here to give a
talk this morning about how to be your
own therapist and without any further
ado I will turn it over to her thank you
Tom
happy to be here everybody thank you
very much for having me
uh well first of all here I am bit
dressed as a Buddhist nun so we
straightaway go into our religious mode
don't win we think it's all about
religion and therefore believing things
well Buddha's not like that so for a
start the kind of thinking cap you put
on when you think science when you think
numbers you put that same hat on please
don't bring your religious hat in here
bring your intelligent hat because I'm
not joking to say that actually Buddha
is more similar to say Einstein in the
sense that Buddha is not a creator he
doesn't speculate no one revealed
anything to him he doesn't he didn't
have visions of things he didn't kind
make things up and therefore there's
nothing to believe it's actually true to
say that Buddha you know is a person
like a scientist as we would call it who
from his own experience has found
certain things to be so so what he deals
with primarily is the human mind so from
that perspective you could say he's a
psychologist I mean obviously he didn't
use that word then he didn't speak Greek
did he he spoke Hindi or poly or
whatever it was but actually Buddha
deals with the mind that's his expertise
and that is finally the essence of what
Buddhism is you know so yes indeed I'm a
Buddhist nun and if you go to Tibetan
Buddhist places you won't get a sense of
its being psychological what you're
going to see is religion pictures and
holy things and nuns and monks and the
trappings of religion but what's
interesting about Buddhism over the
centuries is that there's no
contradiction you know for Buddhist for
Buddhist culture there's no
contradiction between what we call
spiritual and what is called proving
things and using your intelligence you
know or philosophy these things and
frankly that's what actually appealed to
me enormous Lee I was whatever Catholic
and I think in my own life the thing
that really drove me was my wish I mean
it sounds awfully Noble but I'm saying
it my wish for truth so that drove me to
sort of philosophical approaches always
looking for the big view always wanting
to know why and watch you know so you
know first being a bit of an old hippie
and then kind of a revolutionary lefty
and then feminist politics and whatever
always looking for why things were and I
found an enormous ly appealing this
Buddhist idea first that you know Buddha
did nobody created you including your
mother and the father that you know but
but the crucial thing about Buddhism is
that as I said Buddha presents things
about how he has seen things and then
what's interesting in the Buddhist view
is it's a process of verification but
the point of that is not just to get a
head full of knowledge that that
verification of something also brings
along with it the experiential result so
this is key relationship in Buddhism
therefore between what so called wisdom
and happiness so the Buddha's deal
really is that first of all we have this
mind this consciousness these words are
used synonymously and so of course the
way to listen to Buddhism because he's
not a creator you take it as a
hypothesis you don't try to
squeeze it inside your head and believe
it or reject it you take it as a
hypothesis which is a very reasonable
person's approach to any knowledge so
Buddha's deal is what is asserting that
consciousness is not physical for a
start
second it's not created by anybody and
that's a big shock because if we're
materialists as far as we're concerned
our mummy and daddy created us and if
we're religious then God created us but
the Buddha's got a kind of third
approach and he would say we don't need
creating why we need a creator he
doesn't know but he is asserting that
consciousness and you just take this as
your you know as a as a thing to run
with it's your it's this river of mental
moments all your thoughts feelings
unconscious subconscious instinct
intuition the entire spectrum of your
inner being this is your consciousness
so think of it as like a river of mental
moments and you know very well if you
had perfect memory you could track it
all back to yesterday without a single
second missing you could track it back
to the day before and if it existed the
day before you know you have to track it
back to the day before and so on and so
forth you know so you can get back to
the first second of conception so here
is this hypothesis the Buddhist view
would be that the second before
conception you know you your egg and
sperm or in your mummy and daddys body
minding their own business God has
nothing to do with it nor Buddha but
your consciousness is its own entity and
you can track it back and back so that
will do for that concept right there but
the key thing is to see the experiential
implication of this which is which is
what gets us to this business of being
your own therapist you know which is a
very tasty way of seeing what a person
who is living with Buddhism in their
lives is attempting to do because the
Buddha's deal is that your mind is yours
no one gave it to you it's a very
bizarre concept kind of schizophrenic
idea in Buddhism that someone else kind
of created us prompt us on this earth
and said okay now get along with it you
know and I mean the Buddha would say
that what's in my mind is mine my anger
my love my intelligence my kindness my
compassion my tendencies are mine so
this simple one of the implications of
this idea of continuity of consciousness
and I won't go too far into that now it
doesn't need just take it as your
hypothesis it's inevitable it's
inexorable that therefore what's inside
your mind is yours and you're
responsible for it not on a guilty sense
there's no dualistic idea in Buddhism
about guilt and blame and and sort of
that kind of idea what's in there
is yours he would say the Buddha would
say it's and you're not stuck with it I
mean just the last 20 years these
amazing discussions that have been going
on between the Dalai Lama and all the
marvelous minds in from the Tibetan
Tibetan monastic tradition and with
these the best brains in the West you
know and some of the as one scientist
recently said one of the greatest
findings of the 20th century is the idea
of neuroplasticity well with respect
Buddha could have told you that two and
a half thousand years ago I'm just happy
we're catching up with Buddha that's all
you know but guess what we're not stuck
with what we're born with this is an
assumption in all of Buddhas view of the
universe you know and it's something
that's assumed in a person who is a
Buddhist in their practice and it's
quite empowering because if you look at
how we suffer in daily life it's this
sense of kind of hopelessness I'm angry
I'm depressed I'm no good I can't do
this we have these very limited kind of
instinctive sense of what we think we
are we're kind of I didn't ask to get
born it's not my fault what can I do
about it
I think you'd look inside ourselves this
is what holds us back you know but what
taking on this Buddhist idea and
learning to use it as your basis in your
life I can tell you from our own
experience it's unbelievably empowering
but yes whatever's in there is there
take responsibility see it don't pretend
it's not there the hopelessness the fear
the jealousy the depression you know for
low self-esteem they're wanting to kill
yourself wanting to kill others blame
whatever you want to call it it's all
there and the idea being your own
therapist is to become intimately and I
mean intimately familiar with this stuff
not just to get more guilty but the we
all know that when you find what the
problem is you then that indicates the
solution doesn't it if you can't locate
the problem you'll never find the
solution so this is the basis you know
in this nice packaging say in the
Buddhist teachings call the Four Noble
Truths the context here is suffering and
so the third one is where Buddha's
really asserting and again you take this
as your hypothesis that every living
being necessarily possesses this
phenomenal potential to be free of what
we would call suffering what we would
call the limitations what we would you
know all the miserable stuff and the
flip side of that is we have the
potential to grow the good stuff so
looking in a very simple way at kind of
a the Buddhist model of the mind you
know and it's deceptively simple
so you make it awfully complicated in
the West you know with ad ID and buy
this and whatever it is you know but the
Buddha puts put talks about the mind in
terms of we've got positive qualities
which are those that necessarily bring
us happiness and cause us to benefit
others that feel harmonious that feel
spacious that feel relaxed and then
you've got the neurotic negative
qualities that necessarily cause you
suffering necessarily and that cause you
to harm others and ardis harmonious and
fractured and miserable and fearful and
neurotic in their nature you know so the
marvelous point the blood is making and
this is not this is completely flying in
the face of all the assumptions of all
our models of the mind in the West that
these do not have equal status you know
if we think of what we think of a person
you define the parts of a person in our
materialist world we would say that a
reasonable person you know hasn't well
maybe you know a couple of legs and
knows a couple of eyes and roughly the
right place plus some love some kindness
some intelligence some depression and as
long as they're reasonably balanced and
you're an okay person
well Buddha's you here's kind of
baseline if you like when it sounds
insane is really perfection he would say
that mind at its core is pure and again
this stuff you don't believe it I'm
stating it but then a person who's
interested you go into this you you get
your inferential kind of information and
you work it through in your own mind you
process it to see the logic of it to
find the truth of it
and as a Dow lama points out again and
again if you can prove from your own
direct experience that the Buddha's
wrong
you must reject him so the Buddha is a
picture the Buddhist view is that the
positive states of mind are at the core
of our being they are the basis of who
we are and therefore can be grown for
our sake and the sake of others in this
universe you know it's a reasonable
practical issue not like you must do it
because God said so there's no concept
like that in Buddhism it's a it's an
experiential practical issue and then he
says therefore the stuff that he would
call the negative which he says is the
basis of our neurosis and our misery and
our low self esteem and all the rest is
actually not at the core of our being
this is quite a shocker because there's
a deep assumption as I said in all our
models of the mind in the West that it
is at the core of our being the
in fact you'd actually think you're in
an unnatural person if you didn't have
depression or anger we think now we're
unnatural when it's very extreme but the
border would say having any of it is
unnatural in the sense that it doesn't
belong in the sense that it's there
loud and clear look at your life but
that we can transform it we can change
it and I'm not talking holy here do not
hear this stuff of holy here this is
intelligent practical doable stuff and I
can't stress this enough you know
because we have these absolutely
knee-jerk reactions the moment we hear
about spiritual Buddhist nun meditation
we kind of lose our common sense we
think we have to put our thinking cap
off
well mistake keep it on you know and
that's for myself personally what I
absolutely delight in in this tradition
of the Dalai Lama that happens to be in
the Tibetan you know this monastic
philosophical monastic tradition the
last thousand twelve hundred years I
found it in my own life enormously
appealing you know you don't chuck out
your intelligence there's no
contradiction between heart and
intelligence in the Buddhist view this
is nice analogy that a book that a bird
needs to wings wisdom and compassion and
the wisdom wing you could say is all
this work of being your own analysts
knowing yourself intimately precisely
clearly using the same level of depth of
analysis and intelligence and clarity
that we know we need to employ what we
call science you know that's the kind of
intelligence you need to really know
your own mind using these very marvelous
techniques that have been around for
more than a thousand years several
thousand years pre Buddha he took these
techniques from the Hindus you know I
mean they're happy to share these
so-called concentration techniques
they're unbelievably practical
psychological techniques the likes of
which we haven't even begun to tap in
our materialist world and there's just a
practical fact you know don't think of
them as religious this is really a
disservice to ourselves and others you
really to do these techniques well you
need phenomenal discipline phenomenal
intelligence for nominal will and real
long-term patience you know and the
result of these I mean communists can do
them they're not religious in their
nature these practical techniques called
concentration meditation but again we've
got these cliched ideas as all
getting a nice feeling and being mindful
well excuse me you know
thieves need mindfulness there's nothing
holy about mindfulness okay you can't
make a cake without being mindful but
you can't shoot somebody without being
mindful either so we really got to quit
this kind of wishy-washy nonsense about
spiritual I really can't stand it you
know you get my point okay I'm a
Buddhist nun I don't deny whatever but
these misconceptions we have about
spiritual you know we'll make this huge
disordered dichotomy in our own lives
between pleasure and and thinking and
intelligence and science and then your
spiritual on the other side there is no
contradiction you know there is no
contradiction the essence of the
Buddhist one really is this one of um
can you turn me around I can't do it I'm
getting more two more on this side just
whiz me around that's it
um it's just going to go to the left
whatever I can do I can't help it
give me a chair no don't don't worry
I'll be right so okay so let's look at
the contents a little bit of this mind
of ours the names of these so-called
positive qualities and the names of
these so-called negative ones and again
don't here this is judgment it's a it's
a practical issue or try to identify
problems because let's face it we all
want happiness you know and do your
market research just in this room you're
going to get a hundred percent agreement
people want happiness don't want
suffering you ask the dogs and the
giraffe you look at their behavior
you're going to see what they want the
same you know so then the Buddha's deal
is okay that's that's practical a good
start so let's look at what happiness is
how does he define it and therefore what
are the obstacles to it and they're the
things you work on you know you want to
be healthy you've got some suffering you
find out what the problem is you find
the alternative you solve the problem
it's practical
so Buddha's view of happiness is
actually very is very simple we make it
complicated we think of it as like a
needle in a haystack that you're trying
to search for because we believe
instinctively and this is the
materialist view again don't be kind of
it's not moralistic as practical we
think of it as something you've got to
find so we think of it in external terms
the job the body the boyfriend the
dollars the shape the sound the smell
well you know no problem
many boyfriends as you like as much as
many dollars as you like no problem
they're all the Buddha's saying is if
you think that you'll get happy feelings
from it you're mistaken you might get
some but they won't last so for him it's
real simple this idea of happiness if
you think about it again
what we think it is is what you get when
you get what you want and that's drives
us this is primordial in us this is
deeply instinctive within us and here's
finding fault with that he says it's
just not practical it doesn't work but
he says happiness is it's real simple
it's what you get when you give up the
neurosis it's in that sense it's inside
it's a practical thing in other words
the extent to which we are caught up in
any given moment in low self-esteem
depression anger jealousy you name it we
all know those words and they're under
the negative heading we all know them
the extent to which were caught up in
those is the extent to which we suffer
therefore are not happy the extent to
which we are not caught up in those and
therefore the extent to which were
involved in kind of you know connecting
with others empathy being harmonious
forgiving it's a struggle but there the
positive quality is the extent to which
they're prevalent in our minds at any
given moment is the extender which we're
happy it's an incredibly simple little
recipe in Buddhist terms we think it is
what you get when you get what you want
he says is what you get when you give up
the neurosis which is the one so the
technique is learning to know your mind
be your own therapist yes indeed using
these so-called mindfulness techniques
they're practical psychological
techniques to help you focus your mind
the reason you want to focus your mind
because we can see from the second we
wake up until the second we go to sleep
is running 4000 miles an hour in every
imaginable direction with zero control
and we in our culture assume that's
normal
Buddha says it's a mental illness and
he's got techniques to help us steady it
and don't think about calming it that's
kind of you get this sort of an idea of
a person with a silly grin on their face
a calm mind can be a busy mind okay and
if you think about it what causes the
problems isn't a busy mind it's when the
when it's the busy mind is caught up in
fear about yourself and worried what
people think about you and am i good
enough and I'm too fat and I'm too
thin and depression and jealous and
anxiety and all the rest that's the
stuff that causes the misery if you're
full of thoughts about being useful to
others all day and being content with
yourself well please go for it you know
you don't have a problem believe me so
we've got to be very precise about this
sure in time as we progress in the
development of this mind of ours is
ongoing job of being your own therapist
we all know practice makes perfect that
as you progress you can serve a busy
mind I have a busy mind believe me you
can hear it but that's okay you know I'm
not trying to say I'm so holy but I know
from the very beginning when I first
wanted something spiritual as a very
interesting procedure I went through and
I'd been a kind of a hippie in a
communist and a feminist all this stuff
looking for truth looking for the
answers to why the world was the way it
was and then I bumped into these Tibetan
Buddhists and I heard the word
meditation I thought how boring you know
I've no idea what I couldn't care I just
knew I had this attraction to this kind
of I wanted to get a view of the
universe so you know a philosophical
approach a way to see how the world is
and put it all to put that you know put
the two and two together so I remember
having this very clichÃ©d idea about
what I was supposed to be and I kind of
these vague notions of being mindful and
peaceful and all this stuff so I thought
I had to go more slowly or something I
remember a friend of mine she held my
hand and she verbena what's happened
you've lost your energy and I got this
strong sense of what I was doing which
is very common when we serve a spiritual
practice it kind of I was wearing this
print this inauthentic idea of spiritual
like a cloak it was autofit it was
artificial was not authentic and I had
this strong sense and this is what I've
gotten from Buddhism to myself and
meeting these Tibetans I mean people
love the dalai lama because he actually
says he doesn't know sometimes he just
says i don't know when you ask him a
question you know people like very much
this kind of authenticity i mean that's
why they like sarah palin isn't it she
did a good job last night I thought she
kind of seems authentic you know so the
thing was I realized stop trying to be
something I'm not be honest about what I
am but then slowly slowly learn to be
authentic see what you are take look at
your qualities take responsibility for
them and then know you're you're a work
in progress as one tibetan lamas here we
can mold our minds our thoughts and
feelings into any shape we
like you know and this is the thing here
the level of which I'm discussing here
the level of practice based upon these
really marvelous techniques where you
can learn to focus your mind you then
use the skill of cognitive this some
really a process of cognitive therapy
and I'm really not kidding what it is a
master cognitive therapist you learn
more and more clearly literally to hear
the millions of voices inside there
but now erasing like I said out of
control all day every day but it is
possible with more and more focus and
that just needs practice to see more
deeply to listen more deeply to be more
precise and then slowly being able to
distinguish between the neurotic voices
and the positive ones truly that's it
you know that the basis of all our
neurotic ones is one way of saying about
it in Buddhism the basis of the neurotic
voices there's a fearful ones the angry
ones of jealous the depression is that
is a neurotic sense of self of I you
think about you know if Monica and I are
sitting having a very friendly
conversation I'm listening to her and
she's listen to me and I crack heard you
know I laugh at her jokes and she laughs
at mine you think about this carefully
when it's very easygoing there's no real
vivid sense of I this I am listening to
Monica you're kind of connected to her
there's a sense of interdependence isn't
there there's a sense of we now you
watch what happens when you start to
argue that we is cut in half right there
so when the things we're going nicely
you could say that the positive
qualities of connectedness and they are
that's really their nature there's a
sense of connectedness the unhappy eye
is kind of quiet like a sleeping lion
and there's a sense of a sense of
another a sense of connected to other
there but then when that's cut you kind
of revert back into yourself and the eye
rises loudly and you're panicking and
your hearts beating and the Bloods
racing and she did this and I said that
it's not fair poor me this that's the
voice the eye then you're otter guy
behind all the unhappy states of mine
that's their character so it's a bit
depressing if you think that you're born
with this and you can't change it no I
don't want to go kill ourselves you know
so even to think wow that's interesting
maybe it's possible maybe what Buddha
says it's possible that they're not at
the core of my being that I can learn to
look into these and deconstruct them
and hear the voices and unpack them and
slowly cognitively change myself this is
the process I'm talking about here there
are many kinds of techniques as a whole
- you know tool kit of kit of tools as
paulsen said recently about the economy
did you hear him say that I read every
paper in the world I tell you I'm a
complete junkie for newspapers so
there's a whole part is a big toolkit of
many kinds of things the one I'm talking
here which I find eminently practical
for us in the West with all our genius
and genius minds working ten times the
pace of most people's don't try to hold
yourself back love the fact that you've
got a brilliant mind that you're a real
thinker this is the this is the
technique this is the tool that you can
use to be your own therapist to use this
cognitive process to deconstruct your
own stuff okay alongside that
intelligence you need some you know
integrity you need humility you need the
wish to look at yourself you need the
will to want to the ability and the wish
to want to go beyond blame and hurt that
alongside this intelligence that's a
marvelous packaging I tell you that's
the stuff that we need intelligence on
its own as a disaster you can still be
an infantile at the age of 90 even if
you're a genius you know so the
emotional intelligence is what we need
to get and the lack of emotional
challenges is what we have and we have
anger and jealousy and fear and
attachment cuz they're these totally
self-centered unhappy miserable states
of mind
so the first in the wisdom wing talk in
Buddhism it's a question of knowing
yourself well taking responsibility but
on the basis of the fact that you can
change not oh I'm so guilty I'm so bad
not that at all which is the knee-jerk
reaction we tend to have and we point
out problems in our self that's not the
attitude here it's a courageous attitude
that you say okay I am jealous I get
depressed I am this I am that what a
drag it's breaking my heart you got to
have compassion for yourself really
which is a brand new idea for us we love
to hate ourselves so this wisdom wing is
on the one side is on the basis of the
fact that you've got this marvelous
potential emotional intelligent
potential to develop your human
qualities
more strongly you can kind of identify
with your positive potential the more
you have the courage don't you to see
the things that are holding you back but
the crucial one for me is if we take one
thing from this room I can change it
sounds so simple it's almost
embarrassing but you check the major
will level at which we suffer when
things are going bad we cannot see the
light at the end of the tunnel this is
why we despair because instinctively
we're identifying I with that junk
so the key thing I'm saying here is we
have the junk
don't pretend we haven't but it's not at
the core of your being that's all it's
sort of like you've got this big ugly
scar on your and your arm and you think
it's it can't be removed so of course
you want to hide it you feel depressed
you identify with it but one day you
discover you know you can remove it
slowly well there it is it's still there
but you feel more hopeful now because
you know it's not at the core of your
being it's something like this it's
quite profound actually so for me the
thing we need badly in our culture you
know when the Dalai Lama heard about the
moon the level of low self-esteem in our
culture
he was quite sad he said that's a mental
illness they don't even have a concept
like that among Tibetans you know what
do you mean low self-esteem how can you
hate yourself they say they think it's a
shocking thing to say we have bucket
loads of it and even though we might be
getting buckets of dollars and have
brilliant jobs and be praised and loved
by everybody look at the torture inside
our hearts you know so we might have
this stuff but the miracle is the key is
and start with a hypothesis don't just
blindly believe it you can't begin to
investigate something unless you
hypothesize it if you never think it's
possible you won't open the door to it
you've got to think it's possible and
then you've got to work with it and find
out test for yourself you know this is
the approach so what I think you can ask
me some questions now why not
you've actually got an hour's worth in a
half an hour because I talk fast so
there's an advantage so really ask me
some questions get the mic yeah please
oh good so thank you so much for coming
in today thanks for having so since it's
pretty pointless to pursue a job and the
girlfriend and the dollars and the car
wouldn't the most practical thing for us
to be to just take care of a little bit
of shelter and food and spend all the
Paragons wouldn't stand a life like that
no you're ridiculous
there's nothing wrong with millions of
dollars and jobs and girlfriends and
gorgeous things no no you're chucking
the baby out with the bathwater you went
too far you became kind of nihilistic no
that's not the point you can have your
cake and eat it too sweetheart
I'm really serious here the Buddha makes
this enormous distinction between the
thing itself and your interpretation of
it and what he is describing here the
problem is our interpretation of the
girlfriend of the money if you put all
your eggs in those baskets believing
primordial II that having them equals
happiness
he says that's when you'll be
disappointed because you just got the
wrong recipe so he doesn't say give them
up
he says change your way of interpreting
them so the wisdom wing approach would
be you'd see that happiness is it
depends dependent upon you
changing getting rid of your neurotic
attachment getting rid of all your
craving for people to love you getting I
mean I'm joining the neurotic side here
the craving for people to approve of you
and think you're fantastic and the
dollars in the bank the neurotic
dependence on that stuff is what I am
talking about not the stuff itself
because look at our world you know if
you're in Tibetan culture a thousand
years ago you'd live like that excuse me
you'd be tucked into prison if you live
like this homeless people live like this
and they're the scum of the earth aren't
they
so that's not the answer we're in this
world of abundance and money in things
and color and shapes and music and
sounds it's kind of enough a
sophisticated view the first level is
maybe you back away for a while are you
going to retreat mode you know but
eventually with skill you can have your
cake and eat it too it's giving up the
neurotic attitude towards the things not
the things themselves it's a major major
point makes sense doesn't it okay
so to kind of continue in the same vein
I've heard of the concept of pain
without suffering I guess what I'm
wondering about is I feel like it's I
feel like I understand or it's not that
hard for me to apply the kind of
thinking that you're talking about to an
awful lot of day-to-day issues or even
pretty big issues but if you're
confronted for instance with the death
of a loved one these larger things how
does that kind of fit into this
I don't exactly you know I mean one of
the ways Buddha's talking is that we in
our minds we have deep in the bones of
our being so intuitively because of
enormous amount of habit series layers
upon layers upon layers of assumptions
about how things are and how we think
they should be we so much so that we
don't even notice so the one that's
being attacked right here in terms of a
neurotic state of mind which is where we
suffer is a deep assumption that somehow
I shouldn't change that loved one
shouldn't die the job shouldn't go that
I shouldn't get the sector bad things
shouldn't happen I mean you're getting
my point here if we look at life we did
some market research again we're gonna
see it is normal that people die it's
normal that people lose jobs it's normal
these things happen but everything in is
desperately thinks we try to avert it
because somehow it's a mistake so the
idea here is the way they talk in
Buddhism one of the first steps is to
recognize everything changes I mean it's
hardly rocket science but it's deep in
our bones in other words if I got this
lovely cup that came from my grandmother
I've been vesting in this cup a lot of
energy anti so there's an assumption in
my mind and the more I'm attached to it
the more I believe it won't break so
when it does I'm devastated
why are you suffering Robina or my
beautiful cup broke no no the Buddha
says you're suffering not because it
broke because that's its nature but
because you really believed it shouldn't
and wouldn't so it sounds a bit sort of
clinical but there's because we have
strong connections with certain people
and that's as part of life we therefore
have the neurotic / dependent attached
and upon them which is the cause of so
much of the pain which builds up this
whole idea that they will always be in
my life and I will never lose them and
they will not die we know intellectually
they will but was no way you want to
ever confront that it sounds too
depressing
so they send whatz we're not in touch
with that simple reality that things
change is the extent to which we suffer
when it does so it's getting in touch
with that which is quite deep inside us
so it doesn't mean you just oh well when
they die you don't care it doesn't mean
you become indifferent
I remember the Dalai Lama talking about
when his mummy died he was in tears but
at when we've got a lot of neediness and
attachment and over depending upon
something in a neurotic sense we might
never heal that broken heart when our
loved one dies because you understand my
point it's a real the difference between
the positive and the negative sides of
us there it's really really quite subtle
to see them they're very mixed together
so it doesn't mean like his point is a
perfect one we chucked the baby out with
the bathwater as soon as we hear we've
got a happiness doesn't come from
girlfriends well as soon as we hear that
we suffer because we're attached to our
friends we think oh we don't care when
they die no no it's not like that it's
just that it won't be an erotic I base
thing you'll heal more quickly you'll
miss them and you'll be sad when you
think about them but it doesn't take
your heart with you you don't get
destroyed you know you can heal quickly
because you recognize this is part of
life it's a reality you know yeah that
makes a great deal of sense um I had a
second question you got people have the
patience um for those of us who are you
know clearly novices and new to this
what do you think are some good gateways
to learn more about Tibetan Buddhism
here in the Bay Area well I you know
they had this nice saying in Buddhism
that everything exists on the tip of the
wish so the first it's sort of obvious
but the first step in anything is the
thought so am i walking out this door
believe me my legs won't take me miss my
mind decides I'll be very surprised if
my mind says I want to sit here my legs
take me out the door
so the same with going to a Buddhist
Center you know your legs will walk
there your finger will point there
you'll click on it if your mind wants it
so the first step is to want it no no
I'm not trying to sound smart here I'm
really meaning it seriously if we want
something you open the door to in your
mind and you make this aspiration okay I
like this let's see because it's buckets
loads of stuff available but then if you
do start to search get rid of all these
emotional nonsense about religion you
know and you walk into someplace and
someone makes you all excite and you go
off far out amazing they're so holy be
very careful do your due diligence
checkup because a lot of wackos around
you know like you do your due diligence
when it comes to even just anything
definitely do it with the spiritual
practice go down do your research check
things up listen carefully they say
check the teachers check the steps use
your intelligence use your common sense
and it'll unfold it'll come if you've
got the connection with it you'll all
the doors will be there for you to walk
into you know
thank you Scott of starting in mind
though that impermanence one I wanted to
tell you something when I read vanity
one story in Vanity Fair a few years ago
I told you I read every magazine in
existence I read it's wonderful
interview with Tom and Nikol Tom and
Nicole when they were together right and
Nicole said this is very very kind of
the point I'm making at the end of the
interview she said we will be together
until we're 80 and we understand that we
all feel that way when you're in love
with a person you can't imagine that he
might leave you this is why it's so
devastating but then she covered herself
and said and of course if something does
change it will be devastating so the
point the Buddha's making is you've got
this close connection with somebody
whether it's your mother or your lover
you know but what this nonsense in our
mind does is glom onto it all this
concept of now it's forever that's why
when things go down and you're depressed
you want to kill yourself because you
can't see that that will change too so
whatever the status quo is we grasp onto
it as that's it forever we do it all the
time even though we're so stupid you
know we can see it's stupid because we
know from experience things change to
say that oh I might die tomorrow every
one of us in this room will think that's
hysterical now you do your market
research within 100 mile radius you're
going to find a lot of people who
believe when they went to bed they're
going to wake up in the morning didn't
we don't do that kind of market research
you know we don't want to but it's a
fact you prove it but it's right people
die you know
we don't want to think it kind of you
understand and it sounds a cute kind of
idea but it's the implications are quite
profound actually so the Buddha's deal
is the more we're in touch with reality
at whatever level that's his key thing
actually that's what he means by wisdom
cuz he's saying okay this interesting
point actually I'll get another question
in a second though - he says they're
tuned main character is
it's these neurotic states of mind have
one is and that's fairly evident they
are really disturbing they are painful
they are just the having of them is
suffering right there but the other one
is fascinating and this work is really
looking when you study Buddhist
psychology in more depth the other
characteristic is that they're
delusional now if you were accused of
being delusional to be very offended but
there he uses this word delusion for
these unhappy states of mind meaning the
extending some caught up in attachment
to somebody or a chocolate cake or my
own sense of self is this Center which
I'm not in touch with the reality of
things I'm kind of as one Tibetan lama
said you'd these delusions these
neuroses decorate on top of what is
already there layers upon layers of
characteristics that just aren't there
we over exaggerate you know so if you
have a version for George Bush let's say
and I hear that people do you really
appears ugly to you doesn't it you
really believe he's ugly you don't say
well yes there's this human being there
and I know I have all this anger in my
mind and that causes me that causes him
to appear ugly to me but I'm sure there
must be other qualities there as well
you do not do that you go he is this and
you believe what you're thinking we're
gonna calm D like semi she sees a nice
guy there when you see a person you're
attached to you don't say oh yes is just
my attachment making up this ridiculous
story he's really a regular guy you know
he farts in the toilet in the morning
and all these things no no you don't say
that you say he is what you think he is
these delusions and this is quite
primordial as well the more we look into
our minds then more we see this
characteristic they make up a story and
then we believe that story and this is a
major way the Buddha is talking about
how come we suffer you know and this
whole deconstructing of our mind this
cognitive theory me I'm talking about is
very real at this level you know and
beings are intelligent we're brilliant
at it
we're reading this is that style that we
really like you know yeah go on
here we go just are you dying you want
to say okay please sir um I've been
exploring some of this fit closer to the
mic sweet huh yeah I've been exploring
this for a little while and when I first
started hearing about you know anger and
delusion my instinct was to well if I
felt angry I shouldn't so I'm not going
to that's exact what's what we
and and so that wasn't helpful right a
little so now I'm at the stage where
okay I'm angry I'm gonna deconstruct and
I'm gonna feel it there you go don't but
then what happens after that we don't
listen okay you're doing at the level of
feeling but that's still quite gross
you've what's fascinating about this
approach to the mind okay let's say we
have some people in this room no doubt
who I as a little girl would have called
a passive-aggressive then I'm a person
who's ain't a passive-aggressive believe
me I'm an active aggressive all right
now I knew as a little girl because I
was always want to cop the trouble I
knew the ones who are really looking
sweet I knew they were angry inside so
you get my point here so what I'm trying
to get is this let's say you're one of
the quiet people and you don't express
anger
so if but you know in your mind you've
got angry thoughts wouldn't you agree
with that so if you wrote those down and
then I and somebody had to just put the
mp3 player on me I wouldn't have to
write them down then you transcribe them
you're gonna have two bits of paper one
from a quiet person who doesn't express
with her mouth and one with a loud
person who does but you're not going to
see the difference are you they're both
a bunch of thoughts aren't they that's
where anger actually is okay my anger
harms others because I do verbal you
know but the real thing you try to get
into is to start to look beyond the
feelings darling that's just your body
to get to see the actual construction of
the thoughts of anger and they are
called how dare you this I hate you and
that's the part that's hard to hear
because it's so feeling level and it's
so physical for us and so deep down we
can't get to the point of deconstructing
the thoughts well sweetheart if you have
a series of misconceptions in your mind
like if you say I am wearing a blue
sweater if you say that about yourself
and we look there and we can see that's
a misconception wouldn't you agree what
would you do about that you change your
mind baby that's right that's as simple
as that it just is a lot longer to
deconstruct the thoughts and say I hate
you
and you are the cause of all my
suffering and I and because it goes real
subtle real deep based upon layers and
layers of assumptions it's a very
sophisticated process of deconstruction
but once you get your head around the
fact that it is conceptual and I'm not
I swear you're on the track of being a
Buddhist then whether you're clueless oh
I don't care who cares you know that's
what that's where the change is at the
level of changing the way we think but
you've got to have long-term patience
honey and you've got to be brave enough
and this is a scary part to learn to
love it it's like you've got to learn to
taste your own vomit and delight in it
and I'm really not joking here because
that's the scary part so we know we're
angry or depressed whatever it might be
then we hear Buddha says you shouldn't
be we go all tuk tuk tuk I'm a naughty
girl and then we add anger to the anger
we're angry about our anger and we think
that's being spiritual well that's
fundamentalism you know and look at the
spiritual world it's revolting a bunch
of maniacs you know that is not
spiritual darling you've got to have the
courage to know this is long ancient old
stuff you've got to have the courage to
own it and the respect for yourself to
know that it does not define you and
then the willingness to want to get in
there dive in deep and work with it
honestly I'm not kidding okay Buddha
didn't talk like this if you read
Buddhist stuff he doesn't talk like this
I'm talking like a westerner aren't I
but there's not a word here I'm saying
that it's not pure Buddhism it's just
this a different cultural way of saying
it that's all you've gots a major step
to make I am angry I am jealous but
guess what it ain't me and I can change
rather than the guilty nonsense that's
just self-destruction and it's appalling
and that's not spiritual Janice tan
there's a nice saying again we have when
we do this kind of practice in Buddhism
we say we talked about at the end of the
day you kind of check up you know and
you regret you kick the dog at eleven
o'clock and you killed your mummy at
twelve o'clock and you stole the money
at one o'clock
whatever you check back on your day but
you know what we have right now is oh I
did this and I did that and then we go
and I'm a bad person but no you say I
did do it but then you say what can I do
about it
that's the miracle I'm in a Martin
Luther King saying the same about anger
because this internal is like anger but
you're the object so instead of you know
what we do now is he did this and this
and then we say he this and how did that
we curse and swear right but no you must
point out fault it is wrong to drop
bombs it is wrong to harm people you see
the fault but then you say like Martin
Luther King said now what can I do
about it that's the action part that's
the responsible part that's the grown-up
one the one that says I'm bad or he's
bad is like taking no responsibility
it's like a little baby and that's where
we're sit this all we live in the
self-pity misery you know you understand
it's a major step but you got to catch
that voice
turn it around did you act up to you
darling
who else yes so I think you kind of
answered my question um but I guess I've
come at a place in my life where I've
accepted that death is part of life and
that there will be struggles and um you
know pain for everyone so how do you get
to that next stage where you find
happiness knowing that in part of life
Krishna this question of getting putting
getting used to it and that's I sware to
use the experience I'm having this last
12 years working with people in prisons
you know I mean I didn't ask for it to
happen I didn't sort of think now go to
prison you know I was editing a Buddhist
magazine when I was living down in Santa
Cruz the magazine of the organization
I'm part of and we got this letter from
this young Mexican guy he was 18 he told
me been in prison since he's 12 been in
gangs all his life you know from Los
Angeles he was in this prison called
Pelican Bay which is up just south of
Oregon and one of the main top security
prisons in this state and therefore this
country because this the state's the
best for prisons you know he submits the
only growth industry in California
someone told me recently um this guy had
been in this prison since he's been in
prison since he's 12 so since that time
we've had letters from we get letters a
thousand letters a month from people in
prison now we go to eight staff in San
Francisco 150 volunteers around the
world with office in Australia we've got
people in Mongolia Mexico Spain Colombia
and we mainly it's on the basis of
getting letters so about a thousand a
month and so we've contact will easily
15,000 probably more human beings in
prisons maybe in this country so it's
it's just this stunning experiential
example of exactly this point about how
as one lovely person said to me recently
how to find happiness where you don't
expect it so we think of happiness
usually as a pleasant joyful feeling
okay and that's nothing wrong but the
amazing thing is when we understand this
attitude you can learn as one tibetan
lama said it to like problems like you
like ice cream and it sounds nuts but
the first step is to accepting the
reality the death and change happens
said you can be thrown into prison
someone can wrongly accuse you that you
can get rate that you can get murdered
I mean life happens there's another
discussion about why but there's no time
for that here you know the borders deal
but the facing of the reality of this is
profound actually it means okay this is
how it is now let's see what I can do
about it that's the one
the angry voice says it shouldn't be
this way how dare it be this way why is
it this way it's wrong it's this way as
long as we have that interpretation of
it you will never ever ever be happy but
what I'm seeing about these these people
in prison amazing examples I'm trying to
make them all sound so holy you know
regular people but the scum of the earth
the bottom of our society most of them
have been in drugs and violence and
gangs and no family no friends no money
I mean unbelievable lives you know these
people have been meeting over these
years but I can't describe to you the
humility and the courage of so many of
them life sentences death row turning
themselves around recognizing this is
the reality I'm in this shithole excuse
me I will not get out alive very likely
now what can I do about it now let's see
what I can
now let's interpret it in a different
way the buddha's deal at the deepest
wisdom level is nothing has an inherent
nature as good or bad that's a shock to
us this is the meaning of emptiness in
Buddha and it's quite a profound view
you know that nothing is stuck in this
or that things have a relative reality
of good or bad you can't deny it but
finally it is how we interpret things
finally it's up to how we interpret so
we all know if you have a person who's
very angry everything will always look
ugly but another person is more tolerant
they see that they'll see the bright
side they'll see what we can do this we
can do that it's because their mind is
different and I'm seeing this with
people in prison and for me it is so
humbling I'm not in prison I'd go crazy
in some of these places you know they're
living in these violent insane asylums
and they're learning to become amazing
human beings and they're doing this job
that I'm talking about nothing holy
working on their minds changing the way
they interpret what's right in front of
them seeing the good seeing the
possibility seeing the opportunity
that's what I'm talking we can all do
that but just that we're such junkies to
get the nice tastes and smells and
touches we don't want to change our mind
cuz we can change anything with the
thick of a button there you know we're
such geniuses
you understand makes sense doesn't it
yes how do the people who you work with
in prison deal with I imagine there's
probably a very big stigma attached to
pursuing spirituality in such a violence
around in it is physical violence ever
an outcome of I'll decide you can't
imagine all the time so one guy in Texas
this guy who's got AIDS he's gay and
he's on crutches and he got brutalized
and beaten up by some gangster recently
you know he has to be in protective
custody there's so many stories like
this but on the other side there's many
wonderful stories too
yeah I mean someone have to be keep it
completely secret they all share cells
cuz in California the prisons are so
overcrowded just like a joke you know
that they have to keep your pretty
silent about all they might have a
roommate two inches above their head on
the top bunk you know who who purposely
shouts and has the radio on and farts
and does bad noises and abuses while the
guys try to do his practice so these
people live with the most intense things
staring them in the face you know and
they work with it I mean I'm blown out
by it you know I'm really humbled by I'm
the one telling what to do and they do
it I can't believe it you know really
it's incredible so humbling what human
beings are capable of when we are forced
to when there's a wake-up call it's
almost like their mantra this is my
wake-up call you know so yeah it's not
that easy for many on definitely
especially been in gangs this is
terrifying I'm in the gang I can tell
you I can keep you here for hours
telling you stories about gangsters you
know unbelievable culture in these
prisons and I beyond belief actually so
years very courageous they're
unbelievably courageous some of them you
know yep you have said many times that
this is a very difficult work and one
has to be persistent and courageous yes
what is the hardest thing about this
book changing your mind getting rid of
anger stopping believing what you're
seeing stopping believing that you're a
creep stopping believing that person's
really mean stopping believing that it
really is that bad
stopping believing the stories and the
lies that our unhappy states of mind
tell us that we are completely sucked
into that we think of as the truth does
that make sense that's what's hard I
mean it's
it to make ten hundred million dollars
is easy in comparison with this job but
it's the one job is that we don't do
nothing else is worthwhile and it's that
it's this is the emphasis of the
Buddhist one that our mind is ours and
no matter it is possible it's just that
we're stuck in these ancient views you
know that we believe as the truth so
it's once unit but any job it doesn't
matter even if you've got a map you
close you've got the map it doesn't
matter if it's a million miles you have
to walk you know there's an end to it
you know there's you're on a process
it's not hit and miss you've got that
you've got the technique and it's a
question of applying it that's what
gives you courage and confidence and
patience
whereas we tend to think of spiritual
practices kind of like hit and miss one
day you feel all blissful next day oh my
god I want to kill myself again we don't
think there's a method you know I'm not
being rude about the theistic religions
please believe me I'm an old Catholic
you know look it's not our job as a
Christian to deconstruct Christ's views
I mean I remember so what's his name
who's that bloke he's got MS he lives in
a wheelchair Stephen Hawking when he
wrote that he met the Pope and the Pope
thanked him for all his work up to the
Big Bang but he said don't go further
that's not your job that's God's job
well for the Buddha
it is our job there's nothing sacrosanct
being a Buddhist means getting our minds
in touch with reality it is our job to
deconstruct this dub it is our job to
see reality it's our job not anybody
else's but it's M as possible but it
says it's it's innate within us the
capacity do it so you get courage from
that and long term we all know practice
makes perfect
it's not hitting this yeah
to come back to your practical
instruction earlier you were speaking
about positive and negative things that
go on in our mind yes um and I've always
been wondering um you know how do people
decide what makes them happy and how do
we figure out which column something
should be in especially with something
like that you could be self deceived as
an example maybe alcohol that sometimes
it might be a positive thing and helps
it and you enjoy it and then it keeps on
a negative thing or it could be a
negative thing that you feel but it's
positive that's exactly um so how do you
go about characterizing some of these
more challenging Oh Oh thoughts and
invertible the object really isn't the
point it is the point of the attitude as
you're saying so the key thing in
understanding the Buddhist approach to
it is in this little kind of model we're
describing when you look first of all
establish that the characteristics of
the positive minds are - they are
peaceful feeling I don't mean gooey
peaceful I mean pleasant feeling not
paranoid not miserable
they're kind of harmonious feeling and
they are in touch with reality in the
sense that there's a sense of
interdependence which is how things
exist the negative qualities and this is
the point are in their nature
neurotic fearful and distorted in their
view of how things are so alcohol is not
the issue it's whether you're craving
and attached to it that is the one
called attachment which is this state of
mind that its energy is neediness it
assumes an unhappy eye it assumes an eye
that needs something to fill it up which
then causes us to hanker after that
object which causes to exaggerate the
deliciousness of the object which causes
us to manipulate to get the object which
causes us to expect that we'll get
happiness when we get the object all of
that is a characteristic of this
neurotic state of mind called attachment
it's multifaceted that's the cause of
suffering not the alcohol so if you have
if you don't have that then you could
have a taste of the alcohol feel
extremely blissful and you'll put it
down before you get out of control
there's no negativity there it's
positive does that make sense okay
yes go oh one more question okay time to
go one more question
um yeah I am listening so carefully to
how you describe this introspective
lifestyle and this kind of relentless
self analysis and looking at the
mechanisms for emotions and what you can
do about them that's right really
interesting I would and I subscribe to
okay ideas why hang it on Buddhism um it
seems to me I could almost create noise
to go with somebody else's words because
inside that pot again
jut watch stop that sit-ins from why
hang it why hang it on Buddhism what
does that mean um when you read somebody
else's past and somebody else's set of
ideas yes it can get it can be distorted
once once they've tried to describe it
and we get away ruling it in different
ways your own current of organic way of
getting there can be disturbed it seems
to me okay that's okay okay
did you go to school did you learn math
yes did you have a teacher who told you
about one-on-one is - yes well then you
know all the rest of the question right
here how dare you go and get someone
else's knowledge why didn't you follow
your own intuitive knowledge to come to
what one and one is two is I think you
already know that's ridiculous how
stupid and arrogant of you to think oh
I'm not gonna listen to somebody else
who's proved something to be true I'm
going to learn it myself
sweetheart if people have done it why
reinvent the wheel but if you're the
boss
you can read what Buddha says you think
about it if you've got a few cute ideas
that you think are useful then you thank
him but then you make it your own
knowledge whereas religion is believing
it and try to swallow it whole oh my god
that's a disaster your teacher doesn't
ask you to believe what I'm telling you
she says go check it out for yourself
and then you make it your experience so
why not use the knowledge of there's a
nice word intermittent Tenzin Dalai
Lama's name knowledge holder sweetie if
I want to learn music I would want to
find a knowledge holder
I will then get them to help me find
mine then I'll say goodbye to them
because now I've got it I think it's the
most intelligent way to learn anything
on this earth from wiping your little
bottom when your little girl to tying
your shoelaces to learning how to
be happy why not what do you think um I
I feel will anger you don't know if
you're angry at Oh tell me it's just uh
yeah you see in my eyes you'll see that
was smiling sweetheart but I'm I'm happy
analytically don't possible I wonder if
there's a line there I mean um a live
course was teaching it but there's also
um getting thrown off course that's not
the idea that's up to you you're the
boss
there is bucket loads of information out
there isn't there but you're the boss
darling
you're the boss and I think I mean it's
true what you're saying we have to
sometimes when we suck in everything
that everybody tells us and that's what
I'm hearing here we've got to be extra
cautious whom we listen to we've got to
really have the integrity to listen to
ourselves
to trust our wisdom you're absolutely
right so there is a line dead right
because some of us either swallow
everything everybody else says whole or
we're so arrogant we think we have to
reinvent the wheel it's it definitely is
a line between these two extremes
definitely and Buddhism's one of many
many different ideas um clearly yeah
please so choosing one seems that's your
business you decide exactly whom you
want to listen to your uh you are the
boss not Buddha he's just like Einstein
just a messenger
he's doesn't want you to believe in the
equals mc-squared but he's telling you
about it he's telling these findings and
he'll tell you the implications of it
then it's your call darling do you see
my point
yeah I understand thank you very much I
understand yours too and I can see your
eyes are smiling and so on mine is that
all we're done we're cooked Tom oh well
I'm feeling pretty cooked okay are you
guys feeling cooked okay
thank you so much for coming I want to
make a few quick announcements relevant
to the topic of today's talk
one is that soon there will be a
meditation space a dedicated meditation
space opening in the new all's of
buildings we've worked hard on that for
the last little while and it's finally
come to fruition and Google is one of
the first companies in the world to make
that happen so good for you and good for
us second is that the happiness and it's
causes conference they will be held to
support the liberation prison project I
show you the commercial why don't you
let me do the commercial I don't need
the mic oh that's quick I'll be like one
second ok ok yeah yeah but but you
should use the mic because there are
some folks oh oh you might I might get I
just yeah ok you know one of the things
is quickly that I've been over the years
since I've been doing this Buddhist
stuff you know I've learned to really
dislike the begging mentality I can't
stand this kind of nonprofit begging the
same entitlement and sitting there like
I'm kind of waiting people to give you
money I mean I'd like to be an
entrepreneur I think so I become this
sort of I've become like an entrepreneur
in my old age it's very funny being a
Buddhist nun this is the point for you
so I kind of thought years ago I thought
well what works in the West it's called
Commerce I mean if you know you I asked
you for five dollars you're going to be
really reluctant to give it but if I
give you a really delicious cake and
coffee and then charge you seven and
keep five you don't mind at all so my
feeling is we understand this in our
culture you know we understand commerce
really well so you give me what they
want to make them real happy and I'm not
being cynical then they're very happy to
give you their money so we've got a
little Buddhist book cafe at our Center
we got all these kind of plans then last
year I was in Sydney and my colleague
there Tony thank you very much
he's uh he's got his own company at a
half billion dollar company worldwide
that runs conferences and he runs our
Center in Sydney
so he started a couple of conferences
there as a means of bringing in people
to and bring in the dollars of course
you know and it's quickly started - one
is called happiness and it's causes and
one is called mind and its potential
well you know the one last year Djalma
was one of the speakers and I happened
to be there two and three and a half
thousand people came and he weighed 1.2
million dollars for the central I
thought oh hell I've got to do this in
San Francisco
I thought this is fantastic cuz you
can't you people come to Buddha's
centers but like three and a half people
come you know and they put maybe three
dollars in the bowl and you don't want
to beg more from them but you know for
these conferences you can kind of charge
more and I'm not being cynical about it
so we've got this great conference forty
people some of the best brains you know
psychology philosophy we've got
musicians we got our artists we've got a
dancer this gorgeous woman in New York
who uses she's uses her own company to
go into women's shelters using movement

guy andre who's a youth mentor minority

into prisons there for us his son was
murdered in january and he's in tears of
compassion for this boy who killed his
