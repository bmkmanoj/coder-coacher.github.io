today that this talk will be and the
reason why it was interesting to me is
that I'm a sort of computer history buff
and I do a lot of research on the side
you know like on things that happen in
software through the years and don't
promote one thing that in this store has
really struggled it was a destroyed my
imagination is that right if you think
about it like the PC revolution i
believe was really kicked by the
spreadsheet and the spreadsheet hasn't
really changed that much in in all these
I'd say 30 years or so and mr. services
talk deals with the spreadsheet as a new
metaphor for users in organizing
services and and not only services I
would say but more generally organizing
data on the web and giving users a tool
which they could use to organize those
and you know I give some more some
semantic meaning to to some of the
things that are in the web and that we
are trying sometimes too deep crawl and
and gather what they mean but sometimes
we're not so successful in doing that so
I'm going to leave you with Professor
service you will give you this lecture
and please give him a hand thank you
thank you very much since Boris
introduce me it's my turn to introduce
the rest of team young colleagues which
are working with me on this project and
although it's my second visit and second
talk at Google some of these younger
guys have much more experience with
Google than myself even spent a couple
of months here working a summer intern
and Miroslav and Daniel they are sitting
over here they are wintering in terms
now working with Google nowadays here so
these are people who are working with me
first of all from my experience it's
very important let's say a good sense of
humor based on knowledge of an analogy
of situation is very important for
success on the project and it's very
important for create creativity here one
of such analogy which came up during
this research was about Pinocchio and
Geppetto his father Geppetto and it's so
amused us so I want to share this with
you to make this presentation more
interesting and some of these fragments
from this story we will use you know to
make this presentation more picturesque
as our main motivation is that we think
that human intelligence is very
important in the process of composing
web services into the web proposing
services the web processes although all
other research is going another way they
were working on semantic web and they're
working on the process of automation of
composing these services into the web
processes we think that we want to build
a tool which will be appropriate for
end-user to build web processes by
composing these services but the
question is that it's very tough
challenge why because we as we already
know that what is facing nowadays
software industry when we are talking
about multi-core processors we know that
processes which are inherently
distributed and parallel it's very
difficult even for professional
programmers which have formal education
in parallel programming to build such
processes here we are faced with the end
users which actually do not have
experience even in some basic
programming and we must build
which will be appropriate for them to
build web processes which are highly
distributed player and in parallel in
their nature so when we think about that
and a year ago when we have talked here
we find out that what we called before
simple service composition language
which is script language and even this
language could be you know very tough
for these users so we think what should
be the environment look like that this
end users can program these processes so
we think that spreadsheet and gadgets
and we mix up these two things you can
build a environment design environment
which could be very nice for use in for
end users so I will talk about idea what
and how you can measure up the gadgets
and spreadsheet and build such kind of
environment next May part of
presentation I will talk about what is
behind that gets complicated composition
and we'll talk a spreadsheet oriented
execution environment which is based on
service-oriented architecture and how
the with what kind of architecture we
should use as we find out that mostly
service-oriented architecture are not
appropriate for very large or scalable
environment and how should we change
that service composition architecture to
fit our demands for efficient execution
of such gadget composition or web
processes at the end of the presentation
the best way will be to conclude this
presentation about new possible business
models based on gadget composition so
all of us know that internet wireless
network sensor networks mobile ad hoc
networks are converging into the unified
communications service infrastructure
and that through visualization we will
be able to control different kind of
appliances
use different kind of services like this
one which will use in this presentation
as example and probably this
virtualization will affect all human
activities very soon and which will
force the end user to combine existing
services and processes in order to
create personalized composite processes
but we face the challenge how this in
inherently distributed and concurrent
processes should be you know designed
and question is what kind of user user
interface we should use what kind of
programming environment what kind of
distributed architecture and distributed
technology so we find out that maybe
gadgets will be the answer for user
interfaces maybe spreadsheets will be
the prom appropriate programming
environment which is widely accepted for
4 from end users and we think that
service oriented architecture and web
services are technology which will
enable composability and
interoperability of such distributed
processes what I will talk about is
Geppetto we call that it come from
gadget programming a gadget composition
programming tool that will be our vision
how this design environment should look
like how the programming environment
that is husky it is another analogy it's
about you know husky dogs which are tied
together to slide the jagged / and so
the service company you know services
are tied together to prefer to you know
construct new to enable new
functionality so that is our environment
for execution of services not think
about services like web services think
about services as basic components from
which you build your oven application
web services are just technology which
are used to be interoperable at the end
this stands for
service composition architecture is it
is our we define new very efficient
compositional attraction in order to
execute this gadget composition okay so
first of all let me explain what we
think about what we think about what
means gadget compositions just imagined
we are going to do some content
personalized page like which you know
personalization we perform is through
selection of gadgets let's say for
example Google personalized homepage and
then you go to the directory and then
you can find there a lot of gadgets and
let's imagine that we have two gadgets
which will use here for bookstore and
four different bookstore gadgets so you
can use this bookstore gadgets and you
can choose another one which we will
allow you to answer the question which
will be the best offer from these two
bookstores so how it works you just type
in the titles of the books you get the
price from another bookstore and from
another and then you retire this you
know offers and you can calculate the
best offer here we see that this is not
convenient for use because you type you
know all of this you pee twice type the
title you you press this free start
buttons and it's take a huge time so
question is can be arranged this free
gadgets in just one gadget and perform
that as a one gadget and built you know
a new gadget as composition of existing
gadgets status the mine idea so what we
think that you can catch a one-week all
that black blank gadget we call that
Pinocchio it does not have any inputs or
outputs does not have any logic behind
that
it just is blank gadget now you should
define a new gadget as look as
composition of existing one so how can
you do it first of all you must define
interfaces so what I inputs and outputs
the gadget it's the analogy like you
know Geppetto start from pile of wooden
parts and assembled you know Pinocchio
we start from blank gadgets from blanket
and some existing gadgets and built new
gadget so first of all we will put the
name of the gadget and then by using
Jack and drop we can put input as a book
title best offer as result and what will
be the start button ok now we defined
what will be the input and output and
how you start the gadget but you needn't
define how that gadget will work so what
we need as a second and the third step
to define is to define a sequence of
events what will be performed during the
execution of this you know get best
offer you know event and we must define
the data flow how this data flow you
know coming back and forward between
these two these free gadgets and compose
gadget so we find out that we could do
that by using spreadsheet spreadsheet in
each cell of the spreadsheet we could
put your defined one of the event and so
when you put all of these events you
must put them in some temporal ordering
so like why temper ordering that will
define how the gadget will work so
that's another analogy like Geppetto use
these strips you know to move the
Geppetto so here we will put the events
in some ordering how they will perform
during the securing discompose engaged
and we define this temporal temporal to
the dimension which which said that time
is going you know from up to down
or floor lamp from left to the right we
can do in any in any of this you know
shakes we within each sequence well if
two neighboring cells you know occupy
occupied these two events are performed
in in in order in each so that the whole
workspace is is splitted in event
sequences which are temp temporary
independent is each sequence gets its
local time which is aligned with the
cells be you know within itself so here
this sequence has sticks from a1 a2 a3
a4 and a5 well there are some events
like we could you know control this
local clock by setting you know
unconditionally which will which will
force this sequence to loop you know
indent indefinitely and we can use
conditional events for conditionally you
know so you can conditionally set that
local clock if here he stated if results
of executing this event in l.a 12 is
true then this event in cell c 12 will
not be executed okay so now we have idea
how the events are ordered in time
within the spreadsheet so how will look
you know that our composite gadget so it
start to be the get best get best offer
that is from our composed gadget start
button what will happen is that first of
all the book title which will typed in
in that compose gadget here so these are
events what will put this will what we
title we are not typed in and as a book
title at my books that is composed
gadget will be transferred to the book
title of foo books that will be retyped
in transport here so the next one will
be that will be transferred the same
parameter will to the bar books and then
we will perform get price get price
event
at foo books and get price event at bar
books and then the results of that
execution you know that price which goes
from foo gooks will go to the first
price at best offer it will be
transferred to this one and the second
one price and then we will have you vent
get best offer from best offer gadget
and at the end we will transfer to these
results to our composed gadget so this
is how that will look sequentially but
if you have more experience you know
programmer or end user you can rearrange
these events and put these two events
you know split get price and get price
at foo books and bar books in separate
sequences which means here that that
will be executed in parallel which means
that will reduce the response time so
you can actually very nicely program the
parallel or concurrent events by you
know splitting them in separate
sequences so now we have our you know
compose gadget is ready for use which
means that you can just type once the
title of the book and then you can find
out the best price and will be executed
like all existing gadget so we started
with gadgets as just user interfaces to
services but what we find out after
research we did that gadgets are not
just user interfaces gadgets are the top
level basic building blocks of
distributed applications you know it
start from object component services and
on top of that you have gadgets so
gadgets are something which is the top
on a service-oriented architecture so
too smooth you know the transition from
gadget composition to service
composition what we want present here is
human centered and spreadsheet oriented
service composition environment which we
call husk what means that here we spread
that let's say the event sequence which
is defined in spreadsheet on the top
level which we call gadget composition
is translated into spreadsheet which
defines the service-oriented
service-oriented execution of this
gadget and a year ago I present it to
languages one is this one simple service
composition language which is script
language which is used for service
composition and another is oops I'm
sorry on that another is Python which is
extension of Python language with the
libraries which enables to write very
efficient service composition operations
like communication and like
synchronization and SH ok so let me
explain how this will go step-by-step
this gadget composition events will
translate it into the service
composition so here we have Blue Fairy
which brought binocular the life they
actually service composition bring our
gadget composition to life by executing
in distributed environment ok so
although this relationship between
gadgets and services could be complex
and sophisticated or for this for the
beginning we will assume that behind
each gadget there will be just one
service so let's imagine that behind foo
books is service which is defined edit
this page foo book.com page which
perform this logic of that gadget and
what will happen here that this getprice
event at gadget will become will be
turned into the gate price operation
which is executed on a one and A one is
service definition so we here see that
beside events we have service
definitions as well as part of our
spreadsheet you know what we put in our
spreadsheet so at the same we have
service behind bar looks and this event
is turned into the execution of
operation get price on a service which
is defined in a to sell so we have as
well for best offer service and we have
event which is execute operation at
service defined in a free sell an
operation get best hope so decide these
services in order to perform in
distributed environment we need some
additional services one of this is input
service which provide mechanisms for
typing in the book title so this service
is not with we could not see that on
gadget level but this is actually what
we need in order to run that gadget so
what will happen here is that we will
execute input to enable typing in the
title and then we need a need third one
we have another kind of services which
is not visible are these services will
enable communication between this event
sequence which are temporarily
independent so one of this mechanism
could be Q and what will happen after
execution on a to e to service execute
is after execution of this e to sell
will actually have the value of book
title so we need to chat
for this book title to the services bar
books and and foo books so we will
transfer that through this ques so we
will first of all put whatever is result
in e2 to C 4 and C 4 is it is is a cube
and the same time we will put the same
one title to another field here we have
we should first of all get that book
title so get from c4 and then we should
use that as a parameter when we ask what
the price of this book is the same is on
the other side we should get the title
of the book from g4 and then execute it
like after execution the event in you
know g6 that g6 will will have value of
the type so we have a not we need
another Q you know to communicate
between these two sequences and the last
one so we must put the results of
execution of this get prices which will
be the prices and do that in the queue
in the file in e8 and then we could use
that to prices and start execution that
service which used at two parameters and
choose the best offer which could then
be transferred to the hour as results
through that output service so we go
through step by step and now we have
something which is fully defined in
service oriented architecture so now we
are using we actually have tool which
translate that in Python code which
could be executed in distributed
environment well there are some other
communication mechanisms like kliebert
it's here efficiently to use kliebert
because you can just put the value in
kliebert once which will replace the old
one but what is nice you can read it
multiple times but now if you use
kliebert you must synchronize these two
sequences we will use tokens center
which actually contains some number of
tokens if there is no tokens like here
we initially put zero tokens we will
guard the execution the execution of
these two sequences by get talking so if
there is no talking the sequences will
not be able to execute and that the last
return talk and count to puts to talk
and see that token center which will
then enable the execution of all of this
gadget there are another kind of
services we can use one of them is
broken center here we have gadget which
a user user driven so user is typing in
and typing the start button to find out
the results here in broker center will
be event-driven so this will be done by
event here the broker center is
published subscribe mechanism which we
extend with the third party in
communication these are brokers brokers
are spare custom design services which
you know the subscribers sent some kind
of announcement and will publish service
publish announcements and subscribers
you know subscribe with terms so the
broker Center analyze what is announced
according to the terms and if terms is
this announcement satisfies the terms
then it triggers the execution of the
sickness so here up we have two
publishers one a subscriber
and one service for as a broker service
so here will that gadget will provide
new prices each time it's change even
you can put what prices are you
interested in so there is no need for
user to do this stuff so okay let's go
back to our previous first example and
now is question how this will be
executed in distributed environment okay
so here as we all know that the we all
know about coordination based
architecture it has two element
functional elements it has computation
elements and coordination elements so we
extend this architecture to have three
tires we have interaction elements as
well and this intellectual elements they
provide communication synchronization
and other mechanisms so here if we see
that Geppetto that our gadget has free
type of function elements this event
sequence are actually coordination
coordination elements we have this queue
which our interaction elements at the
end we have services which are
computation elements so to execute this
in this tributed environments we must
somehow schedule these functional
elements to the host machines of the
distributed systems in order to do that
first of all we must map these elements
to the services and then services are
scheduled to the host machine so the
distributed systems here there is no
restriction how you schedule service to
host machines but mostly nowadays
service composition architecture
constraint how can you map dysfunction
elements to the services okay they are
free well known as it Texas one based on
orchestration another on choreography
and the last month's are on multi-agent
systems some in orchestration
all interaction and coordination
elements are bapt to the single service
which coordinated activities of this
computation services and that is how is
restricted in orchestration however in
multi-agent system this interaction
elements are separate in separate
services and our coordination and
computation elements constitute
autonomous engines however in
choreography these international
elements are part of communicating
services and and this is how is
restricted so we think that the best way
will be there is no restriction so we
can map all of these services all
functions to separate services so since
all other architectures constrain
elements the service mapping while this
new architecture does not does not have
anything it does not have any
constraints so the best results for our
architecture cannot be worse than the
best results for any other architecture
and we we run some experiments with
different applications and we measure
the execution time of this application
here is one of this application is just
pattern it models better and producer
performers and consumer okay so if we
put that in the graph where we show how
the number of course machines affect the
execution time of distributed
application ok we find out that two
things since that we could our
architecture provides more flexibility
in another architecture so for any given
number of hosts machines our
architecture will give much much better
results than other architects and
another key point is that since we could
each function element
scheduled to separate its map to the
separate service and can be scheduled to
a separate machine then we could
distribute it you know the definition of
gadget to more to the most you know more
machines than other architecture could
do which could do additional increase in
performance what we did up to now is
that we have pi which stand for
programmable internet environment tool
and you can on this page you can access
this tool and use this tool which
translate this simple service
composition language into the CL
language this we called competition
language which is actually the mix
between it uses two languages it is
verbal language and visual language to
enable mobility of our coordination
elements and we interpreted this C
language by translating in c-sharp
another tool what we built is husky tool
which could be accessed from this page
which translate this husky spreadsheet
into the python python is it sixties
extension of Python language it has a
special library which enables that send
received message all of these operations
to do very efficiently ok and we are
pretty end of this presentation so what
we present here is husky is end user
environment which enable very efficient
compositional services into the person
as web processes and it is the first one
system based on spreadsheet and we had
dimension time dementia to spreadsheet
which enable intuitive expression of
concurrency and non determinism we
defined a new free tire service
composition architecture which provide
more granularity and which enable
flexibility in scheduling call function
elements to the host machines which
increases both performance in scalable
and what is more important is that it's
a firm foundation for end-user gadget
composition and if you have end user
gadget composition you actually can
person personalized gadgets for
end-users and they can do that by
themselves which will increase the
number of gadgets and the number of our
users and this is very you know it it
could be very interesting to see how the
new business models will show up with
this gadget development providing
hosting and application so it was very
short what we did on this research now I
am expecting some questions I don't want
to lose you know much time of explaining
how this works if you have any questions
I will be very happy to answer you
they're my condo thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
