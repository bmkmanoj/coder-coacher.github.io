about these two terms data compression
and textual web what I mean just to put
on everything in context so data
compression you all know you open every
book you find the space-saving
transmission cross which are these are
the rich dividends of data compression
more recently people are talking about
speed in the sense that you won't
exploit vector the memory hierarchy of
computers and even more recently and
what I like more are these two points of
data compression one is energy saving
because you are reducing your CPU time
your disk your machines your resources
and therefore you can go to save
energies and there are some studies
about this and also interesting enough
is the reduced burning out of sector in
solid state disks if you write less you
consume less which is a big problem in
this device okay these are the good
parts the bad part is that you need to
the compress and the compression is
costly and obviously you need to find a
trade-off and every time someone asked
me what you want to do with data
compression they I always reply with the
questions what are your requirements
because according to your requirements
that can possibly tell you what is it a
possible search not the right solution
there is no only grave it's a possible
solution and so this is data compression
in pills I I want to do to investigate
data compression in the context of
textual work why textual web so it's a
little bit strange to make this top here
but anyway you know so anyway you want
you want to starve the row pages I want
to store the row pages because you can
generate Nick pizza or because you want
to implement just the link like Ashley
in these two cases you need different
things because for generating snippets
you need you can mean need only the text
the textual part of the web page while
in the other parts you need the entire
page so the Rope page so and the but if
you look to the literature there are
very few papers as far as I know
regarding the compression
ropings and in the context of the web so
one point one step would be okay let's
go to the your favorite I our group
these are the books that are using my
aging lectures and you look inside these
books and you try to find solutions for
this problem so I'll to store tech
documents which are actually not real
documents because they have some
fracture we are HTML and you will find
many trade-offs and in the history of
software at least as far as I'm
concerned with the known softwares okay
so the one that you can download for the
next there are these two approaches
mainly and I will come back to what your
colleagues are doing on BigTable in the
next flight but as far as academia is
concerned software based on either GT or
awkward awkward is the classic Hoffman
in which your alphabet is given by Wars
so it's a variation that exploits better
the structure of the face so very basic
things which are very far from what is
the day let's say the state of the art
in data compression and so this is what
people are implemented kinga regularly
and I say that this is a story this
story was born some years ago when
people came to me and dusted okay but
what you can do people okay you can
imagine from work but what you can do
about where data and I asked okay what
you are able to do on this web page I
just understand that what is the margin
improvement and the number that I heard
was twenty percent okay this was a sort
of folklore a number going around in the
web community and they are said too many
people around and it's in at this number
which for me was a large number okay so
I said oh come on something Frank is
going and so it stayed in my mind for
some months and I therefore decided to
start to look in another person because
it's my approach to every problem in the
sense let's see what other people are
doing because I don't want to rediscover
the hot water so there are
other objects that people have
compressive so there is the web graph
there are some colleagues of mine in
Milano Stefano Stefano Sebastian OV and
alle volte the show al to compress the
web ruffled k in 1.3 with the reg which
is pretty small and more recently other
people coming from you who showed how to
compress the thicker block in 10 times
more but it's still a small is less than
1 Giga bytes then if you were to
inverted list the Bessey block cover
every search engine you look to the most
recent papers published by Sewell group
in New York you find the ratio that goes
from around let's save one percent hey
document IDs just document aggies if you
want to store also the term positions
you jump and you jump over factor seven
so you go to seven percent this is no
numbers okay so numbers that you find in
the literature and okay so these are two
objects and as you can see it is much
less than twenty percent okay these are
the different object than raw pages but
yet these numbers are smaller then in
CGI our 2007 we investigate the problem
of work impressive victories and we go
to erase a range of sixteen forty four
percent clearly 44 is larger than 20 but
in that case we were offering much
powerful operations so we were able to
search for prefix suffix of something so
more stuff was inside be here so if you
look to these numbers you realize that
okay twenty percent possibly is the
right number but the on other web the
objects people were able to do much less
so probably there is room for
improvement and so my consideration was
that folkloric possibly says that is
twenty percent just because people use
of the basic oppressors vanilla
compressors and possibly you can do
something more
and so I think that my decision to work
on this problem came before of three
reasons because if you want to apply it
to approach this problem in a principled
way we have to look to data compression
literature and to use the best that
exists in that a confession literature
and one of the basic blocks that
actually had a big impact in the
community and the last 15 years were
dedicated to this transform is the
support virus in wheeler transform in
the year two thousand five together with
other people we published the paper in
journal of ACM in which we actually
proposes something more powerful the
sense we show that the transform is a
booster we evaluated the mathematical
properties of this transformer and the
the big morale was that you can achieve
entropy bounds which are much better
than the gzip bounds so mathematically
the virus will transform is more power
then since I'm jumping back and forth
from practice I decided to implement
this stuff and we implemented this this
pool which we call it the booster is
open source so you can download from the
neck and we are achieved very good
performance so I've seen that was also
good in crowd so this was one basic
block after six years from barsema
transform in the context of data
compression with either a very big stack
in the sense that we propose it to the
community what is called the compressed
data structure a compressor data
structure and here this is again another
journal evasion paper of the same year
two thousand five and the compressor
that are actually few words is the
following you give me your data I'm able
to build a data structure that occupies
the space which is proportional to the
entropy bound of the data so in some
sense is optimal in an information
theory in a sense and still you are able
to search in this data structure in
optimal time to reticle optimal time or
fuzzy optimal
and now they're our hands of papers
about this idea and i will come back in
the second part of the top because as i
said is a story so i will touch many
many stop then you're the paper from
your colleagues there is some repetition
six years over six years there i read
the big table paper and in particular i
was interested in a column that was
referring to the compression of the
pages and i was surprised because they
were using a very simple scheme so they
use it the ventolin material room which
actually allows you to find a longer to
say repetition at long distances is a
very easy way but they use it as a
booster in some sense because they
virtually larger the window of gdp which
is more and they pop they these were
just one line saying the valiant redneck
beer or a plus GG that's all and then
the road to the numbers are eleven
percent in space and the decompression
speed was really amazing was up to 1 gig
of experts now these are three basic
blocks and I thought that if I wanted to
investigate to the web compression in
the right way I should consider these
three basic blocks but when you want to
scale to the to the web there are many
problems which are not practical the
first problem ah ok just mention one
person in the group of people
implementing the table was Mike burrows
witcha got the exactly the same virus of
a borough singular transport I had a
chat with Mike because because I know
him very well about can you tell me more
I'm doing this kind of paper just tell
me more because I don't want to publish
books and I couldn't get more I told him
and my approach and say okay go ahead I
didn't understand if to other the say
okay go on but anyway I will tell you
and my numbers are not far from their
numbers except for one one point that I
have a justification so as I say there
are questions and the big the first big
question is how to build a huge bar
sangria transform I know that Stefan
worked in it
and I will be back on this so is a big
problem because algorithmic problem
because actually the virus angular
transform is a permutation and the
granularity of the fermentation is the
single character so if you want to build
a bar singular transform of 1 gigabytes
it which is more it means that you need
to permute one billions items okay and
you cannot spend even one integer per
item because it would be four times the
size of you so immediately explodes okay
then there is a question about
compressor thicknesses and here I need
to spend some words so when you work
with GT and compressor what we can do is
to take urine you split into blocks and
you compress every clock so when someone
asks you for a pH what you need to do is
to the compressor blog pages it should
become a trade-off the larger is the
block the batteries your compression but
on the other hand you're floating their
freedom in compresses of indexes this
was iterating over X truth because what
we were able to show is that you can
achieve they all came up compression but
you have no history because the
defaulting at least to it so you need to
decompress five bites you pay something
proportional body ok in theory so what
happens in the web content when you use
with these two so it's natural for this
way the third point will infect ok there
for people paper there were no details I
couldn't sleep after i as a good
addition i got me then we three were
using GT it seems that gzip basic
compressors are not forget so i decide
to start again so this is the scenario
is that of you this is a story and in
fact what happened was that we decided a
new way of professing a you are
transferring these
be sure that you refer to is also tied
in with you supporter then we add
library which it succeeds open only stop
live in Okinawa the beets in Chile and I
will be back next is the way of
compressed it's a network thing I
supervised so today it would and the
other problem actually scored 23 of a
person should become very very funny
that we deal with something I will be
back just for being so this was the
story of one this is this to say that
this is not an operating I would not
believe lyrics and it's a little bit
part entire story ah hydrophilic
Manafort says I promised it to some of
you there will be variation numbers a
lot more and awfully give you some hints
picture of work she was like so as I
told you in order to make these things
with a web so sluggish she wants first
of all collections obviously i cant
pretend again so i needed be collections
for the collection for academia work
Scooby Doo terabytes of data was a UK's
membership available for people from the
download is largest of all about me and
then I do love to which is a classic
data and then I consider a few scenarios
one scenario i hold these space which
actually means that you won't impress
your data for example they have five
and then you want to the compress the
data stream the other complex was email
recompression in the sense that you
shouldn't at all your data BTW you want
would be very popular person one page
okay so two extremes of these then we
took i think of the largest as far as in
all sense of compression on roofs and
all of them are fully explained in the
paper and all of them are available so
there is no hiding no he didn't and
actually we are one representative
premium support if you are I'll divided
hearing tomorrow fits glossy paper fans
plus it means that they are very
formidable it says that my GP pro Kadima
they compress small businesses okay so
they can take advantage over tuition
which are very close TT plus and then
there are advancing compressors that use
larger so like LG ma which is a bargain
booze then be mi casa too deep is the
big table let's say my simulation and
the booster is the best deteriorated
he's getting out to vote very large and
then there is a very subtle which is
pager over so depending on what you can
pick up nearly this equation changes so
for example in the big table paper they
assume it we consider all possible
scenarios in a sense that either you
don't have missed or your people people
depends on your bed in your software
your village and in order to deal with
the facility we considered again two
extremes either you have the booster
which allows you to stay let's say
unbounded is not only means able to take
let's say 50 gigabytes a
to compress all 50 / back together so
let's say and this is useful because the
approximates the gate of the rain should
be so tells you something about it a bit
tall they need to make compressibility
okay but there is another approach you
say okay this is like a kalu Ruby why
don't you just relieve your pages and
then we use the compressors reduce
consider smaller box because actually
you try to put together pages which are
very menus and then you don't need their
logical the only there are many
permutations even enter and leave the
professional problem here what you are
actually doing within the district you
say okay we might actually have not one
source of day usually directed muchas
cosas so when your permit in huge blocks
you are actually approximatively
distribution like a sound of distant
friend distributions so in the question
here is how to find the best
partitioning so soon that I believe the
data so what does she do two pages
together chief edges together fenna 10
megabytes of pages working this is not
the lisa paper options and actually
provides a lady so we provide an
efficient flavor funny
so this is the G main parts we didn't
test
now so i will tell you two numbers let
me start with these days of its basic
scenario so straining weight when you
want to T&amp;amp;C the best possible and here i
will see there is next shot of 50 big
bucks because we leave a huge amount of
experience or every experiment a lot not
just five nations what is nice is that
if you take the class on first so you
find a book oregon so the full quarter
number was correct is it for crowing
stops so 20 per second and in the
compression speed on our machine with
jasper is very 7770 mega particles so
the question is that what you've been
referred to so if you take the booster
which is the state of the art in theory
look a big jump so taking for example
off of 200 megabytes you can go up to
file the tech initial speed is low but
there is no surprise marcy wheeler jumps
it's not patient patient nation so open
it so not surprising is very good
numbers so what is not interesting for
me is the five percent of compression
ratio let block size because actually
tells me there is much repetitiveness
act with a small distances because
wanted megabytes are not much so Keith
are able to look at water Megan are
people achieve the Pipers which is four
times better than the classic then even
though the reefs have so much
repetitiveness why don't explore it
later so we tested LTA which is open
indeed is effects it was really person
because he is able to achieve even
better than the booster so around five
percent and the compressor speed was
almost the same d the concern is very
often you'll be but then just the GT
quick impression so just go he's a
little bit smaller because they come
open for asus is a little bit for
company but 1850s marching and so these
both of us a critical problem which is
the only people give a talk with the gb
present professor are actually go to
social phase one is Carson and the other
is the including praises it go feat the
coffee is expressive like this stuff
like so you have been integers I'll do
you encode your images and the lgm a
proposed to the very nice basically so
our theoretical questionable before we
assume that that gives you the integer
orders the depression quarters what is
the best phrase bus so typically people
ask where the part series which files
the minimum number of races but is not
true because if you minimize the number
of phases it may be the case that you
are talking a very long place which is
very very far so what made a lot of it
whereas it be much cheaper to divide
these braces into let's say two small
and phrases which are very good so it is
not necessarily true that the meaning
barks finger is the best one when you
consider the horror of number of Easter
we investigated this program to Italy
and you have an optimal solution that is
not excavated then the next question was
what are our big day for approximation
is it it's very good so we got seven
dress clearly this is not the eleven
percent that they claim it just because
people lectures from the believer I have
our child of collection dark abyss
little chilly because I just because
they want to have to open suse flops I
took the occasion by gently take us in
just two together so very easy so these
get senators in the neck infusion speed
it's not today one gigabytes per second
at the word planning just because there
is a lot of a great leaping Jeter in
there I'm sure and in this case they are
very simple so what about taking with
you Marcy wheeler transform so use the
commune and use the pool first form over
device so we did it and what four
percent so this is about one percent
better in the healthcare and you can
look to his number in two days one ways
that do is sleep the other way is that
lzma is very good because they're just
looking at four megabytes 400 megabytes
almost like so finding the good encoders
or praises DC lato then if you've got
larger collection you even get better it
back because you can reach 2.8 person
operation which is 1.6 context all so if
you want just to keep the text of the
web page which you think is third so
it's about 250 arcs like them
now then you ask yourself what about
from you why what I show you the huge
sorta because it's the most interesting
people in favor with music so give you
source according to urls you get
something which was expected but i think
is more than it actually you are able to
use the smaller box but you are also
going to include the compression she's
early 3.8 is less than a huge part sugar
so it seems that there are in true there
are named services and so building that
customizes models / groups is very very
good and it is a very brute force boxing
because I just drop in the pieces of
their neighborhoods if you chop to using
hot place and groups this is still
better are people so the same is true
for n zi ma you may use the smaller so
this is the best for dr. or to the
committee human area to the columns
needed you are even better in larger
windows or three points and what is
impressive impressive these are at
permitting and applying adhesive
powdered you get fighter self which is
pregnant so I think mrs. you the
solution does take these blocks it
implement that you get x percent which
is four times better so in some sense he
said we did sort of foundation of their
choice if the simple way or you can
track all the payoffs it most of you
have room for you maybe you will give
you the soundness our terms of deep
now it's not really person I wanted to
cause me these numbers give me questions
posed the question different version a
topology the booster was the most women
can be the dress until we see that is
not to actually are we comparing the
different but not much what we can learn
concluded is that 3.8 is better than the
collection party it up with me so as I
said before it is better to renew and
partition all the partition involves
Albertans a paper tells you and so the
other point is that if you randomly
permute the pages so you we struck the
all recognitions depending on the text
and in some sense you keep only
variation of HTML which are and the
booster is really low dose which the
better compressor achieves about papers
so there is a lot of repetition of all
of things and these actually tells you
that you regularly who've algorithm if
the most of us one does not give you any
surprises random pages LCA nature
then you basically loop so if you can
sort your data you need to find it here
for you are you are if you are another
conflicts like social networks we are
not URL for looting there is effective
like something for show so you need to
party and actually is effective as
vertically now at this point that we
have these numbers the question is that
absolutely I want to build by myself a
search engine you see what is known in
the literature so what is the relation
between the two things is to charge the
unix bar and the storage pod to chart a
pages so seeds in the noticer all these
numbers are not comforted I wanted to do
this comparison just to see there are be
different and here director surprising
because the first line so the first line
here is what you think the numbers that
have shown you before so the best
numbers six percent is something either
get cold visited and 3.8 is something
that you can bet you can get a user and
this is the numbers of sewer later still
asked dr. robert point 1.5% nobody's
only looking 0.85 or cell phone users so
if you consider the jam from 6 to 3 of
10 48 we find the same time one from 65
to some something like a image and what
is more interesting is that they jump in
storing the darkness in a heartbeat it's
not a factor to it it was assured the
beginning are you for it what is a
factor for technique is not very much so
keeping the entire page takes you more
evolved apart then what is great
is the hole that if you're eNOS must
answer place winners for Christmas
unique purposes and apparently the
literature tells you that you need seven
person and what is surprising is that is
a seven percent is larger than six
percent or even double of Cheaper
senator so people know how people press
third position was and what they belong
to the resonators a pages complete more
information because the page gives you
everything so I think that varies
function for improvement third position
is logical position and in fact aight
cya our master is another favorite by
the sewer group addresses the spoken
about there's no is indeed jumping now
this is the second part so what you can
do about even with impression and let me
let me be with special my system
remember that they call to them these
are basically two blocks so you can take
you there and you can compress it you
can keep in the oppressor space the
original vehicles and both of them are
evolved to the Big O great you can feel
your paypal efficient so actually many
times this is often so this was proposal
involves two thousand and we originally
call it in a strange way so we call it
opportunistic data structure just
because they were able to take advantage
of the repetitiveness of the data in
order to switch these days so for to
nisti to listen this is what happened
afar after our paper so many people
publish it the compressive data
structures using some of our techniques
in integers tags the trees graphs lab
latrines functions forces is huge amount
of publications in this context and if
you want some references on some
particular objects i can tell you and
also some practitioners were fascinated
by these results so at least these are
two papers that i right the german paper
just the
I didn't read the paper but my ago
through a friend of mine told means
something about 50 what was waitin I
just needed the Johnson anyway I was not
satisfied of pieces because they justice
capped off many important details so
they seek a party too much this is the
reason why together with my friends
Sheila tomorrow we decide to set up in
society and it is a lot Oh piss off in
over so the best performing so you find
the index collection and the nice thing
is that all of people to fracture nation
the same o'clock so this won't be get
for these people to match as the PR so
you think change one little structure
the other your software double check and
this is the recent paper where we
describe the side so from this side I
took the best compressor because so I
repeated the experiments taking a seat
we are internal memory and light won't a
very fast day to the compression I need
to take it orally so I took 500 e likes
widget we're just directly so the
percentage is 26.2 percent in
compression so it's a little bit worse
oh and the compressional speed is faster
even because you're working and also
because the block is over and between
brackets you have the mean and the
maximum fortunately there is a lot of
audience mission body MCM l and this
variance is due to the fact that he the
law is highly compressible it generates
very compresses so it is very very fast
because it is very traditional
they call tmobile crazy people so this
model is the number of faces the
possibility the compression so when it
achieves the 300 megabytes per second it
means that that blocks forms are you in
person seven means that block then we
check that they would say the
approximation of people you find that
seven percent so we lose the one percent
from that one party do small roles so
it's less fires be very very much and so
this is it validates so I think that was
very good good compromise between the
compression ratio actually is the patch
better compromise if you consider that
in practice by engineering the numbers
they were able to achieve not this then
this is the fault i checked the
compressors of thicknesses the numbers
if you look at his numbers his numbers
of failure so i was really disappointed
when I go because I was really very fact
estas listo maturity of you so I wanted
to get remember so I started reading
about numbers actually white 100
megabytes and not much for work just
because was the largest law that Jesus
software's are able so actually I built
one compressor units per machine you can
imagine and the largest needed either
software can be routed gives 200
megabytes because the Alvin's that we
use to compute the compression index are
keen memory arrays so for this reason it
give me some if you power algorithm that
will be function let me be able to
larger
so anyway so we built 200 memory blocks
so we could be we could explore more
recognition but the numbers are very
tactical the compression ratio is
awesome so forty percent or twenty-two
percent and the decoding speed is very
good so if you look at these numbers you
say your princess appearances are very
good very nice theoretical result but we
practice that apparently so but it in
the DC session official because when it
not be the compression scheme this is
much less than this one so it's an order
of magnitude true but if you remember I
told you that you can they compressed
only what you need so if they object it
you won't be there compressed very very
small so you can even accept two
megabytes per second in the compression
because this is a surely faster but it
needs it impressive long ok so if the
object size is to order of two other
magnitude smaller than your blog then
deactivate and in the paper you will
find some Bank of them both officials in
which I actually fix what is the block
size speed so for example if you need
compressed weeks of it to press also
databases but purposely names which are
much smaller and they
obviously this number is right there any
cases and dizzy stranger will actually
if you look to the theory paper if you
remember can be summarized as follows
details that compresses the peoples of
Isis place which is the space of the
booster so three-point-eight percent
plus the small order terms from the
Rhodesians like these terms and then
mostly there are being conferences and
then it seems that the big Constance is
very large because we jump for a packet
of 10 but the Gosselin's are not one
technique is here is opportunity so we
implement and one of these numbers
actually eliminated or there should be a
negative direction so many things what
what is interesting is that if you
randomly permute the pages so you have
no control your data in this case
compresses of negative space because
they get eighty percent of compression
whereas the others ncla and the others
get to interest so if you cannot touch
your data these becomes a table so they
are competitive Compton state space so
these numbers at the superficial
redeemed are badly but if you look into
that looks they deserve remaining
surprises and many corners again as I
said the beginning of a 12 even when
there is no way the French of your
application requirements we return the
compression space
so yeah
they want to because they said so the
content here is that here I shown the
Holy to not if you look at the paper you
find that differences there are other
settings of design value but the
question time yet so the point is that
actually what happens so these twenty
percent in the sense in some sense it's
like you are coming back to the case you
to do a compression just a few pages
together so and here I do need a little
bit with these far meters this one is a
little bit if there are n equations
please stop me so what is the moral of
these experiences actually and we just
the I think that this paper gives some
answers the most important stuff is that
gives you numbers of eight numbers on
what you can get with open source
software and so is a guide for the
rovers and it also is a sort of
compliment to the mainly sunset and
publishing the literature's about web
graph compression and either too lazy
every tool is not form a dogged by these
objects but also its orbit by web pages
so when you design a software you can
squeeze your web browser you're averting
listed as much as you want but then you
have also the web pages so and so I
think that this gives some numbers also
regarding this part there are three
interesting good points and directions
one is the ncnd is very nice and a
spirit experimenting lzma I got they do
please problem so I'll truth parts
effects in order to prove their final
compression using a fixative cover them
our solar paper is the first so we have
any connotation of these allah but in
practice it does not work
or is it not better than anything just
because we are using in our
implementation and very bad for new
material so we should use the same in
community one thing I think is very very
nice is this paragon the new partition
and compress that people are using and
there are so you can get to choose by
altering then you have an optimal
partition and recording and then you
take impressive and this is very
powerful because as I show you you can
use the smaller blocks anyway what I'm
looking now my cookies interested
bc in an other which are lovely so I
want you look at this so you will be
brought your dragons of the dorms at the
edges and typically varies iteration
between his novels when you want to
photograph if you'd like to start to
ruffle to the compressed way so that you
can access and you can answer is some
cleaning tips of the graph shortest
 with relegation some ideas sir
are present in these spirits but these
are dr. specifically the Sun into
compression so they are Sicilian
colonization and also they considered
wheelies on the graphs which are very
simply give me all the outgoing edges of
it so if you calculate you know you have
to do let's do this classes
finally compresses up there is a big gap
because after
so they are promising already for all
objects assassin so what is it for all
the good moral is don't believe of the
times that I really vanilla I think that
this is very nice sup just one don't
stop don't really
that's
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
