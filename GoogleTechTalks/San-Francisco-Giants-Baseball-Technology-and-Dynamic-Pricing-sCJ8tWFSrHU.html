encompasses New York and San Francisco
Giants so when we come in and speak with
and interact with companies as as young
and fresh and innovative as you do we we
hope some of it will rub off and and as
we get later on I'll talk a little bit
about how we think some of it has rubbed
off and and the fact we're 126 years old
doesn't mean that we have to be
old-fashioned minded or or lack the
progressive instincts that that required
to succeed in business and in today's
modern world so I
we're baseball team and a lot of people
think oops why people think that as a
baseball team well all you really do is
kind of throw the balls and bats out on
the field and get them to play baseball
and give them to win and get good
players and all that well it's not quite
that simple nor that straightforward in
our view we think that to be successful
we really have to pay homage to the fact
that we're in multiple businesses all at
once and our our real sort of mission is
to satisfy a number of different
constituencies and the businesses were
in are number one the baseball business
to be sure we want to win games we want
Giants San Francisco Giants go to the
World Series every year but we also have
to give recognition of the fact that
we're in the content business you know
we're providing content to fans we're
monetizing that content you know we're
competing in an age where there's
multiple
you know competitors within our industry
and then you know geometrically
expansive the number of competitors in
the general entertainment industry you
know that that are competing for
people's share of mind in the in the
entertainment content space so in the
baseball the the business were in we
think of really five we're in the
baseball business were in the content
business we're in the entertainment and
attractions business we have to we have
to get people to come to
just and care about coming to watch us
and yes this competition for the
entertainment dollar but it's really
competition for the entertainment our
you know how do you get people to invest
for a baseball game 3-4 hours they're
coming from Sacramento or they come from
Monterey or they're coming from Santa
Clara Sunnyvale it's an investment how
do you get to be compelling enough to do
that we're in the customer service
business number four so if you don't
serve the customer both through the the
work you do with your content or the
work you do in person at the ballpark
that's that's an issue and that's and
that and that's critical critical test
and then the fifth business were in is
not necessarily a business but it's a
service it's the community service
business we we're San Francisco across
our chest and though were a privately
held business we really in many ways are
viewed as a quasi a public utility San
Francisco across our chest people many
ballparks not ours but many ballparks
are built with public money and so how
do we give back to the community how do
we allow for the fact that folks want
the San Francisco Giants to host their
school groups to provide tickets to send
players out and get them involved in
philanthropic causes so those are really
the five endeavors that where we where
we where we serve tell you a little bit
about I'm going to talk for a few
minutes and then I'd love to take
questions and we'll get to the juicy
baseball questions because I think you
probably may have those whether it's a
Giants past Giants present and certainly
Giants going forward into the future as
the seasons about three weeks away I got
involved one of the most frequently
asked questions I get is how do you get
into sports you know how did you get it
as you get a job you know at the Giants
and I'll give you the honest answer I
was as a grade school student and as a
teenager totally in to baseball and
especially specifically totally into the
Giants walked around with your one
dinner table with the little transistor
radio your phone in my ear listening to
Giants games on the radio and have a and
and and had a real affection for the for
the team played some baseball growing up
but never good enough the quick
realization hit you know I'm not gonna
be a major leaguer but I enjoyed I
enjoyed the game through the media
actually through listening the games on
radio and those days there were only
about twenty games out of 162 games that
were on television so I would listen to
the games on the radio and I I actually
think radio baseball is the purest
medium of them all of all the ways you
can capture baseball because it's it's
the word pictures and there's some
wonderful storytellers announcers Vin
Scully
we now have John Miller I grew up with
Russ Hodges and lon Simmons and so I I
grew up in in that mode went to Berkeley
as a student and in a crazy and I think
in many ways people get into sports and
baseball or any sport kind of through
the backdoor through some crazy story
well I had my own version of a crazy
story which was in 1978 as I was a
junior at kau I was involved in a school
radio station kind of living out my
passion broadcasting and I was I was
broadcasting the CAO baseball football
basketball games and it was about ten
days before opening day and the owner of
the A's
a man named Charlie Finley anybody
remember him Charlie Finley very
eccentric maverick pioneer successful
won three World Championships with the
Oakland A's he was I lived in Chicago
and he was about ten days before opening
day did not have a radio station to
broadcast his games why because his team
he had been threatening to move the team
he engendered some bad will in recent
years this was several years after he
won World Series and I called him picked
up the phone and called him out of this
college radio station at Cal Berkeley
kaal XFM 10 watts we had 10 watts of
power and I said mr. Finley my name is
larry Baer we'd like to broadcast your
games this year
and he said mr. Baer who are you I said
well my name's Larry Behr kaal x FM
radio station he says mr. bear
walks and money talks how much you gonna
pay me I said well I had to come clean
our FCC license is held by the Regents
of the University of California so we
really can't pay you anything maybe we
can send you a dollar in the mail but we
will air your games as a community
service were a non-commercial station
now the context in this time for Charlie
Finley was he was really kind of in the
old school maybe you've heard of Bill
Veck who was the owner of the White Sox
he was a promoter he liked promoting a
lot of things including himself and his
own ideas and in that period he had come
up with the idea of orange baseball's
the designated runner rabbits popping up
and giving the balls to the umpire at
home plate ball girls down the line
wearing hot pants getting getting
retrieving balls so he said your your
your let me get this straight
well you you're a student at Berkeley
and you want to broadcast you your
station wants to do the games say yeah
we want to we absolutely want to
broadcast the games well who will be the
broadcasters I said I'm a junior
majoring in political science my partner
is a sophomore majoring in English will
be your broadcasters he said oh hmm well
yeah can you room together on road trips
you and your partner and whoever the
engineer whatever yeah yeah yeah we'll
share a room at all the road trips so he
agreed to a 23 game contract for us to
broadcast the A's games and and that's
how I got involved in what is really a
crazy world professional sports it's a
world that a lot of rules get suspended
sometimes for good and sometimes for not
such good purposes and and that was that
was how I got involved I then got went
to the Giants ultimately as marketing
director and did a stint there
for a few years before going on to back
to graduate school and just tell you a
little bit about the Giants story and
kind of move it up to present day I in
1993 end of 1992 the Giants had lost 4
ballot measures for to build the
ballpark in the Bay Area I don't know
how many of you were here to remember
this but there was a - in San Francisco
1970 87 and 89 both in in what the 89
measure where the ballpark ultimately
was built and then two others in Santa
Clara and in 1990 in San Jose in 1992
all with public money and the owner as
you would expect was frustrated Bob
Laurie and said I've got it we've got to
sell the team and a group in Florida
Tampa emerged and said we will buy the
team in move them to Florida will become
the Tampa Bay Giants and what happened
then was something that you know was
truly an eleventh-hour and in some ways
a hostile takeover a group emerged and
said we can't let this happen when a
team loses its when a community loses
its baseball team that is in many ways a
ravaging experience for a community I
mean and I felt the same way I was in
New York working at CBS working for the
head of CBS at the time and I was pained
even though I wasn't in San Francisco
but having grown up here a lot of other
people business people were paying and
we cobbled together a group that at the
last minute put that offered a hundred
million dollars for the Giants and the
Giants deal in Florida they were to be
sold for 115 million and we had to go to
the league and try to get approval and
the league saw the history of the San
Francisco Giants they don't like team
movement and they said we'll give this
group a chance and we were in many ways
where who's who
of not even just Northern California
business by the American business we had
a Bill Hewlett from Hewlett Packard we
had Don Fischer from the the gap founder
Charles Schwab Arthur Rock of Intel
weather the founding theses of Intel and
Peter Magowan was the managing partner
who was chairman of Safeway chairman CEO
of Safeway at the time and it was a
terrible exciting period so this is 1993
and we took over I'll remember one I
remember one of our investors Walter
Shorenstein said uh we got good news and
we got bad news the good news is we just
bought the team the bad news is we just
bought the team what what what the hell
do we do now because the team was losing
at that time about 15 million a year 12
to 15 million a year we were a
Candlestick Park which obviously was the
whole reason that you know it was the
viability of the Giants was in question
so we what we did was we did some
research you know when in doubt do some
research so we did a survey of our fans
and we found out what are people
thinking about the Giants why are they
coming why they not coming and what are
their views about management and this is
as we kicked it off we found that the
fans were numb cuz they had gone through
four elections to build a ballpark and
the prevailing view was I do this as an
escape from all the problems in the
world
I follow the Giants I go to games i
watch games i you know take my kids to
Giants clinics I do all these things but
I don't want to be burdened with your
problems and by the way the you hear our
net worth hundreds of millions of
dollars owners and don't complain to me
about the fact you can't get the stadium
or you got problems I got I'm trying to
get my children to daycare so what we
essentially did the message we got from
that was shut up and play ball that if
we're gonna come forward with a new
ballpark measure we're gonna do it in a
way that will be proactive
we're not going to in the interim before
we're not gonna come forward until we
have it all put together we're not gonna
complain about Candlestick so for about
three years
we just went to work underground if you
will we improve Candlestick at the time
and in 1993 we had to put together a
team and we have the general manager had
resigned because he was really part of
the previous owners group a high quality
group and had success on the field some
success on the field went to a world
series but he had resigned the manager
resigned so Peter and I had to figure
out okay what do we do we have to get a
general manager and we have to get a
manager in in 1993 and we hopefully
could improve the team quickly so in
late 1992 we we it was November and we
didn't have a general manager we did
have a manager but we need to get some
players and there was a gentleman named
Barry Bonds who was the premier free
agent at the time in 1992 and this is
November of 92 his father was a great
giant his Godfather Willie Mays was
maybe the greatest giant of them all and
so we said to ourselves okay now is
there a better more perfect fit just on
that just sort of as the writing the
story of Sarah high school San Carlos
born and raised Superstar comes back to
the Giants but we have never done
anything like this before Peter and I I
mean we were you know I've worked in
marketing for the Giants I had worked
for CBS as assistant to two Larry Tisch
but you know had negotiate a player
contract NORAD Peter so we thought was
gonna be you know difficult he was the
premier free agent the Yankees were
going after him the braiser going after
him so we called the agent and the agent
said who are you while we're this is my
name's Bear this is McGowan we're trying
to buy the team we don't have the team
yet they said well call me back when you
have the team well that's not gonna it's
gonna take too long
we need your player and we want them and
we're confident we will get the team
well we pestered him with calls
repeatedly to the point where he finally
said okay you know I give up No Mas here
you call Barry himself and you make the
case to Barry but you can't read it Jim
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
six days a week so you got call before
10:00 a.m. West Coast time or after 4
p.m.
ya said well why is that can't reach him
between because he's spending six hours
a day six days a week working out
running stadium steps you know lifting
sessions 1992 okay his father who at the
time was coaching for the Cleveland
Indians in his let's see early 50s felt
great shape so we thought that sort of
augered well for signing a player to it
would have had to be at the time of
enormous contract so called called that
number outside of those hours and
reached dari and he said and we said you
know we're a group that attempting to
take over the giants we think we're
gonna get a deal here within within
weeks and we want you to be a giant in
our first year and we want you to be
forever a giant in the tradition of your
father and the tradition of your
godfather Willie Mays and Barry's
reaction was first week silence on the
phone and then you can hear his choked
up and he said if there is a way to come
back and wear that uniform that Giants
uniform that I wore that I you know was
in the clubhouse watching my father wore
wear and watch Willie Mays performing as
I was a as I was a you know four years
old through my through my childhood
there's nothing more important that I'd
want to do with my life than to carry
out their tradition so we still had to
negotiate a deal so we met at the
airport hyatt over here in in
a week or two later secretly everybody
thought it was the Yankees or Braves
we're gonna get Barry Bonds and we said
you know and this really gave us a good
interesting idea as to how how the
thinking goes among players agents and
in the world of sports
we have some ideas what to pay but when
we looked at some comparables but we
weren't you know we weren't entirely
sure whether this was gonna go and first
talked about term and we offered up five
years he was at the time he was 28 so
didn't think that would be a huge risk
given his lack of injury history and and
they talked we're talking about seven
years so that would take seven years to
take you to 35 five years take you to 33
probably could work something out there
dollars would let them take the lead in
that discussion Ryan Sandberg at the
time was a was the number one the
highest-paid player in baseball Ryan
Sandberg was making 7.3 million 7.2
million dollars it was an interesting
lesson in how minds and sports work they
said well Ryan Sandberg is making 7.2
million dollars and Barry Bonds is the
best player in the game today and that
was true he was in 1992 the best player
in the game little did we know what
would happen beyond in terms of his you
know his achievements and we ended up
saying we'll pay you a smidge over Ryan
Sandberg 7.3 million a year and we
didn't talk a lot about present value
and so we talked about well we'll set it
up and they basically said done why I
mean there was some back-and-forth but
why because to the ball player and this
was a lesson that you know 17 years
later we still keep in mind the ball
player what's what's very important is
how you're you you slide with your peers
and in those days 7.3 million dollars
for for a superstar was it was good
sensation six years was was a you know a
big commitment so it was about forty
three million dollar deal as we were
getting started
the other thing we need to do is we need
to find a manager and these were really
two of the sort of defining things that
we had to do seventeen years ago the
that you know resonated for next ten
years or so and one of the things we
learned in in and and it's something we
always keep in mind is how the manager
does from from first pitch to last out
is important so that's you know run in a
game send in the signals are you bunting
when do you take the pitchers out
probably more important what does the
manager do from last pitch last out to
first pitch so what does that mean
last out to first pitch games over team
has a tough loss team has a great win
team has to fly cross-country how does
that manager keep 25 players together as
a unit in a way that's going to that's
going to carry out positively 462 games
they suppose a long season it's a grind
it's a long season small clubhouse and
we had heard about the Giants a coach
for the Giants at the time named Dusty
Baker who was the hitting coach and we
had heard about how marvelous he was
with the players he never managed he had
one stint as a manager in the Fall
League which is a you know three week
league that's that showcases some
players some young players in October
every year but that's it no my early
managing experience and certainly no
major league manager experience but
everybody said dusty had the right stuff
no managerial experience so we took a
leap and we met with him and we learned
about him and the way he thinks talk to
players talk to some people who some
people said you know how can you take a
chance for the first time manager like
this and 1993 we had
an amazing experience Dusty Baker his
first year as manager was manager of the
year a team 103 games and Barry Bonds
was MVP unless you less we thought we
were brilliant or anybody thought we
were brilliant we got some good fortune
and some good dumb luck
early on in year number one and then we
had a we've had a you know secured this
route into into where we are now in 2009
which i think is actually poised for for
another good strong era of giants
baseball I want to get with limited time
I want to get to some of the things
we're doing with technology that you may
or may not be interested in they also
wanted to say that just to play out that
the the the history the chronology we
came forward in 1996 with a measure for
a ballpark that would be privately
financed so it's different than the
other four measures that were rejected
by voters and this still had to go to
the ballot because in San Francisco
anything that requires a change in
zoning has to go the ballot and 20,000
signatures from any anybody can put
something on the ballot so we decided to
go on proactively ourselves we put it on
the ballot it passed she'll I figure out
a way to pay for it
and in those days 96 to 99 those were as
you remember go-go days and Silicon
Valley gogo days in the in Northern
California and we were able to through
seat licenses and upfront payments of
sponsorships and naming rights put
together about a hundred eighty million
dollars of in those revenue streams we
borrowed another one hundred and eighty
million dollars and we were able to get
a 360 million dollar ballpark produced
with 18 million dollars a year of debt
service and those eighteen five eighteen
million dollars in of debt service most
observers on the outside thought would
severely handicapped the franchise
thankfully we got out of the blocks in
year 2000 you know really with year one
of our ballpark which was really the
product that we wanted to deliver was
San Francisco Giants baseball in a new
ballpark downtown we have the best
record in baseball
and we were able to get off to a to a
good start and you know some of the some
of the chronology 2002 we were in the
2001 Barry Bonds at 73 home runs
I'm sure I'll get some questions about
Barry Bonds which I'll be happy to
answer 2002 we went to the World Series
and lost in seven games 2003 we won a
hundred games and as you as you take it
through it's been it's it's really been
a honeymoon since we've been in the new
ballpark that has gone through till just
about now maybe you could say early oh
eight we operated about 95 percent
capacity for our first eight years from
oh oh
207 we have a you know we have a really
a record we believe with our fans and in
the game that is you know that it is
that at the top of the industry in terms
of not just filling the seats but
providing customer service and providing
all of everything that I mentioned
earlier content we are now a 1/3 owner
of the the medium that delivers our
games which is Comcast SportsNet went
through a partnership with Comcast we
have done about a hundred and twenty
non-baseball events per year in the
ballpark everything from soccer matches
to skiing believe it or not I could talk
about that to watch the car races
monster Jam's what's called so we see
ourselves as really an entertainment
defined as an entertainment company so
it's been great but where are we now
where are we where we are now is we're
in a rough economy as we all can
appreciate and we have a team that has
not won for four years so we come upon
the 2009 season and we've really changed
the template of the San Francisco Giants
and I think in some ways it's a it's
it's a change template that many teams
are looking to to move to
which is young team not necessarily
going after the veterans we have some
veterans and we've required at least one
important veteran but a young team that
can function over time because they were
all developed in our system in a way a
coordinated way and that's the model
that Tampa Bay franchise been successful
with went to the World Series with last
year and I think that's the model that's
gonna be the prevailing model in major
league baseball going forward so when
you see in three weeks
Pablo signed of all takers position at
third base when you see Travis Ishikawa
take his position at first base when you
see most likely either Manny Burris or
Kevin Frandsen take the position at
second base when you see Tim Lincecum on
the mound as a site raining site Young
Award winner with Matt Cain with
Jonathan Sanchez buffered and bolstered
by Randy Johnson and Barry Zito I think
you'll see Brian Wilson is the closer
you'll see what could be a model that
will take us that will be sustainable
that will take us out out many years I
wanted to briefly touch on a some of the
things we do in technology and then open
it up for questions and I want to
mention that our CIO who has been so
much a part of all of these initiatives
brilliantly designed initiatives is here
bill schlau so I want to build a wave
and you have a chance to I hopefully
talk to him and see him see him
afterwards haha that's okay that's not
that's not as main part of this job just
a few things that with a bill has been
responsible for that has been just you
know terrific industry-wide pioneering
efforts and one thats near and dear to
our heart because I think it really
affects the play that affected the play
positively of the team is something
called video coaching and scouting
system and without going into great
detail what it's done is it's it's
enabled the Giants to analyze the
mechanics of our players in game in
real-time
that a and and the mechanics of the
pitcher catcher relationship and the
hitters so that if you're a pitcher and
you're in the fourth inning and you're
about to face a hitter for the second
time in the order and your team's up and
you're not coming up you can go into a
little alcove joining our dugout and
watch either the previous sequence of
pitches you delivered to them or past
snippets of you versus him similarly if
you're a hitter and starting pitcher
struck you out last time you can go and
you can find out what the pitches you
can look at what the picture looked like
look at what your swing look like and
it's an incredible enhancement and it's
real-time we have a program called X OS
that we just saw in Arizona where the
first team in Major League Baseball to
do this first team in professional
sports to do this and without going into
a elaborate description essentially you
are the players put on sensors put on
spacesuit and they put sensor technology
and they are you know their movements
pitchers motion hitters swings are
recorded and fed back and analyzed and
as you cut chart through a season you
take that baseline and you see where you
are against the baseline and really
valuable for rehab purposes if the
pitcher is injured or hitters injured
also valuable for guys that are in
slumps and you compare yourself to your
baseline you can also compare yourself
to baselines of others that you that
you're emulating those of you who've
been to the ballpark how many of you
been to AT&amp;amp;T Park good most of you
perfect okay
might not be here if you hadn't even
born fans I the 18 t of the HD
scoreboard that we did with 18 T we
introduced in 2007 we
have Wi-Fi in the ballpark as you know
it's one of the putt largest public
hotspots in the world and the first
professional sports facility to have
Wi-Fi we have a digital dugout with new
applications and a smartphone friendly
interface one of one of my favorites was
the double play ticket window which is
now standard but that was the first real
for a serious foray into secondary
market secondary ticket marketing so you
have a ticket to a game you're a season
ticket holder you can't go to that game
you can put your ticket back up online
through barcode technology and no
tickets change hands your tickets turned
off and the person who sells the ticket
through the Giants website who who buys
your ticket through the Giants website
can come to the game and at the game
you'll have your ticket burped out on a
on a machine or through will call and my
favorite and the one that is really that
we're debuting here in a few weeks is
dynamic pricing for tickets and we're
starting with were the first team to do
this and we're starting with 2,000 seats
in the upper deck and the price of the
seat is going to be like the price of
your ticket on an on an airplane it's
going to be adjusted to and calibrated
to the market so let's say and this is
for individual purchases this is not for
season ticket holders so let's say that
the standard price is a $20 ticket if
it's a Sunday against the Dodgers that
$20 ticket given the demand may be 42
dollars if it's a Tuesday night against
the Pirates and it's April and it's cold
that $20 ticket maybe an $8 ticket and
we have setup we've worked with a
software firm and our ticket marketing
people ticket services people have have
high hopes that this will be much more
customer driven create a much more
customer driven opportunity for us in
the ticketing and could be adopted you
know industry-wide in some fashion
very very quickly so we're very excited
about that so we're using technology and
in all these ways bill has been a huge
leader in not just with our team but in
the industry and many of these efforts
and their others we can talk about but
with that I just want to conclude by
saying as I said at the beginning we're
in a number of different businesses and
we're excited about the business we're
in we're excited that I talked coming to
talk to you we really appreciate you
coming and in appreciation for you being
here and taking some of your valuable
productive time changing the world we
wanted to make you an offer since most
of you been to the ballpark and you have
the proclivity that if you go to our
website sfgiants.com you can get a
ticket for any game as a Google employee
indie game in April a game in April for
five dollars off all you have to do is
type in on the ticket page type in the
promo code Google and it's yours for
five dollars off so we have lots of good
games i think the only day this isn't
good for is opening day but that's a
workday and folks here wouldn't like you
to be going on a one o'clock April
Tuesday afternoon one o'clock but in
come to opening night at 7:15 the next
night when Lincecum is going to receive
a site Young Award physically or or any
other game in April so thank you very
much and I love to answer any questions
you might have
oh you want to show some commercials our
commercials I'll do that maybe after
questions just to kind of leave you as a
with something in your brain about the
Giants yes can you tell me the story or
tell us it's absolutely so so so much of
baseball is tradition and so much of
baseball is not just experiencing the
here and now but experiencing the the
the people that create memories for you
and what one of the things we've learned
and the Giants have felt really feels
strongly about that reinforcing the
team's tradition and we've done that a
lot with the the Great Hall of Famers of
the 60s 50s and 60s and 70s Willie Mays
when the Covey Orlando Cepeda or
Juan Marichal they have statues at the
park we would bring them back but
there's a whole era of the 70s and 80s
or really the 80s 90s that we had great
teams some great teams some lean years
but some great teams and great
personalities will Clark probably at the
top of everybody's list because he was
he defined this resurgent Giant era
which he broke in in 1986 piece of
trivia his first home run his first
at-bat was a home run against Nolan
right Nolan run that's good you didn't
expect to get tested but Nolan right so
you Hall of Fame pitcher his first
at-bat and so in he led the Giants to
the World Series in 1989 and though he
was a giant only through 1993 so eight
years he was you know just a beloved
giant and you know it's interesting when
when players you know retire it's it's
not simple I mean you know Joe Montana
retired as a Kansas City chief Willie
Mays retired as in New York Matt I mean
they all came back to their teams with
well he was not signed as a free agent
in 1994 he went off to play with some
other teams Tex Baltimore in Texas and
and st. Louis but always loved here and
in some ways you know maybe in the last
two decades the most popular players so
we had a reunion last year of the
players from the 1987 team that won the
division so or two years ago I guess
that reunion was and and that was from
the 17 so I was a 20-year reunion and
brought will back and we started talking
and it was just obvious that he had
worked some for the Diamondbacks a
little bit for the Cardinals he wanted
to be with us we wanted you know mend
fences whatever fences you know from the
previous ownership or whatever and so it
was great and so now his job now is to
be will Clark which is pretty great
thing so he's in uniform at Spring
Training for about a week and a half I
think he's coming from four different
home stands where he'll be around for
the fans and beyond be what the during
the games will be on the field or do a
low broadcasting and hopefully we'll
have them just like we have for Willie
Mays only McAfee for decades
yeah thanks yes sir now working in the
sports industry do you feel like that's
diminished now that it's like your
business or is it something that like
that passion still feelings oh that's a
really good question and Bill has I'm
sure perspectives of this too you know I
I don't really lose the passion I mean
because because when you know it's a
beautiful day and you know it's 12:55 in
the game starting at 105 and people are
settling in their their seats
I just think about okay this is why you
do with my dad going to games and it's
just in that it's just it's so pure and
I just love it or I'm at home watching a
game on television even a road game
let's say I'm at the game I you know you
get you dive into it and you kind of
forget a lot of the the other stuff and
the other stuff I find is is fun and
interesting you know I think the
probably the toughest time in the 17
years has been doing the baseball strike
and we had that in 1994 and you know
where the industry shut down from August
missed the World Series and it's restart
until May over the following year but
you know I don't really miss it I mean I
don't really lose the passion missed the
passion by being in it you know hey
they're agents and there's the stuff
that's the quote unsavory but it's not
that bad
I mean you know it's a it's a business I
mean sometimes you just have to put your
business hat on and one of my favorite
things to do is you just walk in the
upper deck on a Sunday afternoon and see
the mothers and sons and fathers and
daughters and friends hanging out and
it's great and so that if you get into
that Sauer mode just take that walk and
it just it's just it's great I mean
we're very lucky to be part of that
world I think yes relationship he wasn't
really touted as his last games in the
part when people thought something going
on there because it's a marketing
opportunity you know contact with
something to an end and then also it was
I just kind of read the headline people
attention like black is good so you
couldn't come back when people weren't
trying to bility berry berry sees a lot
of stuff on the net so if he emails me
although he was watching that's a good
question I mean look the first of all I
say and this is a way this has no
relationship to steroids or any of the
controversy or his legal case when a
player is a superstar you know or Hall
of Fame caliber player I'd say as many
times as not and maybe more times than
not it doesn't end easily or well
because there's so much because that
players meant so much to a franchisor to
several franchises and most of the time
the player wants to keep going you know
and and who is that general manager to
pull the plug on me I have seven hundred
and sixty two home runs or I won three
hundred and fifteen games you know and
so it's tough that that you know it's
you you're not sixty five years old
you're 44 37 or whatever so in sports
there's this constant tension of a great
player hanging it up and there's a and
they disconnect between when he thinks
he's done and when everybody else in the
world thinks he's done so you have that
before you even get into the controversy
surrounding Barry in 2007 you know it
was a controversial signing when we sent
Braun back for that final year he had
had that that we signed him in 93 the
story I told so you know that was just
15th year as a giant we saw him till one
year contract there were a lot of people
have thought that that was the wrong
thing to do he had had a we believed he
would have a good year in 2007 and he
would help the team and we were able to
make it a baseball
decision I can't say there weren't other
influences but it was a baseball
decision and he had a good year in 2007
hit 28 home runs there we absolutely as
we went through the season you know we
honored him in every way we possibly
could as he broke the all-time record
Hank Aaron's record I mean we had you
know each step along the way we had
these great you know a fleet sfrom the
world not just baseball
Muhammad Ali Wayne Gretzky Joe Montana
Michael Jordan and ultimately Hank Aaron
at number 756 do testimonials for Barry
and we had a number of things I think
that as it became clear to him at the
end of the season that we may not go
forward with them in 2008 he was hurt
and I think that's a understand that I
mean you know we weren't making the
commitment that we were gonna go forward
with him in 2008 so he could only read
it that way and so there was yeah there
was some disconnect between us in him in
that respect I mean in terms of nobody
else signing him in 2008 you know the
Players Association says it's collusion
I truly well we we had to make our own
independence Asian we had to get younger
and move on I teams banding together to
not sign him I think is not it's pretty
is a somewhat preposterous notion they
make their individual decisions they you
know they blacklist them I mean teams
are in that decision though you know
honestly I'm sure some teams are saying
okay he'll do he'll perform this way on
the field but there'll be the the other
distraction factor and how does that
affect our team but there wasn't you
know I think it's an obvious that there
was a coordinated effort to keep him out
of baseball you know and he has his
legal case now still pending any other
questions yes so there's a been a large
new push I guess in Major League
Baseball these made for online content
or mlb.tv which
it's fantastic personally for me our
display man and one of the things to do
is to have these these blackout
restrictions locally and I was curious
what your take is on well specifically
how much control you guys have an input
into things like I'm going to be that TV
because there's such a huge and again
you mentioned you know over a hundred
years of history essentially of content
that's available and you know it seems
to me that if you're looking to monetize
certain areas for especially saying like
if I beat up two people people who live
in San Francisco the only way they can
essentially get value out of that is if
they don't live in San Francisco well in
terms of why not games so well to me
there's a lot of content that could
potentially be made available where you
could essentially either work with Major
League Baseball or something like that
in the sense of local people could watch
me on-demand or hold footage or things
that you guys feel is relevant to
whatever is going on currently like
you're playing the Dodgers watch old
famous Dodger games against the Giants
it's a great question
and it's a it's really a threshold
question now in our industry just sort
of the background of that of the
questions very inform question is our in
each team's internet rights have been
rolled up into a centralized entity a
central baseball entity called mlb.com
or MLB advanced media Major League
Baseball advanced media ml BAM mlb.tv as
part of its one of the you know
initiatives of ml BAM the issue is it's
really I think and it's on being on the
Google campuses is a fascinating place
to discuss this it's really an issue of
the transition from old media to new
media because what you're really saying
is why can't I scream games and market
right why can't I stream the giant ski
games or why can't I get the content
thing is that there is you get Major
League Baseball made a ton of money off
but it's growing very rapidly this
there's a lot of new features but it
seems to me that the partial thing that
they're missing out on is you know and
they're trying to do this I think with
the new the new TV station but you guys
even personally you know you
at Dean's you show old footage all the
time that seems to me that providing
that content for a fee there's a huge
huge interest that people would have for
that and then you know maybe it's
something where that money would throw a
baseball directly and is supposed to you
got this but it seems to me that there
would be an opportunity where you can
say locally for you know yes it's
blacked out but you can have access to
some certain portion of media the chips
over time right I mean there's no reason
to prevent that access to that content I
mean that makes no sense at all we
should provide you know if you if you
want to watch and we do it but not we
don't really do it on demand through
mlb.tv I don't think we do bill and in
other words the 89s world series
condensed games and will offer this
season's games and we don't have that
full archive in the archive that Tom's
describing is our saving Giants history
dreamed up because we the reality is
behind the scenes we have you know a
huge warehouse footage back not all the
way back to 1958 but all the way back to
the 80s and it's just sitting there and
tapes and every team has that across the
league and so all the way it's not just
baseball in the NBA the NFL and if those
and NBA is actually the best but we've
talked at the Giants level about let's
take that footage we have and let's
digitize it let's make it available to
our fans but when you talk to the league
about it really that's a league
challenge because it doesn't make sense
for 30 clubs to do that individually as
opposed to the league doing it centrally
so it's part of the league's master plan
but for this year the new baseball
channel was really their primary
objective when we're talking about you
know distributing that media app to the
fans so once the baseball channels
facility is developed they're going to
start digitizing that old content and I
think what you're describing you'll see
you won't see you know
oh nine but this is gonna take a while
to digitize all that content may be
available you don't see them like
2011-2012 right do you see it any any
value in you know personally as a team
you know your role within baseball in
the sense of how much can you really do
on your own work you said we don't want
to leave that one you want to go remove
it now and be the first one to provide
something like this or is they not
really an option yeah big discussion
fight dispute and baseball is states
rights versus essential good and you
know I mean we believe that I think it's
important that these you don't want to
tamp down initiative entrepreneurial
spirit intrapreneurial activity and you
know from the Giants we probably are
more on the side there's a larger market
team and we think of more progressive
team you know that has resources to do
some of these things that we want to be
able to do them and you know and maybe
feed them into the central authority and
then they can and that did happen with
double-play ticket window and with with
the secondary ticket market in its hand
but I think it'll happen with dynamic
pricing okay so but sometimes it prevent
you from being fleet as fleet of foot as
you'd like the other side of that though
is that you know the what were they
created this this venture BAM was if you
go back to the old days of cable
television the New York Yankees were
getting 200 million a year you know and
the Kansas City Royals were at 6 million
and there was a great disparity and
baseball was afraid that that disparity
and so they wanted the Internet they
want that to exist in the internet team
by team market by market will do maybe
one more question did you have a
question and then and then I watched
other commercials and people have to go
during the game
well that's very I think it would be
very hopeful what did it get the players
mindful that too much and one of the
players
I can see I mean your review taken
everything about second game but being
into the five during a likely instead of
just going to be natural and to do with
it whatever they is a kind of as if it
one
that's a great question it's a great way
in fact there was there was a time in
our hope he won't mind me saying this
you know we had a losing streak last
year our general manager you know who
was oh yeah you're in a losing streak
and you're not happy he says we're
shutting down the video because the
players think you know you really get in
your own head so for one person's hey I
see this flaw in my swing and I'm able
to correct it is the next guys you know
he's just obsesses on it and it screws
them up even further so it's a so I
think it really the answer is its player
by player that some players you know if
you're baseball being the grind and
bringing the mental game that it is 162
games if you're a 32 year old veteran
you probably can maybe interpret and
process it a little easier then I say a
23 year old rookie who is you know sees
it and get spooked by it and they just
you know kind of gets worse so I think
it's player by player and so the coach
is the answer your question is the
coaches and manager are doing in a
controlled sort of tempered way they did
well it's certainly not mandatory and
it's certainly not something for
everyone and so that's a very you know
it's a really and the same thing with
the spacesuit stuff you know it spring
training everybody's in the sensors and
put doing the spacesuit and then looking
at their biomechanically looking at
their motions but how much guys will you
know act upon it or not act upon it
depends on kind of you know if it's like
overthinking like anything else you know
if you over think it's probably you're
probably not going to be natural I mean
there's some players that just believe
as hitters let's say see ball hit ball
don't worry about that scouting report
on the pitcher and don't worry about
that on a two o pitch he's gonna throw a
fastball or in a o to pitch he's gonna
throw a curveball or whatever just see
ball hit ball and let your instincts
take over and in the end it's still they
you know any sport is still pretty
instinctive so you got to look at that
fine line between science and there's so
much science now you know in our sport
so much science and with the Internet
and then that gets to hold
another topic which we didn't talk about
much today was since Moneyball the whole
Moneyball idea I know the guys are
saying at lunch that Michael Lewis spoke
here I mean you know you can have you
can cut data every which way in terms of
analyzing what you should do for a team
and who you should put on the team and
now put on the team but and so that's
helpful but you also it doesn't allow
for if you're looking at it first as a
player to draft it doesn't allow for
that his statistics don't allow for his
emotional makeup don't allow for you
know what's his body gonna look like
three years from now doesn't allow for
injury proclivity doesn't allow for you
know what kind of teammate he is there's
a lot of X factors where so you know you
can't just get rid of Scouts and just go
on get reports and say okay we are
saying this guy cuz he's on base this
amount and you know based percentage and
all the stats you can't do it that way
so it's a lot of it's you got to take
the information and you got to really
have good judgment with it it's an art
still an art not a science I thought
maybe we'd play the our TV commercials
which you'll be seeing they're just
started this week and it's kind of get
people set for the season one of the
things we try to do with our commercials
it's humanized the players a little bit
and we have Tim Lincecum who won the
siyoung and he's in some of these
commercials hopefully one of them is not
offensive it's a little edgy baby
maybe not edgy for you guys probably not
edgy
just bring them in with that black
screen fell asleep something awfully
sorry talk to him what people
we take ours on the road so if the other
team has it they have to bring it with
them so it's important we have a
portable version so but yeah we don't we
don't allow them to they but they can
there's a way to if you guys said can
you call it up yeah there's there's a
spot where they could do it we'd like to
yeah that's right we'd like to crisp HD
this is no kind of had the fuzzy oh
that's the ticket offers open to all
your friends and family to is hidden
Google so
first they are sort of rating spots and
then they're more specific by sticking
spots
this one's against the Dodgers crushed
Sandoval's
hey let's go right for us
all right I'd show we gotta find out
I'll tell - you really are
yeah
all right I'd show we're gonna find out
I'll talk to you really are
Oh way to go Wilson
we subscribe pleasure
another major point
hello we got a slide then these necks
are more specific to buying tickets for
certain events or is that until their
actual opening day
Dadda generates already broke today are
you texting all the beats you want to
see our white man so get them before
they're gone
we're in San Francisco John let's play
in your tickets now this F guys calm or
877 for SF g is
I'm tickets to all the games you want to
see are available right now so get them
before they're gone
call 877 for SFG ticks or visit
sfgiants.com for tickets that's a
 fastball that's your cover
what's that
that is magic or fireworks a TV host the
rumors you can watch templates gonna be

e night fireworks show presumably TMT is
it except guys calm or call 877 for s FG
t IX guys let's play Brad Wilson our
closer
big baseball bat a cavity looking for
new Sunday May 31st
it's cafe right here so a lot of what we
do is to try to humanize the players and
that's trying to establish it in ways
that are you see the design
award-winning Lincecum just one final
piece of business I'll let you guys go
Tim Lincecum last year we sold as many
Lincecum jerseys from opening day
through August 1st as we did Barry Bonds
jerseys in 2007 when he set the record
from opening day through August 1st so
we think we've got somebody he's oh and
he's only 24 that's we got you know
knock on wood but lightning in a bottle
and it's and you know he was as a face
of the franchise would be a very
attractive have a rock star feeling
around him and we're gonna try to
exploit it but in a way that's
manageable and certainly not put
pressure on him so thanks look forward
to seeing you guys at the ballpark</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
