Thank You Boris in designing innovation
networks I use design with a small D
because my focus is not on top down
pre-specified design but rather on how
you put in place process frameworks that
will enable effective innovation to
emerge the origin and synthesis of life
and evolution our preeminent exemplars
of the origin of novelty from which we
can learn a lot about the creative
process in general and our own methods
as creative problem solvers the first
challenge of highly innovative
organizations is how best to use good
ideas generated both from within and
externally I'm going to put forward nine
principles of innovation networks to
address this challenge harnessing the
internet and ubiquitous computing and
though I will not talk about grand
challenges like federating the world's
knowledge those who think of knowledge
bytes as objects encounter the same
categorization problems that taxonomist
encountered working on living systems so
I think that innovation networks because
of their process up process bottom-up
process focus have something to
contribute to challenges like these i'm
going to put forward the proposition
that debates about the origin and
evolution of life could lead to a mind
shift beyond our traditional view of
evolution offering new models for
bio-inspired computing and innovation
I'll say something about the source of
these ideas and conclude with the grand
challenge that I know thought leaders at
Google are grappling with together with
the new administration that's about to
enter the White House namely how do we
bring about the global mind shift needed
to address the great problems we face in
the world today I'm going to suggest
that the first step toward bringing
about that global mind shift
loops back to the first challenge namely
how do we put in place process
frameworks that enable innovation to
emerge studying the origin of life
forced me to take out of the box a
handful of assumptions that I had
previously taken for granted pattern
recognition we tend to assume that
pattern recognition is a manifestation
of intelligence collaboration i sent an
early version of my book manuscript to a
friend in computer science at NASA Ames
and he wrote back you know zan I
disagree with the way you use the term
collaboration you can't speak of
collaborating arguments I argue that
robots cannot collaborate agents cannot
collaborate they're not conscious but we
talk about competing arguments all the
time we have no difficulty with this so
how is it that we have made competition
a big overarching term and relegated
collaboration to a tiny leash over here
associated with higher level
consciousness we tend to assume that
design is something that designers do
top down so that and the hijacking of
the term designed by intelligent design
ideologues has further exacerbated this
problem so that we lack any term in the
English language to describe a directed
process that converges toward a coherent
result that could not be predicted in
advance there's been lots of study of
scientific method and insufficient study
of design method so reclaiming these
first three terms and decoupling them
from any requirement that they be
associated with consciousness allows us
to look at evolution in a new way and I
want to clarify that I use pattern
recognition in the full spectrum from
mechanistic
pattern recognition simply the
morphology of a key recognizing a lock
that it fits all the way up to higher
level consciousness suppose that pattern
recognition together with autonomy are
fundamental defining attributes of life
suppose that collaboration together with
competition are co-equal complimentary
dynamics that drove life's origin and
it's evolution toward complexity suppose
that life played a role in evolution in
designing itself and suppose finally
that contrary to our common view that
evolution is a property of living
systems that evolution came first and
invented life rather than vice versa so
I'm putting forward nine principles of
innovation networks that harness
dynamics manifest in the origin and
evolution of life now we don't have any
difficulty acknowledging that the
Peacocks tail is not the most pragmatic
solution to the problem of tail lessness
that in fact the lady peahens just liked
those tails and shows us their mates the
Peacocks with the handsomest tails
thereby driving evolution in the
direction of more and more flamboyant
tails so we can acknowledge pattern
recognition at this level of evolution
the challenge is to acknowledge pattern
recognition going all the way down but
you need only google molecular pattern
recognition and you will come up with
thousands of hits so if life advances
toward complexity not only through
competition for survival of the fittest
but also through collaboration and
pattern recognition what does this mind
shift imply i want to quote the great
harvard biologist Darwin scholar and
futurist EO wilson who said we are
drowning in information while starving
for wisdom
the world henceforth will be run by
synthesizers people able to put together
the right information at the right time
think critically about it and make
choices wisely now in today's world
that's a tall order for any individual
but I submit that yo Wilson has written
a beautiful mission statement for the
nexus between Google's great technology
expertise and the great challenges of
Google org so it's timely now to put
together the intellectual foundation for
a problem solving method able to cope
with the complex problems we face today
next year 2009 will be the 200th
anniversary of the birth of Charles
Darwin and the hundred and fiftieth
anniversary of his publication of origin
of species which many call the greatest
scientific theory of all time and 2009
will be a year of great evolution debate
I want to read a quote from another
great Harvard biologist and Darwin
scholar the late Stephen Jay Gould who
said Darwin lived to see his name
appropriated for an extreme view that he
never held for Darwinism has often been
defined both in his day and in our own
as the belief that virtually all
evolutionary change is the product of
natural selection so here is stephen jay
gould suggesting that Darwinism
misrepresents darwin and raising the
question that our common view of
evolution is simply random variation and
environmental selection may be
incomplete Darwin himself acknowledged
the important contribution of his
predecessor jean-baptiste Lamarck and
2009 will also be the 200th anniversary
of the publication of Lamarque's great
work philosophy of zoology Lamarque was
an unfortunate case of a great thinker
thrown on the trash heap of history
because of politics more than 70 years
after his death and more than a decade
after Darwin's death
a scientist in the late 19th century
August Weismann needed a straw man and
coined the term Lamarck ism and
associated with that term the incorrect
postulate of the transmission of
acquired characteristics which in fact
Lamarck never even proposed so Lamarque
is due for a resurrection and that may
well come from the IT community from
people working in robotics and
artificial intelligence developing
evolvable systems able to learn and
improve their performance third
significant thinker R Buckminster Fuller
also really undervalued I had the good
fortune to work for him as Boris
mentioned when I was a graduate student
Harvard and his thinking has very much
influenced my own 2011 will be the 50th
anniversary of buckminster fuller's
concept of world game to harness game
methods to environmental sustainability
challenges and those challenges are far
more acute now than they were 50 years
ago but we have now the technology we
locked been to implement this vision the
internet and ubiquitous mobile computing
to support innovation networks and
networks of networks so why the origin
of life which occurred probably 3.8
billion years ago is timely now suppose
this study can contribute to practical
challenges enabling effective
cross-disciplinary collaboration and
innovation evolving multi-agent systems
able to learn and improve their
performance designing decision support
systems to address environmental
sustainability challenges first
principle of innovation networks flies
in the face of descartes stick them to
start from certainty the origin of life
started from uncertainty our
conventional problem-solving model would
say
state your problem clearly define your
terms pull together the stakeholders and
hammer out a consensus about your
methods and goals and solve the problem
and while that conventional model may
work very well for certain types of
conventional problems it doesn't work at
all for certain types of problems that
we face today and I want to give one
example the US Geological Survey has
predicted there's a sixty-two percent
chance of a Bay Area earthquake with
within the next 30 years of more than
six point seven on the Richter scale
USGS would like to use gaming to
motivate citizen participation in
scenario building and to harness
geo-mapping as a tool both for spatial
decision support and for knowledge
synthesis through time the challenge of
a problem like this is we cannot say for
certain that this earthquake will occur
we do not know when it will occur we do
not know how large it will be or exactly
what kind of damage it will do and yet
we know from disasters like Katrina that
not preparing at all is a big mistake
and so for problems like these the
eventual reality of the future is
coupled with our perception of that
reality and so the is world of what may
actually come to pass is coupled with
our perception of what may come to pass
anybody who plays chess knows that it's
not just the pattern of the pieces on
the chessboard that will determine the
outcome of the game it's also the
pattern of strategic possibilities in
the mind of the player that will
determine how the game plays out so our
second principle of innovation networks
again contradicts the conventional model
of problem solving set criteria for
decision-making rather than rigid goals
classic example from NASA the team
working on the Apollo spacecraft trying
to protect the astronauts from the great
heat of re-entry into Earth's atmosphere
they were trying to develop a heat
that would not burn up on re-entry into
Earth's atmosphere and they struggled
and struggled with his problem couldn't
come up with a suitable material until
finally somebody said wait a minute why
are we trying to develop this material
our criterion for success is to protect
the lives of the astronauts so once they
threw out this incorrect goal they
widened the scope of their options and
came up with exactly the opposite of
what they had thought was their original
goal namely the ablative heat shield
which burnt up on re-entry into Earth's
atmosphere there by carrying heat away
from the vehicle so this great challenge
of highly innovative organizations like
Google is how to make best use of the
myriad ideas that are proposed by Google
employees the great influx of proposals
from the outside and on top of that now
your tenth birthday competition so how
do you put in place a systematic process
to not just assess these ideas in
isolation but begin to systematically
see how they are networked with each
other so suppose you were a reader for
the thousands of submissions in the 10th
birthday competition and after reading
through this huge stack you call it down
to maybe a few hundred that you think
are worth considering seriously and then
you decide to make a directed graph
eight colors to represent the eight
categories of the Google 10th birthday
competition and what you want to see
with this graph is of your finalists
elections which ones act as hubs
connecting and enabling many other ideas
or perhaps connecting across categories
to enable ideas another category so a
great environmental sustainability
proposal that also supports energy ideas
and community ideas this harks back to a
metaphor from mathematicians or dos and
Renier which was picked up by biologist
Stewart Kaufman when he was working on
and boolean networks and a model for the
origin of life this question of how the
system of collaborating components could
arrive at a threshold of complexity to
come alive and the point here is that
the early connections you make are much
less important because you're connecting
isolated entries to other isolated
entries but as you move forward you're
developing a web of connections so
suppose now that you get together with a
colleague and she's also had a great
stack of thousands of proposals to
review and has cold it down to several
hundred and also drawn a very
similar-looking diagram to yours and
suppose you say well lime green
represents our they are finalists
environmental sustainability submissions
so let's see how if they're any of mine
that really support some of yours and so
you're looking for a connection in this
domain and the next connection you draw
becomes much more important because
you're now connecting to superclusters
the third principle of innovation
networks harness convergence avoid
consensus and other bottlenecks again
our traditional problem-solving model to
hammer out consensus Irving Janis a
professor at Yale University did a
number of case studies of how committees
fail when they have brilliant team
members they still come up with
unsatisfactory decisions and one of his
key findings was that the reason these
teams fail is because of pressure for
consensus and we know from evolution
that extensive hybridization can destroy
genetic raw material thereby weakening
the system and so the operative
principle here is the idea of
collaborative autonomy in other words
how do you value the diversity and
uniqueness of the different participants
on the team and so when you're building
an innovation network you have your core
team members who are champions of a
particular idea and the ripple out to
those who can provide technical
support and resources and other skills
to make the project succeed but as you
build that team each individual player
is unique and makes a unique
contribution to the process fourth
principle of innovation networks use
tolerance spectra as opportunity windows
again our traditional engineering view
would specify a machine part to a
standard of accuracy an allowable
deviation or margin of error but that's
the analytic view which needs to be
complemented by the design view which
calls for tolerance for deviation and in
evolution of course random variation has
to occur within a system able to accept
and use that variation so design
tolerates ranges of deviation and of
course in evolution speciation plays the
role of determining the limits of
Tolerance maintains flexible boundaries
retains material with future potential
optimizes the range of variation from
the norm embed standards in
decision-making criteria that determine
what to accept or reject the central
principle of innovation networks and its
central for a reason because variation
is the source of novelty and evolution
in the question on the table is whether
that variation is simply random or
weather pattern recognition in context
plays a role and certainly an innovation
the need to interpret new ideas in
context is extremely important unless we
think that is is the term of Science and
Engineering and as is simply the
metaphorical domain of design I want to
quote three very serious thinkers who
spoke about the importance of as
Vannevar Bush who was a pioneer of
analog computing and developing the
Memex we remember for his
article as we may think and Bush was
contrasting the taxonomy systems of
categorizing and the artificiality of
these systems of indexing with how the
human mind really works he said the
human mind does not work that way it
operates by association with one item in
it in its grasp it snaps instantly to
the next that is suggested by the
association of thoughts in accordance
with some intricate web of trails
carried by the cells of the brain
stanislaw lula mathematician and good
friends with cyber natisha john von
neumann was recruited by von neumann to
work with him at Los Alamos and during
that period Stanislaw ulam said to his
friend John von Neumann what makes you
so sure that mathematical logic
corresponds to the way we think the time
has come to enrich formal logic by
adding to it some other fundamental
notions what is it that you see when you
see you see an object as a key you see
some sheets of paper as a book it is the
word as that must be mathematically
formalized on a par with the connectives
and or implies and not that have already
been accepted into formal logic and
finally Graham Karen Smith chemist known
for his clay theory of the origin of
life worked with the highly structured
kala night clay and noted that this clay
replicates itself templating layer upon
layer and that as these layers replicate
one upon the other random variation
occurs and environmental selection then
chooses the clay configurations able to
maintain optimum porosity for the
continued persistence and replication of
that particular configuration of clay
and so he noted that Darwinian evolution
was operating in a non living system and
though Karen Smith
hypothesis of a clay origin of life is
not widely accepted his idea that
evolution came first and invented life
is taken very seriously and of course
the question that that raises is if a
nonliving system was evolving itself to
become alive how would we characterize
that threshold point when non-life came
to life and I would propose that that
moment would be characterized by
autonomy and pattern recognition in
other words it would be the moment when
pure Darwinian evolution of random
variation and external environmental
selection was no longer sufficient Karen
Smith has also offered some other
theories that support the importance of
as his theory of genetic take over the
idea that evolution develops a
particular function and then comes up
with a better way to fulfill that
function and substitutes or develops a
particular material like bone as a
structural material and then uses that
material as a vehicle for sound
transmission in the mammalian ear for
example Charles Sherrington said between
the perceiving mind and the perceived
world is there nothing in common we call
them disparate and incommensurable
nature in evolving us makes them two
parts of one mind and that one mind is
our own we are the tie between them
perhaps that is why we exist so the is
world deals with what is actual the as
world with what is perceived the is
world with the competition dynamic the
as world with the collaboration dynamic
the is world with survival of the
fittest objects the as world with
utility and performance the is world
with objects and their genetics the as
world with process and behavior the is
world with assessment of the fittest
objects the as world with pattern
recognition of possibility the is world
with design with a capital d
as world design as self organization so
we easily accept the complementarity of
left brain and right brain thinking
wouldn't it be logical if evolution
which invented our brains operated
through a dynamic a creative process
that was comparable to this dynamic that
we see in our own brains and so the
left-hand side of this diagram shows the
more widely accepted views about
evolution Malthusian dynamics of
exponential population growth and
resource depletion which initially
inspired Darwin and of course one of
darwin's great contributions was a
theory of extinction and though the
intelligent design community in the
Darwinists community are at each other's
throats they in fact have exactly the
same position on what I think is the
most important point namely both View
Life as passive whether life was
designed by an intelligent designer or
through random variation and external X
selection in either case life played no
role in designing itself whereas the
theories on the right hand side of this
chart and I have vastly oversimplified
this chart in order to make it clear
there many other theories and other
theories on the right-hand side include
endosymbiosis and symbiogenesis and so
on but on the macro level the theory put
forward by physicist james lovelock who
was working for nasa examining the
spectral signatures of nearby planets
Mercury and Venus and he noted that
these planets had the signatures of dead
planets perfect stasis in contrast to
Earth's atmosphere and where he noted
that earth was maintaining itself in a
far from equilibrium condition which led
him to hypothesize
that earth together with its atmosphere
should be viewed as a living system and
when he first put forward this
hypothesis in 1972 the scientific
community simply dismissed it but now
many serious scientists including Nobel
laureate Christian to do Freeman Dyson
Louis Thomas Lynn Margulis many others
acknowledge that he made a very
important contribution on the micro
level we have facilitated the theory of
facilitated variation which complements
the conventional view of random
variation bringing us to the sixth
principle of innovation networks the
capacity to assess interim performance
which may not yet be testable if we look
at the timeline of evolution the earth
probably formed about 4.5 billion years
ago the origin of life was about 3.8
billion years ago a whole nother billion
years to get to Luca our last Universal
common ancestor and yet another billion
years to get to the first eukaryotic
cell 1.5 billion years ago multicellular
creatures appeared first on earth and
600 million years ago was the Cambrian
explosion with a huge diversity of life
on Earth and the human species has only
existed at the end of this chart for two
and a half million years and so the
immediate view is there's an incredible
process of acceleration here we are from
the origin of life for more than two
billion years there were only
single-celled organisms now a variation
were simply random it would be very hard
to explain that acceleration so the
question is what was going on during the
two billion years from the origin of
life to the origin of eukaryotic cells
and the theory of facilitated variation
helps us to understand the this nature
of acceleration professor Mark kirschner
chair of the Department of systems
biology at Harvard in his collaborator
professor John Gerhart at UC Berkeley
have
produced a grand synthesis bringing
together a lot of different research in
biology and suggested the need for the
two relatively non communing
communicating strands of biology the the
evil strand of the people who look at
evolutionary theory from a macro level
and the DeVos strand of the cell
biologists and and biochemists need to
start communicating because they propose
that really the secrets of evolution
reside in the cellular at the cellular
level and their study I'm going to
vastly simplified just to make two
primary points there's their study
forces us to move beyond an object view
of evolution that evolution is simply
churning out these objects which are
being tested for survival of the fittest
to a process view of evolution because
evolutions are also inventing processes
and conserved core processes like
cellular replication metabolism
signaling were then conserved and
transmitted forward and enabled the
evolutionary process to accelerate as it
became less and less random and there's
second point of the this connection
between developmental biology and
evolutionary biology is that it's not
simply the organism is born with its
genetic inheritance and then either
survives and reproduces or doesn't what
occurs during its lifespan its own
developmental mechanisms through which
it adapts to its environment and many of
these mechanisms are at the cellular
level play a critical function in how
evolution progresses and what survives
and doesn't so this brings us to the
sixth principle of innovation networks
recognize patterns in partial data
anybody who's worked on visual pattern
recognition knows how hard that problem
is the traditional view would say that
improved adaptation and survival of the
fittest explains how evolution generally
advanced toward complexity
the additional view suggested is that
life as a pattern recognition
participates in driving its own
advancement toward complexity that both
life and the environment select
effective patterns so the seventh view
of principle of innovation networks join
autonomous components into collaborative
emergent networks again looking at that
time line and right in this center
between the origin of life and the
origin of the eukaryotic cell is Luca
our last Universal common ancestor she
is of great interest to origin of life
theorists because she marks the moment
when our Universal genetic code became a
universal standard and so the question
is how did she come into existence well
the traditional evolutionary view act
which correlates with the traditional
view of problem solving would be that
there are all these early organisms with
different genetic codes they were all
competing for survival of the fittest
and eventually the superior code one out
and became the universal code that was
then transmitted forward through the
tree of life the alternative view that
I'm suggesting as complementary is also
an alternative web based problem
paradigm namely that Luca might be
viewed as the first great open source
software coding experiment and that
these early organisms were swapping code
exchanging code collaborating until they
could finally come up with a universal
standard for our genetic code and so the
traditional view that evolution
progresses through incremental linear
change and competition for survival of
the fittest is really questioned when
you look at the time Lang line and the
obvious continual acceleration of
evolution which could not be simply
random so we need to add
additional principle that evolution
progresses through continual
collaboration enabling new invention and
its integration a wonderful study of
this by Professor Leo bus at Yale the
his book the evolution of individuality
shows how from the earliest level the
collaboration of components enabled
evolution to jump to the next level of
complexity and of course the traditional
view if it were correct that evolution
was simply a matter of replication and
survival of the fittest then prokaryotic
bacteria do that extremely well there
would have been no need for evolution to
advance toward complexity so I want to
give an example of a problem where these
principles apply and this is work that I
did for the city of kawasaki japan an
industrial city outside tokyo that at
this time had very visionary leadership
and so what I put together was a an
innovation network comprised of 16
components addressing 16 different urban
problems and different sectors of the
population the idea was that these
components all had collaborative
autonomy but they were all networked
with each other and able to support each
other and so for example the world
collage bulletin at the top was to
provide a service to decision-makers
enabling them to have at their
fingertips not only examples of
comparable decisions made at other
places in the world but all the data
that they would need as for public
policy or industry leadership or
educational leadership to make wise
decisions for a completely different
sector of the population the performing
arts community in the long tradition of
Japanese festivals I proposed the
festival of dreams to tie in with
Japanese ecotourism bringing people from
all over the world to propose their
ideas of what we could do to make City
he's more livable places and a third
than important sector of the population
the Japanese recognize that their
educational system has become quite
rigid and the importance of cultivating
creativity in the young and so I
proposed the children's story exchange
which would tap the outstanding ability
of children to appreciate stories and to
tell stories about their culture to
children of other cultures of course now
we finally have automated language
translation that might make this
possible so that's just three of the
components out of the 16 the core
components were a center for innovation
the Globe Theatre I this growing out of
my work with Buckminster Fuller I'm
visited a planetarium that would have a
map of the earth from inside and where
you could bring together problem solving
teams are sort of 21st century world
game rendition that could project data
sets for different problem solving
challenges and then project out from
that hub to the rest of the world via
the internet and take back information
obviously striving for World Harmony to
address our ongoing problem of world
peace and finally the intelligent
integrating system and I did this work
before Google came into existence but I
must have intuited that there would
someday be a great organization with the
capacity to develop an intelligent
integrating system so the last principle
of innovation networks converge toward
innovation by seeking coherence I have
been talking about the types of problems
for which there is no clear consensus
and it where it's impossible to state a
definite goal state global warming is a
very noteworthy example of how our
conventional problem solving paradigm
has failed us in other words the
assumption that we had to have
consensus about what was going on with
global warming before we could do
anything and so we need to be able to
harness prediction in a new way I
suggest that the the interpretation
commonly held of evolution is the result
of a particular interpretive filter and
in fact stephen jay gould suggested that
Darwinian evolution might be viewed as
an extended analogy to Adam Smith's
Wealth of Nations written 83 years
earlier 1776 which so if true then of
course capitalism and industrialism were
on the rise when Darwin published his
theory and perhaps we adopted you that
is now anachronistic garrett hardin in
1968 published his classic in the
journal science on the tragedy of the
commons and showed we're the fallacious
logic of this particular interpretation
leads in other words the notion that
competition for survival of the fittest
is an effective modus operandi and for
example if each fisherman buys more and
more boats and more and more technology
so he can catch more and more fish
collectively this behavior could fish
out the ocean so that there would be no
fish for anyone so that's what's meant
by the tragedy of the Commons which we
face in many domains today but we also
have unique capabilities the self-aware
technology geo where technology's web
2.0 social networks that we could
harness to this challenge and of course
the burgeoning green economy and
responsible entrepreneurship and I'm
suggesting that a revision of
buckminster fuller's concept of world
game a new world game could play an
important role by harnessing our
capacity as speculators so we face the
paradox of prediction and the
problematic first category of prediction
tional Association of prediction is
aiming for certainty valuing precision
in engineering in the hard sciences
complemented by the probabilistic
prediction requiring statistical
inference in the biological sciences
both of these forms of prediction are
typically assumed to be passive in other
words that prediction will have no
effect on what is predicted but as we
move to the third category future
forecasting and trend watching we've
just had a national election and we know
that what the media predicts can
influence voter behavior and hence the
outcome of the election and so the
fourth category which pertains to
evolution and innovation is I think
particularly important now in that this
is the category where we marry
prediction with speculation and
prediction and understand that
prediction is really representing our
understanding now so harnessing that
fourth category as a we visioning of
buckminster fuller's world game would do
brings up the challenge that to develop
a human computer collaboratory an
innovation network toward global
sustainability I think that this is the
challenge for which EO wilson whom i
quoted at the outset wrote the mission
statement and that we now with google
have an organization that is uniquely
positioned to inspire and to develop the
integrating the intelligent integrating
system to support this challenge so
that's where i end and the global mind
shift begins thank you
I don't know how we're doing timewise do
we have questions or do we have another
questions comments
well that we are part of evolution oh so
the question was why do we need people
if evolution did this all so far why
would people need to do something well
they just the process of evolution thus
far has produced us and through but what
I'm saying is that life has been active
through this entire process of evolution
in other words if we assume the
conventional model that evolution that
we are completely passive that life is
completely passive then we have no
responsibility whatsoever for the
direction into the future but if in fact
life all along has been active you know
just as active as the P hands were in
inventing the Peacocks tail then we have
a responsibility we have a role to play
you had a point um yeah in fact
yeah very very good point so the point
made did you want to get this on the
record was the the idea of memes and
that that memes also need to be
propagated in other words ideas need to
participate in the evolutionary process
sent some summary other points questions
point yeah yeah ok so the mention of Ray
Kurzweil in the singularity community of
course they tend to act as if this
technology acceleration is a new thing
and I think the point I would want to
make is that that dynamic is embedded in
evolution itself and yes we are simply
continuing that dynamic through the
acceleration of technology and and the
propagation of means and the question is
you know how we're going to engage in
that process and I think that that we
have minds for a reason and maybe we
could use them effectively yeah other
that I not adequately represent your
point yeah do you feel that they have
you something in the singularity
community that you think is particularly
valuable that needs to be added here
yeah yeah I i think the singularity i
mean that the particular use of that
term comes from vern avenges paper in
which he delivered at nasa in 1993 and
an interesting point there is that the
common view or the common way that that
his use of that term has been
interpreted is singularity marks the
moment when computers will exceed human
intelligence but he actually makes
multiple points in that paper and the
point that i think is most interesting
is that that one of the possible options
he suggested was human-computer
collaboration and the idea of a network
to global brain that would achieve that
that is singularity and to me that's the
challenge worth working on yeah
thank you
