Daniel rabitor who is the director of
the public patent foundation and the
public patent foundation I think has a
very important role in our system in the
United States it gives the it gives the
public voice and injects the public
voice into the patent system and into
the legal frameworks one could say that
they found out the foundation is really
tasked with protecting some of the
freedoms and rights that are not so
often explicitly spelled that the public
should enjoy from this system Daniel is
a lecturer as well the Benjamin Cardozo
School of Law and let's see I'm
breathing here he started his patent law
practice with Skadden ab Slate Meagher
from Flom LLP and then he worked at a
couple of other law firms here I'm going
to skip this at the US Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC
he is a registered patent attorney and
he writes and speaks frequently on
patent law including testifying before
the US Congress and the topic of patent
reform and as a result of his
accomplishments and professional
reputation of P and intellectual
property let's see I think we should
welcome Daniel and list here from him
what he has to say about the defense of
the public patent system thank you
Thank You Boris thanks for having me
here and thanks for all of you for
coming before I get started just like
you say I'm very impressed I've never
been the Google's campus before I really
like the atmosphere here just had lunch
in the cafeteria I think you guys I'm
very very pleased to have been asked to
come here and I'm very impressed by what
what you guys have going on here so I'm
here to talk about the patent system and
about my organization's role therein but
before we get to that topic let's just
make sure we're all on the same page
because maybe not everyone here is the
same familiarity with patents by
definition a patent is a government
granted exclusive right for a limited
term now you may have heard other words
used to describe what a patent is you
may have heard the words intellectual
property you may have heard just the
word property all these things those are
more atmospheric type marketing words
the true definition of patent is it's a
government granted exclusive right for a
limited term so we're all in the same
page of what a patent is now why does
the government do this how many people
are generally in favor of the government
granting exclusive rights to other
people to do things you like government
granting exclusive rights how many
people do not like the government
granting exclusive rights to people okay
I'm with that group I'm more of a
conservative I generally don't like the
government saying the borås is the only
one allowed to wear brown belts and no
one else has the right to wear brown
belts without Boris's permission I
generally believe in freedom and that
people should be allowed to do whatever
they want to do although there are times
when government needs to act the role of
law as you learn in one of your first
days of law school is to solve
collective action problems how many
people here have heard of what a
collective action problem is right so
this is a collective action problem is
when if we all did what we wanted we
would make the world a better I'm a
worse place and so we all need to come
together and agree not to do that thing
so example we'd all be better off
driving on the 101 at 100 miles per hour
because we get to where we're going
faster we get to send more time with our
loved ones and friends and the world
would be a better place for us
but if everyone in this room and
everyone out there on the 101 freeway
drove 100 miles per hour the world will
be worse because there'd be more
accidents safety would go down there'd
be injuries there'd be more pollution
and so to solve this collective action
problem which is a way to get people to
agree to not do something that's in
their own self-interest because if
everyone does it it's to society's
negative interest is to pass law so the
only purpose of law is to solve
collective action problems so what is
the collective action problem that
patent law is meant to address well many
people think or say and mean and even
believe that it's to incentivize
innovation that if we don't grant these
exclusive rights for a limited term
people won't make an investment into
developing new technologies because if
there is no exclusive right once they
develop this new technology they will be
free ridden upon by everyone else who
didn't make those investments and the
initial developer won't be able to
recoup that investment that they made
and thus no one will ever have the first
mover disadvantage of being the one to
make the investment to blazed the trail
if everyone else is allowed to come
along but that's actually not the
purpose of the patent system the purpose
of the patent system is to advance the
state of technology available to the
public now some people think well that's
two of the same things I can show you
that they're not exactly the same
although sometimes they're frequently
aligned if we were to make patents last
for a million years and we were to make
patents punishable by death that would
incentivize more innovation than our
current patent system because patents
only last 20 years and they're only
enforceable for money damages
does anyone dispute that enlarging the
power or the remedies available for
patent infringement would increase the
incentives to innovate right so there is
an increase in the incentive to innovate
but we don't do that because that's not
the true purpose of the patent system
the true purpose is to balance the
incentive with the ultimate disclosure
and the freedom to access that
disclosure once the limited term
yNN's and just to ask what other people
think about the purpose of the patent
system we can look at this little
document called the Constitution which
some people think is relevant and Thomas
Jefferson what he had to say so when you
get into debates with people about the
patent system they frequently corner
their debate on this
well you if you reduce the strength of
patents you'll decrease the incentive to
innovate which I usually respond with
saying okay you've convinced me I've
changed my mind let's make patent
infringement punishable by death and
let's make patents last a million years
and pretty soon they get the point I'm
making by that absurd example okay so
critical legal theory is like doing
physics and including friction right
most physics you learn you learn without
taking into consideration friction but
friction is a real-world thing so you
can't solve real world problems with
basic physics because it doesn't take
into account real-world practicalities
critical legal theory borrows the same
concept which says there are personal
self interests which malign people from
doing what they should do or which we
could expect people to do this is like
corruption right political officials
have personal incentive to take bribes
because then they have more money so
that is a problem of the legal system
that has to be taken into account when
creating a legal system because if you
create a system that is susceptible to
such collective action problems again
this is someone doing what's best for
them even though it's worse for society
then your legal system won't withstand
scrutiny some of the collective action
problems within the patent system today
is we have an arms race incentive and
what do I mean by that if my competitor
gets more patents then I am incentivized
to get is just as many patents if not
more because I need to defend myself and
in return they're gonna have to get more
and neither of us are incentivized to
have a moderate level of patents because
the other guys always going to want to
have more than me so they have less risk
of being sued for infringement than me
or that they have more threats that they
can make against me
pollution this is a typical collective
action problem in the environmental law
space and also in the patent law space
we don't have incentives ourselves to
make sure the patents we get are really
strong and valid
we have incentives to get all types of
patents including those which are of
questionable validity because even a
questionable validity patent is better
than no patent at all let's make an
example if a store was giving out
lottery tickets and only some of the
lottery tickets they were giving out
were winners are you incentivized to
take as many lottery tickets as you can
get even knowing some of them will be
losers
of course you're incentivized to take as
many things you can get assuming the
transaction cost of getting them is low
enough and then you can muddle through
to find out which lottery tickets are
winners and which ones aren't so in
order to address the concerns of a
critical legal theorist you have to have
procedural checks and balances which
ensure that the system is not subject to
these failings of the collective action
problem for the actors and in the patent
system this means basically two things
we have to ensure high patent quality or
high quality of decision making within
the patent system which means we don't
allow decision to be influenced by
corruption we don't allow decisions to
be influenced by being overburdened we
make decisions based on substantive
deliberative contemplative thought and
we also need balanced policies now how
do you come up with a fair and balanced
policy other than turning into Fox News
well traditionally the way you address
this issue is you ensure that all of the
interests which are affected by the
legal system are present in policy
making decisions right everyone should
speak their turn and then the policy
decision makers get to decide where to
draw the line and not always
everyone's gonna win if everyone's heard
the quote you know democracy is two
wolves and a lamb deciding on what they
have for dinner and liberty is the lamb
being well armed with persuasion and
facts to try to carry his day so you
can't always get what you want but if
the system incorporates all of the
affected interests and what they want
and what they
think is good for them then you have to
have faith that the policymakers will do
what's best for all of society which
includes all those interests so who all
needs to be at the included in
policymaking decisions in the patent
system who are the interests affected by
the patent system generally these are
the only three categories which people
can think of patent holders patent
lawyers and those people accused of
patent infringement
most people think if you're to draw a
list of who's everyone that gets
impacted by the patent system if you're
not one of these three people then the
patent system doesn't impact you well I
think that's wrong I think it's leaving
one big group out of the question and
therefore if you're leaving one group of
affected people out of the policy-making
process your policy isn't going to be
balanced for everyone in society and
that group is the public we're gonna
come back to some examples of how I see
the public gets impacted by the patent
system even if your grandmother has no
idea what a patent is she still can be
impacted by the patent system okay so
before I get to that let's just take a
few years back and go through a little
bit of history about where the patent
system has been about half a century ago
40 years ago patents were under severe
attack the entire idea of patents were
completely rejected and uncomfortable
there was an extreme skepticism about
exclusive rights so the second group of
people who raised their hand saying they
don't like the government giving
monopolies to people this is what we had
pre pre-eminently throughout the legal
world in the 60s and 70s part of this
was driven by the express vision of how
a patent was inhibiting competition
there was one patent holder using a
patent to keep another competitor off
the market and this resulted in
increased prices less competition less
innovation etc this is also coincided
with the height of antitrust law in the
United States and the law and economic
movement was just at its infancy have
anyone here ever heard of the law and
economics move
okay this is a theory of legal
justification that's tried to move away
from morality which is traditionally
been the justification for law making
society better by solving collective
action problems this is a school of
legal theory coming out of Chicago which
says law should not be driven by morals
because those are arguable law should be
driven by what's financially good for
society
so whatever makes more money for society
is better whatever makes more money for
companies whatever creates more jobs is
better and that's the law we should have
and we should give up this fight over
what's good and evil
well this movement didn't come to
preeminence until the 80s so at this
point there wasn't this arm of legal
theory contrasting the anti exclusive
rights feeling so the result was severe
oversight and hostility towards patents
now in response the law in Econ movement
started getting published and recognized
and there started to be this divergent
view of exclusive rights just like when
I asked the question the beginning and
some people said they're in favor of
exclusive rights and some people said
they're opposed reasonable Minds can
disagree so there wasn't this
categorical skepticism over the grant of
exclusive rights there are also special
interests expressing the benefits to
themselves of patents does anyone here
want to guess an example of a special
interest which is benefited by patents
anyone want to guess so this drive
towards patents help us and we're big
companies and there's a debate going on
about the pros and cons of exclusive
rights and look at all the economic
benefit that patents provide resulted in
a dramatic shift from oversight and
hostility to unashamed unabashed
expansion of the patent system in the
80s and the 90s and perhaps the largest
example of this expansion was patent
holders went to Congress and they bought
themselves a home court advantage pretty
nice and the general legal system
you have a trial in your geographical
area so there's what are called district
courts throughout the country every
state has at least one and you do a
trial in federal court in your local
geographic area and then when you appeal
that you have a right to appeal to
what's called a court of appeals and
there are 13 various courts of appeals
throughout the country California is in
the ninth circuit along with Oregon and
Washington and Nevada and so you then
appeal your case to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals so there's a patent
case in California it used to go to the
Ninth Circuit there is a patent case in
New York it would go to what's the
Second Circuit if there is a patent case
in Florida it would go to the Eleventh
Circuit and this is traditionally how
federal law gets developed because then
if the Ninth Circuit and the Second
Circuit disagree on an issue the Supreme
Court sits above them to solve what are
called circuit splits where you have two
circuit decisions which are different
from one another and the role of the
Supreme Court over all the circuit
courts is to solve that problem
well patentees were not doing very well
in court they were losing time and time
and time and time again so they went to
Congress and said we need a specific
Court of Appeals to take all patent
cases from anywhere in the country and
this one exclusive Court of Appeals will
hear all patent appeals and you need to
make the judges on that court understand
how good patents are and how good for
society patents are so Congress was more
than happy to oblige and we had created
in 1982 the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit instead of the ninth
circuit or 11th circuit CAFC
this court had created about 25 years
ago has routinely and categorically
issued opinion after opinion after
opinion which have expanded patent law
now even when they do things that some
of us believe conflict with Supreme
Court precedent the Supreme Court has
generally been unable to get involved
because we don't have these circuit
splits between the federal circuit and
any other circuit because no other
circuit is hearing patent cases so in
this essence the CAFC had become the
facto Supreme Court for patent cases and
they were stuffed at least initially the
CAFC was with judges who were very Pro
patentee in fact several the judges were
legislative staff to the Congress people
who created the CAFC
so where are we today in the patent
system we have law which is exactly like
law in all other systems there's a
general fundamental theorem of law which
says the easiest type of law to get
created is that which benefits a small
concentrated group while harming a large
diverse group now why is that the case
well the small concentrated group of
beneficiaries each derive more profit
from this law or proposed law and
therefore have more resources to lobby
Congress do marketing PR whatever to
advance or advocate their position where
is the large diverse group of people who
are each paying a much smaller amount of
cost
none of them are incentivized to fight
the movement of the law against their
interests I already discussed the
judicial bias of pro patents and patent
expansions of CAFC
and the USPTO which is the
administrative agency relevant in the
patent system itself has been directed
by congressional and judicial bias
towards patent systems to implement
policies and make decisions in favor of
patents so nowhere in here if we go back
a few slides so we have patentees they
are part of the small group which
benefit from patents patent lawyers like
myself I have a job because of the
patent system so I'm generally in favor
of its existence so there's part of the
small group that benefits from the
patent system accused infringers now you
would think they'd be part of the people
who are opposed to the patent system but
in reality a lot of the accused
infringers are part of the first group
patentees themselves so while they may
want some time
a little bit of fixing of the system
they're generally in favor of an
enlargement of the system just like
patentees because they are patentees
themselves but the public's interests in
the patent system are not being
represented so when the three branches
of government failed to represent the
public interest what traditionally
happens and has happened over time is
you have civil society or public
interest groups created and that's why I
left private practice some five years
ago to start my organization which is a
501 C 3 non-profit whose mission is to
represent the public's otherwise
unrepresented interests in the patent
system and particularly the public's
interest against low quality and
unbalanced policy now there are two main
concerns that I and my board and staff
have one is the threat the patent system
poses to the public's economic interest
the other is the threats to civil
liberties now I'm gonna get into more
specifics in just a minute so if you
want some examples just hold on now what
we do when we determine there's a threat
worth our time and effort is if there's
a specific patent or group of patents
which are causing an extremely harmful
threat to society we will undertake an
administrative procedure to challenge
those patents the Administrative
Procedure is called a re-examination we
do our own scientific and technical
research into the patent to see if it's
valid and if we believe it isn't we send
evidence to the PTO asking them to
revoke the patent because if we have
found some new evidence that proves it
wasn't a new idea or it wasn't a none
obvious idea for a class of threats we
will advocate for a change in policy so
that those threats are addressed up at
the beginning of the process not
downstream that's the specific patent
stage okay so what are some examples of
patents that have caused economic threat
to the public one large area where
patents harm the public is in the
pharmaceutical industry
patents are used by pharmaceutical
companies to bar entry of competitors
and namely brand-name Pharma uses
patents to preclude generics from
entering the market
this causes a net negative if the patent
is unjustified that is an undeserved
monopoly and so the pharmaceutical
company is seeking what's called rents
or extracting undeserved profits from
the marketplace by being able to charge
this undeserved monopoly and taking
those profits out of society so when
Medicare pays for prescription drugs or
your health insurance is more expensive
paying for prescription drugs because of
an undeserved monopoly that's a net
negative economic effect on society
human embryonic stem cells there's one
patentee which owns a collection of
patents on basic human embryonic stem
cells and whatever form they exist they
were using these patents to preclude
other people from doing research I think
that harms the public I think it's good
for the public for anyone who wants to
do research to be allowed to do it and I
don't think patent law whose purpose is
to advance science should be used as a
tool to preclude anyone else from doing
research Monsanto is a large
agricultural company they had patents on
modified beans or modified seeds and
farmers would buy these seeds plant them
save some for the next season and plant
those well Monsanto said that was patent
infringement and they to run around
suing dozens of farmers putting many of
them in bankruptcy and taking their
family farms because they said well what
you're doing violates our patents
because you still are making and using
our patented modified seats now my
concern in this case wasn't so much on
the substance of the patents but on the
fact that a lot of these farmers didn't
have the resources to even hire a
defense you shouldn't be allowed to win
a legal case just because your other
side can't hire lawyers I think there's
something fundamentally unfair about
that and software and business method
patents we have to ask and there's a
healthy debate going on including a book
by Besson and mirror which
recently published about whether or not
introducing patents into these
industries causes an increase in
innovation or a decrease in innovation
so let's ask a couple people who have
been in the software industry what they
think and I'll let you read the quote
for a minute if anyone wants to take a
guess I don't have any prize to offer
you but other than the respect and
admiration of your peers right so this
is one that people have heard a lot so
Bill Gates said we are forced to patent
as much as we can the sound this is the
arms race which I mentioned earlier
right we're encouraged to waste all this
money getting as many patents as we can
I thought this is a very honest
statement and this is a very helpful
statement okay here's a harder one that
one was easy this is the advanced class
don't be shy if you have a guess yell it
out
no guesses come on who know Boris said
you people were smart come on yeah
that's a hard one
that's pretty obscure people have heard
of Cisco right so this is pretty don't
listen to what Dan ravisher has to say
about software patents listen to people
actually in the software industry what
they say about patents and they say
there are a waste of time and money
we're not doing any more innovation than
we would otherwise because we're
incentivized not by patents we're
incentivized by the needs of our
customers in the marketplace so one has
to ask is there a legitimate reason to
have patents and industries that cause a
drag on innovation instead of a spur to
innovation so what are some policies
that I frequently proposed and that you
could debate yourself that would help
protect economic interest one would to
eliminate injunctions as a matter of law
if we look at patent law purely as an
economic vehicle then so long as the
defendant is capable of paying some
amount of money they should be allowed
to do what they want so here's a
hypothetical let's say I had a patent on
the cure for eight now there's nothing
in patent law but it requires me to make
this cure for AIDS or to allow anyone
else to make the cure for AIDS I can sit
on it and I can laugh at all the people
with AIDS if I want to okay now let's
say Boris came along and he wanted to
make the cure for AIDS available to
people in the United States I can sue
him and get an injunction to prevent him
from doing that how many people think
that makes sense yeah it's ridiculous
okay but injunctions make patents
stronger and that benefits this small
concentrated group of patentees so
anytime you talk about restraining
injunctions or possibly even eliminating
them because they make no economic sense
they get very threatened and they say
you're going to decrease the incentives
for innovation and pharmaceutical we're
never going to come up with new
pharmaceutical drugs and all these kind
of parade of Horrible's but if you think
about it economically there's no
economic justification sure as long as
there's a price and a judge's job
is to decide what's a fair price for
Boris to pay me to practice my patent
I'm not saying Bohr should be allowed to
do it for free but we should go to court
and the judge should decide what a fair
price is but I shouldn't be allowed to
preclude someone from practicing my
technology this goes back to the
software one if patents aren't
increasing the rate of innovation in an
industry they should get their nose out
of it
that's an extreme position I know but
it's one that I hold on to there should
be an exception from patent law for
research how many people here today
thought there was an exception to patent
infringement for research
lots of people right it's a common
misconception don't feel bad lots of
people think how could the patent system
which is supposed to encourage research
be used to actually stop research it's
true there is absolutely no exception
from patent infringement for research
that seems ridiculous to me now of
course if after your research you've
come up with a marketable commercial
product now you need to negotiate with
the patentee for a license but why
should the patentee in the human
embryonic stem cell case be the only one
allowed to do human embryonic stem cell
research
they shouldn't that doesn't make sense
and we also have to make sure that the
procedural goals of the patent system
are accomplished and that's not that's
not a non-sequitur that's not it's
something to be taken for granted it's
very difficult to address abuse and
manipulation and gave them in ship in
any legal system okay so what in what
ways if any do patents threaten civil
liberties well there are two types of
freedoms there's procedural freedoms and
substantive freedoms and most non
lawyers don't even recognize procedural
freedoms they think of substance rooms
like freedom of speech freedom of the
press procedural freedoms you know as
the right to a fair trial the right to a
jury trial the right to be represented
if you're arrested and accused of a
crime these are rights that you have in
a fair process and in the Monsanto
farmer case I'm concerned about the
procedural harms caused when a patentee
who is well resourced alleges patent
infringement against a defendant who
can't even afford to hire an attorney to
defend them I think that's unfair and I
think that's a perverse violation
they're right to be fairly represented
in court we see this also in the
software space we see patent holders who
go around intentionally suing single or
- - person owned websites for patent
infringement
they'll send them nasty letters or
they're filed lawsuits against them
knowing that that defendant has no
ability to hire an attorney to come and
defend them and they're basically at the
whim of the patentee to accept some type
of $50,000 $100,000 payoff to go away in
addition to the procedural concerns that
I have there are also substantive
constitutional concerns that I have
about the patent system so what are some
examples I know if you guys can read
this or not this is a patent issued in
2001 on a method and apparatus for
delivering electronic advocacy messages
everyone see the title how many people
have never seen a patent before
everyone's seen a patent before so this
is an example of what the patent is
trying to cover dear representative I
think you should vote yea or nay on a
particular bill this scares me a little
bit it scares me that the United States
government is saying
junot online services is the only party
in all of America allowed to do this
thing and if you want to do this thing
which is send email to your
representative asking them to vote yay
or nay you need to go call up juno and
ask them how much it's gonna cost now
people say but dan you're you're Chicken
Little right Juno would never assert
this patent I'd rather not exist in the
first place why doesn't why does it
exist in the first thing this shouldn't
this type of a patent should not exist
it should not be a patent on how to
email your elected representatives to
express your position on some law ok
what's another example this is an
electronic voting system pattern
and for those of you that may or may not
know the boundaries of a patent the
legal four corners of the patent are
defined by single sentences at the very
end and these single sentences are
called claims and they actually start
with the language I claim a table having
a top and four legs and therefore you
just go around you say do you have a top
and four legs if yes you infringe my
patent if no you don't so here is the
first claim of this patent I'll give
everyone just a minute to read it
through
I'm sorry for you guys in the back you
can't read the text so basically this is
an electronic voting system with a
computer an absentee ballot manager
agent sounds like software to me or
maybe it's just some guy with a pencil
either way we're not sure a mobile
memory unit a paper ballot the absentee
ballot manager agent has a means for
creating electronic representation of
the ballot and storing the results in
the database now who thinks the owner of
this patent should be the only person in
all of America to be able to do this
thing somebody owns stock in this
company I never even heard of them
before so when someone says patents can
never influence my right to vote patents
can never influence my right to freedom
of speech to advocate my legal opinions
to my representatives they don't know
what they're talking about now here's a
here's a really obscure one anyone want
to guess what this is a patent on
this is a patent on one of the most
safest and effective ways for a woman to
undertake her constitutional right to
have a first trimester abortion right
ru-486 there's nothing in the law that
would preclude this patent from being
acquired by the right-to-life coalition
and using this patent and asserting it
against any woman who wanted to exercise
her constitutional right and preclude
her from using this technology
absolutely no defense how many people
have a problem with that I have a
problem with that you don't have to
express your political opinions in front
of your peers if you don't want to I
have a problem with that yeah it expired
in 2006 right but you can sue people for
six years but tomorrow there may be a
another safer and a more effective but
good catch maybe these people are smart
the question was the patent is issued in
1986 so isn't the threat almost over yes
so what are some policies that I
advocate that could help protect civil
liberties from the patent system one is
anything that relates to the exercise of
a civil liberty should be excluded from
patentable subject matter that's pretty
simple secondly how many people have
heard of fair use right it only exists
in copyright and Trademark there's no
such thing as a fair use of patents I
think that's wrong I think there should
be a fair use of patents and we also
should ensure that no one loses a patent
case or is forced to pay a license fee
to a patentee simply because they can't
access legal representation okay are
there any lawyers in the room other than
me okay if you had any lawyers one okay
just for you sir one slide now if you
have any lawyers who have friends and
they stink when you start talking about
patents oh you don't know what you're
talking about patents are no big deal
patents don't impact anything just pull
up this patent and this threat is not
over sir this was just issued in 2003 so
for at least the next 15 years no lawyer
in the country is allowed to do this
thing without the permission of Louis
Calvin I think he lives on West 50th
Street which is in my neighborhood
thank you very much for your time be
happy to your questions and comments so
sir
so with regard to software in business
you know method patents I've always
thought that even if they would be
patentable that should be patentable for
a lot less than 20 years I mean is that
a possible way to address some of these
issues is just make certain classes of
you know certain industries or certain
classes of issues have a much shorter
time limit that's a proposal that some
people make of course the problem is you
start getting into line drawing between
what gets twenty years and what gets
seven years all right it's difficult to
say well what is a software patent if
it's purely just an algorithm or a
method patent that's an easier case but
what if it's actually a hardware claim
but the hardware is generic commodity
processor and memory and it's really the
software which is doing the results so
it's hard to draw the line but even
beyond that procedural and critical
legal theorists critique of that
proposal the more important one is that
patents lasting for 20 years aren't a
good thing for the software industry so
making them weaker or less isn't going
to make them more of an incentive right
so they're not an incentive development
if people aren't making advancements
because of the patents today why have
them at all well the answer is because
they make patent attorneys really rich
and they make patent holders really rich
and that's the reason why we have
patents on software and business methods
so what is your organization actually
doing to lobby against you know patents
and software and whatnot we've
participated in several briefs on this
issue including one at the Supreme Court
arguing that patents on software are not
eligible and when you make this case and
people think that you're a little bit
radical and you're not economically
intelligent you can tell them that Eli
Lilly also a large pharmaceutical
and he submitted a brief to the Supreme
Court Microsoft V AT&amp;amp;T arguing that
software should not be patentable so if
I'm crazy for arguing this so is Eli
Lilly and very few people would call Eli
Lilly crazy all right so that's a good
proposal you came up with but I don't
think it addresses the problems which we
could write I mean I look at it as
something if you know if we can't get
them completely abolished maybe there's
a way to you know to at least reduce
their you know their harm okay thank you
very much for your question yes sir with
the upcoming presidential election of
course a lot of rhetoric out of both
sides but do you have an opinion on
which candidate is more likely to
improve the patent system no they'll
both be captured in the same way the
legislative process is by the small
concentrated group of beneficiaries who
express their opinions so unfortunately
I don't on this issue it will not be my
determining factor when I go to the
ballot which in New York I can tell you
my vote is very important yes sir in the
back
so the question was can I comment on the
behavior of some people filing patent
applications and claiming they're only
doing so in a defensive way well I
understand why they're doing that it's
the arms race mentality right it's what
Bill Gates said everyone has to give as
many patents as they can and so I don't
critique people for doing what's in
their interest just like you know I
don't get mad at cockroaches for coming
on my counter when I leave food out
right they're just doing what's in their
natural best interest what I would
suggest to these people is to make their
defensiveness posture something that's
reliable in the public issue a statement
issue a formal binding message saying we
are getting these patents and we promise
never to sue someone for infringement
unless they sue us first
this is Cisco's default policy and it
was well known throughout the industry
that cisco has a no first punch policy
and that's fine I mean we can have the
arms race we can go back to 1980 where
everyone's getting all their weapons and
we have to ask as a society is it worth
like is your job should they fire you so
that they can hire me to file some
patent applications I don't think it's
good for society for me to be working
and you not to be working because I
think you're gonna do more productive
work for society writing code or
whatever it is you do here then I will
by pushing papers into the Patent Office
next question yes sir could you describe
a little bit more how in this example
you have of the ru-486 being used as a
way to perform an abortion how the
patent holder would conduct a lawsuit to
prevent that behavior if there's no
provable monetary loss to the patent
holder it doesn't have to be monetary
loss because they can go after an
injunction and they probably would ensue
women themselves that'd be kind of bad
PR they'd probably sue any manufacturer
of are you 46 now people say yeah but
dan that's not true
if they somebody has a patent on
something then they're definitely making
it right they're not just going to sit
that whole I've got the cure for AIDS
and I'm not gonna make it that's that's
ridiculous hyperbole well if you do a
search for non gas engines who do you
think some of the biggest owners of non
gas engine patents are people who have
no incentive to make non gas engines
because that's disruptive technology to
their business model and so there are
absolutely incentives for people not to
practice their own patents and so in the
ru-486 case they'd probably go after the
manufacturer of the drug or whoever's
paying for the procedure like health
insurance companies for inducement of
infringement you know but they could
there's nothing stopping them from suing
a woman as she walks into a doctor's
office nothing at all stopping them and
they could get an injunction barring her
from doing that thank you for your
question any other questions yes sir so
I spent a year at a patent law firm
writing patents applications as an
engineer and I'm responsible for several
obviously unpatentable pieces of junk so
it became clear three Hail Marys in the
collection it became clear to me that
the the time and resources and ability
available to me was so far outstripped
any patent examiner's time and resources
what what do you propose to do about
that problem
well the Patent Office is absolutely
correct when they say we don't have the
resources to do a good enough job well
that's because the job they're being
told to do by Congress is issue as many
patents as you can as fast as you can
because more patents is good for society
and why is Congress saying this because
the lobbyists who just left their office
with a hundred thousand dollar check
says patents are good for society so
tell the Patent Office that if the
patent office was directed to behave in
a different way they would do so I know
several people have patent office
I think blaming the Patent Office is a
main topic and incorrect view of the
patent problem they're like blaming the
muffler for pollution when it's really
coming from the engine so the Patent
Office is not where the fix happens
because they're not the cause
the problem in fact in the software
business method area not only in the
mid-90s were they fighting against
software and business method patents and
it was the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit that forced them to
allow them they are now again trying to
fight against software and business
method patents and now they have a big
case called Bilski at the CAFC
where they may actually get to CFC to go
back so in a lot of areas I've seen the
patent office is actually trying to do
the best thing they can but they've been
hamstrung on purpose by Congress to do
what lobbyists want them to do which is
benefit the small concentrated group
which profits from patents thank you for
your question well any other questions
or comments thank you one more is there
something that could be done about
professional patent trolls who basically
buy up dead patents and go around
abusing them with no intent to ever
manufacture anything use their relation
to that well I don't have anything
against patent but people call patent
trolls or patent these are companies
whose sole business model is to buy
patents and go around threatening people
or actually suing people and making
money and that's all they do they don't
make any product or service a lot of
these people don't even have phone
numbers they're basically just front
organizations for lawsuits I don't blame
them because they're doing just like the
defense of patenting they're doing
what's in their own financial interest
this is the collective-action problem
they're doing what's best for them even
though it's not good for society for
people to go around
chilling conduct and chilling
researchers by being a drag on resources
so the solution is in some cases
specific threats to address them through
patent challenges and several of the
patents which we've challenged to have
been owned by businesses that you would
call patent trolls but in a more general
way it's to eliminate the threat of
injunctions and say if you're not
practicing your patent you can't get an
injunction from someone else all you can
get is some reasonable royalty rate and
the judge is going to determine that and
I think that would go a long way towards
rewarding these people which they
deserve they invented something they
deserve some reward but they don't
deserve to be a drag on innovation
or have the right or ability to hold up
someone else who does want to make the
cure for AIDS or does want to make
better search technology available so I
don't think you again with the Patent
Office you don't solve the problem at
the patent trolls it's the problem is
caused upstream and that's just where
you're seeing one of the symptoms
and this is our homepage so this is a
list of matters we've done where we've
done specific patent challenges Patriot
Scientific is one example of a patent
licensing company and so is the four
Junt jpg patents which you may have
heard of and then these are some some
advocacy work that we've done as well so
again thank you very much for your time
if you have questions you want to talk
to me in private or email me or give me
a call any time
good morning happy to talk to you thanks
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
