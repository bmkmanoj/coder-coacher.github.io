for coming today we've thinking beyond
borders founder Robin pendola to talk
about his organization and their intent
to develop global leadership through
education there many nonprofits
addressing the symptoms of our greatest
global challenges however there a few
that seek to create proactive
fundamental change thinking about beyond
borders of one of those organizations
Robin has a degree in international
development studies from UCLA and a
Masters of Education from Harvard I
spent 10 years working and teaching in
public schools where he challenged the
students to question their assumptions
about themselves in the world you spent
the last two years with his partners to
develop this innovative approach to
global change so just to let people know
this talk will be public and on the
internets please keep all confidential
questions till after so now without
further ado let me introduce Robin
Pendola hello thank you for coming sorry
for the late start I am Robin pando lee
and i'm one of the founders there are
three of us and one of the founders of
thinking beyond borders chris stockage
is one of the other founders sandy
Pendola is the other founders she's my
wife that's why we have the same name
and I want to thank Kylie for for
hosting us today this is feels like a
great opportunity to speak to folks who
are hopefully of like minds to what
we're doing so thinking beyond borders
i'm here to introduce it to you because
it's i'm sure it's new to all of you but
thinking beyond borders our mission is
to help to create help students become
proactive agents of change who have
global consciousness and who have the
skills to translate their learning into
action that's a lot I'll talk more about
it so we're really what we're really
trying to do is we're trying to address
some really specific problems and we
think that this mission that I just
explained to you will help to address
those specific problems the specific
problems that we're talking about are
pretty huge though I mean we're all
familiar with the familiar looming
disasters right there's global warming
and the possible global destruction that
it could cause not just to humans and to
to our buildings and coastal areas but
to wildlife to the global climate life
as we know it on planet Earth there's
the war in Iraq there's conflicts in
brewing in Iran there's genocide in
Sudan there's global hunger one in five
people in the world live in extreme
poverty unless than a dollar a day so
these are all the familiar looing
disasters that we hear about on a daily
basis that are very real and that people
are working to address right now but a
lot of those things particularly things
like world hunger and and global climate
change these are things that have been
coming for a long time and we haven't
solved them yet we haven't come up with
proactive solutions to prevent these
things from happening and to come up
with solutions that will take us into
the future in a way that's productive we
also have we face a flattening world
where the u.s. consciousness in
particular our public consciousness has
not kept up with the flattening of
production and consumption it hasn't
kept up with the concept that the United
States no longer has these borders
economic borders Geographic borders that
can't be crossed we also live in a world
where we have under-exploited human
potential we live in a time where there
is more wealth there's more
technological ability than ever before
far more than ever before these are
resources that could allow us to address
these huge looming disasters not to
mention that the small disasters the
personal disasters that happen for small
children who live in the inner city in
the United States or for mothers who
live in rural Vietnam or wherever it may
be in the world we have the potential
but it's drastically under exploited
because we don't develop the leadership
that knows how to truly access those
potentials and has the perspective to
understand the world that we live in so
that we can apply those skills we can
apply that technology we can apply that
wealth to actually addressing those
issues effectively and proactively
so thinking beyond borders we're an
educational organization what we intend
to do is we intend to offer gap year
programs students who have graduated
from high school and are deferring their
freshman year of college they spend an
entire academic year with us September
to may beginning in September 2008
that's our first program year and they
travel the world for six months the
first six months of their program
they're going to stop in five separate
core countries for months at a time
doing service learning projects so for
example they'll stop in Bolivia for a
month they'll live with a homestay
family they'll work with one specific
NGO looking at how to provide clean
water to communities that don't
otherwise have access they then head to
India excuse me sis out South Africa
where they work with one NGO working on
HIV and AIDS prevention and they live
with a host family for that month they
then head to India and they work in
sustainable agriculture they head to
China they work in education then they
head to Vietnam and they work in
environmental protection so that at the
end of this six months these students
walk away with a pretty broad
perspective of global cultures the
reality of what it means to live in
communities around the world both urban
and rural they haven't understanding
what the global issues are that we're
facing major global issues and they've
worked with the people that are out
there on the ground working to address
those issues so they have a pretty
pretty solid understanding of what
approaches people are taking what's
working and what isn't they've seen it
firsthand on the ground now as an
educator I can tell you it's important
for students to be able to process this
learning all of these observations so in
between each of these month-long
homestays there's a week-long enrichment
week after Bolivia after their month
they travel to neighboring Peru and they
spend a week trekking to Machu Picchu
during that week they engage different
pieces of the curriculum that challenge
them to reflect on the experiences that
they had in Bolivia not just that they
learn more about Bolivia but they learn
more about themselves in relation to
Bolivia as Americans so they learn more
about the rest of the world and the
lessons that they can learn about the
rest of the world through the
olivion perspective after South Africa
they spend a week in kruger national
park in india depending on the political
situation they're likely to head to sri
lanka where they'll engage in ecotourism
activities so you can see how these this
program is really arranged to give
students a very very expansive
experience around the world at the end
of six months they return to the United
States and once they return to the
United States they spend six weeks
meeting with policymakers the UN the
World Bank the IMF talking about
initiatives for development hearing what
initiatives are coming up having the
opportunity to share with policymakers
their perspectives they are also putting
together presentations of their learning
these are presentations that reflect
their personal growth and their
understanding of the world around them
of the things that they saw that they
observed and they travel to meet with
student and philanthropy groups around
the country to share their learning with
these groups to raise awareness about
the issues and to raise funds for those
NGOs they work with a broad the end goal
is really to produce a student who has
the tools to go to college and start
their first day of college saying I have
a really good idea of what potential I
have to create change in the world I
have a really good idea of what is out
there in the world that needs to happen
and it needs to change and I have a
pretty good idea of what direction I'm
going ahead in what specific direction
so those four years of college are an
effective period of time when they can
collect the tools collect the skills
they need to leave college and actually
begin pursuing a career of creating
change in the world and that could be at
all levels it could be a CEO of a
corporation it could be someone who
starts a non-profit it could be someone
who's a doctor and chooses to spend two
months of the year working abroad in a
developing nation now as part of this
there's also a curriculum that the
students follow service-learning
generally speaking is followed by a
curriculum that challenges students to
reflect upon themselves and reflect upon
the experience to be able to do that
they're growing in groups of 16 students
each program group has 16 students in it
and they're traveling with three staff
members as a group they do a lot of work
together to have discussions to
articulate challenging students to
articulate their observations and their
thoughts and then to work together to
synthesize all of that information and
each other's observations into new
conclusions that are powerful that will
push their thinking about themselves in
the world to help them do that and to
help them put it in a stronger global
context that's effective we're going to
help the students by providing a
foundation of understanding about
economics about political science about
culture and social social change so that
they'll be able to really understand
these things on a broad level and root
them in academia and an academic
understanding of the world as well so
clearly we're an educational
organization but we're also a
development organization we're creating
partnerships with NGOs unique
partnerships where those NGOs that are
hosting us abroad are providing
educational services they're meeting
with our students the experts that work
in those organizations on the ground
facing these issues every day sit down
with our students and say hey this is
what our community needs these are the
issues it's facing this is what our
organization needs to survive and this
is the approach we're taking they're
providing that expertise and those
educational services to us in exchange
our students are providing service we
work with them to create we work with
the NGO to create service projects that
actually forward the mission of the NGO
abroad a lot of times 18 year olds will
go to do service either here in the
United States or in countries abroad
working with nonprofits and there their
presence is actually more of a hindrance
than it is a help we look to create
service projects that will actually
allow the students to do something with
their hands with their skills that will
actually forward the mission of the
organization but their primary
responsibility students there is to
learn
so we're a service organization we're
also a service organization our students
go and they do the physical service with
those development organizations abroad
those host NGOs but they also come back
to the United States and they educate
people around the country about what the
issues are about global cultures and
they help to raise funds for the an
awareness for those organizations abroad
by speaking with different groups here
in the United States so we're also a
service organization the last piece of
this that is critical is that the three
founders and we sat down we recognize
the importance of creating not just
these different levels of the
organization of becoming an educational
organization and development in the
service organization but that we really
wanted to create a community of
conscious individuals who are committed
to creating change in the world now that
community starts at a level of the
students there are base the students are
chosen for their ability to engage
communities they have to demonstrate
that they are high achievers in their
communities not necessarily academically
because not all students learn well in
the classroom but they have to
demonstrate that they've reached out to
their community and they've made a
commitment there they have to
demonstrate that they've made a
commitment to the specific things that
they care about as an individual as well
not just what they're what's out in
their community but things that they're
really passionate about these are the
students that are showing that they're
ready they're mature enough to head out
into the world and to engage this type
of experience but then we also have the
alumni as part of our community these
are students that have graduated from
our program gone to college gone to
graduate school gone off into their
their careers and they continue to come
back to our community to provide support
maybe it's providing financial support
to give a scholarship to a student or
maybe it's simply saying hey you know
you have x student who's interested in
starting a non-profit well I started a
non-profit in that same city I can be a
mentor to them and thinking beyond
borders has a commitment to supporting
their alumni by helping them to network
helping them to identify the resources
that are out there to pursue the change
efforts that they plan to pursue as they
translate their learning into action
throughout their lives
we also see ourselves as having a
committed group of individuals who are
out there and organizations who are out
there supporting thinking beyond borders
at it financially or with their
abilities kylie is a great example of a
member of the thinking beyond borders
community who said you know I've got a
way that I can help I can host you I can
host this event so that you can meet
other individuals who might be
interested in joining the community in
whatever way they can and offer whatever
support that they can so that kylie is a
great example of the type of person
who's out there who is committed to
creating change who is conscious and
wants to be part of the community that's
kind of an overview of who we are now
when we started building the
organization we realize three
assumptions based on our own experiences
working in nonprofits and when we built
our business plan we built them based on
our understanding of these three
assumptions the first assumption is that
nonprofits often spend an enormous
amount of time and staff energy and
resources simply fundraising to survive
right and we also understood that
fundraising often challenges the
integrity of the program design of a
non-profit and what I mean by that is
that nonprofits often say well there are
these grants out there we're going to
apply for that grant we don't totally
fit that grant but if we just kind of
tweak what we're offering and we tweak
our mission just a little bit will apply
for that grant and we'll be able to get
it and we'll just have to change our
services a little bit we had no desire
to do that our desire was to develop a
program that would truly create students
who have the capacity to be a pro active
agents of change and to not walk away
from the integrity of our program at any
point so when we designed our program we
designed it so that after the beginning
the first program year September 2008 it
will be self-sufficient on student
tuition alone indefinitely as long as
their students interested in doing this
which are experiences so far in the last
two years talking about this with folks
and our market research shows that there
is no end of interest for students who
want to do who want to take a gap here
that there are lots and lots of them out
there Harvard University for example
sends out their letter of acceptance
saying congratulations you've been
accepted
we really encourage you to defer for a
year and go do something else that's
substantive we're it there aren't a
whole lot of us out there there really
only two or three other programs around
the country they're offering full
academic gap years so that was part of
it the second thing was that we also
realized that the worst startup costs
involved and so we're fundraising for
the start-up costs 240 thousand dollars
to do our fundraising for that first
year we're targeting individuals mainly
individuals who we can really access by
saying hey we need visionary individuals
who really believe that this is a way to
create social change and so what we've
moved away from a lot of the
Foundation's a lot of the foundations
that are out there either a don't like
starting far startups or be like I said
before we don't really apply to them yes
where education yes we're development
organization but a lot of them they're
working in education want to do urban
education and a lot of them that are
working in development want to do want
to provide specific services to specific
communities by preventing HIV and AIDS
or preventing the spread of tuberculosis
or malaria or whatever it may be we
don't really fall under the guise of the
parameters of any of those grant-giving
foundations so that's the approach that
we're taking to fund the organization so
that we can maintain the integrity of
the organization almost at all costs we
really believe in what we've developed
design that much to the second
assumption was that the program should
be accessible to as many people if not
everyone as possible regardless of
financial need now the program price tag
is 35 thousand dollars for the year it's
about the cost of what a year of college
would be and we really see this as the
best first year of college that you
could have what better way to prepare
for four years of college so that you
actually benefit from all four years of
college rather than like a lot of myself
and a lot of my friends we studied
abroad in our junior or senior year came
back and suddenly realized oh I get it
now I know what I have at my fingertips
here so that's the first thing the
second thing is that for each program
group of 16 students that cost of
thirty-five thousand dollars allows us
to offer three full scholarships to that
group of 16
so 3 out of 16 automatically we can
offer full scholarships or we can break
those up and offer partial scholarships
to more than just three students that
makes it more accessible but still we
recognize the thirty-five thousand
dollars puts this program out of reach
for the vast majority of students around
the United States so the last thing that
we did was by creating a self-sustaining
nonprofit the only fundraising that we
ever have to do after that first start
up here is for scholarships is to
provide scholarships to students which
as an educational organization is the
absolute easiest fundraising you could
ever do in fact in this past year of
starting to talk more and more with
folks about the organization that we've
designed in the last couple months of
fundraising this early these early
stages of the fundraising campaign we've
found that more and more individuals are
saying to us well you know as a company
as an organization we don't feel
comfortable funding a start-up but when
the first program here starts we'd be
more than happy to offer a scholarship
we've had three offers like that already
for the first program here so we're not
we're very positive we're very
optimistic about our ability to provide
scholarships and enough scholarships to
make the program accessible to as many
students as possible the last one is
that the program integrity must be
protected throughout the development and
growth phase of the organization now
you've heard I've already mentioned a
few ways that we're doing that the other
key way is that we do not have a desire
to grow as fast as possible one of the
benefits of being a nonprofit is that we
don't have to make a profit we don't
have to worry about generating a profit
and putting as many students out there
in the field as we can as quickly as
possible our first two program years
will include just one group one program
group of 16 students each year sandy and
I will be traveling as two of the three
staff members so that she is the program
director and I is the curriculum
director can critique it can work with
the the curriculum that we've put
together work with the program design
and make sure that it works for the
students that it works for the host
communities and then at the end of the
day it's really meeting that mission of
creating proactive agents of change who
can translate their learning into action
so we can really perfect the model
before we begin adding more students to
that same itinerary and adding
additional itineraries as we go so
that's the basics I want to open up to a
few questions we have a bit of time for
a few questions but I really want to
thank you for coming out I want to thank
you for coming to learn about this it's
something that you know on the personal
note this is everything I've ever wanted
to do in my life all in one place travel
the world help students learn about the
world and help to create change it's
everything I'm passionate about so it's
exciting for me to be able to stand in
front of a room of people and talk about
the things that I'm really passionate
about and have you all listen so
intently so thank you very much for
coming but are there any questions that
I can answer for you yes sir thank you
my question is how do you six voluntary
organizations or NGOs
good attitude has your team come up with
those six and choose which issues to
focus on director students so the
question was how do we identify those
NGOs those host communities abroad that
we're going to work with what are the
criteria and how do we choose them as a
team well we do that in a number of ways
one was we developed that specific
itinerary to offer a broad perspective
of what the developing world looks like
Bolivia is small growing very smooth
very slowly it has a large indigenous
population that's still relatively
living relatively traditionally compared
to many countries around the world India
is much larger growing much faster China
is much larger still and growing much
faster still Vietnam is small but
industrializing quickly so we really
tried to give a broad perspective in
that sense the NGOs are selected
specifically for their fit and the
communities that we go to are
specifically selected for their fit so
we have many contacts around the world
sandy and I are about to travel around
the world for three to four months to
each program country and we'll be
looking to make sure that the
organizations that are out there that
we're partnering with one have the
capacity to support the students and
offer the education that that that we
need for them for this program but too
we also want to make sure that this is
an organization that has the capacity to
use our students productively they're
not going to be a hindrance on the
organization and three we want to make
sure that it's a community that can host
this size group effectively without us
being a hindrance on the development of
the community bringing 16 18 year old
students from the United States to a
community in either rural or urban
developing nations can have a huge
impact and we want to make sure that
it's a community that that is able to
support us and that we're going to be a
productive member of in the long term
that answer your question yeah more or
less yeah okay I know I threw a lot at
you so please feel free yeah I'm sorry
he beats you out there
I
like a Vietnam yeah yeah
students
yeah so the question is the question is
if there's a language barrier in
countries and you're speaking of your
own experience traveling through
Southeast Asia mostly how do how do
students become productive members of a
community in a brief amount of time if
they can't master the languages of those
countries it's a great question a lot of
these countries were specifically
selected because there's a significant
english-speaking population in them
Bolivia is a key example where that's
not true sandy and I both speak Spanish
fluently so that will help to bridge a
lot of those gaps in that country India
South Africa there are both significant
english-speaking populations beyond that
China and Vietnam in particular it will
be a challenge and one of the ways that
we can do that is a finding communities
where there are pockets of individuals
either university students or students
who are individuals who are
professionals who do have some English
language skills hiring translators who
become part of the program they're
probably providing more than just
translation services but also helping us
to build access to the individuals that
we need in that local community and
communities throughout the region so it
is a challenge it's something we're
going to face specifically in China and
Vietnam out of that that itinerary but
it's something that we are digging into
we are finding individuals that can help
to provide those services that'll make
it accessible make the community
accessible to students is that the same
question I say you nodding quite a bit
okay go to it right
damn fine right right so the question is
how do you engage policymakers
particularly the UN the World Bank in
the IMF on it on an annual basis so that
the policymakers will continue to come
back to the table and the students
actually have something to contribute
well it's a very good question the first
thing is that the first answer to that
is that all of these organizations do
have educational arms they are supposed
to be reaching out to students in the
United States and abroad so in some ways
for us to be able to step forward and
say hey we've got students who can come
and they can have a substantive meeting
with you it will meet your educational
requirements it's it's easy we're
putting it on a platter for you in some
ways it's not necessarily a lobbying
meeting it's not necessarily
specifically breaking apart policy but
simply a discussion that is an
educational discussion that's the first
thing second thing is the United Nations
offers consultancy status for nonprofits
particularly international nonprofits
and it's a few years down the road
before we would be able to qualify for
it but that's the type of that's the
type of relationship that we'd be
looking to build with with these
international policy organizations is to
have that type of consultancy status so
it's it's not easy that is a difficult
part of the program design but we think
it's critical my experiences as an
undergrad were many of you probably
familiar with calpirg I was on the
campus at UCLA working with calpirg and
the best experiences I had in college
we're walking the halls of Congress in
DC lobbying for toxic right-to-know
legislation and walking through
Sacramento lobbying around the Clean
Water Act so it was it's I think it's a
powerful experience to as a student as a
young student to go to these two
policymakers and actually have something
substantive to say you know that that
experience is critical again
to engage them absolutely I that was one
aspect of it clearly of the curriculum
because it's such an expansive amount of
time the curriculum is pretty expansive
as well so we're working with one NGO in
each host country but where the the
project model for that month actually
includes about four days a week of work
with the NGO and then the rest of the
time is spent visiting other NGOs around
the region so that are working on the
same issue so that you not only get an
in-depth look at this one NGO but you
get to see what other people in the
region are doing what different
approaches people are taking that
that'll give students a chance as a
result they'll be exposed to it
undoubtedly projects at the World Bank
the IMF for funding un sponsored
programs as well so that they think
you're right i think that will be a big
part of our ability to speak with those
organizations because we'll have
something substantive to say
specifically about their projects yeah
thank you it's a great question other
questions I should probably stop in a
minute but I'd be happy after one or two
more yes sir
what are the opportunities outside of
just directly supporting you guys are
you looking to bring people on full-time
more volunteers what's the strategy
there well at the moment you know at the
moment we're putting our in terms of the
growth we're putting our efforts into
the fundraising phase the expansion of
the program in terms of our staff will
begin in the spring and we'll be looking
to add probably just two staff for this
for this first program year and that
will be the third person to travel with
sandy and I around the world and then
someone to provide assistance to Chris
who will stay here in the United States
continue operations and begin to enroll
students for the coming year so the
program continues to thrive but beyond
that a lot of it is capacity building
for the organization building that
community so that there are other
nonprofits around the United States
there are other prophets internationally
there are other organizations that can
provide services a great example is our
students will be interacting with school
student with school children here in the
United States through video blog and
text blogs so that they'll have the end
chat so they'll have the ability
possibly even through through web
casting to to interact with students in
a substantive way younger students or
their peers about these issues that
they're seeing so finding individuals
that can help to provide the resources
that can help to provide the
infrastructure to do those types of
projects and expand our capacity and our
reach out into the US community in the
global community that's a huge part of a
way that that individuals can support
thinking beyond borders absolutely one
last question yes ma'am
when you're selecting your NGOs
NGOs
actually doing something well yes we do
the last thing that we want is to go to
work with an NGO that is sorry the
question was do we review empirical
evidence to make sure that the NGO that
we're going to work with abroad is
actually doing substance of work they're
not just there absolutely there are a
lot of NGOs internationally that are set
up by individuals simply because they
want to do good work but they don't
really have the capacity to do any good
work so it is important for us to review
that but i will say that our goal is not
necessarily to work with all the
greatest NGOs in the world I mean part
of the reality of service learning in
the reality of experiential learning is
that sometimes things fail and we learn
a lot from the things that do fail so we
won't be looking for those nonprofits
are those NGOs that are falling off the
face of the earth because they just
can't get it together but we will be out

working with those NGOs that are really
phenomenal first one that comes to mind

opportunity to be exposed to a great n
do but then there are lots of the small
NGOs that just for whatever reason they
can't get they can't pull the pieces
together even if they have a great
design the pieces just won't come
together for them that's important to
see it's critical for students to have a
real understanding I'm gonna go ahead
