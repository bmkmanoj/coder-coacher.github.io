this particular tech talk and it's kind
of serendipitous I've been helping
externally with an integration with
Google Health and ray and Kevin were
introduced to the project because of a
Parkinson project that they're looking
at and they wanted to come here and
share some information about how Google
can help with telecommunication and
telemedicine and specifically around the
Parkinson disease and some of the
research that they're doing so without
further delay good morning my name is
ray Dorsey Kevin Bigland and I are both
neurologist at the University of
Rochester and are very pleased to be
here to share ideas with you we think
patrick williams very much for the kind
invitation to speak with you today we
want to talk to you about parkinson's
disease and how simple web-based
technologies can improve care and the
clinical research related to Parkinson
disease and using Parkinson's is just an
example of a chronic condition and that
how this model can be applied to other
conditions as well so this morning we
like to talk to you first about to have
Parkinson's disease as a chronic
condition whose burden is growing both
in the United States and globally second
how telemedicine using simple web-based
video conferencing can extend the reach
of care third hotel notice it can also
improve the conduct of research and then
discuss with you some next steps in
future directions so first up Parkins
disease is a chronic condition that is
readily treatable it's defined
clinically by observation by the
presence of having two symptoms in
asymmetric rest tremor slowness and
movement rigidity or difficulty walking
we still know what the causes of 2010
about ten percent of cases we think are
due to genetic mutations the balance of
the causes we think are due to
environmental exposures and the
pathological hallmark is loss of nerve
cells in the brain that produce a
chemical called dopamine the treatment
is quite effective especially early in
the course of the disease and was
developed about 50 years ago and it
consists of replacing that dopamine that
lost in the brain surgery is another
treatment that's been more recently
developed as an option for in some
individuals Parkinson's these like
unlike other chronic conditions often
defines an individual people have a
tremor they have difficulty walking and
so they're rarely identified as abnormal
or that something is wrong with them and
that affects them it affects their
caregivers it affects their social
interactions with everyone and it's
difficult burden to bear for individuals
people bear this burden for a very long
time people live for on average about 14
years of their life maybe a fifth of
their life with Parkinson disease and
forty percent of these individuals will
require nursing home care at some point
in time so this is what parkinson
disease looks like
alright the Masters start today this is
just a video clip showing some of the
hallmarks and one as you can see that
his right hand has restarted tremor keep
your arms out there for going to go back
and forth like this for me fast as you
can you can see there's some slowness
and movement especially with his right
hand compared to his left and again the
travel close your hands for me open
close you can see that his face doesn't
expression in normal mining fast as you
can just these two and the left hand
wide and fast as you can I put your arms
across your shoulders and stand straight
up for me see that when he walks his
right arm barely removes he takes short
strides he's got a stooped posture and
he's got a tremor these are all the
clinical hallmarks of Parkinson disease
the challenge is that the due to aging
demographics both in the United States
and globally the burden of Parkinson's
ease is going to grow substantially so
between 2005 and 2030 doing some work
that we did countries that are going to
experience in zero to fifty percent
growth a number of individuals with
Parkinson's these are some countries in
Western Europe and Japan number of
individuals who are going to with Morgan
caesars can grow between fifty to a
hundred percent by 2030 including the
United States Russia number of people of
target disease will increase by eighty
percent the United States and it'll be
more than a doubling of the number of
individuals with Parkinson's disease and
many of the developing economies of the
world including China and India looked
at a different way and 2005 we estimate
that in the world's most populous
countries conservatively there's about
four million individuals with Parkinson
disease by 2030 this number more than
doubled to over 8 million individuals
and more than half of these individuals
with Parkinson disease and Mauro's most
populous countries will be Chinese so
this is not a United States problem this
isn't a national problem this is a
global problem the challenge is even
greater because in the vast majority of
these country
individuals with partners these have
never sought treatment for their
condition and have never received
treatment this is despite the fact that
treat Parkinson's ease is readily
treatable with medications that decrease
the risk of death and that these
medications are quite affordable and
inexpensive so what can we do we know
that improved access to specialists who
care for parking disease or for any
chronic condition improves care and
outcomes so that if you have increased
access to specialists you get higher
quality patient care and that leads to
improve outcomes and quality of life
this is true for heart disease where you
have more appropriate medication use and
increase survival for asthma we have
greater adherence to medical guidelines
and improve quality of light and 2
diabetes where you have better process
measures and fewer complications the
same holds true for Parkinson's disease
research that we did among the 350
individuals across the United States
with parking disease found out that
individuals who see a Parkin see
specialists are three times more likely
to be satisfied with their care than
individuals who see a general
neurologist and this increased
satisfaction was across every domain of
care apartment disease measured
including information received about
Parkinson's that time spent with the
position information about complimentary
of medical that complementary therapies
for parkinson disease the challenge is
that even in the United States access to
specialists is very limited so this is
where we live in Rochester New York near
Syracuse and this area is the Finger
Lakes region this is about 150 miles in
diameter and in this area there are over
30 nursing homes and there are only six
neurologists and not a single Parkinson
disease specialist so even the United
States you know if you're in gilroy or
if you're in you know Riverside and you
have parkinson's disease your ability to
access care is greatly limited so how
can we extend the reach of care and we
think you can do this with just simple
web-based video conferencing so three
years ago a nursing home in New Hartford
New York population 20,000 has 250
residents their administrator estimated
that twenty percent of their residents
had some form of Parkinson disease
and said we have no parking see
specialists we have no neurologist for
seeing these patients we're just seeing
a general internist is coming and sees
patients can you and Rochester provide
care to our residents in New Hartford so
we said yes and what we used to do that
was very simple technology he's a laptop
computer with a broadband connection a
webcam a microphone some software from
polycom encrypted software for security
purposes and that was it the total cost
of the entire setup beyond the laptop
computer and broadband connection was
two hundred dollars and they had a very
similar setup on their n so this is a
contrast to other telemedicine
applications which were you know
extremely costly capital intensive this
is not so this is the first individual
that dr. Kevin Bigland saw about three
years ago he's an individual who's
actually used to get his care in
Rochester New York but since going to
the nursing home was no longer able to
access care and we were called by the
nursing home because this individual is
having behavioral disturbances was
trying to climb out of the window of the
nursing home I was having trouble
thinking he was his score on our
standard cognitive measure was 21 out of
30 he was on a medication for tremors
that makes thinking worse and he was on
a drug called aricept which is used to
improve cognition so he's on a medicine
to worsen his cognition and a lesson to
help with cognition Kevin saw him and
after a series about two or three visits
change his medications his behavioral
disturbances went away his cognitive he
took off both the medications for one
worsening cognition one helping
cognition this score in the chem exam
went to 30 out of 30 his behavioral
problems resolved and it became one of
the most popular residents in the
nursing home so based on this pilot
experience we're researchers we said
let's conduct a randomized controlled
clinical trial to see whether improving
access be a simple web-based video
conferencing can make a difference in
the lives of people with Parkinson
disease so we took for residents who
have parkinson's these in this nursing
home and assign them to receive
three visits with us be again simple
web-based video conferencing over six
months and we take 10 individuals who
reside in the community those
individuals who you know grow the
grocery store I live independently they
have Parkinson disease and we randomized
them half a randomized to receive usual
care for six months whatever care they
had been receiving and half hours
randomized to receive visits with us via
telemedicine first of six months primary
outcome that we looked at what's
feasibility and we found that 29 of the
30 telemedicine visits were completed as
scheduled the one that wasn't was
delayed for two weeks because the
patient was sick we found out that our
assessments that we do a standard exam
that we do for parkinson's disease was
valid and reliable when conducted over a
web-based video conferencing compared to
in person so that there were the quality
of the examination with two minor
exceptions was just as good done
remotely as in person and we look at
other secondary outcome measures so was
a telemedicine visit looked like i'm
going to show you first a clip of an
individual who resides in the nursing
home at the beginning of the study and
then we saw him three more times and
we'll show you what you look like at the
end of the study and you can see if you
can see any differences
good the other hand so this is this is
me in Rochester New York uses him and
New Hartford New York comes in the local
conference room
in your left hand in your left hand
and then the left foot
we kicked out of a wheelchair that's not
too bad or good this is six months later
after we've adjusted his medicines do
the right hand again please right hand
very good that's left side
what in the left hand throw it in the
left foot so you can see his bonus of
movement has improved Alice
oh pretty good here we go okay yeah
that's enough yeah so uh hopefully you
can very kind beginning he couldn't get
the wheelchair by himself he couldn't
walk and the visit just three months
later six months later after three
visits you can get out of wheelchair it
can take a few steps by himself you know
you can go the bathroom for example by
himself is clearly not normal but I
clearly improved just over six months so
what is the data show well the data
showed that increasing access to
specialty care improved quality of life
and patient satisfaction so this is a
scale of called the Parkinson's disease
questionnaire 39 is the standard scale
for measuring quality of life of
individuals it's just a survey
instrument that's used in a wide range
of clinical trials for Parkinson's ease
those individuals who receive
telemedicine had an improvement in their
quality of life those who received their
usual care i significant worsening we
measured that patient satisfaction those
who received how medicine had
significant improvement patient
satisfaction compared to those who did
usual care I've notice a difference in
quality of life if a drug did this it
would be considered the second most
powerful drug use for Parkinson's
disease and this is greater change in
quality of life than even seem for
surgery brand this is a very small study
and then that a motor function
individuals with parking seesaw no
progression of their disease over the
six months whereas those who had usual
care has significant worsening of their
a disease over six months so we were
impressed we were satisfied but what
really got us was the feedback we
received from patients and this is one
individual who we said we're going to
the six-month study and at the end the
six months we weren't sure what was
going to happen because we knew if we
were going to continue to receive
funding to continue the study Joe eight
questions
after november seventh and this program
is stunning I I am no longer connected
to you will ripen would you like to stay
connected yes I would very much for the
Presbyterian home has been very generous
in working with us to continue this for
another year at least okay thank God
play right here it's big difference can
you tell me a little bit what it was
made it valuable for you um I truly feel
personally that I got to type of
attention that I need it was not
accessible to me because the area where
I live because of my cotton suits
condition so she succinctly summarizes
the value proposition that we're
providing we're able to provide care to
individuals with Parkinson's disease
anywhere that they live so no longer is
a person's access to care determined by
where they live but now that they can be
free to live where they'd like to live
and still receive the care that they
need unless you think it's anything that
I had to do with it this is a patient of
dr. big lens and the feedback that she
gave him these are both individuals who
reside in the community with Parkinson
disease ok now I'm getting very
disappointed that this is our last time
i will see you probably don't know if
it'll make sense you've been such a
difference of my wife I you know morning
from thousand extra years this is God's
it's phenomenal and one out I think we
got to figure out the particulars about
it but I think our plan is to continue
doing telemedicine for another year so I
said all that that father and see what
happens yeah
we are all of this is a gift oh my god
God has read the script that's great not
because my parts are cool I can't
believe this Wow so most of our patients
don't do that to us so based on that
feedback we've been doing this now for
three years with these individuals they
all continue to do exceptionally well
and we're looking to expand the model so
this is a again raj rochester new york
toronto and you keep this area we live
here in Rochester New York with a parkin
see specialists in this area there are
57 nursing homes 55 neurologists and no
Parkinson's II specialist outside of
Rochester so if you have you know a
Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's
disease or any chronic condition your
care is just from a generalist whoever
comes into the nursing home when we said
we can do better can we provide care to
the individuals in these different
nursing homes who have Parkinson disease
as we're planning to do later this month
actually is start a larger scale trial
just like we did with the first nursing
home but in with 50 patients in five
different nursing homes this is you know
we're Parkins disease specialist but
this same model can be applied to any
virtually any chronic condition so here
in 2010 there are 140 million Americans
of at least one chronic condition by
2030 this will increase to half the US
population have at least one chronic
condition eighty percent of these
individuals live at home and these
individuals account for seventy-five
percent of healthcare expenditures in
the United States so how can we provide
care to these individuals regardless
where they live you know it's one thing
if you live you know in Mountain View
you can go to Stanford even that can be
difficult for individuals who have
limited mobility was their way we can
provide patient centered care to
individuals regardless of their location
and what we want to do next is to
provide the same model that we're
providing into nursing homes but provide
that care directly into individuals
so providing a virtual house call and
this virtual house call can be done with
widely available just simple web-based
video conferencing I mean most people in
here probably use skype so you could
practically use just skype with some
encryption to provide a care with two
households that have computers and
broadband access but the real thing the
real value can be greatly enhanced up
through applications of Google so you
could merge the virtual house call and
use google voice and video chat and
incorporate that with a google health
record you could videotape the
encounters that you have with patients
and store that as part of their
electronic health record that
information can then be used to monitor
the disease progression for the position
to see if the individuals are doing well
or responding well to medications to
educate the patient about how their
disease has been changing and for the
patient to give you information that you
wouldn't otherwise be able to capture
you can use Google to create virtual
disease specific communities virtual
support groups to educate or to provide
support to individuals with Parkinson's
disease it's a relatively common
neurological disease but the vast
majority of individuals feel isolated
because they don't have friends or
colleagues or peers who have the same
condition that they have who are going
this through the same thing and the same
could be true as said of the caregivers
and you know Google's obviously making
as some efforts into increasing
broadband access and this could be
another way to expand virtual house
calls another way virtual house calls
can be conducted be a simple plug-in
computer which you just plug in to the
walls the size of your fist that Marvel
is developing you can link the TV and
camera to reach additional households
that don't have computers for example
and again apply the same Google
applications to enhance the experience
beyond what is currently available a
television right now televisions are
used to distribute entertainment but
held in medicine could actually be a
much more valuable application for a
television than than entertainment and
that you know Google TV could be used to
provide it finally you could provide
truly mobile medical care through
applications from web enabled phones and
the nexus one phone you know it's just
looking at
with Patrick today you know is more
powerful than the stethoscope and can be
a very powerful medical tool for in
front and increasing access to care we
think that the that the model with
telemedicine can actually be better than
current model of care so most of the
time tell messages due to some
substitute for care for individuals who
otherwise can't access and access it but
there are many ways in which
telemedicine can be much greater than a
much better than the current model of
care so the current model of care is
that you drive to Stanford to see your
neurology of Parkinson disease and you
have a doctor to patient relationship
and that's a very nice relationship if
you do virtual house calls you can still
have that patient of dr. relationship
you can actually have a relationship
between the patient that character from
the doctor a classic story is mom has
Parkinson's disease she lives in
Mountain View and she goes to see her
doctor but her daughter who's increasing
becoming involved in her care lives in
Iowa you know the current miles that the
person has to travel from Iowa to
Mountain View to go see her patient to
go see her mother to go see that
position now you can have these people
be in different geographic locations in
receive care many patients with
Parkinsons ease can see one doctor
doctor can improve educational session
or many doctors could see one patient if
you have Parkinson's disease and you're
having depression you could see a
neurologist and a psychiatrist for
example the current model of care is
synchronous the patient the doctor must
meet at exactly the same point for care
to be provided with virtual house calls
you could have synchronous visits or you
could have asynchronous visits and which
patients can provide data you know dr.
sometimes my arms moves like this could
video tape it video clip it and send it
to the physician for the decision to
interpret at his or her convenience
similarly the physician could provide
information to the patient but the
patient could access or take part in at
his or her convenience currently the
patient in that position the patient
must be in the same place in the same
place at the same time right now you can
free both the patient the doctor Kevin
and I are taking a red-eye back to
rochester new york today
night principally because we both have
patients tomorrow to see in clinic if we
could do web-based video conferencing we
wouldn't have to take the red-eye three
months ago I was able to see patients
via telemedicine and in our office in
Rochester as home with my sick child and
I was it was able to do everything from
home except they actually had to find a
babysitter watch my kid for two hours so
I could drive to work to go see the
patient's BMI web-based video
conferencing set up at work invited at
home I wouldn't have had to go and it
work I won't have had to find a
babysitter for my son just could have
done it from home cost there's
substantial travel costs if you think
about the time and that you spend when
you go to the physician to see a
physician for 15 20 or 30 minutes you
should probably spend four times that
amount of time at least just to go see
the physician many of our patients
travel over 100 miles to come see us
they spend more on transportation they
spend more on just transportation gas
car and tolls than they do on the visit
themselves Medicare pays a seventy
dollars for a CF patient and follow-up
if someone's driving 100 miles round
trip on the miles each way that's IRS
would pay you a hundred dollars they
pendmore for travel than they do for the
visit there's enormous loss of labor
productivity from both the patient who
is maybe working or often from the
caregiver these are extremely resource
intense environments hospitals and
position clinics are very expensive
places to receive care virtual house
calls no travel costs minimal loss of
productivity low capital investment two
hundred dollars probably last minimal
overhead delivering carrot in people's
homes is not a pipe dream it's feasible
right now the number of individuals
households with a high-speed internet
access is at least 75 million just last
week the Federal Communications
Commission releases strategy to bring
high-speed internet access to 7 million
US homes that lack it while making
existing broadband connections that
serve 100 million households at least 10
times as back
I'm not going to turn over how
telemedicine can not only improve care
but improve a connective research to dr.
Kevin big one good morning thanks again
for inviting us we really welcome the
opportunity to talk to you all about the
work we've been doing in Parkinson's
disease and using remote technologies
for both for clinical care and for the
conduct of clinical research and so I'm
going to focus now on our vision for
using remote technologies in clinical
trials and other clinical research
endeavors so developing drugs is an
extraordinarily expensive proposition
and this proposition has increased
dramatically over time and so the
average cost for bringing a drug from
preclinical trials to clinical
development and FDA approval is about
eight hundred and two million dollars
half of that cost arises from the time
required to conduct the research the
majority of that time is devoted to
recruiting subjects and recruiting
appropriate individuals to participate
in the clinical research the clinical
trials of specific drugs in addition we
have to enroll about twenty percent more
people in clinical trials than we think
we need to to answer the scientific
question at hand largely because we
anticipate that about twenty percent of
individuals will drop out of studies and
so there's a large and efficiency there
in that if we can somehow enhance the
time for recruiting individuals
maintaining individuals in studies then
certainly we could reduce these costs
dramatically and to give you an idea
about five percent of all healthcare
expenditures or sixty billion dollars is
spent on clinical research for new drugs
so we we are very passionate about the
idea that we think that remote
assessments can really be valuable in
this context we think it would be
dramatically reduced costs one of the
other driving forces of Health of costs
for clinical trials is that the
that individuals who are in studies have
to be seen relatively frequently
sometimes as often as every four weeks
sometimes more frequently than that in
order to really assess the safety of the
study and to do clinical assessments on
those individuals clinical remote
assessments would allow us to really
only do those in person assessments that
are critical for the safety and conduct
of the trial most of the other
assessments could potentially be done
remotely and that would be a huge cost
savings because in terms of you know so
we have to you know in order to conduct
this research we have to pay those
investigators who are doing the
in-person assessments a certain amount
of money we often have to pay for travel
for individual subjects enrolled in
studies and you can imagine the cost
there the biggest bigger issue is I
alluded to previously is that we would
save time on recruiting individuals and
subjects into studies we often account
six months year sometimes two years to
enroll all the individuals in the study
a lot of people's reluctance to be
involved in clinical research has to do
with the time commitment and so the
extent that we can say that you know
look we only need you to come in twice
all the other visits we can be done
remotely in your home we think we would
enhance recruitment that way maybe a
little bit more technical is the issue
of currently most studies particularly
diseases like Parkinson's disease where
you really need to recruit large numbers
of subjects to be able to answer the
questions that you want to answer we
have to have multiple centers both
nationally often internationally to
enroll that number of subjects into our
trials so you have a number of different
individuals different locations
throughout America throughout the world
who are evaluating these individuals
there's a lot of variability that's
merely associated with that investigator
evaluating that subject and you have to
account for that variability in terms of
your ability to detect meaningful
treatment effects so if you could use a
single individual to rate all these into
rate all these subjects on your problem
your most important clinical measures
that are going to be most useful for
evaluating whether the treatment works
or not we think you reduce the
variability considerably we know we
reduce the variability considerably and
that would reduce the number of
participants you need to enroll in the
trial and therefore reduce costs
recruitment i'm going to harp on this a
lot you know clinical trials for
participants is burdensome there's the
travel burden you're really limited to
individuals who are geographically close
to the site in question that's
conducting the research individuals with
Parkinson's disease have mark mobility
issues as you saw and so they really
need to we need to facilitate that as
much as possible to the extent that we
can reduce the burden on individual
participants we think we can enhance
recruitment and also more importantly
potentially allow these individuals to
stay and study and the studies and then
maybe we wouldn't have to recruit that
additional twenty percent of individuals
above and beyond what we need to answer
our scientific questions I think it
touched on this already is the
geographic scope you know you have to be
geographically close to occur currently
to a site that's conducting the research
to do it that really excludes
individuals who are you know living very
rural environments we had a colleague
who now lives in who works in the
University of Utah Salt Lake City you
know his catchment area in terms of the
individuals that he sees is probably
five different states all in the Rocky
Mountain area we know travel through
that area is very challenging most of
these individuals are lucky if they can
see if Parkinson disease specialist once
a year if at all and certainly they're
not going to be able to participate in
clinical and clinical research trials
where individuals have to come in on a
frequent basis to be evaluated more
importantly potentially is the ability
to expand the pop the population pool to
individuals who otherwise would not
participate in research at all and so
these are individuals with who are
mobile but also individuals living in
nursing homes a lot of the unmet
therapeutic needs it particularly in
parkinson's disease relate to conditions
like dementia cognitive impairment and
psychosis hallucinations the majority of
those individuals with those problems
actually reside in nursing homes and are
not participating in clinical research
and clinical trials so our ability to
develop drugs that address those really
unmet therapeutic needs is limited and
we think and we've shown that certainly
you can evaluate people in nursing homes
with this technology and that you can
get that that it is almost as good or if
not as good as in-person assessment and
so you could really open up therapeutic
research trials to a whole
cohort of individuals who would
otherwise not be able to participate
finally we think you know remote
assessments may potentially be an
improvement on the current model similar
to our clinical care where we think that
evaluating people in their homes is more
maybe better than actually the in-person
assessments that we currently conduct if
you think about it we currently conduct
an in-person assessment it's a snapshot
in time of that individual they're in an
unusual environment they may be travel
in an hour to get there which has an
impact on how they're functioning or how
their symptoms are and then we have to
get a subjective sense for how they're
doing at that time point based on how
they think they're doing which is often
more a reflection of how they're doing
right at that time and not a good
reflection of how they're doing over
time so as Rice stated you know the
ability to have asynchronous evaluations
where you record clinical information at
different time points when they're
occurring and then evaluate them at a
later time point may be more meaningful
in the sense that you're seeing people
in their home environments you're seeing
them at times you would not always be
able to see them similarly we can do the
same thing in clinical research you know
one of the important aspects of
conducting therapeutic research and
Parkinson disease and other chronic
conditions is the ability to monitor
safety very closely currently we rely we
put the burden on the participants to
let us know if they have any safety
concerns or side effects that are
potentially related to the experimental
treatment in question and that's a big
burden to put on an individual
particular with a chronic condition
oftentimes we don't find out about these
things until months later when it comes
to us as part of their research visit
and so the ability to really detect
these safety concerns in the individuals
home in real time with as little
participant burden as possible is a very
valuable proposition for clinical trials
in Parkinson's disease we often ask
individuals to keep written logs at how
they're functioning into in order to
address the idea of in order to address
whether or not treatments are having any
impact on a day-to-day basis on their
function very common for individuals to
be sitting in the waiting room on the
day of their visit filling out their
written logs that should have been
on throughout the time period and so
these you know it's amazing actually
that we've seen treatment effects on
these subjective diaries that actually
have led to fda-approved medications for
Parkinson's disease but certainly there
the implication there is that the
treatment effects may actually be
greater than what we're seeing and the
ability to with little participant
burden evaluate these some of these
clinical outcomes in real time is very
valuable finally the ability to take
that data as soon as it occurs and
upload it directly into our analytic
database allows us to monitor safety on
an ongoing basis very easily and we
think the quality of data therefore
would be better again about recruitment
there's been a lot of work on trying to
understand what our burdens of
participation in general and parkinson's
disease less than five percent of
individuals with Parkinson's disease can
participate in clinical research
similarly true and other chronic nor
degenerative conditions most people do
not participate in clinical research and
the question obviously is what are the
burdens on individuals that prevent them
from participating and so Cora wish did
a study survey study largely where he
asked individuals with Alzheimer's
disease what is the you know what are
the things that prevent you from
participating in research and the number
one thing that was most important was
the travel burden associated with
frequent visits and they found that if
you really were did home visits for
individuals that you could enhance
recruitment dramatically the other
things were associated with risk
associated with the drug and the chance
of receiving placebo but above and
beyond that home business travel burden
was the most important and so for very
little cost they could enhance
recruitment into the into trials bus
just by participating in home visits and
we think why go out to the individuals
home when you can assess them remotely
in their home at probably potentially
for a much lower cost so now I want to
talk about a collaboration of this oh
talk about a study that I'm involved
with that's funded by the Michael J Fox
foundation and specifically about a
collaboration with Marvel and they're
plugging computer or in order to enhance
our ability to
detects safety important safety outcomes
in this trial so is rat apenas an
antihypertensive drug that means it
lowers blood pressure that's it so
that's his main goal it's what we call
calcium channel blocker type of drug and
it's shown promise in Parkinson's
disease so it showed promise in
parkinson's disease animal models that
they may prevent or be prevent
Parkinson's disease in those models and
then more importantly actually in a
number of large epidemiologic studies
and individuals who are otherwise
healthy they looked at individuals over
time in these primarily European
healthcare databases where they really
have a most complete capture of all
individuals within a community and they
looked and said well if you're taking
certain types of medications what was
your risk for parkinson's disease ten
years down the line and they found that
calcium channel blockers and
specifically the type of calcium channel
blockers that is rata peeing represents
really lowered to risk for developing
Parkinson's disease and other blood
pressure medications had no such effect
there's a lot of good evidence you know
from previous data that suggests that
azz rata p may be a useful struggle
study to drug and parkinson's disease
that it may prevent or slow the
progression of disease so talked about
its wrapping lowers blood pressure so it
actually has the potential for having
significant serious side effects in
addition individuals with Parkinson's
disease are very high risk for low blood
pressure in general they tend to be
hypotensive they tend to have low blood
pressure they tend to have difficulty
regulating their blood pressure and so
one of the major concerns in giving
people with Parkinson's disease who are
prone to low pressure to begin with
often have baseline low blood pressure
is can we worsen that and cause serious
complications so our study is a phase
two it's a safety and tolerability study
trying to identify a dosage of his rata
pain that is both tolerated and shows
preliminary evidence of efficacy and
individual Parkinson's disease it's a
one year study and we thought that so
currently current model is that
individuals as they slowly increase the
dose of the drug are required to take
their blood pressure twice a day the
blood pressure actually I want to move
on to the next slide people
pressure monitor wrong one what's that I
got it the blood pressure monitor here
is a digital monitor it has some memory
capabilities is able to store the blood
pressure recordings and so it does store
those blood pressure recordings in
addition and that in those blood
pressure monitors are brought in about
every two weeks or so to the research
site it's uploaded to the database about
every two weeks in addition we need to
know at the time of the in-person
research visit whether a person is
tolerating the drugs so that we can
increase to the next dosage to the
higher dosage and so what the way that
we've approached that is a very
inefficient way we've asked individuals
to actually keep a written log of their
blood pressure recordings so you think
about it we're asking them to take their
blood pressure twice a day we're then
asking them to key also in addition to
taking it keep a written log of that
blood pressure recording and then every
two weeks they bring that information in
and so we're really missing valuable
time in terms of addressing any
potential complications of drug we're
putting again the burden on participants
to record their blood pressure and also
to notify us if there's they think
there's a problem associated with their
blood pressure recordings and so this is
actually a relatively significant burden
for these individuals with Parkinson's
disease with reduced mobility with
reduced ability to write writing is
often impaired in Parkinson's disease
and so our solution was to utilize the
Marvel plug-in computer to upload the
data on a regular basis ideally on a
daily basis so that as investigators we
get that we can look at the database and
look at it in real time and make
determinations about the safety of the
drug in real time and we've also taken
we've reduced participant burden because
individuals no longer need to record a
written log that data is available to
investigators they can go on to
currently we're uploading it to Google
Health they can go on to Google Health
pull up that individual's health record
with permission from the individual of
course and evaluate what their blood
pressure has been doing at the time make
a determination about whether it's okay
to increase their medication
still at this point it requires that
individuals take their plug-in computer
and plug it into their wireless router
or what a have you or and so that the
information is uploaded to the internet
but certainly the technology exists to
make this a completely remote process so
that individuals would their blood
pressure and be done they plug in the
plug-in computer to the wall they take
their blood pressure the data is
automatically transferred to Google
Health or similar repository and you
could imagine that you could set
settings on it so that an investigator
might get a text message or what have
you that if the blood pressure is out of
range or too low so they can act on that
immediately so we think this model
really suggests that remote assessments
may reduce burden on participants
improve safety outcomes for individuals
participating in clinical trials and
ideally save money in addition we see
the idea of doing assessments in the
home as a as a means for evaluating how
people look clinically what their
examination shows maybe other
assessments of how they're functioning
and genetic studies so 23andme as many
of you are probably aware is a in ish
ative to evaluate genome or genetic data
on individuals and individuals basically
sign up i think they pay about four
hundred dollars and they get a number of
they get ancestral information which i
think is the lot of driving force for a
lot of individuals but they also get a
specific gene specific data thats
related to disease risk and so they'll
learn about their genetic risk for
variety of diseases including
Parkinson's disease as well as male
pattern baldness but a variety of other
things and we think that that's that's
that's interesting cohort to look at in
addition through 23andme they developed
a Parkinson's disease initiative they're
specifically interested in looking at
individuals with Parkinson's disease so
they've made it very cost minimal to for
individuals with Parkinson's disease to
get their junk data so i think they
request $25 if you have parkinson's
disease the question becomes you're
asking a community of individuals
without medical whether or not they have
Parkinson's disease or not many of these
individuals probably have not been seen
by a Parkinson's disease specialist or
maybe not even by a neurologist and
you're getting information about their
genetics and you're suing that they have
Parkinson's disease or some related
condition and you the reality is the
data quality is quite low because you
don't really know what they have we can
see that video remote assessment is a
very via web-based video conferencing
potential using the plug as a mediator
for evaluating the video data Izzy would
be a useful easy way to one identify
what their clinical examination shows in
a very rigorous manner determine whether
or not they have Parkinson's disease or
some other related Parkinson's like
disorder or some other related
neurologic condition it's very common
for individuals with tremors to be
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and
not have it and in addition it allows
you to follow clinically over time what
happens to these individuals very easily
in a cost effective manner so we get
genetic data it'd be interesting to know
that if specific genetic genes
associated Parkinson's disease or maybe
even genes associated with other
conditions unrelated to Parkinson's
disease have an influence on how people
behave over time in terms of their
physical examination and maybe other
features in addition the cohort of
individuals who are otherwise healthy
and sign up for this this service
proportion to them are going to actually
have genes that put them at risk for
Parkinson's disease so these are
individuals who are at risk unbeknownst
to them oftentimes at risk for
Parkinson's disease based on their
genetic profile and it gives us an
opportunity to evaluate those
individuals who are not yet sick follow
them again in a very cost-effective low
burden type of way and determine what
are the features of the features that
first unfold what are the features of
disease that are most important in this
pre-symptomatic PD period prior to the
onset of symptoms and prior to diagnosis
and allows us to potentially develop
therapies that would slow the with delay
the onset or prevent disease onset in
these populations so I think that these
genetic studies and coupled with remote
assessments is a very powerful means for
evaluating a variety of questions in
Parkinson's disease and potentially
developing therapies that may prevent or
delay the onset of disease
I'm just real quick okay so finally I
want to say that another issue is using
remote technologies to get a better
understanding of really day-to-day
function and day-to-day disease
manifestations so we've talked about the
fact that people with Parkinson's
disease may have some variability in
their function throughout the day they
may have involuntary movements it's
often very difficult to know what people
mean when they have these types of
problems without actually visualizing it
and there may be automated technologies
using devices like the google phone or
other simple devices that include
accelerometry so you can detect movement
position you can potentially identify
mobility how often are people active
during the day we know that exercise and
activity is very important for improving
function and delaying progression in
Parkinson's disease Falls are important
morbidity in parkinson's disease Falls
assoc are associated with fractures
nursing home placement and death in
Parkinson's populations so monitoring
Falls is a very end people are very poor
at reporting how often they fall or when
they fall so the ability to
automatically detect falls in this
cohort would be very useful both from a
research perspective but you could
imagine from a care perspective if you
can get notified or somebody can get
notified whenever an individual with
parkinson's disease Falls it's the I
think as ray mentioned it's the it's the
21st century help me iPhone and I can't
get up medication response daytime
activity people with Parkinson's and
particularly people with Parkinson
disorders are prone to sleep apnea and
using infrared technology we can
potentially monitor carbon dioxide
levels and individuals and develop
interventions to address elevations in
carbon dioxide associated with sleep
apnea and importantly using UV detectors
that can be available on these phones
week and other devices we can monitor
sunlight exposure recent data suggest
that sunlight exposure is associated
with conversion to vitamin d vitamin D
appears to be important for preventing
cognitive impairment and dementia and so
there's reasons to think
it'd be important to monitor you guys
don't have this problem in a North Ridge
California but in Rochester New York
everyone has vitamin D deficiency so we
just want to finish up talking about
what we see is next steps in future
directions for our research and where we
think the collaborations may exist so we
think that we can use Google
applications capabilities and resources
to expand the telemedicine model
primarily for care is ray talked about
virtual house calls we we were all aware
of google chat in google video as an
alternative means for performing virtual
visits and individuals homes our
understanding that that can be encrypted
in a manner that can be utilized
utilizing the plugging computer to allow
people to with with the with a camera
and a TV to perform virtual house calls
in that manner for research purposes
both using video conferencing and things
like monitoring blood pressure
monitoring mobility monitoring
medication response in real-time and
we'd like to assess the feasibility and
value of the new google new technologies
and services such as the marble plug
computer i think i've already talked
about this Google Health and for
delivering care and read and performing
research and ultimately like to expand
the geographic scope most of our
research has been conducted in the
western New York and upstate New York
Region we'd certainly like to expand it
to other states and from a research
perspective we'd like to expand it to
multicenter trials the study I told you
about is a multi-center study but the
research we're doing is really done at
the University of Rochester at this
point we have envisions of expanding
that to multicenter trials and showing
that we can conduct the same assessments
that are conducted in person remotely
just as well and that would really may
have a huge impact on drug development
and drug development costs and
participant participant recruitment and
retention ray is taking a faculty
position at Johns Hopkins and that
really opens up an opportunity for us to
explore this technology in Maryland and
probably internationally
so this is our vision for the expansion
and timeline for our expansion so first
we plan on providing care to individuals
directly in their homes and that's
something we plan on doing actually
probably next week so we want to test
the feasibility of performing virtual
house calls and ultimately expanding it
to see whether or not virtual house
calls are an improvement over
traditional care both in terms of costs
and the quality of information that we
receive next we'd like spanned
incorporate remote assessments into
research studies we talked about 23 and
me as we see as being a very meaningful
use of this route this type of
technology and into existing and future
clinical trials and finally we like to
apply to the model to other chronic
conditions for example Alzheimer's
disease which is you know a chronic
condition associated with aging which is
increasing in prevalence dramatically as
the population ages and expand the
geographic scope both at this within
North America and also internationally
and ultimately as the one patient that
ray showed you so eloquently put our
vision relays to provide patient
centered care to individual Parkinson's
disease no matter where they live and we
want to thank you for your time and
happy to take any questions at this
point Scott the care that you gave to
the nurse
largely dependent on someone
setting up the conferencing right yes
there's still a difficulty
configuration for these
well we don't know oh so the question
was that in our nursing home experience
and in fact in our community experienced
a date we've we've modeled around having
these tele health centers so we have a
telehealth center that is local to the
individuals that are participating in
this in it but is so it's it's
convenient for them but they still have
to leave their home to come to the
center it's in the nursing home so the
nursing home individuals actually are
right there and that's actually been
tremendous convenience for them but
we've had individuals there for to do
and I've done two things one they work
the camera on their end so if we ask to
see something specifically they move the
camera to that specific location in
addition we have a nurse that we've
trained to do some Parkinson's disease
evaluations and so the question is when
you move this type of technology or this
type of a service into the home you
really it's you know unsummon term
somebody you use for this ones but it's
you know unassisted telemedicine visits
there's nobody there necessarily there
may be a caregiver but there's nobody
there with training or expertise to
perform these and so we're certainly
interested in assessing whether that is
actually a feasible possibility we think
it is feasible we think we can get
enough information in order to make
marked improvements in the quality of
care and in patients function and
quality of life did you want to comment
on the technology is exactly the same
technology grandma is using to speak to
her grandson so why can't grandma I'll
speak to her doctor
really great very challenging for us
while adopting
I know it's sort of lack of in person
feeling about having computer separating
two people
face your drawbacks of stuff
so the question is what are the I guess
the barriers to people adopting this
model on a larger scale and one of the
things you raises the weather there's in
you know you don't form that traditional
physician-patient relationship and
there's a little bit impersonal through
the computer and so we did conduct focus
groups you're trying to address that
very specific question in the people
that have participate in the studies
thus far and we've actually found that
time to be concerned there's at all in
fact general the relationship that
people have the people feel that their
relationship with us via telemedicine is
better than with other doctors they've
seen for their Parkinson's disease
there's been no concerns at all about
the interpersonal issue I would say and
I'm going to segue to Ray on this the
major barrier to adoption has largely
been in terms of reimbursement for
telemedicine services and I'm gonna let
ray speak to that issue sure so early to
physically don't touch the patient you
touch them in a different way I think as
you touch them in more meaningful way
the current way that we deliver care is
really centered around the doctors
convenience you come into a waiting room
a holding cell we wait until the doctors
ready to come see you and he comes out
and sees you this way we're actually
coming to you coming directly into your
home's to provide care to you in the
most meaningful way possible and the
most patient centered way that we know
of and at 2010 reimbursement is a
challenge Medicare currently covers a
telemedicine visits in certain settings
it doesn't cover it in non rural areas
such as new heart for New York
population 20,000 for whatever reason we
think it's just a matter of time before
payers will change and then there's
other alternative economic models by
which this can work as well
to your experience as a developer pick
up
and
develop the tool itself wasn't you was
it
you know
is kind of fun so how did this program
get initiated what were they lean year
or the yeah well actually Marvelle came
to us we were involved in you know they
asked they were interested in whether or
not this could be a useful technology in
clinical trials and they said who's
doing clinical trial work he got Carl
key Burt's name and ultimately he
referred you to us because we were doing
some of this remote assessment work
already and so we met with Scott Smith
and said yeah we think this is valuable
we're doing a clinical trial in
Parkinson's disease where we need to
monitor blood pressure this seems like
this be a very useful test case to in a
simple way of improving the way that
we're currently doing things both terms
of efficiency and reducing participant
burden and improving safety with that in
mind I think Scott configured the device
to make it compatible with the blood
pressure monitoring that we were already
using in that study and so that's we
didn't do any of the technology aspects
ourselves in that regard
doctors and desist
develop
and develop or you will need
I would say we probably need support in
terms of technological adaptation so say
you know one of our goals is to be able
to increase access to web-based video or
video conferencing technologies so that
we can do visual evaluations of
individuals I think it's in the short
term at least it's going to be very
we're not going to get around doing some
type of visual synchronous evaluation
particularly in the context of clinical
trial work they're just regulatory
issues around that and sort of FDA
approval processes there are certain
outcomes that need to be assessed in
order for a drug to come to development
so we you know we think the plug
computer potentially is a means for
improving access beyond those
individuals with computers and beyond
those individuals with broadband access
potentially using other you know the 3g
network satellite etc
as reducing it
obviously we have other technologies
that could support
so the only question is the overall
penetration in telemedicine you want to
talk so tell mesons been done every day
it's being done right now it's been
widely used in psychiatry and other
fields for many years and many decades
so for example town medicines used to
provide care to individuals who
imprisons prisoners you know where it's
very difficult to get it it's used in
the PA system to provide care to
veterans wherever it is it's used to
manage acute emergencies so stroke you
can get position to position
consultations it's used in radiology you
know where you can now separate the
acquisition of a picture and image from
its interpretation the choosing
dermatology it's in use in a wide
variety of ways you can get a second
opinion from a doctor right now if you
wanted to on a runny nose I think what
we're trying to do is change the model a
little bit and that apply to chronic
conditions such as you can develop a
longitudinal relationship with patients
over time and free that individual and
human free the physician for many
Geographic restrictions were that
individual lives there's no reason that
in 2010 an individual has to decide
where they want to retire based on their
medical conditions in their proximity to
positions there's no reason that an
individual you know in Bangkok can't get
treatment for his parking disease
because there aren't pregnancy
specialist in Bangkok and those type of
things just no longer need to happen in
2010 and the technologies are ready
there you guys can easily create the
technologies to enable this was needed
as you know partnerships creativity and
will and weaning partners when you
creative people and we have some will
that we'd be happy to pass on
obviously technology make it much easier
I mean I don't like
but now is destroyed
and you can check out in big thing as
you know its cost this is no longer a
cost issue you know you have your mobile
telemedicine vans your motels in
medicine unions you have cameras that
you know five ten thousand dollars
hundred thousands of dollars it's robots
out there that can make rounds for you
for three hundred thousand dollars you
know our solution is not a
capital-intensive at all its low cost is
two hundred dollars it's a lesson you
know you know a couple months of a cell
phone bill you know it's really
available technology but which really
needs partnerships creativity and will
to make it happen your availability is
the doctor as well has increased origins
to researchers sort of get more bang for
your buck concerns
so has this means more work patients get
treatment that
so does the productivity of physicians
increase with telemedicine and you know
patients like time with doctors and
that's always going to be a scarce thing
and you know you can't make it right now
that the time is relatively similar we
spend about half an hour with follow-up
visits if you come see us in clinic we
spent about half an hour on time our
no-show rate is much less for
telemedicine visits than it is for
regular visits our ability to conduct
visits will be increased because we can
now do it you know from our home from
our Jessica right now for clinic we
literally both Kevin and I have to drive
from our office to go to clinic to go
see our patients when we see tell mess
and we don't move we just turn on our
computer and do it with telemedicine you
can extend your reach you can reach more
than one individual at one time you can
reach caregivers you can read many
patients at one so I think that many to
one concept is another way to improve
the entire model of delivering care so
there's lots of creative ways that we're
just touching on them which you know
telemedicine can improve the current
contract of care 24-hour access mean
there's hundreds of things we r
restricted right now to our clinic being
open from nine to five the monday to
friday if i want to see a patient for at
six o'clock right now i can't do it
something isn't open that's nonsense
right that's when patients want to be
seen saturday morning i can't do it i
wanna see patients after i go to bed on
the west coast after my kids go to sleep
can't do it hundreds of different ways
that it can be done and better
I know an arm in REO in our specific
situation the ability of us to see
patients via telemedicine in our office
that we generally work in and not have
to go somewhere else to see patients has
a dramatic effect on our productivity
yes so it was he said this is a cost
effective way of doing things and there
should be some natural sponsors for this
would see me insurance companies should
be as the government should be spawn
support organizations of doctor should
be sponsors working who are the existing
sponsors of this right now our research
is being sponsored by the nursing home
so the nursing home has a financial
interest and you know when filling beds
retirement communities have an interest
in you know providing great care to
their residence they have an interest in
you know not having their patient how to
go to the hospital two different
insurers have expressed interest in this
model with us excels the local Blue
Cross Blue Shield ensure in our area has
I committed to funds to provide virtual
house Cal virtual house calls
individuals we just had a conversation
last week with the united healthcare or
certified a colorado license they've had
me doing telemedicine last week so the
payers are coming around to it we advise
where researchers that we write grants
me right lots of grants foundations will
probably be the next adopters and I
think there's increasing interest from
federal government department of
agriculture roll a medicine to see this
model expand again it's just you know
partnerships creativity and will that
are necessary to make it done you know
Kevin and I can't do it ourselves we
don't have all the capabilities and
resources that are necessary to do it
julio porosity we're so income in the
united states that telemedicine is
restricted by us be licensed in the
state in which the patient resides used
to be that's a major barrier now is
predominantly a cost barrier there are
third-party providers who can get
licenses for you in all different states
so i'm currently licensed in New York
and in California your license in New
York and Pennsylvania i think in
maryland so you can you know readily
expand licensure and then overseas and
those are some other issues that we need
to look into but people were you know
come
in frequently to tertiary academic
concerns like Stanford spending
thousands of dollars in transportation
costs to come see their physician to get
a bill for three hundred dollars and
then to disappear never be seen by that
position again you know now you can send
them home with a webcam and I say we'll
see you in three months and we'll save
you the thousands of dollars and you can
give us a little contribution of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
