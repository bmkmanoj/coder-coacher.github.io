bunch of different pieces of code
running in the same domain
non-interfering except through public
api's so the arrows in the lines on the
right side are just normal object
references and function calls so that's
how cajoled pieces of code and cajoling
is a term that we use when we rewrite to
JavaScript and so a cajoled code is the
code with security guarantees so once
once their control they interact just by
a normal JavaScript function calls so
something that JavaScript programmers
are very used to dealing with and the
foundation for what we're doing is
called object capabilities an object
capabilities is an extension of
object-oriented programming that makes
it you know very easy to reason about
the security properties of piece of code
and it works on top of reference safe
languages Java is for example as a
reference safe language you can't just
go and cast a number to a pointer so you
know if you reference something it's
because you've gotten that reference by
some other means either you created the
object or it was passed to you an object
capable ease adds a couple further
restrictions so objects are encapsulated
they're only accessible via their public
API only if you intend to expose
something you know only that the ways in
which you intend an object to be
manipulated the ways in which its
manipulable and all influence on the
outside world is via sending and
receiving messages so there's no you
know raw access to the file system
there's no system calls with direct axis
and you can deny access by simply not
providing references if you need to
reason about what can this piece of code
do you just reason about you know what
objects can access if I don't want it to
access a file you know I just you know
don't pass in a file object
and it builds on good software
engineering practices so for example
separation of duties a lot of times when
you're writing a piece of code you break
it up by what this is what each piece of
code needs to do if you're trying to
build a secure system you want to make
sure that a mistake in any one area is
not going to kind of allow cascading
breaches it's not going to allow
somebody to to gain all kinds of
authority and so if you separate this
piece of code from that this deals with
a file system that deals with the
network then some of breach in one place
isn't going to allow you know
necessarily somebody to exploit both and
dependency injection is a way of
separating I guess the implementation of
inputs from you know the code that takes
them as inputs with authority injection
the way in which you grant authority to
a piece of code is by passing a
reference and object capabilities is in
many ways a lot more flexible than
static security policies and what I mean
by a static security policy is if I
wanted to allow access to a particular
file I could say this program has access
to only these files whereas if I'm doing
object capabilities it's all about
passing in the references so if somebody
wants to delegate authority they simply
pass that reference on and the piece of
code that is dealing with a file system
doesn't have this static policy which
prevents delegation in many cases so
and
so you've probably all seen a google
search it's a box with a button and what
I'm trying to demonstrate here is that
you can write code and have two mutually
suspicious pieces of code interacting
with one another and one piece of code
is the search box it has accessed via
the google ajax search api's to our web
search and so I can search for and get
back a bunch of results and you know it
can manipulate a small part of the Dom
so that it can it can display its
results to the user and that doesn't
look like cats but well that doesn't
look like cats at it but there's this
other piece of code which apparently is
malicious right now that is that is
taking it receives a message which which
result I clicked on and it gets passed
in a result object and then it does an
image search and it's supposed to
display pictures of kittens but it
doesn't seem to be doing that right now
and
and this is kind of the overall
architecture we we rewrite JavaScript
CSS and HTML and so we taken a bunch of
inputs which are various file types
those get turned into parse trees and
then each of these boxes in the middle
is a transformation from parse trees to
parse trees so we take HTML parse trees
and we strip out the parts that we can't
prove safe we take in JavaScript and we
do similar kind of validation and
rewriting then we turn the HTML into
something which looks roughly analogous
to document dot write and so that turns
into JavaScript which will produce the
same HTML but in a limited context and
what we end up with is we end up with is
a JavaScript parse tree and a CSS parse
tree and those can then be embedded in
the page and this is meant to be an
extension extensible system so if for
example you wanted to and a lot of
clients have their own steps that they
need to to go through if you wanted to
for example we write macros in
JavaScript you could throw your own
processing stage into this which would
take the parse trees that it cares about
rewrite them and throw them back in the
bucket of parse trees for the next for
the next consumer to deal with and the
search gadget that I showed you earlier
this is some of the code in it so it's
specified as a chunk of HTML it looks
like normal HTML it loads some script it
loads some CSS and then it has a bit of
HTML that actually specifies the form
and the first thing we do is we look at
the script tags we look at the link tags
we look at the style tags and we pull
out the various pieces of information
that we need and we go and we and we
also go into event handling attributes
such as on click and we pulled the
gripped out of there and place it with a
stub which will call through to the to
the safe version of the JavaScript we do
some rewriting of CSS style rules to
prevent collision if one gadget wants to
define a style rule which says the P tag
is purple and another gadget that wants
to define a star rule which says the P
tag is pink then we need to make sure
that you know even if they're in the
same page one gadgets style rules don't
affect the Dom nodes created by other
gadgets and so we put a class on the
beginning of each of the style rules and
effectively namespace them that way and
once we've got JavaScript once we've got
everything boiled down to JavaScript so
we've taken the HTML and and turned it
at a JavaScript which produces that HTML
we then need to make it safe and again
you know we also want to to make sure
that there's non-interference and so in
in JavaScript the window is effectively
your global scope we create a separate
global scope and we rewrite all global
references such as document to the fake
global scope that we create and we call
that big global scope outers and this
also allows us to put ourselves in the
middle of interactions between the
JavaScript and the browser so the
document is an inherently unsafe object
it allows you to you know create script
tags set the source muck around with
them well any number of ways to
arbitrary execute arbitrary script and
we can create our own document which has
the same API as the original but that
allows us to you know enforce certain
policies
and the container then loads the gadgets
since the gadget is compiled down to a
parse tree of JavaScript and a parse
tree of CSS we include script tag and we
include a link tag to load each of them
and then we create the global scope so
we create the global scope and then we
set up the fake document and then we
load the safe JavaScript and CSS and in
the demo the gadget used the google ajax
search api's that of course requires a
lot of access to the network but we
don't want to allow direct access to the
network and so we inject an authority
into each of the gadgets we create a
search engine object which has a very
minimal public API the public API
basically says here's something I want
to search for here's a call back to
invoke once you get the results and then
we just assign that object as a member
of the global scope so since this is the
outers object and where is the signing
the search engine member then they just
say search engine it appears to be
something in their global scope to the
gadget
and guess that's about it questions
we do the compiling on the sorry I'll
repeat the question the question was
this this works really well in a
compiled environment but javascript is
an interpreted language and and and how
does it affect performance there the the
answer is we we run the controller on
the server the quad roller is written in
Java and then the way a lot of
containers work is they have this thing
called a gadget directory and so you've
probably seen I google you can choose a
bunch of gadgets to embed in your page
say you know I want my newsfeed here i
want this year that there and so there's
this gadget directory which is basically
a cache of you know gadget source code
and and that cash now just includes you
know the cajoled source code as well and
that actually gives us a lot of
flexibility and deployments so you know
if we find a security problem after the
fact we can just go through and flush
that cash as far as the performance of
the actual javascript we are inserting
runtime checks so we do this is a fully
whitelisting approach when you go to an
object in and you want to to run a
executed method on it unless we can
prove that you know that method is
something safe than we need to check
whether or not you know you have access
to that member so for example on Firefox
every object has an eval property which
you know allows you to do just about
anything and so that is something that
we did not white list
we don't do that right now there is the
question was how do we handle things
like evil and dynamically generated
JavaScript right now we do not the caja
language is a subset of JavaScript and
we've defined another subset cajita
which is something that is which is
something that is very easy to to verify
client-side and so that's a superset of
JSON but with functions it excludes
things like this and and and so that is
that is something that we can we can
parse and verify you know efficiently
client-side what other adverse are you
aware of do this and can you compare and
contrast this with other approaches to
the question was what other efforts are
there in the same area there's Doug Doug
Crockfords add safe which is a
verification only approach that they
don't rewrite JavaScript they just look
at it and determine yes this is safe or
no this isn't that's also a blacklisting
approach and you know blacklisting if
you're blacklisting you're depending on
and you know Doug Crockford has done a
huge amount of work and in making sure
that he's gotten this right but there's
less flexibility with that approach and
you're also relying on the blacklist or
to have thought through everything that
you know could possibly go wrong and
there's also jacaranda which hasn't I
haven't seen a whole lot of details on
it yet that is a much more kind of
object-oriented approach so it's trying
to take a subset of javascript remove
the prototypical aspects of the language
and and present a purely class-based
language and I don't know enough about
the language to come in but since we're
trying to you know our target audience
is is people who developers who are
familiar with javascript HTML and one of
our goals is to present the same set of
tools
we wanted to you know continue treating
JavaScript as it put a typical language
FPGAs yeah f bjs is Facebook's version
and they are you know doing something
similar I believe it is oh is it is that
a white listing approach it's a
blacklisting approach and they do the
similar kind of rewriting of global
references to point to something else so
that they can then interpose you know
their version of document so we going
wind up with no six or seven of these
things out well you know we were trying
to present the answers probably yes in
the short term and the question was are
we going to end up with six or seven of
these on the web in the short term I
think so we're trying to present the
same API the people are familiar with an
hour substantially the same API and so
you know we're not we're trying to avoid
the burden of everybody learns a
completely new language and so you know
they can leverage everything they know
about you know JavaScript and CSS and so
on if I can interject we're also in
active communication with Doug Crockford
climb to resolve differences between add
safe and kavita
first question how do you parse the
JavaScript we wrote our own parser for
JavaScript CSS and HTML XML you know
markup languages yes yeah yeah we
generate proper parse trees and the
since we wanted this to be an extensible
tool chain so that people can put their
own you know JavaScript optimizers
obtuse Gators and so on on to the end
what we do is we take all these parse
trees and then we shove them into a
bucket and then we have a pipeline each
pipeline stage says you know I know what
to do with HTML so you know I'll take
all the HDI well maybe you know turn
them into JavaScript parse trees which
you know I then just shoved back into
the bucket and so if somebody wanted to
you know parse FB ml for example they
could put a markup a parser for that you
know onto the front that would produce
FB ml then you know you have something
that takes FB ml turns into JavaScript I
don't know how you would do that but and
then you know would just take those
JavaScript parse trees dump them back in
the bucket and they would be then picked
up by the next stage that cares about
JavaScript
third-party libraries all right and and
what was your third question all right
the question was how do we handle
third-party libraries and we've gotten a
lot of questions about jQuery prototype
script oculus Yui you know any number of
other libraries we're dealing we're in
we've been talking to John Resig of
jQuery a lot and we've been talking to
some of the prototype folks taking a
library that that that makes a lot of
assumptions about the environment and
tries to present it is you know some of
these libraries we can get to cajole
jQuery for example you know is very
particular about not extending native
objects so it doesn't add members to
object it doesn't add members to
function prototype does that all over
the place and that presents some
problems because when you know if we're
if we're assuming non-interference and
people are adding things to object our
prototype that's going to affect every
foreign loop of a gadget that doesn't do
that there's tricks we could do with I
with iframes to you know create a new
window which gives us a new version of
object and you know there's other tricks
that we can do with that and and we've
kind of I don't know what have we
actually settled on for jiggler for
prototype Ben's decoration mechanism art
I should mention the particular issue of
object Renaissance that specific object
prototype takes pains not to decorate
that one all right but it does decorate
radar all right and yes so object
decoration is is we're just you know did
control when something is created we go
and inject the extra extra fields into
it all right
impossible to fish a lot of this
functionality actually into the browser
so that you can have sort of like
instead of a script source equals
whatever you use good source equals
whatever savings true or type equals
tech / kaha Bob with something like so
extension we've talked to some we've
talked to some interpreter developers
and and one of the things kaha does not
include the width construct in it and it
does not allow modification of the
arguments array and those are two things
that make it very hard to optimize
JavaScript modifying the arguments array
means that you know if a function can
reference it scholar it can actually
change that callers local parameters and
and and and without those two
restrictions interpreters could so it's
possible then the future interpreters
might recognize that a piece of code is
kaha and be able to execute it more
efficiently but I you know I don't know
if any when we're not planning any
change pushing any changes to the HTML
spec this moment any other questions let
me
following
yeah HTML the question was what are we
doing about HTML sanitization
specifically are we using the html5
rules html5 is a is it's a it's a great
piece of work it's kind of a
codification of these are the ways
browsers actually deal with you know
TechSoup so it has you know browsers you
give them just about anything and
they'll you know interpret it somewhere
and and over time they've come to
interpret it pretty consistently yes we
are using html5 to generate our parse
tree what we put out is what we put out
is is is consistent we also have a
client-side sanitizer so that when you
assign no dinner HTML it'll get
sanitized unless it's you know something
that we know a priori is safe safe HTML
and and and that is not html5 compliant
because we didn't want to rewrite an
entire browser in JavaScript so
the question was you said there's no
this that's in cajita which is the
subset of kaha that we want to be that
we plan to to use to implement a safe
eval kaha allows this and
what alliance with a
the question was of existing gadgets
well most of them kajol and if they
don't what do gadget developers need to
do and the main blocking factor to
having many gadgets control right now is
our partial you know we implement this
fake document and we haven't implemented
there's large parts of it that we just
haven't implemented yet and I think the
most of the problems that people have
right now will be working around you
know the parts that we haven't
implemented yet and for example right
now we haven't implemented proper
sanitization of styles and so you know
that's going to be a large area
sanitizing styles in javascript is hard
just because CSS where we're using CSS
to one CSS to one is a big language and
so we're planning on providing kind of
templates of styles and various other
ways to manipulate styles but setting
you know doing setattribute on style
right now will not work so question
were you talking about the architecture
graph let me see if I can't remember
where I put that and and what was your
question which does it include I'm sorry
we don't we don't do obfuscation right
now and was there all right is that all
the questions cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
