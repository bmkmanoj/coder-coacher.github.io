is not actually a relative of mine but
he is a friend who I've known for a very
long time in fact he and I wrote our
very first computer program together
about almost 30 years ago now who is a
adventure game written and basic after
that while he went on to college even
when he was in high school he worked for
thinking machines corporation produces
the connection machine and he worked for
them again after college but then
unfortunately the intellectual rigor and
complex math of computer programming
became too much for him and he moved
over into theoretical physics he's now a
professor at MIT at the Center for
Theoretical Physics and we've lost our
screen while he's here to talk about how
big the universe is which for Google
means how many data centers are going to
need so please welcome professor
Washington Taylor right thank you very
much in and thanks to ian and the
seminar organizers for inviting me here
it's a pleasure to be here on very
pleased that so many of you can come to
a talk which is probably going to be
about as far from practical application
as most talks as any talk you might have
heard here so what I'm going to talk
about today is a story which has emerged
in recent physics having to do with how
big the universe is and how we're going
to make predictions about future
experiments things that will be seen
that accelerators that are not yet built
things that will be seen in cosmology in
the context of a rather challenging
worldview which has come out of string
theory and cosmology in the last few
years so I'm going to start off well
left
so what it fix that
well I'll carry on so let me just
summarize most of what I'm the big
picture and a few words and then I'll
get into a little more of the details of
this and how this turns into web could
be a very difficult computational
problem so recent evidence coming from
two different directions on the one hand
from cosmological experiments which
measure things happening things that
happened at the very early in very early
history of the universe that we see it
very far distances away from us 42 13 14
billion light-years away these
observations have combined with some
recent theoretical developments in
string theory to give us a picture of
the universe which is radically
different from that which we had in the
past it's sort of the next step in a
Copernican revolution we're in our
little patch 13 or 14 billion
light-years wide of the observable
universe seems to be potentially part of
a much much much larger system and in
other regions of this much larger
universe going beyond the horizon to
which we can see with our experimental
apparatus there may be regions in which
the physics is governed by somewhat
different laws and in some places there
may be regions where the laws of physics
look very different all governed in some
sense by an underlying theory which
perhaps a string theory but from the
point of view of traditional particle
physics these different regions in the
universe may have very different kinds
of physics so one of the challenges in
this picture where the universe is so
big and physics is different in
different patches of the universe is
making predictions so in some places in
the universe physics may be very very
different from ours and there may be
some places in the universe where
everything is almost exactly like it is
here but if you look at the electron
mass the ninth digit of the electron
mass may be off by one and if that is in
fact the case it means that that ninth
digit of the electron mass is not
something we can predict based on
fundamental physical theory so
the title of the talk is when is it
google not enough and I'm sure each of
you at some point since coming here
before coming here has gotten into some
discussion about how big the number of
Google really is and as you all I'm sure
no Google is pretty much bigger than
anything you could run into in almost
any physical problem or any problem of
relevance to nature because Google is
approximately the number of particles in
the observable universe so you might
think that you will not need to deal
with numbers or computational problems
well obviously some computational
problems search exponentially big spaces
so you might need to search
combinatorial spaces of that size but
you certainly wouldn't expect to see
this number appearing in a
characterization of a physical system
the point of this talk is that in this
new picture of the universe it seems
like there may be far more than a Google
different regions of universe each with
their own laws of physics string theory
in particular seems to have more than 10
to the 1,000 different solutions each of
which corresponds to some kind of local
physics and if the current paradigm that
is emerging is correct each of those
maybe realize somewhere in the universe
this poses a huge computational problem
even if we can in principle completely
understand string theory even if we
could define it write down the equations
and even solve those equations how would
we sort through this 10 to the 1,000 or
more possible solutions to find the one
that matches our world and so what I
want to talk about today is filling in a
bit more as to why we ended up at this
picture telling you about how to think
about the problem of making some
prediction based on this model and then
talking a little bit about some of the
computational problems I and some other
people have been working on actually
starting to systematically look at this
space of solutions and trying to
understand if there are correlations if
there are structure if there are things
we can do which make this into a
computationally tractable problem so
I'll talk about some of that I encourage
questions from the audience during the
talk yes
so the question is could each of these
solutions be realized just once no as
we'll see as we get through the story
probably each of these solutions is
realized many many times so the size of
the universe is probably much bigger
than this if this picture is correct you
could take the currently observe size of
13.5 billion light-years you could tack
on pretty much as many zeros as you want
after that and you might still not be
quite approaching the size of the
space-time that you would need to
capture all the physics that might be
realized now I'll talk a little bit
about how things got so big why the
universe might be so big as we go
through this but yeah I encourage
questions as we go through i'm going to
kind of try to keep this to a fairly
simple and straightforward core of what
i'm talking about but there's lots of
things i'm going to comment gloss over
and if people are interested i'm happy
to say a little more about anything
okay so here's a quick outline of what
I'm going to talk about I'll start by
discussing the idea of cosmological
expansion how the universe got to be so
big and some issues which have to do
with recent cosmological observation
telling us about the rate of expansion
of the universe then I will talk about
string theory which is a formal
development a theoretical framework in
which people have been trying to
describe quantum gravity and then I'll
bring them together to talk about the
vacuum problem the problem of looking at
these many solutions a string theory and
figuring out which one might correspond
to our world finally I'll talk about the
computational challenge that appears
when we have this huge space of
solutions okay so let's start with
cosmic expansion so the basic feature of
gravity which makes it different from
all the other forces is that all objects
exert a gravitational attraction on all
other objects that's not true of
electromagnetism if you have to
positively charged particles they will
repel each other if you have oppositely
charged particles they will attract in
gravity everything attracts so although
gravity is by far the weakest of all the
forces in nature this fact that it is a
universally attractive force it's really
what makes it such a relevant force in
our everyday lives because we are
interacting with big objects the Sun the
earth these things all have lots of mass
and they attract us and they attract
each other and caused most of Newtonian
gravitational physics to happen so in
the absence of any other effects if you
have a bunch of objects floating around
in the universe they will
gravitationally interact each other and
they will begin to come together so one
consequence of that observation is that
we can't have a static universe if the
only force between these objects is
gravity if you just try to populate the
universe with a bunch of objects and
keep them at fixed points they'll all
attract and things will come together
there will be some kind of collapse so
about a century ago Einstein was worried
about yes please question
that's a good idea
great yeah it's a little smaller but
that's probably much yeah let's let's do
that thank you for that suggestion okay
so about a century ago Einstein worried
about this and he wrote and wrote down
this beautiful theory of general
relativity the basic equation of general
relativity is this a thing called G mu
nu which characterizes the curvature of
space-time and there's a thing on the
right called team you knew which
characterizes the amount of matter and
energy that's moving around in that
space time and he had this beautiful and
simple equation G mu nu equals 8 PI team
you knew I promise I want to very many
equations but this is one of the very
few I will include yet this beautiful
equation saying that gravity is caused
by matter you have matter it causes
space-time to curve and in turn the
curvature of space-time causes things to
move on curved trajectories and that
explains all of gravity but he couldn't
explain why things weren't all
collapsing together so he's stuck in a
fudge factor a little extra term in this
equation which is that thing in blue
over on the right he added a little G mu
nu which is describing that's called a
metric it describes distance scales in
space-time multiplied by a constant
called capital lambda so capital lambda
is something called the cosmological
constant and he stuck it in basically to
allow his theory of general relativity
to have a static solution a solution
where all the stars were fixed in the
heavens and they weren't coming towards
each other and they weren't going apart
well Hubble pointed out after some
observations that in fact it seems that
the universe is expanding all objects
are moving apart from all other objects
at a fairly rapid rate and what that
means is that we're not in a static
universe and Einstein and he
characterized the addition of this term
into this equation as his greatest
mistake in his career because he said we
don't need it we can get rid of it
basically we have the universe expanding
and gravity will just cause the rate of
expansion of the universe to gradually
decrease as the objects attract each
other so ever since then people have
basically believed that this thing the
cosmological constant is zero you've set
it equal to zero the universe expands
there was some big bang the rate of
expansion gradually decreases as gravity
pulls
together and that people thought was the
end of the story now in the last few
years people have done very careful
observations of distant supernovas of
the large-scale structure of microwave
radiation left over from just after the
Big Bang a lot of detailed cosmological
observations and what those things tell
us is that the rate at which the
universe is expanding is no longer
decreasing it's actually starting to
accelerate so distant objects you would
have thought gravity would just slow
down their rate of motion away from each
other distant objects are now starting
to accelerate away from us at a faster
and faster rate so this implies that the
cosmological constant is not in fact
zero what the cosmological constant does
is it sort of exerts a constant pressure
of everything on everything else which
causes things to expand it can be
characterized as a kind of a dark energy
and energy which cannot be measured in
any particular way but which seems to be
causing things to move apart so it now
seems and is pretty convincing evidence
for this that for about seven and a half
billion years about half the lifetime of
our universe of our local patch of the
universe the rate of expansion has been
increasing things have been moving apart
from each other faster and faster and
this is now a big puzzle of cosmology by
to seeing discussions some popular
science or more technical things on dark
energy this is the issue that we now
think that much of the energy in the
universe is made up of this dark energy
which is forcing everything to
accelerate apart so if you characterize
the amount of this dark energy this
stuff which is causing the rate of
expansion to increase the thing which
Einstein thought was a blunder but in
fact seems to be there if you
characterize the amount of that stuff
invariant in natural units which you
know you can sort of make everything
dimensionless so you end up with a
dimensionless number the number
describing the cosmological constant
seems to be about 0.00 and there's 119
zeros and then there's a 1 so it's 10 to
the minus 120 it's an incredibly small
number so somehow the universe is very
finely tuned so that for a long time it
was expanding under the under the
influence of the initial energy causing
the Big Bang and things were slow
down and then only very late in the
history of the universe after galaxies
had formed and lots of structure was
here has this cosmological constant
taken over and forced things to start
moving apart faster and faster okay so
that's the cosmological observation it
seems that the universe is expanding but
the thing causing it to expand is an
incredibly finely tuned number and from
basic physics is not obvious why this
number should be so finely tuned any
questions about that okay so let me come
to a slightly different aspect of this
story another set of cosmological
observations which also tell us about
some expansion but in a slightly
different context so there was a thing
called the Wilkinson microwave
anisotropy probe which went up in space
and was very carefully measuring the
microwave radiation coming from the very
early universe coming from different
directions you might have seen pictures
of that also if you read some popular
science things um according to those
measurements there's an incredible
similarity between patches of the
universe in different directions in the
sky and what that means physically is
that it seems like those regions must
have somehow been in causal contact
things that happened in one of those
places that we see at the very distance
very far distance must have influenced
others but according to a simple model
of the expansion of the universe and the
history of the universe there's no time
in history when those things would have
been in causal contact because the light
from those two things those two
different directions is just now meeting
us so if you have light ray is coming
from two points coming together and just
now meeting us it's very hard for a
light ray from one of those to have
gotten to the other in the far distant
past of the universe so people found
this very puzzling but there's a nice
simple and beautiful explanation for
this which is the notion of inflation
which fella named Alan Guth is now at
MIT came up with the idea of inflation
is that in the very early universe
probably even before the Big Bang there
may have been a significantly large
cosmological constant and that large
cosmological constant as we've discussed
now
causes the universe to expand and if
that number is not 10 to the minus
hundred and twenty but a half in natural
units then it causes the universe to
expand very quickly in every plunk unit
of time the size of the universe will
multiply by a factor of e so you rapidly
get exponential growth and like stock
markets until they undergo Corrections
it would just get bigger and bigger and
bigger faster and faster until some
correction would kick in and move in
move us into the phase of the universe
we're now in at this time so the scale
of the universe in that period of
expansion would go as an exponential in
time now we do not now live in the
universe which is incredibly rapidly
inflating so there was an initial
picture of inflation which Ruth came up
with which I will describe here because
it's relevant to the later part of this
story and we can we can combine our two
the two things we've talked about that
in the history in the distant history
the cosmological constant was bigger and
now it's incredibly small in this little
picture where we have some kind of a
potential function sort of a landscape
where there's one minimum of this
potential at a high value so it might be
that the universe used to be living in
this red dot vacuum one where the energy
where the cosmological constant was
fairly high and things were inflating
very rapidly and in quantum mechanics in
classical mechanics if you're in a local
Hill Valley like that you'll never get
out of it but in quantum mechanics you
have a wave function which can kind of
creeped out over the hill and suddenly
you can sneak out it's true I was told I
didn't want to move too far away from
microphones and nobody'll hear me oh so
if we moved out into the second the
green minimum by quantum tunneling we
get away if we get away of motions or
moves out of the first vacuum into the
second vacuum at a certain point we can
suddenly get a region a bubble of this
of the second vacuum popping out and we
would move into by quantum tunneling the
vacuum that we now live in with a much
smaller cosmological constant so let's
just keep that picture in mind this is
one scenario for how we could get a very
high cosmological constant in the past
and a smaller one in the present this
scenario as described can't be exactly
right this is the old version of
inflation and there's some newer ID
which which are taken into account but
this is actually more relevant for the
story I'm telling today yes question
yeah I'm actually talking about the
whole universe or a region in the
universe so here's the way to think
about it if we live in a situation where
everywhere in the universe were in
vacuum one what can happen through
quantum tunneling is a patch of a
certain size can creep into vacuum too
and if that patch is big enough that
patch will take over well it what it'll
do is it'll form a bubble and that
bubble will expand on its own under its
own cosmological constant it'll expand
at the speed of light the region outside
it will also be expanding and I'll come
to a picture in a little bit where
you'll see what the universe starts to
look like you get a background where the
universe has a large domain in region
one with a bubble inside and in regent
in domain 2 in vacuum two and both of
them are expanding so each one of them
is getting bigger and bigger over time
due to its own cosmological constant yes
another question
good so the question is is there any
thing which rules out negative matter
something which would cause a repulsive
force in gravity so there have been a
lot of experiments testing gravity in
great detail and looking for so-called
fifth forces which would be additional
forces which might be interpreted as
negative gravitational forces so far
none of those experiments have come up
with anything definitive there are
alternatives to Einstein's theory of
general relativity there none of them
are at in my mind at this time equally
attractive as explanations of what we
see in nature but there are some puzzles
having to do with both dark energy and a
more prosaic kind of dark matter which
is extra material that seems to be in
the universe these detailed observations
by w map tell us that only a small
fraction less than ten percent of the
matter in the universe is the stuff we
can see baryons and you know the stuff
that makes us up some fraction of it is
made out of dark matter which is some
kind of matter we can't yet observe and
some part of it is made out of this dark
energy and there are alternatives to
Einstein's general relativity one in
particular is called mond which modified
Newtonian dynamics which purport to give
an alternative explanation I would say
at this point in time these are on the
fringe of what's widely accepted it's
pretty uncontroversial that most
experiments very strongly support
Einstein's general theory of general
relativity which would give us a picture
where mass the mass that appears in the
term sourcing the gravitational field is
the same as the thing which is affected
by the gravitational field and that just
always gives you an attractive force
good question of other questions ok so
we've talked a little about cosmology
next I want to move to string theory so
what is string theory and why I want to
talk about it so there are four forces
in nature that we have observed and
verified with clear experiments there's
electromagnetism which were all very
familiar with it underlies all
electronics there's the strong and the
weak nuclear forces which are equally
important the strong nuclear force holds
together the charged particles in the
nuclei of atoms and the weak nuclear
force is also relevant in nuclear
interactions and then finally there's
gravity as we've said gravity is the
weakest of these forces but the only one
which is universally attractive now we
have this really snazzy mathematical
framework for describing theories of
forces it combines quantum mechanics
with field theories like
electromagnetism it's called quantum
field theory and it's a very elegant
theory it accurately describes three of
these forces it describes
electromagnetism the strong and the weak
nuclear forces but if you try to use
quantum field theory to describe gravity
you run into significant problems at all
kinds of hell breaks loose and you
really can't make sense of what you've
got the issue is essentially that in
quantum mechanics you are looking at all
possible ways that a system might
fluctuate or Traverse a make a
trajectory from one point to another in
its space of possible configurations and
in the case of quantum field theories
that means you imagine that a particle
could take all possible routes to get
from A to B and then you some something
over all of them in the case of gravity
that means you have to sum over all
possible ways that space-time itself
could fluctuate and that would include
things like little worm holes appearing
and disappearing and very complicated
things happening with the geometry and
topology which we don't have any
mathematics to really handle so there's
some foundational level of which we
don't know the right mathematics to do
it and as sort of a practical level
where you just try to not evil apply the
rules of quantum field theory and you
get infinities you can't deal with other
infinities in all quantum field theories
but some of them you can sweep under the
rug very easily those are called a
normalized well theories gravity is not
a reliable theory it has further
problems so over the last two or three
decades people have started to work on
an alternative to quantum field theory
which is premise on a very simple
starting assumption which is just that
rather than point-like particles you
assume that the objects moving around
our little loops of strength their
little one-dimensional objects and if
you make that assumption you change the
picture of space-time where a point like
particle will move along and amid a
photon that's an electron emitting a
photon which then connects to another
electron in place of that you get a
picture where two loops of string will
in
interact by sending a loop of string
apart across this gives you a smooth
picture of how strings interact and that
smoothness of the picture on the right
compared to the picture on the left is
what makes it a much better behaved
theory in some sense so if we just do
this simple technical thing we replace
point-like particles with little loops
of string we discovered that we
automatically get a quantum field theory
which has forces like electromagnetism
but it also has gravity in it it just
pops out automatically so that's great I
think we're definitely on the right
track the biggest catch here is that
this theory lives most naturally in ten
space-time dimensions so if you think
that this is the right theory describing
quantum gravity and right now it is
really the only consistent and robust
framework we have to describe quantum
gravity and higher number of space-time
dimensions add in its variance you're
stuck dealing with ten space-time
dimensions so how do we deal with that
well there's a notion which people have
pursued for many years which is called
compactification and basically the idea
is maybe not all the dimensions of those
ten dimensions are big maybe you can get
rid of six of them by curling them up
into some very small dimensions it like
imagine a very long straw if you look at
a very long straw from a ways away it
just looks like a line actually the
surface of the straw is two-dimensional
it's curled up in a little cylinder but
if you're far enough away you don't
notice that so we may be living in a
space-time which is really 10
dimensional but we're only seeing four
of those dimensions the other six are
curled up very small and the structure
of those extra six dimensions depending
on exactly how you curl them up can give
you different kinds of quantum field
theories that is it can give you
electromagnetism and the strong and weak
nuclear forces or it can give you things
which are slightly different and that's
where we're going to get to this issue
that there's lots of different solutions
yes question
good so the question is whether there's
a natural reason for the dimensions to
curl up like that there are a number of
suggestions and it's obviously very
attractive to try to find a reason why
we would live in four dimensions rather
than a different number of dimensions I
would say at this time none of them are
really convincing I mean there are some
notions that there are their extended
objects that might wrap around some of
these dimensions and they would kind of
keep some of them from expanding and
allow others to expand and there's some
numerology that might make that a
plausible story but I would not say that
it's yet a really robust story so in
particular you can already see that the
number of dimensions of space-time that
we observe is not obviously predicted by
string theory so in some of those other
regions I mentioned the apparent
dimension of space time may be different
right if you go far enough away our next
door neighbors in the next patch may
have a six-dimensional apparent universe
that's one of the things that might be
different one of the other things that
might be different is they might have a
different compactification they might be
compactified down to four dimensions on
a different manifold which we give some
other quantum field theory so you can
start to see how you're going to get a
lot of different solutions okay so an
important question is is string theory a
unique theory so there's a famous
parable of the Indian parable of the
blind men and the elephant which people
like to try it out at this time so I
will trot it out here's the elephant you
have a bunch of different blind men and
there's an elephant and each one of them
approaches the elephant and touches a
different part of the elephant and one
of them describes it as being sort of
hard and smooth because they were
touching the toenail and one of them
describes it as being kind of like a
snake because they were touching the
trunk anyway string theory is a little
bit is a little bit like that for a long
time we thought there were five
different string theories and they have
these names you can see up here at type
to a type to be hetero doc so32 etc I've
got sex and I'll mention that a minute
what was realized about ten years ago is
that these are all different pieces of
the same underlying structure there are
things called duality symmetries which
relate all these and show that they're
really all part of one underlying
mathematical framework they're all
limits of the same theory so string
theory is in fact unique not only that
but there's another thing over there
called M theory which is not even quite
a string theory it's 11 dimensional
rather than ten it doesn't it doesn't
have strings at all it's got two
dimensional membranes it's also tied
into this thing so there is some
underlying mathematical thing we can't
quite define it but we know how to
define certain limits of it and the
limits of it that we can define are the
little pieces of that elephant that the
blind men have been touching so string
theory is a unique theory it's got some
unique underlying mathematical structure
even though we can't articulate it yet
but it has many different realizations
in terms of the kind of physics you can
see coming out of it that comes from the
fact that there are many different
compactification many ways of curling up
those extra dimensions and each one of
those can give you different kinds of
physics in space-time so that leads us
to the vacuum problem which is what I
started discussing at the beginning so
until about five years ago if you ask
most people that thought about these
things they would have told you well the
cosmological constant is almost
certainly zero and it seems like there's
lots of compactification zas string
theory but there's probably some
mechanism which just forces it to choose
one so when we really understand the
theory we'll probably have some dynamics
which will force us into one particular
vacuum it will have lambda equals zero
that will be the world and we'll be able
to predict the mass of the electron
there was a quote I don't know 20 years
ago 15 years ago by outstanding
physicists who commented that well it
seems like it's now only a matter of
technical details before we can predict
the mass of the electron to 20 digits
something ought to those to that effect
it hasn't been done yet and it's now not
quite so clear that we will be able to
do that for the following reason as
we've discussed experimentally it's been
observed that the cosmological constant
is not 0 it's 10 to the minus hundred
twenty and in a parallel development not
necessarily related to that but but
certainly the idea of looking for
solutions with positive lambda has been
has been promoted quite a bit by this
observation it's been realized that in
strengthen we really don't have a
natural mechanism to pick up on vacuum
there's many many solutions with lambda
equals zero and there's many many
solutions it seems with lambda not equal
to zero it's harder to mathematically
characterize the ones with lambda not
equal to zero but in fact we can show
that there are an infinite number of
solutions to string theory each of which
gives you a different local space-time
physics
now if you put in some really simple
cut-offs like that the size of the
compactification manifold is not too too
big so we would have seen it already
then you can cut it down to a finite
number that we can actually compute it's
not to say there have to be a finite
number but the ones we know about are on
the order of 10 to the 1000 it seems
from basically putting together a bunch
of pieces people understand and making
the most natural conclusion so there are
an enormous number of different ways of
using string theory compacta fiying it
and coming up with some kind of four
dimensional physics like ours but
different and that number of threats to
be on the order of 10 to the 1000 so is
this yes please question
these are okay so the question was is
there any notion that some of these
solutions might be more likely or more
stable and those are precisely the
questions that a lot of strength
theorists are trying very hard to answer
right now you can wave your so let me
address those two things separately one
is the likelihood the likelihood would
involve choosing some kind of a measure
a distribution on the space of these
vacuous and to do that we would really
have to understand the dynamics of the
theory of the dynamics of quantum
gravity better than we do this picture
of inflation with this kind of tunneling
process that I talked about is something
people do not mathematically understand
very well and in fact it's very hard to
assign probabilities there's a sense in
which we really have no idea how to
define probabilities for these things
because you get an infinite number of
things at some point and it's like if I
give you all the integers and I ask you
what fraction of the integers are even
your natural response is half right but
then I can list them in a very different
way I can you know list uneven integers
every third one 3 to 5 74 etc and I
would say well only a third of them are
even it really depends on what you put
in as a cutoff basically so we don't
know how to do that there may be a sense
in which that's true but we don't have
the mathematics to describe it yet right
now all we can do is talk about the
solutions the second question is whether
some of them can be stable and others
can be unstable that is probably the
most promising way in which to get rid
of this rather disturbing picture I'm
painting where there's into so many
solutions it is possible that many of
the solutions are unstable all the
solutions with positive cosmological
constant are probably unstable but on a
very long time scale time scale is much
much longer than the history of our
universe in particular if you have a
small cosmological constant you can
always decay into an even smaller
cosmological constant but it takes a
long time on the other hand if your
cosmological constant is one-half in
natural units and there's a nearby
vacuum with a cosmological constant of
one quarter you're going to be unstable
to that vacuum in a very short period of
time so there is a sense in which that
instability will naturally take you down
further and further to small our
cosmological constants eventually so I
hope that answers your question um okay
so this is this picture at all sensible
should we should we take this at all
seriously this is sounding pretty wacky
we're talking about an enormous universe
with different regions that we can't
really observe why would we really take
this seriously
so this a kind of a prescient argument
by a Nobel prize-winning physicist named
Steven Weinberg who made an argument
which i think is one of the more
compelling arguments for taking this
story seriously and his argument was as
follows before anybody had observed that
there was a nonzero cosmological
constant he did a little calculation he
said if the cosmological constant was
bigger than a certain value remember the
cosmological constant causes things to
move apart from each other if it was
bigger than a certain value then before
galaxies had a time to form everything
would have just drifted apart or been
pushed apart by the cosmological
constant galaxies would never have
formed we would not have the kind of
nice structure we see in our patch of
the universe and we would probably not
be here and he computed the number and
the number was 10 to the minus 118 so if
the cosmological constant was bigger
than 10 to the minus 118 then we
wouldn't be here because galaxies would
never have form structure of the kind we
see would not have formed and we would
just have a diffuse gas of particles
moving apart from one another or at
least we might have smaller structures
but nothing as big as what we need to
get our kind of structure in the
universe so he made this argument before
anybody measured that the cosmological
constant was 10 to the minus hundred and
twenty and then people measured that yes
it's just below his bound it's 10 to the
minus hundred and twenty to me that's
actually a kind of a compelling
observation because it says that if this
story is correct that there's a lot of
different patches with different
cosmological constants then the fact
that we live in the patch with 10 to the
minus 120 is just kind of an
environmental feature of the fact that
stuff like what we see can only occur in
certain places in the universe you don't
ask the following question you don't
look around and say look most of the
universe is empty space why are we not
sitting in empty space right now I mean
statistically we should be an empty
space right that does you know you don't
even have that discussion because it's
clear that for us to be here we would
have to be living in a patch where
there's a bunch of mass and a planet and
all that stuff in the same way it may be
that the universe is very big and we're
not in one of these other patches for
the same reason we're not in empty space
because nothing interesting happens
there so to me this is actually a
somewhat compelling argument it
certainly makes us it certainly is one
which indicates that we should perhaps
take this point of view seriously and at
least try to debunk it so the picture
we've assembled by this time is often
referred to as the string landscape is
one of your neighbors at Stanford
University here who I've been talking to
a lot this semester in the last few
years a guy named Lenny Susskind he
recently wrote a nice book which I
recommend anybody interested in learning
a little bit more about this called the
cosmic landscape he would I think was at
least partly instrumental in coining the
term the landscape to describe this
scenario basically the picture we end up
with is a landscape where there are lots
of hills and valleys in this
cosmological constant scattered over the
space of possible string configurations
and there's a bunch of minimum local
minima denoted by the green points and
the different minima correspond to
different kinds of vacuum the lake there
is a continuous many parameter family of
vacuum with lambda equals zero and the
various local Hills are things with
lambda may be greater than zero but some
of them will have less than zero but
there could be lots of these if there
are enough of these in particular if
they are greater than ten to one hundred
and twenty of these and if lambda is
relatively uniformly distributed between
0 and 1 or minus 1 and 1 then
generically just by probability some of
these vacuo will have 10 to the minus
hundred and twenty or smaller for their
cosmological constant so in fact the
best way to realize a vacuum which has
such a small cosmological constant is to
just have a whole bunch of them and have
some of them just by random statistics
have to be small otherwise you have to
somehow fine-tune nature so in some
sense it's the simplest explanation for
how to get a small cosmological constant
is just that there's so many different
possibilities we just happen to have
enough possibilities that we get some
naturally so you're actually naturally
led in the absence of some kind of
really detailed fine-tuning of how the
universe works to a picture where there
are lots of different vacuum and most of
them don't have such a small
cosmological constant
okay so what this leads to if we put
this in the context of this inflation
and bubbling story that we talked about
is now we have this potential and if
you're sitting in one vacuum say vacuum
one which is the red vacuum there's
always a possibility that some little
patch of the universe will bubble up a
patch by quantum tunneling that's in
phase two in the second of these vacua
hey phase one will expand because when
you have a cosmological constants base
expands and an exponential rate phase
two will also expand so the amount of
space that is in each of these two
phases will expand exponentially the
amount of space in phase one will expand
faster than the amount of space in phase
two but they'll both expand
exponentially and then if there's a
region three we can either tunnel from
one to three or from two to three and
we'll get patches of three appearing
inside the patches of one and two and if
you go on from three to ten to the 1000
you get some idea what the picture of
the universe might look like there might
be regions which are in one phase with
bubbles that are in another phase
containing bubbles in another phase up
to 10 to the 1000 different kinds of
phases all scattered around the universe
okay so that's the picture we end up
with now the question I want to address
is if that's the universe then what do
we do about it and what can we actually
do in terms of carrying out the goal of
physics which is to actually make
predictions or figure out how to explain
the physics where we are so the vacuum
problem is where are we in this picture
yes question
there would actually be boundaries
separating these regions it might be
hard to get to those boundaries because
if you're going to give an patch because
of the fact that the universe is
expanding things that are distant are
moving away faster and faster so for
instance if we live in a patch with our
cosmological constant we've observed
because of this accelerated expansion of
the universe if you started traveling at
the speed of light out towards the
boundary of the universe by the time you
got there it would have moved so far
away that you would just have to keep
going and going and you would in fact
never be able to reach the things which
are past a certain point called the
Hubble radius so we can't actually get
there but there may be a boundary out
there if you look if you had a global
picture of the space-time then you would
have a function where you would be
living in one vacuum and then it would
be some kind of a kink where the thing
would move into another vacuum and then
but you'd be living in the other vacuum
so there would be boundaries domain
walls separating these different kinds
of physics but unless you were lucky you
wouldn't be living in a region where you
could see one oh yeah there's not a
question
so the question is is it possible that
there's a boundary heading towards us at
the speed of light and yes it is
possible it is not required because in
our patch of the universe our patch of
the universe has this Hubble size
anything that happens outside the
outside the Hubble size will never get
into us now it's possible that out at
Alpha Centauri it might happen that a
little patch of another vacuum forms
which is just big enough in some next
you know maybe we're in vacuum to maybe
a patch of vacuum three could form
somewhere out there and it would expand
fast enough it's close enough to us and
it's expanding fast enough that we would
not get away from that it would just
come and hit us so it is possible it's
very unlikely because we have such a
small cosmological constant they're
probably the time for the decay is at
least billions of years are much longer
but it is not logically impossible in
this picture yes another question well
this is where you get into ok so i
should i should add here that a lot of
physicists really hate this picture and
there's a lot of controversy about
whether it makes sense to talk about
this what you do with this picture if
it's right or really whether it whether
this is physics because when we talk
about one of these other patches we are
in principle unable to move to one of
those other patches and measure things
in our patch of the universe even if
there's at this 30 if 30 billion
light-years away there's a domain wall
we'll never see it because it's outside
our Hubble radius so parts of this are
very hard to verify directly now there
are other things in physics that are
hard to verify directly nobody's ever
seen a lot alone quark and yet we
believe that there are quarks quarks
come in in sets of two or three that are
tied up in little pat bundles which have
no charge under under the strong nuclear
force the fact that nobody's ever seen a
cork doesn't make people not believe it
it just means you have to have more
sophisticated indirect evidence that
this is true now I believe that if we
can get strength theory to the point
where we can say look this is a really
robust theory this is what it predicts
and it also predicts the following
things which we can verify by experiment
then we will be in a situation where we
have to believe that this is the
simplest explanation for our universe
and therefore this is probably correct
but we may never be able to measure
those
directly yes another question
but so the question is is there a
preference when you're tunneling from
one vacuum to another whether you're
increasing or decreasing lambda now the
process of decreasing lambda is called a
Coleman dilution instant-on and it's
been fairly well understood in physics
it is pretty straightforward to
construct the sort of a solution in a
certain Euclidean eyes version technical
stuff you have to do but there's a
relatively robust sense in which people
think they can make sense of the
tunneling from a higher cosmological
constant to a lower one there is some
controversy I would say as to whether
you can go up I don't think there's a
universal agreement on that the general
feeling I think as you probably can't
but nobody's I would I would not want to
go out on a limb on that way it's a
harder thing to understand I'm sorry the
dark energy is proportional to lambda
yeah the trick about quantum mechanics
is you can for short periods of time you
can tunnel into things with higher
energies right you can always you can
disobey conservation laws for very short
periods of time in quantum mechanics and
we don't understand quantum gravity well
enough to know whether if you
momentarily disobey the law of
conservation of energy by formulating a
little bubble more energy that thing is
going to start inflating under its own
cosmological constant it will just keep
on going we don't understand whether
you're allowed to do that or not another
question
okay I have nine minutes I will I think
conclude in nine minutes thank you very
much so the problem is where are we so
this leads to the last part of my talk
which is actually the computational
challenge here of is this something
where we might hope to make some
progress in terms of figuring out how we
can make a prediction even if this
outlandish paradigm is correct so there
are two things that we can try to do
which I think will help us to move
towards making physical predictions the
first thing obviously is to try to
identify our vacuum right which vacuum
do we live in out of these 10 to the
1000 that's a hard problem because you
have to look at a lot of different vacua
a simpler thing you might try to do is
to try to find structure in this
landscape you might try to find for
instance things which are always
correlated that is if you find feature
one feature in the landscape you and
sorry if you find that all vacuo with a
particular feature also have some other
feature and we have the first feature in
our world then you might hope to find
the second feature but there is this
issue which is that even if we know the
theory and we can mathematically write
it down and we can compute precisely
each of the vacuole one at a time
although we obviously can't run through
all of them cuz we have enough particles
in universe to do it if we could in some
way compute each of them if all the
observables are uniformly distributed
and independent then we are in trouble
because we may not be able to make
predictions right if there's other
versions of the universe right next door
which could have any possible imaginable
value of the electron mass of the fine
structure constant governing the
strength of electromagnetism if all
these things can be tuned to arbitrary
precision by just choosing some vacuum
we have less we have far less than a
thousand digits of experimental
information that goes into our
characterization of the Standard Model
of particle physics right now we could
presumably dial each of those parameters
arbitrarily if all these things are
uniformly and independently distributed
so it's kind of a semi organized effort
going on I mean it's basically just a
bunch of people doing their own
individual things but there's some
effort to organize this a little bit
Mike Douglas from Rutgers Gordy Kane
from Michigan myself from MIT lots of
other
good physicists from some of the best
institutions around both here and in
Europe are thinking about this bill
emissions sort of skewed towards the
younger end of the of the age
distribution a lot of the older
physicists are more skeptical of this
approach to understanding physics and
this controversy is a kind of an
interesting sociological phenomenon but
there's also serve an East Coast West
Coast split on this one I'm one of the
Renegades on the East Coast who's more
into this but lots of people both here
and in Europe are working to try to
analyze these vacu and what we need to
do is there's a number of steps that
have to be gone through we need a
mathematical formulation of the problem
and we don't actually have a complete
mathematical definition of string theory
yet so we need to work towards that but
along the way we we can characterize
these vacuo fairly well in many cases
without even knowing how to define the
theory which may sound difficult but
it's true once we can mathematically
characterize the problem we need to come
up with efficient algorithms you're all
familiar with that issue you have some
mathematical framework that's in some
paper somewhere you have to figure out
how to make an efficient algorithm to
actually solve the problem and then once
you know what the algorithm is you have
to actually perform a systematic search
involving implementing the algorithm
putting it on a bunch of computers or a
computer and running through things and
then you get whole bunch of numbers out
and you have to interpret those results
and say does this tell us anything about
physics so each of these four steps I
think is a major challenge and there's
interesting things to do on all of these
I think of particular interest perhaps
to the people here there are a lot of
challenging questions having to do with
algorithms and systematic searches which
really form a major computational
challenge here we're obviously not going
to search through 10 to the 1000 vacuo
by just having a computer run through
them one at a time because we'd never
get there we need to be smart about how
to do that so yeah got about five
minutes I'll just whip through this um
let me just give you a little bit of a
sense of how you construct different
vacuous so the first thing you do is you
have to pick a six or seven dimensional
manifold in which to compacta finds the
one class of manifolds if people have
compactified are called Flavio manifolds
certain mathematical gadgets that beacon
characterized by certain combinatorial
data in certain cases in a very simple
way one of the first computational
efforts in this direction was done by
parents kharka if you google Kreutzer
and skark ax and collab you you will
find their online searchable database of
473 million collab et al manifolds so
there you can just get a little sample
of a tiny fraction of the number of
possible string compactification these
are 473 million different things you
could compact upon each one we give you
different physics there are probably
many more collabs nobody even knows if
the number is finite or not but
certainly this is probably a small
subset but it's a nice subset which is
easy to characterize there are also
other space as possible and even spaces
which are not really geometric but I
don't time to get into that generally
these collab yells will live in the late
in that landscape they will have
continued table have lambda equals zero
and they will have continuous moduli
like if you take a circle the circle
could have arbitrary radius simple a
string compactification as you compact
around a circle and then you're in nine
dimensional space-time that circle can
have arbitrary radius that will change
the coupling constants in the nine
dimensional theory you want to get rid
of these things which are called moduli
which are those parameters so you put in
some things called fluxes which are like
generalizations of electromagnetic
fluxes and when you put in those fluxes
you generate the landscape I described
where you have lots of isolated vacuum
so there's been some progress and
classifying these different so called
flux vacuo if you combine collab eil
manifolds with fluxes in principle this
gives you a compactification with a
certain come up with a certain
cosmological constant now there's a real
trick which is that nobody can calculate
the cosmological constant in a case
where it's nonzero for any of these
vacuous and the reason is the
cosmological constant is the energy
density which comes from summing up a
huge number of terms which are like plus
one minus one plus seven plus point
seven minus point three etc a whole
bunch of numbers with opposite signs and
these things have to add up and cancel
202 within 20 decimal places to get 110
120 it's really hard to compute those
things we don't even have mathematically
the formalism to do it but even if we
could there was a nice argument by den F
and Douglas which shows that even in the
simple models the problem of finding a
vacuum with a small
lambda even given some simple models for
how to compute it is an np-hard problem
it's a lot like the minimum length
vector problem you know this problem or
if you're given vector you get a set of
vectors in a space and the question is
what's the integral linear combination
of those vectors of the shortest length
that's an np-hard problem and that is at
least the cosmological constant problem
even in the very simplest cartoon
characterization is at least that hard
so even if somebody could write down all
the models and then ask you to calculate
the cosmological constants it would be
very hard to locate our vacuum with 10
to the minus hundred twenty cosmological
constant okay so you might worried at
this point and say we're totally out of
luck it is true that because of this
mathematical and computational
complexity of the cosmological constant
it may be intractable to identify our
precise vacuum or even to compute those
vacuo which have such a small
cosmological constant but that is not
the end of the story i would say that
all is not lost if in fact the
cosmological constant is relatively
independent of other features we may be
able to predict everything else about
physics and just not the cosmological
constant and then we would just have to
say look we found 10 to the four hundred
vacuo with all these properties the
cosmological constant is uniformly
distributed one of them must be hours
and have a small cosmological constant
so if we can show that all models with
particular features let's say features x
and y which are observed in nature also
have some other features z then we can
make a prediction we can say if you do
in a particle accelerator experiment
which should which should measure Z we
should see it because every model we
found in string theory has that that
would be a prediction out of string
theory even in the face of this
computational complexity so to do that
what we have to do is we have to look
for correlations in the landscape so
then we have various different ways of
getting into more detail now we have to
not only have a compactification we have
to pick the forces of nature and the
particles and there's one way to do this
which is by putting higher dimensional
things called brains I won't get too
much into this but that we can put in
things wrapping the thing we're compact
defying on and they intersect in certain
places in the way that they intersect
will give rise to some number of quarks
and some number of electrons and things
like that so skipping a lot of the
complexity we can formulate this problem
essentially as a partition problem given
a big vector we're give it a bunch of
little vectors and the question is how
many ways are there of adding up an into
a linear combination of the little
vectors to get the big vector so in this
case the integers will correspond to the
forces of nature if N equals 1 at CNM if
it's too it's the weak force if it's
three it's the strong force if it's for
it's something we don't have in our part
of the universe so there's a partition
problem if we want to evaluate all
partitions you can think about that as a
fit as a computational problem it's an
exponentially hard problem there's an
exponentially large number of solutions
if there's lots of solutions some group
in Germany blue van Hagen at all spent a
year on computer time computing through
all these in some recent work with Mike
Douglas we've been doing this but we
took a different approach we basically
are just looking for the class of models
which include the standard model so
we're saying look if you fix the
standard model the partition problem
becomes a cubic time problem so actually
in the last couple months we put it on a
computer we've got a bunch of algorithms
and we can show that in this particular
class of models there's only on the
order of 10 to the 7th or 10 to the 8th
which have the standard model gauge
group and of those only about 10 have
the right set of particles now there's
only a piece of this landscape but it's
a an example of how by using
computational cleverness we can actually
start to find sets of data sets of vacuo
which we might compare to our universe
summary is the universe may be very big
really really big as many zeros as you
can imagine physics and other places may
be very very different from the physics
we have here string theory seems to have
a lot of different solutions and can
describe many of these solutions but
there's a real challenge in figuring out
how to make predictions based on this
model and I think not only their
mathematical but also many computational
challenges and I think it's pretty
interesting it's a place where
mathematics and physics and computer
science all kind of come together we
want to do a bunch of searches and so I
hope you found this amusing and if any
of you are really interested I can give
you more references or you know if you
want to spend some of your ten percent
time trying to find vacu I'd be happy to
talk to you about that I'll leave it
