offering us this this platform in some
ways but also just to have the
opportunity for kids to talk about
themselves and about what we do just a
little background in 2006 2007 we
started as a group and we were launched
in someone's house one of a board
members house on clipper Street in San
Francisco and it was basically in her
kitchen and living room for a number of
years and we've now moved to the San
Francisco Friends school but it starts
it usually the beginning of the school
year and it's once a month and these
kids have many of them have been coming
over and over and over again during that
time and and just a little bit of a
background from there that very first
meeting there may be about 15 kids in a
room and Jonathan Mooney who is a LD
advocate extraordinaire
went to brown has an incredible story or
not just overcoming but using his
strengths and as as someone who probably
reads at a third or fourth grade level
right now so he talks a lot about that
but he turned to the kids and said so
what do you want to do and there was a
little bit of a hubbub in the room and
they said we want to speak on panels we
want to make a film and we want to write
a book and at the end he turned to the
woman whose house it was Julie Tron and
myself and said I don't think that's
gonna happen not that he was doubtful
but it was a lot to bite off and these
kids have over time and time again have
shown great resilience great fortitude
and they're very very ambitious so I'm
gonna turn it over to we're gonna start
all the way down at the end I want you
to introduce yourselves tell us what
grade you are in what school you go to
tell us a little bit about when you were
first diagnosed with your LD
hi I'm tomorrow and I'm senior at the
base school which is in San Francisco I
was first diagnosed in seventh grade and
it actually wasn't really that
revolutionary I guess when I was
diagnosed because I was kind of I don't
really understand what learning
differences were at the time and I
didn't really understand until around
ninth grade so maybe I'll talk about
that later
yeah thank you hi I'm Frankie I am a
junior at Gateway High School in San
Francisco I was diagnosed in first grade
that was a long time ago
I don't really remember but what my mom
has told me is that when I was first
diagnosed I went around walking down the
street telling everyone I was dyslexic
and I didn't know what that meant I just
thought that was a good thing but other
than that I don't really remember I'm
Shawn I go to rear in high school in the
city I was diagnosed in third grade but
it wasn't really that like big a deal
because learning disabilities were like
diseases so yeah
I'm Annie I go to school in Marin County
I technically go to three schools right
now I have four independent study
classes a class at Redwood high school
in the class at College of Marin I have
dyslexia and something called scotopic
sensitivity syndrome which is kind of a
reading disability it's basically like
you know the salt and pepper on a TV
when the cable box is unplugged it's
kind of like that only everywhere um and
so on pages it makes it a little hard to
read
I was identified in the end of sixth
grade and prior to that I really thought
I was stupid thought I was going nowhere
I was failing classes I could not read I
didn't know my math facts couldn't spell
and school was my least favorite thing
in the world and so when I was
identified it was definitely definitely
a relief to like know the cause to all
of my school struggles but it was also a
little bit scary because like I thought
dyslexia just meant like oh you're kind
of you know not as good as everyone else
but turns out that wasn't right hi I'm
Nia I'm a freshman at Redwood high
school and I have ADHD and dyslexia and
when I was first diagnosed in the end of
fourth grade beginning of fifth grade it
was kind of a relief because I always
had a lot of trouble with like spelling
a math facts and I could not memorize
anything but I also thought it was kind
of this really cool special Club because
like my sister Annie she had gotten
diagnosed and I figured anything that
Annie had that was awesome so it's
Alexia oh my gosh that's so cool
hi I'm Fiona I I have quite a few
learning disabilities ADHD dysgraphia
probably and sensory integration
disorder in some processing disorders
with my memory and stuff um oh and I'm a
senior at the bay school with tomorrow I
tomorrow and and I was diagnosed I think
when I was like in fourth grade is that
right mom
okay she nodded
so that means that I'm good and you know
I mean I was in fourth grade at the time
so I don't really remember it but I do
remember it really kind of changing when
I went to sixth grade and then I started
taking a THD medication and that really
helped but this is I've really gotten
improved with my learning in terms of
the my learning disability by going to
say I want everybody to answer this one
as well talk a little bit about school
challenges you know how sort of when you
first noticed if you did because maybe
some of you have not but when you first
noticed through your learning difference
learning disability how school was
challenged for you so I think for me the
main thing is just taking a lot longer
to do work than other people and I
noticed that already in I guess when I
was in middle school because we always
had class work to do and I always had to
finish it during lunch or finish it
after school so that was kind of
frustrating another thing is that I have
a hard time memorizing math formulas so
even though I would like say it to
myself again and again to write it out
again and again just what it stick I
think those are the two main things well
I was first diagnosed in first grade so
I don't really remember but what I do
remember from that time is I remember I
couldn't really read in first grade so
people even my parents and I think even
my nanny came to school to help me read
because I couldn't I couldn't do it so
they had to someone had to sit next to
me and help me read all so people would
take me out of class and do these
certain exercises things like that and I
didn't really know why I just thought I
was like oh time out of class that's
okay with me
anything to get out of class
and then I started taking ADHD
medication when I was in maybe second
grade maybe first and I've been taking
it ever since then so I do definitely
notice when I haven't taken my
medication and when I have taken it
because I just am a lot more when I do
take my medication I'm a lot calmer and
I can concentrate but if I don't I'm off
the walls and I don't even usually
recommend recommend to myself take on
this medication and then also I started
to notice when I started getting to
higher and higher levels of math I
started having more and more problems
math is my is probably my worst subject
I get okay okay grades but I I have test
anxiety especially in math so when I'm
at a test and look at the test I forget
everything and or that's not always
usually the case but sometimes I will
forget everything and will completely
fail the test my learning disabilities
where most trouble become for me was
basically in grammar school I have a
hard time remembering and the difference
for me is that I didn't really get any
help from teachers the playing field
wasn't leveled so I had to basically do
the subjects like everyone else had to
but like they were like a different
level so it was difficult to let's see
well I first remember struggling in
first grade where I would just sit in
the corner with a book looking at the
pictures like scared on the verge of
crying because I just couldn't
understand the words I used to pretend I
was sick to the point where my mom took
me to get blood tests because she
thought something was medically
seriously wrong with me and school was
just it was horrible
it was the probably one of the worst
experiences I've had was having to go to
school without knowing that I was like
sick and without knowing that there were
strategies to help with it
my main troubles have definitely been
through spelling and math I remember in
second grade Antarctica was the bane of
my existence
like I remember in first grade we had
this game where you would everybody
would start on the line at the edge of
the classroom and then they would ask
you an addition fact and you would hop
forward if you got it right and I just
remember being stumped back at the
starting line and it was just horrible I
did not understand what was going on and
I it was the same thing when we started
the multiplication in third grade I
didn't I wasn't able to figure out
multiplication until around fifth or
sixth grade and I'm still not good at it
at all and still can't spell at all
although with spellcheck it just helped
out but we were in sixth grade we had a
lot of spelling test and our teacher
would go around and like you would get
she would draw you a special picture if
you got 100% and I remember being the
only person in the class who had never
gotten that and she thought it was funny
she'd be like oh you're so bad at
spelling I'll have to throw you out the
window but that was not very funny from
my perspective um I kind of had similar
experience
I mean spelling is basically a lost
cause with me and math facts are just no
don't even try but um I really didn't I
don't remember really hating school that
much when I was younger or even when I I
mean I just really didn't like the
people at my school because I was really
weird I mean we kind of already knew
that there was something not quite right
like there was like I was like I
couldn't not like hit people and stuff
so there was something wrong but we
didn't know exactly what it was
but I don't know why I did just didn't I
mean I just was happy aminos and I
wasn't I I didn't feel like I had a
terribly negative experience but yes the
just what I want to stay on the sort of
the social emotional thing because a lot
of kids say we'll say that if you're not
feeling well that saves sort of socially
emotionally in school that it's really
hard to learn and your friends and the
the social group around will give you
that confidence of being able to to work
through some of the more challenges in
the school but tell us a little bit
about how your friends perceive that
especially if they weren't as accepting
or didn't quite understand what you were
going through could you tell us just to
maybe some time in your educational life
maybe in the classroom or right out of
the classroom where where kids maybe
we're less than kind and what did that
look like well I don't really have a
specific I guess anecdote about a friend
but I do really know that the social
circle and how they perceive you as some
learning difference is really important
because in middle school it was kind of
like if you didn't finish everything
kind of right on the dot that you were
not as good and so I had that kind of
thing going on but with me but then when
I was in high school in my first year I
think started to change a little bit
because people my school were really
accepting learning differences actually
a third of them have learning
differences and they all would just say
it kind of it wasn't a big deal no one
likes there that you in fact in my first
year at my high school I was working
with two friends on math and they were
saying if they were dyslexic and I was
kind of surprised that they would just
say that right away because I didn't
even know them that well and I wanted to
say it too but I kind of still had this
thing about oh maybe I shouldn't reveal
it because it shows something that's not
so great
but I realized that over time just
saying it is really empowering just like
you know if it like I want to say that I
have a learning different to someone
then I then
want to say it and it feels great and I
know that other people will feel more
comfortable when they hear someone else
say it so it just kind of builds this
community of people that really are
accepting that they're proud of it and
it's really contagious so I remember
probably the time I was probably the
most criticized for my learning
disabilities was coming first grade
although I don't really remember as I
was probably most definitely really
thought and it's just the really weird
kid because in first grade my teacher
didn't know how to teach me at all she
would hurt her solution for not having
to worry about me was putting me in the
back of the room with a box of Legos and
everyone else would be doing the class
activity and I couldn't do that so she
thought okay I'm just gonna put Frankie
in the back of the room and happy but
I'm by myself in my own world and I
thought was great
because I was playing with LEGOs what
kid wouldn't want to play with Legos in
school and then in second grade I went
to a school called Charles Armstrong and
that's school for kids with learning
disabilities in Belmont just north of
here and so every kid was dyslexic so I
was in every kid almost every kid was
the same so during that time I wasn't
really everything that about dyslexia
was normal so there wasn't really
anything about that that was weird um
then I got into high school and that was
the first time I actually went back into
the public school system um so I was
very nervous about that and after I
joined safe I started realizing that
advocate advocating for myself and being
open is very important so I'm very open
about my learning disabilities when it
comes to school and I'll tell that
person okay I have this learning
difference it's gonna take me longer in
order to do this so you may need to help
me and you may need to be patient
because I'm not gonna do it as fast as
you and I'll tell that person that and
sometimes and a lot of my friends are
very helpful they'll help me they'll sit
down with me
they'll be patient so on and 30% of my
high school
as a learning difference so um I haven't
I'm the people on my score very
supportive so I talked about my grammar
school being like they didn't really no
one really knew anything about learning
disabilities so that kind of hurt me in
a way because I didn't really know
anyone that had learned disabilities I
thought it was just me so I would kind
of honestly I would use that as excuse
for not being able to do my work or say
like I can't succeed I'm just going to
blame it on learning disabilities so
it's basically not until high school
when I realized that like when I was put
in a group it's called the resource
specialist program they're like a
hundred people in that group so it made
me realize that I'm not the only one
that has these difficulties some people
have a lot like hard difficulties and
they're still getting through it so I
can't do and then with this safe it
really taught me how to be an
independent like not really be scared of
like that I do have one in disabilities
being able to talk about him with people
yeah let's see well I was lucky enough
when I was diagnosed that one of my
close friends at the time was also
dyslexic and so her and I and a few
other girls in the class but just bring
computers everywhere and like have
really obvious accommodations and it
wasn't really an issue but that was at a
very small private school and then I
went to a sixteen hundred kid public
school for high school and I just
remember my first day of English class I
was sitting there and the teacher wants
to strike a paragraph so I whip out my
computer I'd been doing that for like
three years or so and a girl was just a
quick what are you doing why do you have
a computer that doesn't make any sense
and I told her I was dyslexic and in the
middle of class she stands up go to the
front of the room and writes I forget
what the word is but write something
backwards and asks me to read it and
I was a little taken him taken by
surprise and told her that you know no
one with dyslexia reads backwards and
that that was a myth and she just kind
of shrugged and she's like oh that's
really weird like a nice diagnose I
didn't really have much good problem
with it first cuz you know my sister had
it and everything but I feel like nobody
came up to me and said things like oh so
you read backwards and like oh you're
stupid do an LD it was just kind of a
little bit like the little side plants
that you get like a nap when you go up
to the board and you do the problem
wrong because you say like two plus
three is six or something like they just
kind of look at you like what are you
doing and so they don't exactly say it
out loud just like the little sideways
glances occasionally that can be a
little bit stressful but over well over
the over time I've got like really
comfortable with it and never tell
anybody who listen like oh I just likes
you do you want to know what it is I go
to this thing called safe it's so
awesome you should check it out and then
since that was at the small 45 cave
class school and now I go to a giant
public school with almost 500 kids in my
grade and I remember it was like Friday
I think my friend comes in what are you
doing over the weekend I'm like oh well
I'm going to the Chad conference
what's that only it's this a TD
conference what's a DD I'm like it's for
kids abilities what's in LD and I tried
to explain it and she just kind of looks
at me like oh I love mentally disabled
people like she literally says that's
really just kind of look at her too much
that could be like what are you talking
about well so well I've never really got
made fun of specifically because of my
learning disabilities I just got made
fun of because I was weird and yeah
but I mean I kind of feel like it's not
really about other people being mean to
you it's more about kind of you being
mean to yourself sometimes as you think
like oh well I mean it doesn't really
make any sense if you can't I mean
I can't do this thing and I mean I'm
never gonna get fixed and I feel like I
didn't have that as much as a lot of
people but I do feel like it's a problem
for pretty much anybody who has an LD
because knowing that the world is
structured it's kind of you know you
can't you just you still have to like
work to fit in and to have the system
work for you and that's hard this is
really pretty challenging just to have
you know to go through what kids go
through just on a daily basis but also
to have the the extra stress sometimes
of knowing that you learn differently
than at least 60% of the kids in the
room if stiff statistics hold true and
maybe even more you were all playing
with stuff I see people noticed that you
all have little gadgets in your hand or
little things in your hand many of you
tell me a little bit more about you know
things that help you tell me a little
bit about your accommodations and any
sort of assistive technologies that you
use
okay so I mainly use audio books to read
I I think I'm pretty much like the
audiobook Queen at my school because I
every time I have a new novel I always
order the audiobook or get it in the
library and that just I started doing
that only last year and I don't really
know why I didn't do that before because
it's honestly the best thing like to
compare the people it's almost like
watching a movie without the pictures so
it's really cool
it helps me cuz I have a visual and
auditory processing learning different
so if I can read something and hear it
at the same time that helps me a lot
the other thing is that I use my
computer a lot of the time I I do like
paper and pencil I guess I'm kind of
old-fashioned but I I usually I usually
use the computer most of the time unless
it's just kind of a free write because
it helps me work a lot faster and it
just makes writing more enjoyable so I
just want to say that I love
accommodations greatest thing in the
world my accommodations mostly for
school like math um I have in my math
class there's a person called a learning
specialist and that in my classroom
really cool guy and what he does is he
sits in the back of the room and while
the class is taking knows he'll take the
notes as well and then he'll take them
copy them and you'll give them to people
who need it and I'm one of those people
that give those notes so that really
helps me because I sometimes I can't
read my own handwriting and with I also
have auditory processing disabilities so
in my auditory memory is in the second
percentile so I only taken two percent
of what I hear like it let's say in a
lecture so that's barely anything so
what I have to do is I have to look back
on the notes in order to understand what
I'm doing for homework because I can't
process it just from a lecture
I'm allowed to use a computer let's when
we're when I'm doing like a timed essay
although I'm not a very good typer I
have time and a half so I have time so
let's say add an hour to do a test but
then I'll have an extra thirty minutes
because I need that at your time because
I work a lot slower than an average
student I do use audio books I actually
just started this year as well and it
really helps it's a lot better than
myself just reads me because if
someone's reading it like let's say in
an audio book like an actor's arena I
get the picture so much better and I
enjoyed the book so much that so much
more also at home I use a program called
Dragons naturally speaking and that is a
you have a headphone and you have a
computer and you talk into the headphone
and it types out for you I can do that
whole entire essay just like that and I
can pace back and forth and it's not
very accurate so I it's it's not the
best that accuracy but so I can go back
and fix it but that definitely helps
when I'm doing an essay at home so my
main accommodation is I get a hundred
percent extend timing
I have processing issues so let's say
the class gets like 30 minutes I'll get
like almost an hour so yeah that really
helps because although it kind of is a
little bit of a problem because like
you're just kind of in there taking a
test with no one else in there even
though it's kind of cool it just takes a
lot of brain power to be able to focus
that long another thing that I get is I
get a type everything I'm not really
sure how it goes to my learning
disability I think it flashes because my
handwriting and then the last
accommodation I get is I have teacher I
have like one-on-one testing which is
where when I'm taking a test a teacher
will read the questions for me because a
lot of time when I read the question
I'll have to read like ten times before
I even get like the
gist of what the questions asking so
yeah having to teach it by carrying it
out loud really helps me well I think
that number one accommodation you can
have is self-advocacy and that's a giant
topic that we stressed it's safe
basically just being able to understand
your disability and tell your teachers
about it and know what you need and be
able to express that I know for me every
year I send an email to my teacher or
first-first I go to my teacher and I
talked to them and I introduce myself
and let them know about my dyslexia and
how it affects me and the accommodations
I have and then I'll follow up with that
and send an email just so you know they
know to kind of reinforce it a little
friendly reminder and then as far as
like assistive technology goes I use a
computer program called inspiration and
it's a way of creating an outline but
it's very visual instead of Roman
numerals and numbers it's like little
bubbles and pictures and you make little
webs and like I said you can put
pictures or different text boxes and
titles and colors and then if you need
to turn in the outline it actually turns
it into a formal outline for you with
you just click a button and that's I
cannot write essays without it and then
I also in my legal accommodations list I
have gum and the use of a fidget toy
because I don't actually have a DD but I
really do need to be doing something to
focus something like little like moving
my hand or playing with a pen and then
as far as audiobooks goes there's a
organization called are fe and D which
is reading for the blind and dyslexic
and if you have a formal diagnosed
disability they will give you providing
with free audiobooks for almost any bug
I like Annie have a legal documentation
of using gum and fidget toys I actually
just have buckets and buckets of them in
my room I go to the dollar store and buy
out everything they have like these and
silly putty and I'll buy my gum and bulk
at Costco so I always have it I also
have time and a half because although a
lot of these times I can finish tests
faster than the majority of my
classmates because my mind moves so fast
but also because it moves so fast I skip
things I leave out like lots of
different symbols so I need the extra
time to just go over my work so I can
check over my tests especially with math
I have to go over it and check every
problem redo it about three times and
use my little check mark system operator
I also just like Danny said I advocate a
lot I have to go talk to my teachers
very frequently I can use my computer
sometimes most like I also use
inspiration and things like that and I
also have preferential seating which
means I can talk to my teacher and say
hey you assign me to a seat in the back
corner but I can't see the board so I
will get moved up to the front so that I
can pay attention and so that I can
listen and learn I've no I should have
thought this through um well I I get
time and a half like pretty much
everybody else and I get a laptop
accommodation which is really not
unusual for my school because they give
us computers so almost 100% of
everything is done on the computer
unless your teacher is really weird and
makes you write out essays in which case
you're like I have an accommodation yes
so that's nice once in a while but I
think the what I think really helps me
most is visual stuff so that includes
like when we watch movies I you I don't
have like an accommodation for this so
I'll just asked out of curiosity and
I'll ask can we have the captions on
because that's one reason why I love
watching foreign movies in
because they always have the captions on
them I love captions so much you guys oh
my god oh by the way Google you really
need to improve your like the caption
things just anyway I mean because that
just really helps me absorb what it is
they're talking about because otherwise
thank you know you've got everybody here
and I am already forgotten what I wanted
to reply to something that Sean said but
I've totally forgotten what he said and
if maybe if I had had captions I would
remember but no sadly real time thank
you a couple of just sort of points of
clarification our FB and D which is
recording for the blind and dyslexic is
now called learning ally and it is it's
been around for a long time reporting
recordings for the blind and their you
know their their whole business plan is
they're just all of these volunteers and
they're recording just about every book
that's imaginable if you don't and if
it's not out there like a text book or
even a novel they'll put it on for you
which has been great and they've been a
really great friend of a pen of the
parent education at work
and I wanted to go back to something
that you guys talked about which was the
whole idea of self-advocacy
you know cuz this is a forum this panel
is a form of self-advocacy right they
influence teachers sometimes they will
influence even their their peers and now
being here at at Google in front of this
group of sort of sort of maybe a mixed
audience maybe some parents who are
interested or maybe you have a child or
who's dyslexic or a DD ADHD
you know perhaps perhaps you're thinking
about policy in the future I want to
know when you have advocated and it's
not worked you know you've gone up and
you know you in perhaps it was a little
bit earlier on and you're you know
you're your own sort of self conception
as being some
with a learning disability and a lot of
you talked about yeah and Annie talked
about legal accommodations so you know
this there if there is an evaluation
cycle a devaluation or sometimes even
input from a medical doctor this is the
law of the land with a DA the American
Americans with Disabilities Act but tell
me about a time when you have advocated
for yourself and it hasn't worked and
what what what did you do next I don't
really have a situation where it didn't
work but I do have a situation where it
was a little bit tricky at least in the
beginning because I had this teacher a
new teacher and when we were doing a
timed essay in class she said that I and
this other student didn't who has a
learning difference that she said we
didn't need the extended time and that
would finish and so I guess me and the
other student immediately leaped up from
our chairs and like told her that we
need our extended time and I mean to put
it bluntly it's not really the teachers
opinion because it says and our learning
plan that we need this and I and then
she let us have it so I was happy um I
haven't again have I had a really time
where that hasn't really worked but I do
have a 504 which is basically an IEP in
that sense for individual individualized
education plan I believe and um so I
it's a legal document that I have a
legal document saying that I need these
accommodations so there has been times
when I have walked up to teachers like
my Spanish teacher and I've told her I
need this and she says why and I said I
have this learning disability and a
learning difference and I need this
accommodation or the same CV should be
like it's fine you'll do fine it's like
well I have a 504 saying I need this and
she said you know it's fine Frankie
you're gonna do fine um
there has been times when I'm just like
screw it I'm just gonna stay in the
classroom and I've done a fine but so
sometimes I don't even bother going to
her and asking her I have had I have had
problems with my science teacher on
freshmen in this year on about
accommodations you know cuz he's just
yeah she's just not a very nice guy he's
not the best guy he's very intimidating
to go up to and saying I need this
uh-huh so but other than that nothing
really bad about for my accommodations
so the only time the accommodations
hasn't worked for me was when like I we
have like an RSP room which is where
like all the learnings Billy kids can go
to take tests do a homework study to
kind of get away from like like if they
need accommodations done the only time
if that hasn't worked was when a teacher
like thought that I didn't really need
to go because the test was only only
like it was a really short test but
still I would I would have liked to have
a one-on-one testing about because that
would really help but so what ended up
happening was I took the test in the
classroom but then I've learned that
teachers are like a lot more
accommodating when you go to them after
school so I let them know that this is
what I need to be able to succeed and
they ended up being fine with that let's
see the first time I self advocated was
in the end of 6th grade and I I had
never talked to teachers in my life and
I thought it was the scariest thing in
the world and I went up to my science
teacher and we had a poster assignment
where we had to draw pictures and
handwrite things my topic was a
jellyfish and one of my main
accomodations is the use of a computer
because my handwriting is just horrible
and I can't spell to save my life and I
mean it does
that doesn't show how smart I am so I
explained to my teacher that I had just
been diagnosed like two weeks ago and
that those were my accommodations and
she was she was almost acting like I was
trying to get out of the assignment or
make it easier or trying to cheat and
she didn't give me the accommodations I
got a D on my assignment and I just
cried for days like it was horrible and
I ended up having to have my mom get
involved and she talked to the principal
and we eventually worked it out but it
was it was horrible because it's not
fair and so now I whatever I
self-advocate I usually keep my
accommodations list like the little kind
of summary of my psych ed report in my
backpack just in case anything comes up
because like brendan was saying
learning disabilities are qualified
under the Americans with Disability Act
the Americans with Disability Act and so
it's like the same thing as giving a
wheelchair to someone who can't walk or
giving glasses to someone who can't see
it's just more of an invisible
disability so it tends to be overlooked
one of the main times that my
accommodations haven't worked for me is
this year because I moved from this
really small 45 student class teachers
knew me they knew my accommodations by
heart they knew everything I needed to
succeed to this huge school and so the
first day of class I went down to all of
my teachers and I explained my
accommodations and my LDS and what I
needed from them and they're all really
accommodating they all said it was fine
like anything that they would help me
out no just oh this is gonna be great I
don't know what everyone was talking
about this school like all the teachers
were awesome and then we had this math
test because like basically what I
assumed was that my teacher it doesn't
matter that she has seven periods of 30
students she can remember something that
I told her once so we had this math test
where we had a substitute teacher
and because I'd only reminded her once
and I wasn't fully advocating wasn't
reminding her it didn't let her know the
day before the test she didn't put me on
the list for people with extended time
she remembered my calculator which was
good but not the extended time part so
although I was able to finish my test my
stuff wouldn't give me the ten extra
minutes that I needed to finish checking
the back of my sheet and literally I
only need ten minutes like during lunch
or something and those few problems
where I wasn't able to check over where
the only points that I lost on the test
that was just a little bit annoying but
um from then I've learned that I just
need to go back and tell my teachers
really frequently every time I need
something from them I need to let him
know three most of the problems that
I've had have really come from me it's
not other people I mean some wait I'm
not saying that you guys were better
anything I'm sorry yeah I just realized
that anyway but the most recent time
that I can really remember where I
haven't been given a an accommodation
has been in Mandarin and I really like
Mandarin a lot but there is the most
stupid assignment that exists that we do
every single week and it's copied down
all these characters in boxes and I hate
it so much and then actually to like
talk about it in class and you know but
you know that doesn't help cuz
everybody's like oh yeah but anyway um
so it's I mean and I did I talked to my
teacher and he I don't know he'd I guess
he just I'm not sure why he didn't give
me the accommodation but I mean you know
what can you do sometimes but I did find
a way to actually help which is to
pretend to play Tetris with the boxes so
that helped a lot
I'm gonna ask two more questions and
then we're gonna open up for questions
for other folks just so I know that
you've been sitting very very patiently
you know one of the sort of stock
questions that we have is like who you
know who's encouraged you and usually 80
to 90 percent of the people would say
their parents and more to the point
usually it's a mom oftentimes or whoever
is the custodial parent at home so this
is actually advice for parents you know
advice for parents who are really
beginning to go through this whole idea
of you know I think my kid may have a
learning disability or I know my kid has
a learning disability what what advice
would you give them
well advice that I would give to parents
who have kids with all DS is I know this
sounds kind of typical or cliche but to
give them some space because I know miss
has been really great for me when my
parents give me space when up til and I
was in seventh grade my parents help me
with homework and they are the most
impatient people it was horrible to get
help from them on horn like it was bad
for me and it was bad for them and so to
make a long story short when I was in
seventh grade they stopped helping me
with homework and that's when I started
to rely on my teachers for help and I've
always had really great teachers I I
always ask them my questions right then
and there even when I feel
self-conscious because I know that when
I'm cold I'm on my own
there's no I'm not asking my parents for
help so I need to know how to do the
work before I get home and the other
thing is just to have faith in your kids
because I I know that kind of like when
if you really do then it really shows
and your kids will like really trust in
themselves that's really the most
important thing is to trust in yourself
and be confident
my advice for parents is really get to
know your your child and what
what with their differences and what
they're dealing with because it's
important to understand what what
they're what they need and what they are
going through and it's it's important to
know that because then you're not going
to be able to help your child and that's
is always one thing my mom is always
done is she knows what I have she knows
what I need she knows what I struggle
with
she knows what my difficulties are she
knows what my strengths are and without
that she wouldn't she want she's not
gonna if she won't be able to help me
and like tell a teacher or even maybe
tell a tutor who I've recently gone that
this is what he needs he needs this
she's not gonna be able to understand
this unless you do this this this so
also just you know when they are having
trouble especially when a child is
recently being diagnosed and they're at
an older age it can be one of the
hardest things to go through so just
being there for your child saying that
we're gonna figure this out we're gonna
get accommodations we're gonna get
everything figured out with the school
that also really helps so one thing my
mom especially tells me when I don't
really do well on papers or tests is
like okay like you didn't do too well
but how are you gonna make it better
like what are you gonna do to make the
difference and that kind of helps
because she's not like she like to me it
like encouraged me that like she has
supported me that I can succeed and I
can't do it on my own like I just think
that that's great that like I know that
she has my back
I definitely agree with what everyone
said just about generally being
supportive like the process of from
before you were diagnosed so when you
were diagnosed - after - even past when
you've accepted it it's all pretty
challenging in kind of different ways
and just you know understanding how
frustrating it can be and just generally
being there but also trying to stress
the positives because old learning
disabilities often it's only the
negatives that are focused on but I mean
I know we've had panel questions before
that are like what strengths accompany
your learning disabilities and everyone
has like two three four strengths that
directly correlate to their disability
and that's not you know really talked
about and you can really use those
strengths to help compensate for your
struggles what's your strength that was
gonna be my last question by the way but
but that's okay
yeah it's spoiler alert but we just a
process check I know a lot of people
probably have to begin to make a move at
1 or shortly after but tell me what your
strength is oh let's see
well despite the fact that writing takes
me like hours like four or five hours
tried an essay I'm a really really solid
writer when I have the amount of time
and I also because my brain kind of
approaches things from a different
direction I'm really good at
standardized tests and math and I
actually kind of really do enjoy math
standardized tests and tend to do really
well on them yeah great thank you well
going back to the what parents can do I
really didn't I really agree with what
everybody else is saying and also I was
really lucky down the mom who never did
this but don't think that your child is
stupid like even if they're having
trouble in one of their subjects if
they're having trouble in school just
know that they're not stupid know that
they're not lazy just know they're
having some trouble just like when
somebody has glasses people know the
zoom oh they have glasses they can't see
their they must not be good at like
school they must be stupid just like if
you have an
or something it doesn't mean you're
stupid and lazy it just means you they
might need help number one don't kill
your kids I would and second of all I
would say make them go to all of this
stuff themselves because I can't I'm
sure that my mom can tell you that it's
really it's really up to the kid in the
end what they do and you know if I don't
feel like taking my meds today because I
don't understand what they do and
because my mom just you know least at me
down and lectured me I'm sure she went
to this thing you know I'm probably not
gonna do it it's not like I don't do it
though just saying but you know I it's
important that they learn about it
themselves cuz eventually they're gonna
like leave and then they won't know what
is going on so make them go too safe
great just real quickly there there's
the the idea Sally and miniature woods
who are really great friends at Penn
really talk about overcoming dyslexia
but these guys they're they don't really
need to overcome anything
right they have defined very focused
strengths that that make them who they
are and make them the kind of learners
and kind of people they are Annie
certainly certainly has taken a crack at
answering this but some of the rest of
you could you just talk about your
strengths you know just shout it out
what are you good at I'm really good at
reading and writing which I used to
think that I was actually bad at reading
writing because I always took a long
time to do it but actually I I was
taking this literature class of my
school and I I was taking a long time to
do it but I was because I take a long
time to read things and I have to read
things multiple times but I actually get
a lot of detail and I get a lot of like
the nuances and the symbolism and I that
when we were discussing the book in
class that I was actually really
understanding it really well and then I
was enjoying it and that it was just I
realized it was one of my strengths and
so that's when I started to see
proud of my learning difference um some
before maybe I was even a toddler from
before I was diagnosed acting acting has
always been one of my strengths I love
getting up on stage even just like
public speaking like what we're doing
right now I'm through safe I figured out
that I'm actually really good at public
speaking getting in front of crowds and
speaking in my mind is something I'm
really good at playing a character on
stage I've always loved doing that um
when I was in middle school I discovered
I'm really good at creative writing
I suck at persuasive essays suck at it
and I and I hate doing them so and what
I do sometimes even you know I'll do my
own creative writing you know I write
things myself
I do short stories I new scripts so
whenever I have free time
I'll do that yeah I think that's pretty
much my biggest strengths so my biggest
strength is basically not giving up I
mean like I've been at like the bottom
up I've failed many times but I've
always been able to get out of it so
yeah because of my learning disabilities
I've been able to kind of endure like
the worst and being able to bring it up
things like perseverance and being able
to talk in public and like advocate for
myself and be able to tell people what I
need and how they can help me get there
I had something oh yeah also because of
like a TDR ADHD being very fidgety and
kind of hyperactive that helps me out
and when I play sports and also and I'm
like working with younger kids I work at
a circus camp at Manny Ivan summer and
because my ADV in addition to just
overall excitedness
I'm able to keep up with them and just
kind of keep going and like really
excited about everything I kind of have
like this was sort of relating to what
Frankie was saying is that I'm really
good
thing but it's mostly because I'm really
good at understanding what other people
are feeling like I kind of take the time
to really think through what other
people are what other characters are
kind of why they're doing the things
that they're doing and I think that's a
really big strength that I have to so
that's yeah any other questions question
two the question was to tomorrow and
it's about you said about talking about
the your parents giving you room but
what's what's behind that well I've
never answered that question before
so I'll just do my best I've never
consciously thought about it but I feel
like I
I really appreciate when my parents
understand my learning difference
because I think that sometimes it's kind
of hard to understand and so when they
do I feel really happy because sometimes
when I they ask me a question and you
know how people when you ask them a
question they kind of expect an
automatic answer but I don't not really
good at that and so my mom and my dad
understand that I just need a little
longer to think about it and it's not
that I'm ignoring them so I think it's a
combination of kind of supporting them
because I know that I can talk to my mom
whenever I need to and also I guess
combination of that and giving me room
so I guess it's kind of nice that I can
always go to them and they'll check on
that check on me once in a while yes
that's the question was the turning
point in your lives when when you
decided to either go in one direction or
not right so when you decided that
you're either going to bomb out or you
were gonna really tackle this head-on
it's a fee and I want to start off with
this well I probably say that it was the
fact that I really really like learning
and if you really like learning and you
really like what like even if you're not
gonna rain
but let's say that you really like what
books have to say if you're really if
that's what really makes you happy then
you'll be willing to go through a lot of
stuff I mean I get people iliyan a you
you know you've always got books books
are your friends because books are
awesome even if they don't have words
they can have pictures pictures are nice
but yeah I mean overall I would say like
it's hard I mean to raise a kid to you
know be motivated even if they don't
have a learning disability how do you
even do that
so I think I wanted the main turning
point for me when I stopped going out I
don't really care I'm horrible at it
anyway why I didn't try was probably
when they stopped testing us on math
facts for speed and I remember in 4th
grade bad minutes 30 multiplication
facts in 1 minute I think I accomplished
3 over the course of the year when my
classmates they got to like the 60
division facts and I yeah so once they
stopped testing us first testing us on
spelling just like tests of them and
also when they felt like just basically
the memorization and more to the
thinking about it and like Fiona I
really enjoy learning I really want to
learn but so I think once they stopped
doing it for facts and a little bit fun
what learning turns into more concepts
ideas and what your opinion is that was
my turning point basically I mean it
wasn't like just a moment or anything
but it's kind of the process of going
from like having all these struggles and
realizing that there is a reason and
then understanding what that label means
and then like like when I was diagnosed
with dyslexia I eventually read through
my second report my mom became really
educated and was able to really help me
like learn what it is and once you do
know what your label means you're able
to figure out kind of like
accommodations and strategies and
strings and then once once you have
those strengths and strategies the plane
feels kind of leveled and everything
just doesn't seem so impossible anymore
and it it's just not as intimidating and
a lot easier to toggle so the turning
point for me was probably when I
graduated from eighth grade because I
decided that I can be whoever I wanted
to be I wasn't constricted to like oh he
can't learn
Leszek I gave up on him so it's
basically that that when I basically
said okay I'm gonna I'm gonna be this
straight you're not gonna be a smart
student there and also another moment
that kept me on that track was when my
learned disability teacher or mentor or
whatever you would I call him he has a
sign that's hanging up in his room it's
no excuses so he wouldn't let me use
like my learned disabilities as an
excuse for not succeeding my turning
point was probably when I joined safe
voices just you know cuz when where I
went to Squatch on drunk I went to that
school for seven years and from second
to eighth grade and like I was saying
well like I said earlier you know being
different was normal you know so it
wasn't I didn't really think about it
until I got into high school and I
joined safe and after going to a few
safe voices means I really realized okay
this this is the I'm gonna I'm just
gonna keep on fighting for it I'm gonna
keep on going and going until you know I
reach my goal and you know every time
every year I'm getting closer and closer
to my goal I'm figuring out what I want
to do with myself
after in college you know what what my
interests are what I'm good at when I'm
bad at so I think I kind of have one
specific moment which doesn't sound like
a big deal when I'm saying aloud but it
was pretty big deal for me I was reading
this novel by Toni Morrison for the
first time and it was in the beginning I
was like oh man this is so hard you know
like all the symbols I don't get it and
then we had discussions every day and
one day I just said this one comment
that I didn't even know that I knew but
I just said it it was kind of like an
instinct I don't know like the words
just like crawled up my throat and like
burst out basically and I was like wow I
don't even know I could do that and from
then I started to really realize that
I'm good at these analyzing things and
kind of character analysis so yeah and I
just have to say we have to stop right
there I'm gonna turn it back over to
Debbie but the corollary to
Shaun's you know in this RSP room which
is no excuses should be for parents
certainly for schools for people like me
and in administrators and certainly for
teachers which is don't give up you know
to see every student that you have every
child that you have in front of you can
learn and would really like to learn no
matter what they're giving off sometimes
but it's not giving up on an individual
with excuse individual student it's not
so much about that kids not having
excuses which is great but and it's not
really about overcoming either I think
it's about that nexus between when when
two people sit down well there's a
teacher and a student and says okay
let's begin and it sounds like these
guys have done a great job so if you
give them a round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
