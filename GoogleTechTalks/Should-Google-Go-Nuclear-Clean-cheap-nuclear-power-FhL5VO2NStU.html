pleasure to bring dr. Robert boussard
here to give a talk on alternative
fusion energy
dr. boussard has a PhD from Princeton
he's currently functioning as co-founder
and director of energy matter conversion
company
he's a former assistant director to the
US Atomic Energy Commission and has held
prominent positions at Los Alamos
National Labs Oak Ridge labs and TRW
systems among some other places so he's
here to talk about his uh his ideas and
some of the results that they've
recently been able to make public so uh
also this talk is going to be posted to
Google video so please refrain from
asking any confidential questions during
the Q&amp;amp;A session
please welcome dr. Broussard thank you
Michael I'm very pleased to be here and
see all of you interested in something
that if it works would really help us a
lot on this planet the as I was telling
no garlic earlier I started out in the
engineering R&amp;amp;D business 57 years ago in
the spaceflight we have Mira and rockets
in space where the thing that movie and
that's what caused me to get into
frontier technology developments which
led me down this long trail to this
fusion program what I'm going to tell
you about today is listed on this slide
that you've Cheerilee already I know I
want to talk about what is nuclear
fusion how is it different from fission
and war waters that go on what are its
problems and what we did in our small
company we actually named an energy
matter conversion corporation because we
like the fact that I'm signed and
invented it and it's e mc-squared and we
have a registered trademark what we
learned what we learn from our work and
the general conclusions and then at the
last why are we doing is what is it good
for it's not just scientific
entertainment and it's not trying to
we're not doing it to make money we're
doing it for a particular goal which
will turn out to make a lot of money and
how to get there what the next steps
have to be the end of the trail
Thanks ah we have to turn it I'm making
an assumption which is maybe wrong that
that a lot of you are not familiar with
the details of fission and fusion energy
because you're in the IT business but
that may be wrong and I apologize to
those of you who this is boring but
fusion fusion is in fact the energy that
powers everything in the universe it's
the energy that makes solar energy every
photon that falls on the ground comes
down from the Sun from the fusion
reactor fission is when heavy atoms that
are basically nearly unstable split into
two radioactive atoms and fusion is when
two light atoms merge into something in
it splits fission has the property that
every fission process makes a
radioactive isotope that is very
hazardous and dangerous and it gives a
Three Mile Island in Chernobyl and
decaying radioactive folks we can't
control energy is released when the
light nuclei refused because the fusion
the intermediate product does become a
fission product but it fission is
generally into other light atoms that
are not radioactive
the ultimate fuels are fusing hydrogen
nuclei together and that's what runs the
Sun other common elements light elements
can do that and they include lithium
boron and helium isotopes some of the
reactions are radiation free and others
are not I just want to show you the
energy levels we all know about
chemistry fire hydrogen and oxygen
burning makes h2o and it gives you about
ten units of energy measured in electron
volts if you take deuterium and tritium
the two heaviest isotopes of hydrogen
and cause them to make a helium four in
a neutron you get seventeen point six
million units of energy that's why
fusion energy is so exciting it gives us
remarkable bombs and other exciting
things fission on the left there are
three stages if you have a heavy
unstable nearly unstable nucleus and add
a neutron to it it will start that
nucleus oscillating the energy of
binding energy of the neutron will cause
the nucleus
oscillate and eventually it will break
up break into two parts and get more
neutrons than it occurred at the
beginning and one of these neutrons
built around it can start the chain
again that's the fission chain reaction
giving you two radioactive isotopes and
that of course is what gives us
hiroshima and nagasaki and all the
excitement of the world the fusion is a
different thing this is the deuterium
tritium reaction giving you the helium
for the neutron the others are similar
the one we're most interested in is this
one because it's very odd it's a moron
11 which has a charge of 5 in the
nucleus and a proton a hydrogen nucleus
you add the two together the binding
energy makes an excited state carbon 12
carbon 12 is one of the most stable
nuclei in the universe but when it's
excited by the binding energy of the of
the fusion process its unstable when it
decays to a beryllium age in helium for
the brilliant mate very shortly ten to
the minus thirteen seconds later decays
into two more helium four so this
process is unique it's the only nuclear
energy releasing process in the whole
world that releases fusion energy at
three helium atoms and no neutrons no
radiation its radiation free which means
if you build a machine that runs on that
and you turn it off you can go sit on it
there can be no Three Mile Island sand
not sure know it's difficult to do but
these are the favorite isotopes to you
as protons neutrons and trichomes and as
I mentioned this gives us there's nearly
20 million units of energy the intrinsic
energy gained from DT which is what the
world is chasing is about two thousand
to one but of course the means that the
world
Polly won't work that way the neutron
free reaction here gives us 8.7 million
units of energy and we can reburn the
helium-3 deuterons when they fuse split
into two channels at right on which is
radioactive and the hydrogen nucleus and
a helium-3 and a neutron that helium-3
can be cycled back to the exhaust system
you have to have on the system the
reborn' with another do
on to make more energy so you get about
ten point two million units of energy
the D plus T gives you this ridiculous
result where most of the energy is
carried by a 14 MeV Neutron and the
reason people look at D plus T and I
apologize for this graph but this is a
cross section a cross section is a
measure of the probability of a fusion
reaction happening when you try to bring
two particles of similar charge together
as a function of the energy of the
particles the hair you make the energy
the easier it is for the particles to
overcome the Coulomb repulsion between
the two charges and the closer you get
them you have to get them within about
1.3 of Fermi's of the distance before
the nuclear forces will grab them and
make fusion and D plus T has a
probability curve like this goes way up
here but an energy of about 40 kilovolts
the pb11 system unfortunately in this
particular target frame Peaks it around
560 kilovolts very much higher very much
harder to do and impossible to do in any
system that has a maxwellian
distribution of particles where all the
particles are mixed and they're all in
thermodynamic equilibrium because most
of the particles that make fusion are
not at that energy that's the tail of
the maxwellian distribution and most of
the particles of a maxwellian system are
much lower energy incapable of making
fusion but very capable of making what's
called bremsstrahlung radiation from
electrons and didn't oscillating around
ions in the system the original physics
the physicist and the original program
back in the middle 1950s remembered
their high school physics very well and
they said how are we going to contain
neutral plasmas in thermodynamic
equilibrium and they remembered the
right-hand rule you know if you have a
current flowing this way the charged
particle going this way the force on the
particle is right angles to those two
the force in a magnetic field is not the
restoring force it doesn't restore the
particle from the direction it's going
it's always at right angle
right hand rule so they said you can't
contain particles without a few because
I'll run straight into the walls so
we'll put a magnetic field together and
all the particles will gyrate on them
and this is going to trap them so all
manner of configurations were devised to
trap them with magnetic coils that tried
to bottle up the ends where the particle
would all go out and so little magnets
and cos magnets and reflection and
mirror magnets at the Connery's cos this
is what Livermore spent two billion
dollars on it's an impossible system
because it has a point cost North Pole
South Pole and South Pole is an equator
and the losses out these equatorial line
cusp kill you and so that the physicists
of which I was one that said let's close
up close up the solenoid and make it
close so the magnetic fields never in
another particle to stay here and
circulate around and round
but there's a physics reason why you
can't just do that you have to have a
polite alternative circumferential true
so they invented the tokamak lebretia
from the Soviet Union invented it I
often thought he invented it and gave it
to us to make sure we never got there
that's all we have now and the tokamak
let me explain something that's the
inner tokamak 30 meters across the river
can put 10 feet tall that's a normal PWR
this is about the size of the machines
we hope to build and the reason that
these machines these mix magnetic
confinement machines which don't
confined in in local thermodynamic
equilibrium are so big is very simple
it's that picture I showed you of the
magnetic field and it's gonna - all the
particles gyrate and they stay there
very happily so long as they never
collide with each other the moment two
of them collide the guiding Center for
that collision jumps
- gyro radio so every collision causes
those particles to jump towards the wall
it's a random walk process but it turns
out it takes more than a thousand
collision scattering collisions in DT
before you get a fusion reaction that
means you have a thousand gyro Center
jumpings to go through
well you know the probability of a
fusion reaction it's a random walk
process of the distance as the square
root of the thousands of the twice
narrow radio and that makes these
machine have dimensions across the
plasma regions that are measuring two
three four five meters you can't beat
physics the physics says it has to be
that day furthermore the DT reaction
makes this 14 MeV neutron the 14 MeV
neutron is very very energetic and it
has to be disposed of and you have to
find some way to create the tritium that
you're burning because it's not a
natural isotope so twelve-year app live
beta decay and you create it by
capturing the neutron and a blanket out
here of molten lithium the neutron is
captured in the lithium lithium six
which then makes tritium that's what we
use for the bomb and that's for the
lithium six and you have hundreds of
tons of molten lithium sitting around
this giant plasma container and outside
that you have the superconducting
magnets that you have to have to have
the high fields and this whole thing is
an enormous ly expensive proposition
which even some of its proponents say
they don't think it might ever be
economic but it's really good science no
the problem we have seen so long was it
everything that they're doing is highly
radioactive it's expensive it's measured
in tens of billions of dollars that
projected run-out cost of iterators
twelve billion the program over the next
25 or 30 years another 30 billion the
United States has already spent 18
billion dollars chasing this tokamak
dragon and the elect initial
electrostatic stuff comes in at the
order of tens to hundreds of millions
there's no end in sight that we see in
the tokamak world giant machines and no
predictability it's all empirical one of
my friends dr. Nicholas crawl a
consultant to us probably one of the top
three theorists in the world said some
years ago he spent 15 billion dollars
studying tokamaks and what we know about
them is they're no damn good
but fusion works all you have to do is
go outside in the daytime or go outside
at night and look up there are billions
of fusion reactors every star is a
fusion reactor every single one I'm and
not one of them is toroidal and they're
all held together by a funny force
that's not a right hand rule force it's
a it's a central force field force field
arrival from the central potential it
always points to the center no matter
what the particle motion is it's always
pulling it to the center so the Sun
Stars run on fusion of hydrogen for
hydrogens together make it make a helium
atom after you have some inverse beta
decay going on and the only other force
we know that's like that that's that is
I did charge directed or mass mass
directed m1 m2 over R squared or e22
over the R squared
there's the electric force electric
field force on charged particles the
Coulomb force charged particles of
opposite sign attract from the direct
forces and charged particles that above
like sign repel so what we have to do is
find a way to take electric fields next
slide
that's all right polite electric fields
and make them accelerate the particles
you want to collide toward each other
how can you do that you can't do that
with any assurance if you just take a
plane parallel electrode and do it but
other people a long time ago so if you
can do it in a sphere you can make a
spherical electric field you could make
these particles come to a focus toward
the center for the one over R squared
convergence fusion-powered goes as the
square of the density of the particles
times the cross section times the
velocity of the particles times the
volume over which that acts N squared
Sigma V volume density in these machines
because it converges as one over R
squared goes like 1 over R squared
density squared goes like 1 over R
fourth this means if you can get a
spherical convergence going almost all
the fusion will take place in little
bitty region in the center called the
core that we were not the first to
understand that in 1924 Irving Langmuir
and Katherine Blodgett working in the
East Coast wrote a paper on currents
limited by space charge differences in
concentric flows and Spears in 1959
Elmore tuck and Watson
that was almost published the classic
paper on inertial electrostatic
confinement of a plasma and what they
talked about is putting a screen grid a
spherical grid like two sims
back-to-back inside a sphere and biasing
that sieve to a positive potential so
that electrons from out here would be
attracted through the screen would go
inside
it would make a negative potential well
because the electrons would slow down
the kinetic energy would be transformed
into potential energy of a potential
well and you could then drop ions into
it at the edge the lens would fall down
and recirculate back forth back and
forth like marbles in a well and if they
collided and didn't make a fusion they
didn't get lost like a tokamak they
would go right back up the well and give
their energy back to the well so you
could make a fusion machine that way the
only trouble with it is they had a grid
and you have to have in the case of
electrons about a hundred thousand
transits of electrons before you will
get a fusion out of the ion population
you will put in and no grid is that
transparent the best grids that Hirsch
and Farnsworth could ever build were
about 95 or 90 percent transparent and
if you have a hydrant a high
interception rate on the grid all the
energy you put into the electron
acceleration goes into the grid and the
part of energies lost in the grid melts
it doesn't work you can't get there the
food version Farnsworth Philo Farnsworth
who invented raster scan television and
Bob Hirsch who was a postdoc student
worked for grinds were 12 Wayne Indiana
in 1967 wrote a classic paper here where
they actually built a machine that
inverted the ELMO Chuck Watson potential
they had a grid
bias negatively so they accelerated the
ions directly and that way they could
get by the electron interception problem
and replace it with the problem of ion
interception because the ions had to go
through several thousand times and they
could never get a research factor bigger
than about seven to ten but this little
machine that they built which her still
has on his desk in Alexandria Virginia
actually ran at ten to the tenth
fusion's per second on DT which was a
then and now is still a world record for
such a device for that particular
machine but he did it with ions if we're
facing each other so in a way he had two
guns that were spherically focused in a
very carefully designed machine that
Farnsworth designed he was a brilliant
designer and and tested it the total
gain of the system was about ten to the
minus six
meaning the power output versus the
power in and that was because of the
grid loss problem in the pas other
secondary problems of collision lv2 the
Wolves they're two therefore two ways to
do this one we call an acceleration and
electron ion acceleration what Hirsch
Farnsworth did and there's the grid that
kills them and and this is the Elmore
Chuck Watson concept with the grid
removed well we did the invention we
made was very simple elementary when you
look at it to throw the dreads away
replace them with a magnetic field
magnetic fields do not contain neutral
plasmas worth a darn and that's the
tokamak problem but they will contain
electrons by themselves very easily
because electrons don't weigh anything
do you got Deuter on a dime 3,600 times
heavier than a an electron so it's easy
to contain electrons and magnetic fields
or there wouldn't be a variant
associates up here building high-power
tubes these point is if you do that you
have no grid collisions you replace that
problem with the problem of how fast do
electrons transport themselves across
the magnetic fields to hit the walls of
the magnets which now become the
magnetized grids and you have a system
which fundamentally you should keep open
so that there can be recirculation and
what you do is you produce the elmore
Chuck Watson negative potential well and
then you drop ions into it at the edge
the ions see that well and they
recirculate I've showed here a central
virtually no
because if you put a lot of ions in it
will push the anode up in the Centers
the ions collide these devices are
almost neutral the other departure from
neutrality required to make a hundred
kilovolts only one part of a million
when you're at a density of 10 to the
twelfth per cubic centimeter it's so so
small that we found that the current
computer codes and computers available
to us to analyze the problem with and
capable of analyzing it because of
numerical noise and the particle and
self calculations by a factor of about a
thousand dude the basic problem of this
kind of fusion this quality Spirit is to
make a quasi spherical field we can't
tolerate this mirror loss with the
equator that Livermore spent the time
and money on for other people not just
Livermore we have to have a magnetic
field that has only point cusps think
about that you put two coils together
and you make a North Pole north pole and
have an equator you had this huge loss
equator of line line cusp
there's no way around that yeah unless
the topology or the configuration is
correct there's only one configuration
that works and that's the one we
patented it's a configuration which is a
polyhedron where the coils are all on
the edges of the polyhedron and the
polyhedron has to have the property that
there are an even number of faces around
every vertex so that alternate races are
north-south north-south north-south if
you look at the queue which constitutes
the normal iconic cusp it only has three
faces are on every vertex and you have
that line cause problem and that's the
only thing we can find so and that
solution was to make a system that it's
quasi spherical there's no magnetic
monopole so you have to do it from the
surface so it's a bunch of cusps
sticking out like that and there are no
line cuffs so you have only point cuts
losses and we trap in energetic
electrons in that and form the negative
potential will and drop the ions in and
they're focused at this one over R
squared and they oscillate across the
core as I mentioned it acts like a
spherical colliding V machine and the
fuel gas input at the potential will
edge is just nothing more than putting
neutral atoms and letting the incoming
inject that electrons on ionize them at
the edge the ionization of the of the
fuel add that the neutrals gives you a
low-energy electron the low-energy iron
the ions fall into the well below energy
electrons are heated by the incoming
fast electrons very rapidly microsecond
timescales and become part of a
circulating system go ahead I just show
this really quickly
oops there we go this you've seen the
only thing I want to show you was this
maxwellian distribution problem this is
at a local thermodynamic equilibrium
maxwellian magnetic system here's the
density distribution in the Maxwell II
and most of the energy is right here
you're sitting in a room where the
temperatures what is it seventy eight or
something and all the particles are
about seventy eight the way out here
four or five times out are a lot of
particles in the room that are much
higher temperature than that you don't
feel because they're not very many and
if you're in a system that has its
potential well then we're describing all
the particles at the bottom are at one
energy if you have 100 kilovolt well and
you're dropping the nine at the bottom
they're all one hundred kilovolts
they're not spread about and the problem
is in that these mix systems the fusion
reaction cross section which goes up
with energy like that only causes these
little guys to make fusion and all the
rest of the particles are losses so what
that is to going for it is in the case
I'm sorry to do more details like this
but this is cross section versus energy
you may remember the Phoebe eleven
peaked at 560 kilovolts oh not if you
drop a z05 boron into 100 kilovolt well
at the bottom of the well it has five
hundred kilovolts because it has a
charge of five falling down the will so
I don't have to put 560 kilovolts into a
system to make that one work
the ion fusion power just two points by
doing it this way we actually decouple
the two problems the one of the big loss
problem is the electron losses to drive
the well the generation of fusion power
has almost nothing to do with that how
about how ever many ions I drop into the
system that's what makes the fusion but
I don't have a well unless I kick take
care of the electrons with the problem
is to understand how the electrons drive
power is is lost or controlled and see
how many ions we can put in to still
make fusion it turns out that we've done
studies and particle and cell codes and
movies and all kinds of interesting
computer thinks that if you have no ions
at all and you inject electrons you make
a deep well it will be very sharp at the
edge of flat metal then you start
injecting ions and the well will begin
to smooth out because the ions will go
go in if you inject more and more ions
you will finally get a well but is
basically curved and very flat at the
center but you won't have enough density
to make fusion you need to put more ions
in the net so that's at the center it's
not quite it's quasi neutral but it's
slightly high at a rich and then you
begin to develop a little central
virtual anode if you put still more ions
in with a fixed electron current the
virtually no gets higher and higher and
higher until it finally blows the will
out and the range between flatness and
blowout is about five or eight to one so
it's not a control problem in the sense
that it's micros you know millionths of
a control thing
you factors of liber8 to play with an
ion flow control the magnetic
confinement of electrons in credit is
critical to ensure that we have what's
called cosmic scaling I've told you
about point cusps point cusps other
things that people saw in mirror which
are called mirror machines I showed you
the picture with the particles came in
and mirrored and reflected the
reflection coefficient in a mirror
machine a low density machine like that
is varies as 1 over the strength of the
B field that's not good enough if you
can somehow put so many electrons in
there that you make the pressure balance
equal between electron
adding pressure and magnetic field
pressure at the outside be squared over
8 times the magnetic pressure and any is
the kinetic pressure if you can make
those two things equal you can't make
them you can't make the kinetic pressure
greater because it will blow through the
field it's like blowing up a balloon too
much you can make them equal then you
can push the magnetic field out as you
push the magnetic field out the scaling
ceases to be a mirror scaling it becomes
what's called cusps confinement scaling
and it scales as 1 over the square of
the magnetic field and if we can do that
what it amounts to is we're making the
loss holes through which the electrons
go out smaller and smaller and smaller
the harder we drive it with the electron
injection up to the point where we
inject too many electrons and if you can
still open up the cusp holes and those
equations are all understood now and the
question was can we do that we called it
the wiffle ball effect because as you
know the child's toy the little plastic
toy with the holes in it if you put a
marble inside it and you shook it like
that sooner or later the marble inside
would fall out a hole it would find a
hole the smaller you make the holes the
longer it takes to marble to get out
that's exactly what we're trying to do
the other problem in electron
confinement is magnetic insulation of
the walls all the structures that are
out there the containers were the coils
and things that hold the close together
the metal parts we have to keep them
from being able to be seen directly by
electrons without magnetic insulation
and that's turned out to be the devil in
the details which we finally resolved a
year ago the occasion is are these two
things could we make wiffle ball scaling
work and could we understand the magret
magnet transporter we have done both of
those in the last 12 years
the approach is low-tech engineering
compared to the monstrosity 's of the
huge machines I once used to call them
superconducting cathedrals
very much like the Middle Ages they put
it but it turns out that that that that
curious simple concept cause these
spherical fields and all that has
enormous we complicated and wonderfully
exciting physics in it all through it
why because it's non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium it's a completely dynamic
system with operative opposing counter
flows of two different charges the
density change from the outside to the
inside can be ten to the fourth or ten
to the fifth and there's a time
dependence when you start it up it's an
unbelievably complicated problem made
more complicated by the fact that every
charged particle interacts with every
other charged particle is not like the
neutrons in a fission chain which only
see you when you get within the range of
nuclear forces every charged particle
because who Maxwell interacts with them
all and a computer calculation to do
this once was estimated by Bruce Caplan
to do one all up start-to-finish
time-dependent calculation if one of
these machines would take a thousand
hours on the Craig and this is not not
useful the Rd device to build is small
and fixed and quick and cheap quick and
cheap not compared to my budget but
quick and cheap compared to what the
eighteen billion dollars we've spent and
it's straightforward testing and
critical physics these are all classical
physics machines and that's one of our
problems and trying to find people to
hire nobody's trained in gaseous
electronics anymore nobody's trained in
gyrotron x' and thyratrons
and you can't find people who do the
work of Langmuir in the 20s and 30s and
that's what we need
we drew a picture this is very old this
is 15 years old what such a thing might
look like it's got the wrong kind of
coils we should never make box coils
like that we no no but this is a
truncated cube it's a it's a cube but
the corners cut off and there are coils
here they all go in the right direction
it just gives you a general idea the
thing and of course being a good
physicist what you do today is you
patent it
so we file patents in 85 and they're
shooting 89 and another one in 92 which
we can pass over that and having filed a
patent on it because nobody seemed to a
patent in this configuration which we
saw was the only one that would work to
get rid of the Gribbs we said let's say
we can't get a program to see if this is
good idea will work with idea was to get
a program that could produce practical
nuclear fusion in a reasonable size
which would yield useful energy without
radiation hazards it seemed like a
perfectly sensible goal that we should
pursued but it didn't fit the model of
the main programs simply because it's
too cheap too quick this is I show this
chart only because it's one of the real
practical engineering issues it's
there's physics in it but it's really an
engineering problem arc breakdown in
practical experiments what kills us is
these parking parking occurs no matter
what this is a curve passion curve for
plane parallel electrodes for hydrogen
the point of this curve and not that I
choose any particular number on the
breakdown voltage is that we have to be
very careful in the pressure in the
distance we have in the test setups from
I the machines the test setups they kill
it if the product that it to is too big
our breakdown occurs at hundreds of
volts we're trying to run these things
at 10 and 20,000 kilovolts for 10 yeah
10 20,000 volts and of course we're
playing parallel electrons it's one
thing if you have if you have sharp
points and corners and bolts and one
thing in another the breakdown occurs
more easily this is a an engineering
problem not a physics problem so good
now I want to show you some pictures of
some of the devices we built I might
just say we started no there's a slide
first I'm sorry there's a view graph
yeah
no can we go off that here here we are
that was the second thing when the first
thing we built was a small open
polyhedral coil that we ran at a few
hundred volts just to show that the
scaling would work we did that we took
the program to not to the deal we cuz I
came from the do a AC and I knew that
was hopeless no it's not not a
pejorative comment it's that the program
of the do we which we had created was
this monstrous money machine that still
goes today and people tend to protect
their rice bowls and that's how human
nature is and I knew they would never
want anything that would threaten those
rice bowls and in fact I went to Bob
Hirsch the Farnsworth who was then
research director at Arco and I asked
him Bobby I said what do you think we
should do it is do not go to me say do
not go to her to do e because they'll
never support it and they'll kill it
take it to the DoD so we did we took it
to the Strategic Defense Office where
Jim Lanson who was an astrophysicist
with the technical director he
understood it immediately like that he
said it's a great idea well funded me
bothered it through the defense nuclear
agency and then later on it was funded
through DARPA
this was an early DARPA program in 1989
when we built a protein it was 190
centimeters across
it had coils like that picture that I
showed you wrong design in retrospect it
had it had all these big metal faces out
here that were not magnetically
insulated and we didn't know enough not
to do that in fact the paper we wrote on
the experiments here and published in
ninety-fourth erroneously tells you that
the electrons got lost in the guns
coming into the machine they did not
they got lost after they got into the
machine when they hit these metal walls
that were not magnetically insulated you
can say what's trivially obvious to even
those of meanest intelligence to see
that would happen but it wasn't she was
and that was the DARPA program after
that we we tended to abandon for this we
abandoned that closed box configuration
we set out and tried a little bitty
machine 5 centimeter radius and this was
made of solid state magnets so we did
not have the complete magnetic field
Wein cusps around here you can see the
electron burns where the particles that
come out run into the machine we did
that just to test the idea of the
polyhedral configuration and the next
slide yeah that was the second one we
built this was called WB to WB to is 10
centimeters in radius and look at it
it's a beautiful machine but it's not Co
these are all air core magnets and
they're uncool because there's no way to
cool anything at this size and scale and
so we had all the problem of outgassing
from the insulation of the coils that
crumbed up the vacuum system and all the
coils are touching that's how you held
it together you welded them right there
a bad mistake in retrospect but that's
what we did and we ran it in the next
picture showed you one of it that's what
happened when we ran it in 1994
September October 94 we actually
achieved a wiffle ball we this was the
whole point we achieved a beta equal one
condition but at very low energy because
the drive systems were a low energy when
we cascaded in the middle it brought the
energy way down but it was a wiffle ball
we ran all these tests on the air
because Maxwell doesn't care if it's a
fusion or air or whatever it is air
ardent and here you can see the high
density in the core and you can see the
particles coming up through the
constantly turned around through other
cusps this was done in September 1994
the first test like this and we thought
my god what's happened we got a block we
don't want a month later in October 13th
we rented again and finally realized we
produced a wiffle ball machine that was
a great wonderful thing it took us a
month to understand what we were doing I
mean while I gave a talk at a meeting in
Pittsburgh by the Navy Westinghouse in
the American nuclear society on advanced
technology for the 21st century on this
program before we had really understood
we had the wiffle ball and the talk was
fairly successful because the Anas
wanted us to give it as a talk at their
annual meeting in Washington in May and
I turn to our contract monitor and said
hey what should we do should we accept
this invitation you said no now that
you've got this thing working no more
talks don't go to any more physics
conferences don't write any papers just
lay lay quiet just do your work and door
published so for 11 years we had an
embargo in publishing
that's quite difficult to talk about it
because there's so much stuff we have
hundreds of technical document the next
slides
I was wb-3 which was the larger version
of WP 2 and it was built by only by
budget limitations we didn't really have
any way to do anything bigger we were
running out of money and this is another
machine which has flat coils square
square coil containers you ever see a
magnetic field that makes squares no all
of their curves and so these coils
inherently had huge areas of metal where
the magnetic fields produced by the
coils themselves would run into the
metal as soon as the electron gets on
that field line it's lost Doh egg and
she didn't that was W before the next
one we built and it too was connected at
the corners and it too had square coil
boxes in retrospect but not good and
things we called all Gauss's that
connected and because this was a cold
machine of that square copper tubing
with water cooling inside at 200 psi we
could get to 3 kilogauss for this and
run at steady-state eventually we want
all the machines to run steady state but
the suffered from the same basic flaw
that it had square box coils and field
lines are ran into metal and dog houses
and welds at the corners where you could
not avoid having the lines run into the
middle next one that was W before put
into the test tank we had a Faraday cage
put around it these are some of our
people who were working on it we had to
insulate all the supports because
everything that was that they're wrong
potential would attract electrons and we
ruined the Power Balance
and the things we're trying to measure
next slide that was it running at one
point and I showed this because we tried
every conceivable potential
configuration to get this thing to go to
high beta we could not succeed with the
power supplies we get in the lab we only
had about 100 kilowatts and it turned
out we need we knew we need a lot more
we didn't have the time money in this DG
and he didn't have the power supply so
we ran it we tried putting this thing in
a very high positive potential and
everything else in ground including the
emitters the mayor's came in from the
side of it and what happened was we
trapped electrons and you can see they
beautifully came out
corners just like that wb2 picture and
95% of the current went straight to the
coils to the walls into the cage
95% saw the walls in the cage as an
attractor for a look for electrons it
went back to their their original birth
it would not work we can't do it that
way next one
we've tried also you see are we we
wanted to ionize neutrals find a way to
control neutral ionization because if
you can't keep the neutral population
down it will flood the core and make the
will go away and so we tried what's
called electron cyclotron resonance
oscillation you put microwaves at 2.45
gigahertz into this thing and every tiny
if there's an 860 or something like that
Gauss lime surface at that line that
resonates EB over MC it resonates with
the microwaves and you can ionize the
neutrals very quickly in that situation
and we did this this was an ionizing
inside the Machine the next next slide
shows us testing on ionizing it outside
we proved that we could indeed ionize
using magnetron radiation from microwave
oven a $99 Sony oven we took the power
took the tube tube and the power
supplies out and 4-way rectified the
power supplies and drove it that way and
that was fine the problem with it is
that later tests we found that I'll show
you the Machine which you did we'll talk
about next one oh that was the lady was
the president of the company she's
smiling because she we wouldn't have a
company who she hadn't been there she
took care of all the administrative
garbage if your pardon me for saying
that the leases and the insurance
policies and the constant government
audits from the DCAA not only do we have
to live with the IRS like you guys do we
had to live with all the government
auditors and so we had a huge
administrative
sixty-four thousand pages of paper and
the 12 year program 35 percent of the
funds of the program went into
administrative reporting and
documentation stuff it's not like
private industry we can control it
and she's happy because we have just run
double you give me the next slide we
have just run value b4 for the last time
and we ran it finally knowing we hadn't
enough power we ran it on a bigger
passenger bank with a 400 kilojoules
storage we ran it for a few milliseconds
a fraction of the millisecond pulse
output we finally got enough current
into the thing to drive it properly even
with all those welds and corners it took
several thousand amps to get it there
which was way too much but we actually
got fusion out of it the DD fusion that
10 kilovolts and that was an historic
moment it actually we did it four times
the last week of December of 2003 which
oddly enough the first time it worked
was December 17th 2003 which happened to
be the exact 100th anniversary of the
Wright brothers first flight at Kitty
Hawk and one of the people who work for
us was Lauren Wright Jameson whose great
uncle roar Valona Wilbert who knows at
any rate and December 24th Christmas Eve
day we ran it for the last time and
we're very happy because it was the
first time we'd ever had a really true
high powered pony will power a
polyhedral system that produce fusion
next slide under that led us because of
time and budget limits to the next
machine wb5 this was going to be a
bigger machinery we thought we would try
to beat the arcing problem by using
superior magnetic insulation all over
the machine not like that first one
which had those big plates and see we
couldn't raise the pressure at which the
potential well would still survive and
we built this with closed corners even
though we knew that you really had to
have a recirculating machine and we
built it the WD 5 you can see this thing
and you're all these coils but still at
the corners and at the seams there are
places that are not
not proper the next slide I'll come back
with this machine in the end we learned
that that wasn't the way to go and I'll
show you and more well why and so we
built the machine finally in great haste
we were running out of money our budget
had stopped in to fiscal 2006 we were
saved by Admiral Cohen and onr who gave
us an infusion to carry us through some
calendar to double over five and and we
were going to run out of money and had
to start terminating staff and closing
down our lab which we would have died to
do in April but he served Camus survival
money and we realized in an in about May
that wb5 was never going to work for
reasons I should have had at this point
Tom and said we have to have a machine
and has no metal services available to
the electrons and it has to be
recirculating and all the coil
containers have to be conformal to the
shape of the magnetic fields they
produce so we very quickly design and
very quickly built this device which has
circular toroidal coils that have Center
spaced at the corners the key is the
spacing the original pattern was based
on the idea that you have coils of zero
dimension brilliant physics idea but the
minute you make a finite called
thickness and try to put them together
the current carriers that are on one
side make coils and fields that
intercept the other side you can't have
those coils touching because field lines
will run into the metal the minute you
have a finite size car which we all do
so we had to space the calls so that
they did not touch so there was a place
where the magnetic fields to go out
between the coils and the spacing has to
be a certain number of gyro radii that's
too much to go into the but we built
this with this kind of thing and the
connectors of course are the only
problem left but they had some magnetic
insulation too because we connected the
coils from we connected the conductors
from coil to coil through those so there
was a local magnetic field around space
and this we built very hastily in July
in August of 2005 and we ran it in
August and September and early October
to get
- equal one day - and then we ran it in
November could I have the next slide
that's the coil system go ahead next one
and that's how it looked finally when I
went in the tank and then go ahead and
that was it in the tank it was really a
very lovely machine I think that's the
is that the last Oh No I'll go skip from
W that was wb6 I'll come wb6 work they
worked like a champ did everything we
had imagined that we should have done in
the beginning and it proved that they're
so weak at all Oh missed the obvious for
15 years none of our consultants none of
our review panels none of our opponents
none of us none of me none of my stat
saw these these obvious facts when we
finally saw them in 2005 built that
machine and when we ran it at the 12
kilovolt 10 kilowatt will death
it produced a pulse of DD fusion - 10
kilovolts which is very low energy that
was about 1 times 10 to the ninth
fusions per second that's a hundred
thousand times were more higher than
version Farnsworth every gene in any
experiment they ever did it's a world
record it was only a short time was
about a quarter of a millisecond doesn't
sound like much on my watch but it's
several thousand electron transit times
in the system so from the point of view
of the electrons at steady-state they
don't know any better they live on a
different time scale they're moving at
10 to the ninth centimeters per second
next slide and in the process of this
program I've skipped over this but we
built a very simple thing several very
simple things call em PG magnetic
polyhedral grid we wanted to try to see
we couldn't get somewhere with the
scaling business by using water cooled
copper tubing in a single turn coil we
could only run this at two thousand ants
because of the cooling limits are we we
can turn the water into steam we
couldn't drive it any harder but the
trouble is we've only a single turn the
ampere turns in the coils were so small
we can only get about seventy to hundred
Gauss out of these things so the B
fields were really small but
nevertheless we were able to run this
with a thirty kilovolts it defeat
deep-well and it made fusion but the
fusions were limited
the fact that we didn't have enough
current and couldn't hold enough density
were those low fields we could only get
a ball in the center about 4 to 5
centimeters going and it was producing
about 1 times 10 to the 5th fusions per
second steady stream but it did prove
the polyhedral principle again the next
one and we were that's it in the tank go
ahead and the less odd thing we did was
build a very strange device which we
call pz LX
it's a single turn copper coil it
doesn't look like a Turner God's she
would out of a copper block but it's
polyhedral configuration inside this
metal container to take care of the
stresses the coiled coils come in and
turn around and make the polyhedral well
and we did that with a solid copper
block very thick in order to try to put
huge currents and get gigantic fields in
this thing because we were concerned
that people were saying well these
fields aren't stable they're not
equilibrium stable and dynamically but
they are and that's what we did we ran
this pulsed at 200,000 amps pulse for 3
milliseconds of capacitor bank and what
we did we had a passion arcing fashion
arcing would break it down to 300 volts
so we drive it with an external electron
emitter arc break down the stuff inside
as we turn the magnetic field on
sub-millisecond timescales from the
capacitor bank or as we turned the
current on that's the magnetic field and
and then it would grab the ions when the
when the shield got high enough that the
I enjoy a radius was smaller than cavity
size it would capture the ions and you
do adiabatic compression of the ions but
then we could compress these ions very
heavily up to 35 killing else could we
did this about a hundred and fifty times
over a period of a year and fields are
stable as a rock why because same HD
theory is correct if you have a field
that's convex toward the plasma at all
points it's always stable it's only when
it's concave toward the plasma that it's
unstable and all these polyhedral fields
are convex toward the plasma and we got
neutrons and fusions out of this thing
and they agreed with the adiabatic snow
cloud codes and theories that we add
that we're perfectly correct is there
anymore I don't think so
oh yeah I guess that's that's the
machine in the drivetrain you can just
go through this quickly that's that's
that little one this is the drive system
we had that's that's a capacitor bank
back there here's the tanker was in go
ahead that's more of the same this is
just part of our lab one of our guys
this is power supplies the electronics
lab go ahead and here was the gray a big
gray vacuum tank we use for some testing
you're just cycle through it local this
is where am i this is the side of the
back main vacuum tank in the pumping
system no no this is not a lot see I'm
too close I can't see it there's a
battery bank we got 240 RV batteries to
drive the drive the new coils we could
put out to several thousand amps and
controllable with IGBT controller so we
could do voltage control go ahead and
this is oh really
this is a power supply meal trinit panel
go ahead this is a water tank we had to
have deionized water and all that stuff
to keep it cool because the cause would
heat the water why go ahead this is that
12 12 12 bank capacitor arrangement that
stored 400 kilojoules of 15 volts and we
had you know March lines and things this
is these are some epic tronics high
voltage power supplies that we use to
drive the electron emitters but they
were limited to like smile amps at 15
kilovolts and Tunip amps at 30 let's see
next one now this is the controller for
all the other vacuum comment of a triple
molecular pumps to get on the main
vacuum tank and six of them go ahead
this is a control point go ahead next
one that is a great tank again we have
too much just go ahead Michael
that's this is a small vacuum tank in
which we did the wb2 testing back in
Manassas Virginia long time before go
ahead that's more of the water system
that's the big tank let's see it again
that's the main tank it was 2 meters by
three and a half meters it would go down
to the minus ninth tour was really a
pretty good vacuum system and he was
handy built in the drill that's a small
great tango again and that's just more
of the same with a mallet the fact the
turbopump was here next CP again next oh
well this is calculation skip through
these lengths ahead okay yeah no I
wanted to show you something about WB
five the big box with green coils that
was not open and recirculated this is
the potential well as a function of the
density of the starting neutral gas in
the system that was used in that
original DARPA program with the great
big hundred and ninety centimeter black
thing we found that if the starting
pressure was the density was above
somewhere between a tenth and one times
ten to the eighth per cubic centimeter
and this was a poem we had to run this
thing pulsed 25 millisecond pulse why
the potential well which was originally
set up would die right here it would
start to die why would it die because
the pulse would create ions out of the
neutrals and the ions immediately would
see the well I was forming and the lands
would rush in and flood the well and
make a central virtual anode and blow to
Wella couldn't be couldn't be stopped
because we didn't have steady-state
control
why didn't we have steady state control
budget money was a DARPA program 50
million dollars and the director changed
four months after it started so we don't
do fusion in DARPA so he killed all the
out your money so we could never
actually build what we started out to
bill but this is what happened it died
at this density the next chart shows us
what happened when we built WB 5 here's
the DARPA thing here as a function of
pressure and here's what happened in WB
five we actually managed to move that
pressure the starting pressure in which
it died up a factor of a thousand we
said oh boy we're winning we're going to
get there where do we need to go we need
to go to pressure approximately a
hundred times
higher to get to densities of ions high
enough to make useful fusions in the
middle when they could when they
coalesce we were a hundred times too low
we were not ten to the eighth they're 10
to the fifth times two alone so all we
needed to do we said was put a hundred
times more current in it
hot dog we've got that capacitor bank we
can put a hundred times more current in
for a short while so we did but we done
some electro static code calculations to
show mega electrostatic potential lines
and the next one is even more compelling
this shows us where the electrons went
and well and behold where do they go he
went to the corners the seams where
there wasn't any magnetic field
sure enough the magnetic fields produced
by the coils insulated the surfaces
beautiful that's where we got that
factor of a thousand but as the fields
turned around and came up in the corner
they went straight into the walls and
that's a railroad track for the
electrons to get lost and so we put a
hundred times more current and we gained
a factor of two and pressure we said
this is obvious this is the obvious
point that we all miss it's trouble of
course you can't have anything that does
that you have to a machine that doesn't
do that so we got swept it caused us to
build no don't do that one fill wb6
where we didn't oh ok it's ok
caused us to build wb6 which had
conformal coils and spacing at that no
magnetic fields running into the middle
and sure enough that's what we got we go
neutrons out of here and then the counts
are three because it's a pulse system
when their encounters are sitting
several meters away from the device we
had two sets of Neutron counter and the
neutron counters counted one flick at a
time and it's 4 pi radiation so if you
have a pulse you got a lot of area to
cover we only had some such a big box
for the neutral we got 3 counts and that
turns out to be about 4 times tended I
could read it I tell you to reduce it
when it came out over the pulse rate
because the pulse width was only about a
quarter of a millisecond came to came
out to be to be 10 to the ninth units
per second we didn't know that this I'll
just tell you a little history and wb6
when we built it we built it very
hastily
both as quickly and cheaply as we could
considering that it was titled it's hard
to build it's hard to build circular
coils in the lab when you're winding
them yourself you don't have any money
and you're running out of time and money
we had to close the lab down on the 1st
of November it was already November 2nd
or 3rd and we finally started to do
these tests we had to close it by
year-end calendar 2:05 because budget
was gone and we were running them these
tests on the 9th and 10th of November
the problem was that we had run the
Machine quite a lot before and lower
voltages and higher densities to study
beta equal 1 conditions when we could
get to beta equal 1 by running it on a
high current Lobo of his power supply
we'd run it probably fifty or hundred
times to get data for the transport
equations so all that time every time
you turn the coil on the magnetic forces
and the wires tend to push them apart
move them and they had been moved a lot
and pushed through all those tests so we
ran it on the on the 9th and the 10th of
November four times and four times we
got these results with fusion neutrons
and on the 11th of November we tried to
run it once again and the coils had
moves this is much higher voltage and
drive the clothes had moved sufficiently
they were his clothes were covered with
normal normal varnished type insulation
and they had somehow worn through in one
corner and it shorted at the feed
through and the battery bag discharged
through the coils and blew the Machine
apart
that was the 11th of November and that
was already 11 days past the shutdown
time for the lab and the following
Monday is a Friday following Monday we
started to the lab down nobody had time
to reduce the data
she said the data start on a computer
and I wasn't so early December that we
reduced the data looked at it we said oh
my god look what we've got we've got if
you've got something that beat her she
farmers by a hundred thousand it works
we didn't know that for a month it was
like WB
wb2 and and the wiffle balls and once we
knew that that was true what do you do
nobody seemed to care so we closed the
lab down and put all the equipment
together and the later you saw who's the
president of the company so why don't we
save the equipment we can't say we have
a million dollars worth of Navy
equipment sitting there all that lab and
all that stuff
she said well would you find a company
locally that can take this equipment and
we can transfer it to it as a DoD
contractor and I happen to know a man
who was running a company like that not
ten minutes away from this man called
Jim Benson maybe you know to know him he
runs a company called space dim space to
have built the engines for spaceship one
that's hanging in your in your lunch
room here and their rocket company some
Jim Benson have known for 30 years very
bright guy and he's absolutely intent
upon making this happen
for Space Flight my original goal to
because it makes space engines of
incredible capabilities if it works and
so I got together with Jim Benson at his
grazie behest and we transferred a
million dollars worth of Navy equipment
to him all that vacuum stuff and all the
pumps and all the power supplies in the
labs and he hired our three best lab
people so the lab still exists just that
we don't have he has it I don't care let
him do it
he's got a bunch of good guys and he
would like to pursue that program next
slide oh no this is oh yeah one of the
things on the on the outline said I'll
tell you all the things we've learned I
won't tell you all the things we've
learned it's too much it's 11 years but
there's a paper that I've submitted and
we probably will be published from an
international conference in Spain early
in October International Astronautical
Congress 1,500 people 150 nations and I
published to put this paper into the
conference because I wanted to for the
first time in 11 years put a summary out
in print this is what we did and what
we've learned and what it's about so
there is a paper available if anybody
wants it to describes it all it's not a
very good physics paper because it
doesn't contain all the equations
doesn't create all the theory in the
models
but it talks about it all and it gives a
lot of references you can probably get
that somewhere I don't know where it's
out point is it's out in public for the
first time in 11 years yeah I guess no
there's never one about codes they're
word oh okay well I can't help it let's
see we have codes I'll just say we have
codes that show power balances in these
things and power balances power and gain
as functions of the size of the machine
of the voltage and the size of the
machine I'll just skip ahead we have a
lot of graphs we could show you know
tell me we're out of time so I'll just
skip all that but if you assure you we
do have lots of codes the computer codes
of various cones for heat transfer
magnet design for potential intensity
distributions and lots of equation
modeling and one thing in another we
also looked at for every up here in Palo
Alto some years ago looked at machines
that would make utilities feel happy and
we think this is the best one that DT
catalyzed by the helium-3 we call it
chat a makes a neutron you capture it in
a blanket to make more statements
enhances radiation hazard it has the
advantage that it makes process team
this is not pb11 clean this is DD making
things that look like PWR neutrons but
but it makes PWR sticky so you could
build a machine like that and put it in
a blanket put it in the container like
that and then take that particular
container and put it in the central part
of a of a books central part of the
power plant where you have a number of
them lined up in a row and then that's
the reactor building the rest of this
plant is normal plant steam generators
same steam turbines and generators and
cooling towers and this is the way you
can retrofit existing fossil fuel-fired
plants you come in sit down next door
build a little reactor building and tie
it into the existing steam lines and
don't trouble the guys but the old tanks
leave them there but now you can turn
the oil tanks off and run the thing on
steam that comes from the DD fusion
system and it's no different than a PWR
system in the sense of the neutrons it
produces except when you turn it off
there
any radio answer to a product to decayed
chili we did most of our work with the
Navy books somehow and what we found for
the Navy we can make system well power
systems like that in the long run the
Navy's interested in pb11 the Navy wants
to convert the whole fleet to electric
ships and this is a way to make an
electric ship that is nuclear but has no
radiation unlike the youth a submarine
and it's relatively simple engineering
commercial viability is look six to ten
years from the time we prove the first
main demo plan and the cost as we
estimated today is 150 to 200 million
was was a chart from 1994 and the Navy
system looks like that it's actually
forget this there's a homopolar motor
driving a propeller but the powerplant
is here and it's 14 foot diameter pb11
spheric Raja knee and instrument murders
and murders and capacitor banks that
fits in the Power Bay of arleigh Burke
destroyer and it would run as long as
the electrical systems held up as long
as westinghouse can make the standoffs
for the 104 the two mega volt output now
i want to talk about why are we doing
all this
who cares why are we doing it for fodder
for the Navy from the DoD we're a one
contract company sole source proprietary
without any competing we never compete
for a contract we vent sole source
contracts from the beginning we've only
had one contract which is of course why
we died on it the money thing but if we
can make it work you can stop the green
notes effect you can make power plants
with no off gases no atmospheric slob
you can stop acid rain stop all thermal
pollution you can build a DT system that
will burn up nuclear waste we did a
study of that in 93 showed a dt burning
system can make so many neutrons that
you can burn up the nuclear waste in 20
power plants and studies take time and
make power at the same time to sell it
and change the storage time from four
thousand and nine thousand years down to
40 and 90 years which is more attractive
so it's it's an inexhaustible sort of
hydrogen is everywhere deuterium is
everywhere deuterium is one part in
6,000 and every glass of water you do
small-scale of low-cost and the product
is makes well I said this electric
fusion plants make one of the
interesting things they can do is make
really cheap ethanol we went to Vulcan
Cincinnati an ethanol plant builder Ann
Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula a
division wouldn't and ask them what what
about putting it out and hydrous ethanol
plant of the barge run by these guys and
they said yes
fifty thousand ton barge computers six
thousand tons a day of anhydrous ethanol
if you put it in Brazil and you run a
thirty mile square cane field which has
two crops a year and because you don't
have to use the pith and the husk is by
gas for fuel you can you confirm at the
pit as well as the juice and the husk
you can take off with a Canadian process
called the to be process and make wood
products out of it and get it
get some income from it and you can get
help and hydrous ethanol at 25 to 30
cents a gallon that cost and that's not
bad but the big real companies might not
like it unless you gave them a license
to do it for themselves and this means
that all the third-world countries in
the tropical belt where you can get to
crops a year cane can become all
producers
very interesting and burn up nuclear
waste freshwater you can certainly make
practical spaceflight in that 11 years
we were embargoing from writing papers
and Navy allowed us to write papers and
what you could do with this if you had
it so we wrote a series of eight papers
on how you can make rocket propulsion in
space by practical if you had this thing
there all improve it brings global
economic stability and that's really the
main driver cheap clean power made
readily available makes fixed energy
prices we don't have the OPEC up and
down game low value cane in third world
countries becomes a high-value export
product and all the third world nations
can become economically viable
provided you set up the business
arrangements in the right way so that
the people who are building the plants
are making the alcohol are forced to pay
some portion of the profits back to the
third world countries from which they
are taking the cane you can make a
profitable
just realisation possible in third-world
countries because they will have money
and that's the whole name of the game
destroys the world market for gasoline
it eliminates the oil cartel and while
it while the oil States suffer income
losses what they're betting but no what
they really need is food and how do you
get food in many of those things you
need water to irrigate to make
agriculture but these plants can make
desalination plants so cheap that you
can afford to make food you can make
desalination plants they run one
twentieth of the cost of what the Saudis
now pay for desalination water and that
allows you to do agriculture and if you
can do that you ought to be able to
stabilize the Middle East back calm
experience
never mind ideology money talk well yeah
well war should vanish and so on the
third world becomes physically
responsible no yeah is this the last one
no there's one more chart may I do one
more truth was its who thoughts because
there's two more the end-use market
price of all these energy products that
this machine can replace which will be a
40-year replacement time is five
thousand billion dollars a year is
estimated by the Chase Manhattan Bank in
the 1990s into year two thousand dollars
five trillion dollars a year if you do
this by building a machine doing the RMV
and leasing everybody in the world to
build these things we want to build them
lease everybody GE cuk Korea Electric
and brown boveri lease them all over the
world lease them in charge of the
royalty fee of two percent of gross but
you will generate is a hundred billion
dollars a year profit that's a business
it's the biggest business in the room
what we need next
we know the design scaling it's a four
to five year program the design scaling
actually I don't have a chart I do have
a chart but don't bother with the design
scaling we've learned is very odd on
this machine the power goes as the
seventh power output goes as the seventh
power of the radius seven
you make it bigger the power output
suddenly goes now the gang goes is the
fifth power the radius that means that
there is no point in building something
half size it isn't gonna get you in a
torch down by two to the seventh so you
might as well go the next step build a
food power demo how big is one and a
half to two meters radius for Dede two
to two and a half for pb11 doesn't get
any bigger doesn't become aircraft
carrier size it's that size we were
always working at one eight to one tenth
of the side but we could learn all the
physics there it took us a long time it
was very cheap we had five to ten people
working for twelve years but we learned
all those physics doubling the size
won't give us any new physics not until
we get to the full power sigh so that's
the next logical step and that's that
cost is will cost about 200 million I'm
aware there's a lot engineering problems
the physics problems are gone the
engineering problems are the things we
have to do you have to get men hunting
or write the owner somebody to come in
and do the instrumentation and control
we need to have somebody come in and do
few gas control feed systems at sub
millisecond timescale we have to do a
lot of engineering things which we know
how to do but the engineering cost more
than physics factor of 10 the first year
we want to do two more machines like wb6
have an enormous ly high level review
panel for the most senior people in the
United States all of whom are probably
over 70 because they're the only ones
who know enough to know what the hell
we're talking about and and and have a
demo program plan and the second third
and fourth years developing building
machine and build and test a demo play
we can do that in something like five
years is that it that's it and that's
what we're trying to do we need $290 we
don't hit it I'm not going to do it I'll
be an advisor but Jim Benson and his
company maybe Google it's the most
exciting program I know in the world or
I wouldn't be working on it I think
that's why you guys are all here because
you have an exciting company you're
doing exciting new things this is
something that can change the world
completely it's like the shift from wood
to coal coal oil oil to nuclear in
France at any rate and this is something
that's even more profound
because it affects every single energy
program on the planet once it gets going
there's not an attempt to kill oil
companies it's an attempt to change the
way people live the way politics works
and the way energy is available to
humankind and the way nations that have
nothing now can have something we
thought that was a pretty good objective
and we still do and I will tell you the
reason I began publishing after that
embargo is gone because they don't pay
us anymore
is because I'm intent that this program
shall be done and we can't do it in the
United States of America somewhere it'll
be done it'll be done in hay fed
northeast of Beijing or it'll be done in
India or it'll be done in Brazil or
Argentina or Spain or Italy
it'll be done somewhere are Venezuela we
can put enough cheap steam down the
Orinoco fields to get that oil out a lot
less than $30 a barrel and they have
seven times the reserves of the Saudi
and you may not like Shabbas but it's
got a lot of work and we have a way to
go somebody out there will do it if we
don't and I think it's a shame but we
don't I came here because who knows you
google your Google mentality says maybe
you guys will do it
I'm sorry I took so long you have a
Claire we should have questions and
answers if I can give any thank you sir
yes
microstructured metamaterial
design options rollercoaster environment
question is if the metastatic materials
which have strange indices of refraction
will that give us any hope you may get a
confinement business I don't think so
and the reason has nothing to do with
their properties I think that they're
just in another world that we don't we
don't interact with everything we we are
doing is enormously high magnetic fields
and it's an environment that's totally
hostile it's very high energy particles
that are in the case of pb11 up to two
hundred kilovolts and huge surface
damage from from impacts and so I don't
see how the solid state machine those
hollow solid-state devices have any
particular role to play in this this
machine they might have some use in
external control systems but not in the
device itself and there may be a bad
answer but that's the only one I can run
oh yes
No
oh here
if I were personally able to write a
check to find that cycloid but first
because the double v6 was destroyed and
there's no working
demonstrate
research
that's the last chart now that's the
first the first year of the five-year
program that wasn't a person no no it
wasn't clear it's called wb7 and wb8
right here the first year will be two
small test machines which are called WB
seven and eight that are like WB six but
not because they're not circular coils
which are not op in them they will be
actually coils that follow the
polyhedral configuration but they will
be carefully spaced and we expect them
to work three to five times better than
WP 6 one of them will be a truncated
cube and one of them will be a truncated
dodecahedron and those are two machines
that we will do to do just exactly what
you asked we will do wb6 improved 50
times more so that we can hammer that
data down so that the senior review
panel will have something to look at
yeah it'll be there and I wouldn't I
wouldn't convene that senior review
panel without having that data to say
look here it is now what do you want to
do to let the first year just to do
that's two million dollars but if you're
going to go on to the full program which
you should do you must will program it
for five so you can get some run up on
the main program you can't hire good
people eternal in your program but
that's key absolutely key yes
trying to get to writing a very long
paper about 120 pages with all the
mathematics and if not all but some I
don't know what to do with it we can
just much paper this paper you know said
it's not available on the internet it's
in the Proceedings of the International
Astronautical Congress held in Valencia
in early October
it's supposed to be on the internet but
he can't find it I think yeah I have it
I suppose you could write me and I'll
send you a copy well it's it's PDF on it
somewhere I'll either there's actually a
copy it with jiff s
yes in steady-state how do you actually
extract it you helium nuclei from being
mobile and talk the when you do pb11 you
get three helium nuclei one of them is
at a fixed energy of three point four
six MeV and the other two are average
two point four something and their
average because the beryllium made the
decays is moving so they run between
about a hundred kilovolts and a couple
of MeV that helium you have to take the
energy out by having Gribbs external to
the machine electrically bias Cribs so
the helium nuclei charge up against the
grimms and when they run out of energy
they will hit that next grid okay when
they hit the grid they become neutral
because they're neutralized by the
electron and then you have to have an
exhaust pumping system that pumps all
the external gas out all the time anyway
because you can't afford to lose all
your fuel you can't afford to lose the
boron in the hydrogen so you have an
exhaust system in which you then have to
have separation processes to separate
out the helium from the from the protons
and from the boron and you we've done a
study of that for most almost have a
little paper on looking at centrifuges
and electromagnetic separation kraj and
they have one thing in another and it's
perfectly straightforward because these
are all light elements where the mass
differences are are really quite quite
sizable and if they're not mass
difference sizable like T and helium-3
think they'd courage cryogenically
condensed at different temperatures so
it's really straightforward to do that
you take the trash out that way
you take the energy of the helium fusion
products out by grids it's like a giant
battery beta-decay battery yeah so other
than that
now that I know I really don't I mean
engineering is not you just don't do
that you have to have really good people
Westinghouse and GE and Raytheon and a
lot of good people come in to help you
do all the engineering of that heavy
stuff you want to do two hundred
kilovolts standoffs I don't do that
yep refunded Westinghouse to do that but
we have 800 kilowatt mega volt
transmission lines running across the
country so people do know how to talk
about those things anyway
the impediment has always been money
we've told the Navy and the DoD since
1989 that the cost of this program in
today's dollars is 200 million dollars
you've added a report after report after
report and they knew that and they knew
that from the beginning and they said we
can't do that why can't you do that
because if we do that I'll tell you the
story if you do that it becomes visible
to the staffers on Capitol Hill it's a
big enough budget item that people see
it once it becomes visible for the
Capitol Hill staffers everybody on
Capitol Hill knows that this is what the
Navy is doing the deal we will see it
but via we will say no you can't do that
we have the Charter to do fusion and
that's the end of the program because
they will co-opt it and shut the Navy
down so the Navy had funders that a low
level below the radar screen of politics
that's exactly what happened and it's
nature its life and there we are the
funding has always been way too small we
had to stand between five and ten people
doing this whole thing for 12 years
microwave ovens I mean we actually we
actually learned all the physics slowly
but we learned it all and the
engineering problems of course are
waiting on those budgets we couldn't
even run the Machine steady state we had
to go to these cat banks going too small
size and capex makes the experiments
very difficult because you don't have
time you can't build cooling you can't
control the gas flow we had sub
millisecond pulse gets inputs where we
couldn't turn them off in time it's very
hard it's much easier to build a big
machine sense of the control problem we
need not we I don't need it but whoever
does this needs a lot of help
the Chinese and Heisei could probably do
it very straightforward
seven years old that seems like a raw
the question is am I made I made it sort
of jocular remark that the review panel
would probably be people over 70 years
old I don't know that that's true I'd
actually have some people in their 30s
on it because I know some very bright
guys the problem is is that engineering
schools and nuclear engineering and in
physics related physics really don't
treat people in this field anymore and
they haven't for 20 or 25 years because
it's an arcane field that doesn't fit
modern technology where have all gone to
silicon we've all gone to microchips and
we've all gone to solid-state devices
and there are very few people who make
giant four foot high pop I have power
too it's not like the days of Langer and
Dan Tesla and those guys this is really
back in that world it's not that
anybody's evil it's just that there
wasn't any market for people like that
so the people who lived through it I'll
give you one example of one of the
people I'd like on that review
committees name is Bob Simon's he was
head of research at Varian for years and
then he was head of electron Lytton
electron devices here in san carlos and
he's been following this field and
working in it for 35 years he's 86 years
old but he's smart as a tack I mean he
comes from another world and there's
nobody trained in the schools that you
can turn to I happen to know some good
people at Sandy and was almost some
really bright guys who I would turn to
to put on this panel because they think
outside the conventional magnetic
confinement box and that's the problem
the box has become so big and so
well-funded it supports thousands of
people and hundreds of labs all over the
world everybody for decades has been
thinking about next Welling and
equilibrium plasma and it's very hard to
break that monsen if you live in that
box and your income comes from doing
research in that box how do you ever
break out of it well I know a few people
who do I know a manic column who I would
bring
as the director of research from England
because she's appalled at what he's
doing her but he's working on jet which
has been being studied there for 24
years now it's a very difficult problem
but but it's a real problem when I even
discussed this with Bob Hirsch you still
in Alexandria as where we would find
people and how do we find people who are
credible but I can find a lot of people
over 65 who are really credible who have
been brilliant engineers in their
lifetimes and who have a national and
international stature who I would trust
I don't own these guys they're just
friends of mine and we don't lie to each
other and they would tell me what they
really think and that's what I want I
want the brightest guys I know to be
there to tell me what they really think
should we go ahead or should we say nots
too big a risk and why bond I don't
think that's going to be their answer
you've given under government in the
sense that I find no one in the
government who is at this point remotely
interested in doing it and anybody in
the government the government you see is
staffed largely by people who don't have
a physics background and the staffers
many of them don't really and this is as
the buzz the chart said it's very
complex in arcane physics and this is
not a fault it's just the way things are
the the government will always turn to
its government laughs for an assessment
the government labs will say no good
absolutely no good I've been through
that for so many years it's beyond
belief these are my labs I used to be an
assistant director in most loans and and
in the AEC and I know these guys I mean
they're all my friends but second of all
say no except for a handful of guys I
know in those labs who think outside the
box and those are the good guys I put
some of those young guys in the pen yes
oh this lady sounded ludicrous given
that office
Peter simulations to advance some the
estate of yard I pinched over that much
too quickly
we have been doing computer simulations
of these since 1989
starting with Bruce Kaplan admission
research with the magic code which was a
particle in cell code in which we could
make beautiful movies of these these
little particles moving in and out and
going through numerix and Albuquerque
with Jacquot roots who used to work on
the program and its new Eric's as a
subcontractor doing more particle than
cell calculations that halfway through
their contract they said we give up we
can't calculate this problem the problem
is how do you do a calculation of the
magnetic field being expanded under the
total beta equal one condition the
pressure balance condition in a
transient way with all this maxwellian
interconnection and when you are only
one part in a million away from me quote
from quasi neutral neutrality so we
can't do it we can't get the gridding
fine enough to get rid of the numerical
noise in the calculation down to the one
part in a million it's a de to get it
that's fine the Gritti has to be so
great that the machines will take eons
to run we have nothing that will work so
he quit in the middle of his country
it's we have a lot of numerical
simulation capability that electro
static code that I showed you with the
particles going to the wall that was a
code developed by an ex Andy a guy in
Albuquerque we had we've had he modified
to some degree and it's a brilliant code
it's wonderful was originally designed
for particle beam accelerators but that
code only works in a collision list
regime it's only for collision with
particles but the minute we get beyond a
few hundred nanoseconds we have
collisions which we don't have
collisions we don't have expansion of a
field so it's only the start of
conviction that that code can help us
with numerical simulation is great but
it has horrifying limits because of the
nature of the physics of the problem and
we will use it everywhere we can we can
get bigger machines or parallel
processors that was the original game
five parallel processors working
directly on this system it would be
about an eight million dollar effort
never had the money its we're waiting
for it now you asked about financing we
have no plans for five minutes
I've given up as I say in the government
and not that the government was bad just
the way the budgets are why do we run
out of money because the fiscal year oh
six budget and the Defense Department
was cut you are deemed Navy RMD was cut
26 percent in fiscal year oh six because
we have to fight roadside bombs in Iraq
the Navy budget cut of 26 percent caught
an entire line item out of the Navy
Advanced Energy Development all gone we
were under that line item so we had no
money coming in FY o six and Admiral
Cohen saved us just long enough to get
those results and and there's no way in
the current budget situation in the Iraq
business and the current administration
to get anybody interested in anything
except 700-mile fences and Iraq Wars and
one thing in another and I'll that's
what it is
and and there's no way the deal we will
ever support it I'm not until it's
running in China because it's a threat
it's a threat that this is you know two
million dollar a day or high school and
everybody is pounding down the road
toward it or to be builded kadosh
friends and this is the next big thing
for the next thirty years they can all
do research and retirement on that oh I
don't see government doing in anywhere
in any Western nation that's why I limit
the overseas nations to those people who
are not partners in the tokamak program
but there are enough of them in an
average of forty million a year can be
done by a lot of different countries and
it probably will be if we don't do it oh
I do I have a plan for private money no
I'm here by accident because no called
me one day and said I want you come to
Google and give it to up well I happen
to think you know something about Google
and its people and your stockholders and
and I think it's got an interesting
outlook and you have a very exciting
point of view and a very exciting way of
doing things here that I haven't seen in
a long time
and you have a lot of money and there's
any serious interest in changing the
world on a long time scale it's not
going to return anything in two years
this may be a place that should should
pay some attention to this obviously we
need an angel there are a lot of people
in this country who have met
multi-billion dollars who could fund
this at lunchtime I have no intention of
spending my life running around talking
to the law I'm too tired
somebody if somebody wants to do it
they'll figure it out if they don't
it'll be in print it'll be everywhere
around the world and I'll give it away
we have the patents on it somebody will
pick it up someone China is a
participant in it three percent so they
don't want to be thought to be not
members of the community but China is at
hafe a building some very interesting
tokamaks of the kind that we were
looking at 20 years ago quite apart from
it or that will be dinner to the punch
and I think that we have a lot of a lot
of people elsewhere in the world who
don't have the same kind of mental
constraints that that we have in this
country and for all I know that's what
will happen I would prefer we would do
it in the United States with people like
you who have vision and go power and are
excited about things and so would Jim
Benson we would like to see see space
Devin Benson space company take this
thing over and maybe work jointly with
whoever else partners with it and go for
the space engines might as I told know
when I was seven years old my objective
in life was to fly to Mars it still is
and these machines can do it because
they'll make space engines a thousand
times better than anything else
single-stage to Mars in four weeks h tol
to live with 25 dollars a kilogram
seventy six days to Titan one of the
moons of Saturn it's a very remarkable
engine I wish I had a plan I could tell
you what a plan would be going to all
the Foundation's and all the
multimillionaires they you know the
people who SpaceX and all those guys
Elon Musk and and Jim Bezos and those
people that it's too tiring
I'm not tired in that sense I'm talking
to
and the problem is the fusion community
is sold and so entrenched you always run
against them the media question you
always get when you talk to people who
are not personally themselves I do not
personally themselves understand the
curiosities of the physics and why it
really will work even though you can
tell them it will either they believe
you because they know you and they know
you don't lie to them or they say well
it sounds good but I have to have vetted
by somebody and they don't know where to
go to vet and the first question you
always get is how come if it's so good
that United States government isn't
doing it that's the first question I've
had that question in France and other
news and Surrey not unreasonable the
answer is very long and teenies and it
sounds like sour grapes but it really
isn't it's just reality in a private
world any world a private industry where
people don't think like government they
can understand that if you do what you
do because it's right and it will work
try it's what you do here I think
question no published it through the
first time in October we had the only
other people working in the field that I
know of are at University of Illinois I
George Miley who's working in the Hirsch
Farnsworth regime with the with grids
and Jerry Coulson ski &amp;amp; santeri us up at
University of Wisconsin where they have
been working on Hirsch Farnsworth
machines for a long time also they're
all stuck with the gridded systems
nobody's trying to do the magnetic
confinement thing possibly because we
held all the patents on it but that
wasn't stopping them from doing research
but I know George for 30 years and
they've known all these guys for 30
years they're good guys they just took a
different path they wanted to see if
they could make Hirsch better
it happens in Ableton and there's a
group in Japan doing something somewhere
Hirsch Farnsworth machines there's a man
in Germany named johns vet who's
building semi cylindrical systems to
make Neutron sources for measuring paper
thickness and paper mills but that's not
fusion power that's making it a
diagnostic instrument on earth it's like
well walking
PFN well loggers run on the accelerator
D and attorney ated targets and make
pulse neutrons that go out into the oil
fields and scatter back depending on the
hydrocarbon content I know nobody who is
doing this that's part of the problem in
the review committee that there's no
group of people to turn to who they're
working on except people who worked on
it 25 and 30 years ago partly because
I'm a fellow of the International
Academy of astronautics and partly
because I'm a spaceflight enthusiast and
partly because the canoe the meeting was
being held at the time which fitted my
time schedule to submit a paper I was
going to go to Valencia and give the
paper but one should certain medical
limitations on what I can do so I didn't
go I just sent the paper in and people
have it there I hope to publish a much
larger paper in the general likes using
