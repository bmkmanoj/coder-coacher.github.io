isn't my project I'm I'm Bjorn with the
copes foundation and Milan was done by
Mick Kirsten and a bunch of other people
who happened to live in the Vancouver BC
none of whom could make it today
mostly because many of them are having
small children sometime in the next day
or a couple weeks or at least their
wives are and so for some reason they
didn't want to come down to California
and miss that event just so they could
talk here at Google so instead I'm
giving this talk because I really like
this Milan stuff and I use it all the
time and as I put in the abstract once
you start using it you'll get hooked on
it and you'll never go back to not using
it
it turns out from my point of view Milan
is incredibly simple and so this talk
should be fairly short and you can ask
lots of questions because I just have to
cover a couple points and all of a
sudden it's totally obvious much like
when I looked up and noticed that we're
actually all on the ceiling because the
balloons are floating in the air from
the floor so a little history of Milan
they they started a couple years ago
they did a user study it's actually all
funded it's all started around Mick's
PhD work at the University of British
Columbia he was looking into a number of
things about the way people do work and
they started building on top of Eclipse
because a number of different research
universities and so on have found
Eclipse to be a good platform for
building new tools around software
development on top of so they're working
away on it and discovered it to be
incredibly useful and turned it into a
project and the main observation here is
when you're looking at Eclipse and
here's it clips captured as a picture on
a slide I'll do some demos in a bit it's
got lots of stuff up here now you guys
are all familiar with the clips so you
will know what all the little a's and
little yellow things and the blue things
and it all makes perfect sense to you
but another hand there's a lot of stuff
going on there on the screen at once and
in fact most of it isn't relevant to the
current task that you have at this very
moment so you know more stuff there and
the real problem is information overload
we're all multitasking all the time in
fact as I was sitting at the back well
Michael was talking I noticed that
everybody in the audience or at least
90% of you were multitasking at the same
time you were reading email on your
blackberry or some there's one guy was
watching had like seven tabs open on the
browser and was zipping back and forth
and doing all this stuff so he's
multitasking and listening to the talk
at the same time and we have that same
problem when we're programming at least
I do is that I'm doing all these
different things and people call me on
the phone or the instant message me or
Twitter goes off and I'm constantly
switching back and forth between all the
different tasks I'm trying to do and
every one of the tasks I'm trying to do
has a particular context surrounding it
a set of files I'm working on a
particular bug report I'm working on and
I don't know if you guys read that New
York Times article from what a couple
months ago that basically said
multitasking makes us stupid and the
reason it makes us stupid is because we
lose that context every time we switch
to a new task so the basic thing that
myelin does for you is it makes tasks
first-class citizens
so tasks are now integrated into the IDE
and it filters the IDE down to the exact
task the context of the tasks that
you're working on so over here we have a
list of tasks and notice that like this
this Navigator project Explorer over
here is now filtered down to just the
things that are relevant for that
particular task and all the views inside
Eclipse are filtered down to the things
that are relevant for that particular
task and then when I switch to a
different task my phone rings somebody
calls and says oh some website is down
you know we can't submit talks to
eclipse Khan any more I go up there I
click on a different task up in the the
the tasks list and the whole IDE
switches over to the context for that
particular task and enables the windows
and and filtering for that task and
closes down this one and then I come
back to this one Eirene able this it all
goes back to this particular context so
in order to do that Milan had to make
tasks be first-class entities inside the
IDE
that's the ascensions central bits of
Milan my talks over for the day
no no really seriously that's the
essential bits of Milan the rest of this
talk is all expanding on that particular
topic showing you a couple demos and
some of the neat technology about how it
works but the essential tax things are
the tasks are first-class and there
and you only see the bits that you're
working on because of that yeah well so
we solved that problem with brain
surgery we go in we alter your brain and
then you don't you don't even remember
um no there's this nifty little button I
don't think I can jump high enough maybe
I can do this here there's a button up
here the little purple button up there
which you can turn on and off whether it
filters it or not so if you've
discovered when you're looking around
that you can't see find the right thing
you turn off the filtering then you get
the whole UI back again and you can be
confused and then once you've found it
you can turn the filtering back on again
but the thing is it's sort of like you
know Google I assume not working here
gathers a lot of data about people as
they browse around through the
clickstream that you do like when you
search for something it says did you
really mean to search for something else
right and so one of the things that
myelin does is it watches your
clickstream as you walk around and and
work in the IDE and has a degree of
interest model that makes some
assumptions about what you're interested
in based on what you've seen before as
you're walking around in the IDE and you
know they've worked on it quite a bit
and assumed that you know you could
always make it better but so far I
haven't found a lot of cases where it
doesn't work and then the cases where I
found where it hides stuff that I
actually wanted to see I just used the
global search function and it finds it
and then it once I found it I'm starting
to work on it so therefore I'm
interested in it and then it appears in
all the the filtered views of the menus
and things other questions
how do I see shared what right so that's
in this sum this task view over here and
I'll actually show you a demo of that
but the task view in in this particular
case is connected up to Bugzilla
which is where they're storing all of
their tasks these guys the Milan guys so
those are all Bugzilla numbers actually
eclipse.org Bugzilla numbers and so
since they're in Bugzilla everybody
who's got connection to Bugzilla can see
them and shares them that way you can
have your own private task repository
that you share among you just a few set
of people and so on and in fact the way
I use it I'm hooked up to four different
task repositories at once and I have a
private one I have a private one for
Eclipse work I have one for public
eclipse work and then so on okay so oh
so now we're gonna have an overview of
what I was going to tell you I'm
actually using mixed slides here so I'm
a little not quite up to speed on
exactly what's coming next because Mick
wrote them and said here give this talk
but I could give the talk without the
slides because I just think it's so
exciting um so I gave you the
introduction which was the entire talk
and then I'm going to go over it again a
couple times and then I'm going to tell
you a little bit about the framework and
some technical details behind it the you
know like I said before used Mailand you
had all these all your things little
post-it notes and so on and now you have
this one task list and you're connected
up to repositories so that you can you
can see each one of them and then Milan
does a number of things for you it
allows you to do offline editing and
access so it caches all your tasks in on
the disk so you can edit them and so on
while you're on the airplane just handy
or wouldn't you're commuting back and
forth in the bus it does change
notifications with integrated with
Eclipse so they appear in the same
resource change stream that other change
notifications and Eclipse appear what
else can we say here oh you can search
them you know when you do ctrl H to get
the search box when you do a search
there it searches across all the tasks
it's fully integrated with all the rest
of Eclipse so it's just you know it's
not just sort of an add-on on top of it
it's not just like a piece of paper or
post-it note it's integrated into the
whole environment and in fact the way
they built these things
is when they built the the filtered
project view or package view it's
actually the original package view with
some extension points into the package
view and then they filter them that way
or they use the existing ones filtering
things that are there and so it's
actually not even a separate piece of
code it's actually the same code that
you've got out there they've just
plugged in some additional filters into
the extension points to make it all work
so the way this task focused UI works I
think the next slide has this little
animation which is kind of cool is that
you know it has this degree of interest
model that keeps track of what you've
seen recently and therefore what you
might be interested in and it's not just
what you've seen it's also the things
that are connected to what you've seen
so if you're working on a particular
method you're probably interested in
other methods by the same name in the
class structure that might be callable
if you're working on a particular
package you might be interested in other
packages that are nearby that package in
the naming structure or ones that have
references to it so it's not just what
you've seen but also using some
knowledge of the semantics of the
programming language you're currently
working on things that you might be
interested in so if you're working on
Java it knows about the semantics of
Java to figure out things that are
interesting to where you currently are
if you're working on C using C DT again
it has an integration with CDT so you
know something you know something about
things that you might be interested in
nearby where you are and and then the
parts that are interesting to you know
that they're the best for my opinion are
the context is obvious and managed it's
obvious because it's filtered and it's
managed because it keeps track of it all
so that when you switch back and forth
between between tasks it remembers where
you were and comes back to it and in
fact you can even share your context
with other people on your team currently
the IDE just stores the context locally
on your machine but you can save that
context to the task you're working on
which if you're using Bugzilla is your
task repository just saves a zip file of
some context information as attachment
on Bugzilla and then somebody else on
another person on your team can open up
that context using using milan and it
automatically applies that context to
your that person is Eclipse IDE and then
they have the exact same context that
you are
looking at filter down in the exact same
way so you can share them back and forth
and then what's very handy is this
one-click task switching let's see if
the next light is the animation that I
think it is oh no it says demo and I'm
supposed to give you a demo of this so
well see if I can make this work here we
go here's my yes my latest ganymede
installation and you'll notice that over
here I have my task list the way I've
got it set up for example there's and
there's all sorts of little UI hints in
Milan that you get used to as just like
you did with Eclipse so one of them is
up here that we have is a little blue
arrow that says there's incoming things
that I haven't looked at yet and one of
them is here you know we need to set the
registration fees for the clip summit
Europe so it says here Bjorn you'd
better do that and I should do something
about this so if I wanted to do that I'm
actually that's not the one I wanted to
do let's go look here under my bugs and
I can't remember what I was going to
have on the demo okay well we'll just do
the registration fees and so I can
activate the task here and it shows me
that I haven't chosen any files for that
one so that wasn't the task I was going
to demo so I was looking into this
problem and I have this particular file
was part of the problem of to make that
and my screens turn so small here on
this display but you know here's a PHP
file with all sorts of code that
generates the conference website and so
I happen to know if I'm and I had to
stop working on that problem because I
have to give this talk so I just turned
off that task and it retained all that
context and then I go and give the talk
and then when I come back to it I turn
the task on and it's filtered my my
display back down again using the
context that I was in now there I have a
number of different queries here for for
the different types of bugs here's a
list of all the bugs are currently
opening in the eclipse portal
some of them are signed to me which I
filter down as my bugs and so here are
the ones that are assigned to me for
example this one if I activate this one
there are some files that I'm working on
for that particular one so I've switched
to that particular task if I switch to
the you know away from it then I'm back
to the unfiltered view so it saves the
context of where I am I've got all the
tasks explicitly mentioned now these are
all just
bugzilla tasks if you because we happen
to store everything in Bugzilla so we
just have a form here that edits the
Bugzilla and it has everything that
including you know all the comments that
have been made and all the things that
you normally see inside the Bugzilla
task repository or bug repository now
myelin will attach to number of
different repositories not just not just
Bugzilla but JIRA and there's a whole
list of them and through different
adapters so that each difference so that
you sort of it not forcing you to use
one particular repository but it'll
attach to whatever repository you're
currently using and use that as the task
repository in the code repository and we
can do that by show view task
repositories so here are the three
repositories that I've currently got set
up for my particular system so we have
for instance you know the Eclipse con 1
I mean the Eclipse one is attached up to
the Eclipse bugzilla and it's logged in
with me and it keeps track of all that
information it caches it away so that it
can resynchronize and it resynchronize
--is on a regular basis so that these
things stay up to date and then I can
get the little blue arrows that come in
and the and the arrows that go out and
so on back and forth again now let's go
look at a particular project spec
remember what I saved one away here so
this particular one I said was a Java
one which it's not so here now I've got
I set up a context just so you could see
how it looks when we're working on a
Java
and so it's filtered away a number of
Java things but again I'm just in the
Java perspective the Java person I could
be in the Java perspective and you know
seeing all the the bits and pieces over
there you know that oh it's this file
and it's that file and the particular
degree of interest model that keeps
track of the dependencies between them
so you guys fall following this as I
wave my hands around and zip the mouse
around but again I'm just repeating what
I said before which is there's there's a
list of tasks over here in this
particular case I've restricted the list
of tasks by searching for a particular
number because I happen to know that
somebody had called me up and said it
was 2 0 3 8 4 4 but you know I could
also just go have the complete list of
tasks and find them now another thing
that I can do what i was going to demo
that later but i'll demo it now because
i'm talking to you is you can also it
also has a whole thing for scheduling so
I've scheduled a number of tasks to
happen today these are them and I've
scheduled some others for later this
week and then there's a whole bunch of
ones that are unscheduled so you can go
and and and set yes you know it's not
just a list of tasks but also task
management so I can say which ones I'm
working on when and it'll notify you as
they're coming along one of the
interesting things is let's see we can
say scheduled for and then I wonder if I
can say choose date no can't so I have I
have an older version of Milan they have
this feature where you could say Jul it
for some day not today not tomorrow but
some day and this turns out to be
actually really useful because it's for
things that you know you should be
working on but it's not today that I'm
working on them it's really soon now and
so you're scheduling for the some day
and it constantly floats into the future
and reminds you that yeah you're
supposed to be working on this but it's
not scheduled for a particular day so it
never goes out of you know never becomes
past due but it's always just about JB
do so and the reason I mentioned that
besides it's kind of a clever little
feature is that it's one of those things
that as you're using the the Milan
system to manage your workload and your
tasks that's one of the things that you
do you know you have all these little
post-it notes you got the things
I'm working on today and then this list
of things that were here that I need to
be getting to you and if you're going to
use some automated system like this to
manage your task list you have to manage
that it you have to have that exact same
behavior that you're used to with your
post-it notes or whatever other
mechanism you use and one of those
behaviors is I got this list of really
soon now but not critically due today
and so they have even that feature in
where you can say some day and then it
just floats along into the future okay
so you know I have turned sound on so I
don't know what its gonna yell or cut so
um I don't know I I don't like these
revealing slides so we'll just scroll
down to the bottom oops too far nope
there we go
so a number of tips about how to get
started using using Milan and so in
addition to getting started with Milan
Mick and his colleagues have started a
startup based using the Milan technology
as a basis called tasks top which
extends Milan to your entire desktop not
just your IDE so it incorporates things
like integration with Gmail and and
what's that Microsoft mail product
outlook and no seriously I don't
remember what it's called it wasn't
there wasn't a slot less light and and
Microsoft Word and other documents like
that but this is about the IDE version
so you know you want to manage your
tasks with one task list I manage them
slightly differently personally you saw
in my demo that I had a number of
different queries up there I have one
list of all the queries or all the
things that are open under each of the
projects that I'm busy working on and
then I have one of the things that are
assigned to me so that I can monitor the
work that everybody else is doing and
then when things are assigned to me they
show up in my little work queue so I do
have one task list for me but I have
lots of works test this for everybody
else you want to work with different
task repositories like I said I have one
for my private stuff I have one for
things I work with with our meeting
planners for our conferences one for
private foundation internal things like
contracts and then one public one that I
work with across all of eclipse open
source
you know you can navigate around the
tasks using hyperlinks again that's the
tight integration with Eclipse every one
of the tasks turns into a hyperlink so
you can just go and click on them if I
try remember to show this one and get
back to the demo if a task depends on
other tasks you know you can just click
on the other tasks and goes right to
them so you don't have to remember to
type in the number or anything like that
you can search the repositories and then
of course my favorite one multitask with
ease so I'm less stupid when I'm using
Milan because when the phone calls or
the i.m comes in says you know some
there's a problem with this particular
piece of code I can just click over to
that particular problem report it saves
everything I was doing so that when I
come back I'm back to where exactly
where I was and getting back is easier
you can navigate Java programs and see
programs with focus and I there was one
of the other languages that Eclipse
supports is also adding Mylene
integration and you can share these
tasks context between members of your
team so that you can hand work off you
can look into a problem you can look
into a feature to figure out what it's
all about oh I still need to talk to
that person I can save that context they
can restore that context they can look
into it you can have a conversation
about that so I don't have to tell you
go to this file I can just say here's
the context and you can load it up and
and you can share that same context that
you've recovered in your head back and
forth because we've made it first-class
so then there's the expert tips
and the getting get set up for team
awareness is has to do with setting up
your task list queries the way I have so
you can see different sets of people you
know so I work with a number of people
at the Eclipse Foundation on one project
I work with a different set of people on
a different project so I have different
of those folders set up for each of
those projects so that I can see those
little icons you know new things have
come in on this particular task list or
on this particular task list and I can
monitor what's going on the the focus
your week one day at a time is this
scheduling issue one thing you find as
soon as you start using something like
Milan or you know tools like task list
management I've been around for a long
time I think one of the things that
Milan does that other such tools haven't
done in the past is this tight
integration with the IDE where it shows
you the context you're working on and
it's not just a to-do list but one of
the problems you find when you start
putting your to-do list into an
automated system like this is that your
to-do this is a lot longer than you
remember it and you know even mine isn't
nearly as long as when Mick gives this
demo it like goes on for pages and pages
and it's like well how can I ever
possibly deal with that to-do list well
if you focus on a small piece of it what
I'm going to get done today or what I'm
gonna get done today plus some day which
is like one of my favorite features
there then it's a it's a plausibly
doable list of things to do and you
prioritize them these are really
important these are not so important you
can use all that mechanism and it flows
along and it's not so scary let's see
you you can actually manipulate the tax
contest context if you become an expert
so if things accident if the system
accidentally puts things into your
context that you didn't intend it to you
can actually go and tell it these aren't
really in the context this is one of
those features I wish Amazon head cuz
you know I'm buying books and I buy a
bunch of books and then then my sister
wants a book so I buy a book for her and
all of a sudden I start getting
recommended books about horses well I
could care less about horses so I want
to go into my Amazon context and say no
horses are not interesting to me but I
can't but you can with with Milan if
you're an expert
oh okay so there you go if I were an
expert
you can work offline I don't see how
anybody can work with small monitors but
Mik claims it's possible so he has a
line about that you know to me if it's
not this big it's just not usable it has
this nice mechanism for dealing with
patches for Java code so obviously when
I'm working on a particular problem and
I have a context I've built around that
problem and I finally have solved that
problem it's obviously that piece of
solution that I've built that turns into
a patch just for that particular problem
so there are some one-click buttons in
there to take the context the change is
only in the context that I've worked on
and turn it into a patch and attach it
to that particular bug and vice versa if
I do a team commit to commit the code it
takes the bug description of the task
that I'm working on and assigns it as
the default comment for all of the code
that's being checked in and it keeps
track of if you're doing changes to
multiple different bugs at the same time
so I'm working on this bug and I'm
working on this bug then it keeps those
change sets separate so when I'm working
on one and I'm done with that one and I
hit to commit that code it takes just
the changes for them in that context and
commits them and doesn't chance submit
the changes for the other context of
course that does fall down if you have
both contexts pointing to the same files
you have two sets of changes and say
well it's not actually that clever but
it's close right yeah did someone have a
question no and then of course Mick has
to put in this line at the bottom here
which is once you become an expert you
should contribute back to the Milan
project and make it even better that's
what that particular line is you know
rah rah go open-source contribute to it
and I really suggest that once you start
this you'll be hooked and you'll love to
do that Milan itself doesn't integrate
with any of the project planning tools
the tasks top tools that they've built
in their startup and sell I believe do
integrate with the project planning
tools but I'm talking about the milan
project not the test top commercial
thing
a team awareness in all this task
management and you just dispense with
project planning tools I generate a pert
chart from from my task list well you
know now we're going into the realm of
opinion but I haven't found pert charts
to be useful in a long time so I would
have said get rid of them even before
but it depends on how you run your
project right so if I were building for
instance the Mars Lander that the
Phoenix lander that landed recently
probably I wouldn't use an agile
software development process because you
know it I think the total landing took
what 12 minutes right and so if a bug
occurred in the first three minutes
there really wasn't time left to upload
a change you know to fix that so you
might want a bit more rigorous process
to do that one I tend to work on
projects which are much more agile and
have a shorter iteration cycle and much
less death or destruction should they
fail and so I tend to use a less
heavyweight planning process and so we
tend to use lists of tasks as our
project planning mechanism the sort of
only concession we've made normal
project planning is that we number the
tasks in some partial order because they
tend to be dependent on one another but
but that's about the extent of what
we've done can you get aberrant burndown
chart from this contribute bugs and
patches actually I think that would be a
fabulous thing to add to it and I don't
think it's in Milan although it might
they you know you might add that as a
feature request and those guys would
probably just whip it out because you
know eclipse has got the whole business
intelligence reporting toolkit for
business intelligence reporting I guess
its toolkit and so it's easy to make
that sort of report and all the data is
there in the database of all the things
that people have worked on and and it
actually Milan even keeps track of how
much time you spent working on each of
the bugs if you turn that option on I
mean you don't want people to spy on you
if you don't want it but you can turn
that option on because of course it
knows how long that task was active when
it was activated when it was deactivated
and so you know basically how long each
person each person spent on each one of
the bugs and so you got all that data
there
so you could easily build a burndown
chart but it's not in in this version of
Milan yep I didn't bother an email test
context because I just used the the
repository to share them all they're
just zipped up files binary files so I
suppose you could mail them around but
you'd have to go and extract them from
the repository
there's no they're not made into
first-class citizens that you can drop
into a mail message you know when you
say share it it just attaches it to the
task you're working on post it out to
the database when I get a longer
presentation of a knowledge right so the
thing that's not going to happen is if
someone made a big refactoring while you
were away
it doesn't refactor your task context as
well right which i think is what you're
asking and I suppose that that the Milan
guys could add that because the latest
Java refactoring stuff that was put in
actually I believe last year's Europa
release of Eclipse includes some deltas
in the refactoring it keeps a track of a
basically an audit log of all the
refactorings it applied so it can't be
good
so you could actually take the that
Delta stream and apply it to the context
which obviously keeps track of you know
where where it is in the tree so you
could apply it all and do that they
haven't that's about all I can say yeah
yeah so there it does store it in the
meta directory of your workspace it has
a bunch of information about tasks
you've chosen and private things that
you don't want to make public so for
instance your particular schedule of
when you've decided to work on things
like some day is stored locally and not
in the public repository because as
they've made the decision that that's
not something that I want to broadcast
to the world that I keep delaying this
particular task because I find it
unpleasant right so yeah it does have a
local repository of a bunch of files but
it's just a bunch of files it's not even
a sequel database or anything yeah
you can just copy it that's one thing
and there's also a command in Milan to
back it up I just have a cron job that
just copies it every night and then I'm
safe
you can in the new release that came out
just tomorrow so that's one of those
scheduling things you can actually share
your metadata between workspaces I would
say that it's probably more of a late
beta early gamma feature because it's
brand-new but yes that is now available
because there are people like you who
had to do that as opposed to the
development the myelin development team
who only works in one workspace ever you
know so yeah
so we want to share context doesn't mean
that you have to have your projects live
within your workspace it's in our
environment we don't have our projects
there SourceTree doesn't live within
your workspace itself it's outside of
your workspace location disk for
everybody want to share it with you yeah
it does it by the resource thing on the
side so I'm pretty sure that the with
the names I mean I don't know because I
haven't tried that but I'm pretty sure
that because the names are the same
it'll work but it'll be an interesting
experiment my project name and then
research that I need there rather than
full well I think that's the way it
keeps it internally is what I'm saying I
don't think they keep the file locations
because then it wouldn't work between
different machines right because you
know my home directory and that
workspace then it would work I'm
wondering if you give it to require you
need to have your project live within
your workspace well so the projects have
to live within the workspace no matter
where you store them on the disk right
because otherwise the resource Explorer
won't work so in that sense they do live
within the workspace but the question is
where do you keep them on the disk and I
don't think that matters for my land
although I can't guarantee that because
I've never actually tried that no that's
not true I actually do have a couple
cases where I keep the files in a
different location on my disk and it
does work so I'm pretty sure that would
work yeah
so um right you I think your question is
how many other plugins do I have to load
in order to load Milan is that what you
saying
that seems to be a good story about
oh I see yeah um I have some slides at
the end of the talk but I'm a lot less
capable of giving that part of the talk
than Mick is because I didn't write any
of the code so we can mumble about it
but probably your best bet is to
actually talk to those guys directly and
ask them how their new babies are and
then you know get the architecture
details I do know that one of the things
they've done very tried very hard to do
is the core Milan and is is separate
from each of the adapters so the adapter
for Bugzilla is a separate plugin from
the adapter for JIRA which is a separate
plugin from the adapter for each of the
other systems that it attaches to so
when you load up Milan for your
particular version of Eclipse you select
the set of a the set of plugins that's
going to work for this the tools that
you have so it's sort of this model
where instead of having to force one
central authority for everything you
just sort of attach to all the different
types of repositories code tasks and so
on that you can you can interface with
but that's not the question you asked so
yeah
integrating
you're tracking and you can actually you
know the making it easier when new
people come on so in order to in order
to make full workspace provisioning
possible from Milan would be like almost
no effort at all because Eclipse already
has one or two depending on how you
count at other projects that do
workspace provisioning the one I happen
to use is Buckminster and you can give
it a specification and it goes and finds
all the patient projects and all the
dependencies that you need to load up
into your workspace to make it possible
so if you wanted to extend Milan to do
that you just make it so that in
addition to all the other things on the
task there might be a little additional
thing which is provisioning me a new
workspace for this particular task and
so then when someone's working away on a
task in addition to saving the context
it would save away a Buckminster spec
which would allow somebody else to
provision exactly the right set of
projects to do that and integrating
those two together should be very easy
they both have a good set of api's so
very little work I would say on that one
yeah
you effort to make other languages
supported in Milan yeah I don't know
about the UML site it's it's going to
depend a lot on what the model behind
the editor is so one of the reasons that
that Milan works so well with Java is
that the JDT has an excellent model of
the Java program in the background that
it can use to walk over its degree of
interest model and build up that context
so if you had a language oh right for
another one of these tomorrow releases
is that the CDT has a model as well so
that you so that Milan had can now
integrate with that and walk over it
some of the language specific editors I
was using them one of the pearl ones not
an eclipse one but it's Eclipse plug-in
and I noticed that it's really is just
storing as a text string behind the
scenes as an editor so it doesn't have a
good model back there so Milan couldn't
integrate well with it except at the
text file level because it doesn't
there's no way to specify exactly what
I'm interested in when I'm editing that
that Perl file right so it I believe
that it's not that much work if there's
a model behind it computer keeps going
to sleep but that if there's no model
behind it it's basically impossible
right the idea of whether of integrating
it with a visual editor I think I think
that's an interesting question and it's
an interesting question not so much in
the amount of work it would be because
if there's a model behind it which this
probably is for a visual editor it
wouldn't be too much work but the
problem is how do you display a visual
display in a partial form one of the
nice things about me see if we can go to
another screen here oh yeah I'll go to
this screen so one of the nice things
about this display is that it's a tree
and so it's really easy to filter a tree
over here and display something but if
you were displaying like a UML diagram
or something and you want it to filter
out to some particular context I think
there's
interesting question of how do you
reduce that so that it still makes sense
and it can expand back into the larger
thing I just think there's an
interesting you know sort of visual
problem there I don't think the level of
effort is is that great but there's a
sort of a research problem there and I
noticed down here my little taskbar is
busy
synchronizing so on regular basis it
goes out to the database and checks to
see what the current set of tasks are
and so if anything had come up we'd have
some new little blue arrows that pointed
in and you know it just goes out there
and checks and make sure everything is
you know I'm up to date on the tasks in
fact you use the exact same submit
command that you currently use whatever
it is right so I I happen to use CVS
because the Eclipse files are all stored
in CVS so I just go over here and I say
team synchronize our team commit and it
just the myelin integration is
integrated with both the SVN and the CVS
adapters and it takes the task
description and puts it in as the
default comment attaches that set of
changes from the change set in to that
then does it commit right so you don't
have to change your behavior at all
because they've integrated already into
the IDE and that's the neat thing about
Milan is it's got its fingers in
everywhere in the IDE so your behavior
is exactly the same except that you go
over there and press a little purple
button to say I'm working on that task
or press the broom that's pretty much it
right which is why this was a short talk
actually had scheduling fields hmm I
don't actually know but we could look at
the code afterwards and see so I noticed
the next thing on my um on the slides
here is this under the hood little
animation so let me show you the
animation so that you can at least be
entertained by it so the idea is that as
you do some interaction it's got this
context which keeps track of sort of how
interested you are in something so I'm
looking at this method so I'm this
interested in this particular thing
right and then I navigate from there to
the class and so now I'm more interested
in the class and a little less
interested in the method and so
internally Milan is keeping track of
this data structure which keeps track of
how interested I am in certain things
I'm gonna go to the interface and again
I'm more interested in the interface now
less than the class and less so as I as
I navigate around and and work on things
or don't work on things if I haven't
been working on something for quite a
while it drifts away out of my level of
interest because I haven't looked at it
in a while and drops out of the context
so it keeps track of what you're looking
at but one of the things that's
interesting here is that I go back to
the methods and now the method becomes
more interesting and you know I make an
edit to the method so the method is even
more interesting
and let's see I forget what the little
what's the law what's that what's a
little diamond
I can't remember what the diamond is but
the the the thing I wanted to show here
is that it's that this particular thing
which I can't remember off the top just
drive me nuts here yeah yeah
the intuitive is is related to the
method is that what it is
and so you know because it's related
it's part of the it's part of the the
task context right and so things that
are related to it are also part of your
context because they're part of your the
things you might be interested in as you
wander around so the things that are
that you know it's both direct and
indirect interaction and it's the
frequency and reoccurrence of how often
you've talked to you've you've
interacted with that thing that keeps it
in the context so these the degree of
interest model and that context is
constantly being adjusted as you move
around inside that particular task so it
keeps track of really and it does have
really quite a good job of what you're
currently interested in and working on
and I think
um I actually don't believe it measures
time although they could you know
because they keep track of the timestamp
but the reason it doesn't measure time
is because you might go away for a long
period of time because you're
uninterested or you might go away for a
long period of time because in their
case their wife's having a baby and it's
in it's unclear you can't tell from just
the IDE which one of those things is
true and so you know it doesn't use time
it just uses a clickstream instead and
so you you use these thresholds to
define level of interest and you can
actually when you get good at this you
can tweak the various thresholds if you
find that too many things are showing up
in your context or too few things are
showing up in your context you can sort
of tweak these thresholds up and down
I've never had to do this it's it's like
one of these little great geek features
that you know I know I could control the
whole thing but I don't have to well
it's a you know it's a set that's above
zero and then up to zero is just yeah
even with the pixels it's curved okay
yeah and I think I'm going to oh and and
then I should have this this one last
slide here right which is why this whole
thing works besides the fact that it
obviously works because I use it so you
should therefore you should use it so
that's clearly one of the reasons but
there's actually you know a theory
behind this which is that memory comes
in two different forms there's episodic
memory and semantic memory and the
problem when we when we task switch in
and you know do too much context
switching is that we're losing out on
our episodic memory and we're not we're
not keeping that around so that we then
go on to the next task and we lose it
and so what myelin does is it makes
those episodes first class entities and
keeps track of the context where we were
at in that it doesn't help you with the
the semantic memory of you know like
memorizing the multiplication tables
which I had to do because I have gray
hair but maybe kids don't these days
don't have to do that but the point is
that it doesn't help with that type of
memory it helps with the context
switching tasks which
memory of the short-term you know
episodes thing that you go to here you
go to there you'll find that you know
there are certain things in life that
you remember over and over again like I
have very vivid memories of what
happened of where I was and what I was
doing when Challenger exploded on
liftoff right that's the sort of memory
that's not episodic memory that's
semantic memory and I'm always gonna
remember exactly what I was doing when
that happened but you know which set of
files I was working on to work on bug
number 60 you got me right but that's
what my lens for us to remember that
particular piece of just this particular
episode and so there's been a bunch of
research on this and you know they the
mick for his his university research
went out and they they did some user
studies and they verified that it
actually statistically significantly
increases productivity II I'm gonna
believe him I'm not sure exactly how you
do that but then I'm not a PhD and user
studies so and with that I think I've
used up all my time I appreciate you're
all asking questions so it didn't turn
it into a five-minute talk and I'd be
happy answer more later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
