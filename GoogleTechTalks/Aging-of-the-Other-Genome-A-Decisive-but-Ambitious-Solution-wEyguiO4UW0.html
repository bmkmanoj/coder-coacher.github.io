here at Google and today we have a very
interesting speaker
he's already great visiting us for the
third time and it's going to talk about
the aging of the average genome a
decisive but AM business solution and
some tentative alternatives to this and
he's based in Cambridge UK and he's mine
researchers of malucia
Foundation and I think we're gonna have
a very interesting talk here thank you
yes thank you very much for inviting me
back this is the third time that I've
spoken at Google and I must say I enjoy
these talks enormous fellate because
they audiences of course predominantly
not biologists but I know that a lot of
you do have at least a certain amount of
expertise in this sort of thing so I'm
going to find I've usual give a talk
which we tries to be approachable to non
biologists but also to have a certain
amount of depth to it one thing I want
to mention before I start is that since
I was here last the book that I
published over the past couple of years
has come out you all now have a copy
over there
I have a few more of these available to
give away for some small amount of money
if anyone's interested later on it's a
book written very much for a general
audience but without without cutting any
corners on the science really so I'm
certainly hoping that it's the sort of
thing that people of this sort of degree
of expertise will get a lot out of and
it's available on Amazon as well of
course if you feel like thinking about
making your decision so what am I gonna
talk about today well I will try to go
through the following sections in the
tour first of all I'm just going to go
brief recap of the general philosophy
behind the approach that I've developed
over the past several years for
combating aging and this is an approach
called strategies for engineered
negligible senescence which is a hell of
a mouthful and the acronym of senses
rather melt more memorable so I'll just
give a brief recap of that and if
one wants to know a lot more than either
you can ask me afterwards or you can go
and have a look at the video of the talk
that I gave here in May then I'm going
to move on to one particular strand of
sense which is the the main topic of the
talk today I'm going to explain why it's
important for us to worry about
the damage that accumulates during life
in what I call the other genome in the
title of the talk in other words the
mitochondrial DNA then I'm going to look
for awhile at some of the approaches
that various people have looked at for
combating via accumulation of
mitochondrial mutations simply by
eliminating them and restoring the
mitochondrial DNA to a less damaged
state and I'm going to give some reasons
for pessimism with regard to the
possibility of that approach actually
being effective in the foreseeable
future then for the rest of the talk I'm
going to talk about the approach that I
think it's going to be effective which
as you will see it's not so much a
repair strategy a direct repair strategy
but rather especially that's better
called obvi Asian in other words we
basically let's the damage accumulate
but we do some triggering Pokkiri to
make the damage no longer be damaged in
other words to make it harmless okay so
I'm gonna start with this now some of
you may remember if you came to my talk
in May that the first thing I did was to
describe what aging actually is and of
course it's pretty difficult to know
what to do about a phenomenon if you
want to do something about it until you
understand at least a little bit about
what the nature of the phenomenon
actually is so I want to first of all
make sure that a few very basic things
are understood the first thing is we
don't have genes for aging aging is
something that happens by default just
like the aging of a car or a house or
whatever we don't have they have
mechanisms built into the human body
that say that it should actually last
less long than it otherwise would if we
didn't have those mechanisms rather what
we do have is a whole host of anti-aging
machinery built into us that allows us
to live as long as we do and the reason
we have aging at all is simply because
the anti-aging machinery that we have is
not comprehensive so in other words if
evil
had taken the trouble to invent even
more elaborate even more sophisticated
and comprehensive anti-aging machinery
than what we have already then we would
age even more so than we currently do
and we would live even longer and I
think probably the most succinctly that
this has yet been described is what I'm
saying up here that aging is a product
of evolutionary neglect rather than
evolutionary intent that was the way
that colleague and friend of mine
learned hayflick put it some years ago
all right so that's the first thing you
need to appreciate about aging the
second thing is the sort of if you like
causally two-step nature of Aging but
there's an ongoing aspect and there's an
eventual aspect now for the purposes of
this talk I'm going to be using the word
damage in a manner that is essentially
defined by the second and third
sentences here damage is for purposes
today a set of molecular and cellular
side effects of metabolism in other
words side effects of the normal
processes that keep us alive and more or
less intact from one day to the next and
from one year to the next those
metabolic processes incorporate the
creation of a whole bunch of damage as I
mentioned a moment ago most of that
damage is automatically repaired by the
intrinsic canting aging machinery that
we have built into us but some of it
isn't and those things that are not
repaired accumulate and eventually some
of those things that accumulate start to
get in the way of metabolism they start
to cause our metabolism not to work so
well and that's the phenomenon that I'm
well the set of phenomena that I am
grouping under the word pathology
including all of the age-related
diseases that we're so familiar with and
also all of those things that go wrong
with us in old age that we would not
normally call diseases things like
gradual decline of the efficacy of the
immune system loss of muscle mass things
like that and finally of course as
everyone knows whether you're a
biologist or not it's a downward spiral
it's a sort of vicious circle when
pathology starts getting going things
start to go downhill at an accelerating
rate
alright so that's aging and as those of
you who saw my talk in May or who have
seen my work before will be familiar
with this is the essence of the
conclusion that I came to several years
ago and that has dominated my work in
this area ever since what I'm saying
here is
if we accept that there is this chain of
events metabolism causing damage and
damage eventual eventually causing
pathology then we can envision three
different ways in which we might go
about doing something about aging that's
well I'll call it the geriatrics
approach which is to wait until
pathology starts to emerge and then to
try to hold back the sands of time and
stop the pathology from from
accelerating and accumulating as fast as
it normally would and that's fine in
principle it's um it's a way of
postponing the age at which pathology
becomes seriously life-threatening and
problematic but of course it's a losing
battle because the precursors of the
pathology these various types of
molecular and cellular damage are
continuing to accumulate through our
life and therefore the geriatricians
globe is becoming harder and harder
gerontologists tend to start from that
knowledge from the appreciation that the
geriatricians approach is a losing
battle and they say well okay prevention
is better than cure let's get in let's
get stuck into this chain of events at
an earlier stage let's try and clean up
metabolism and make it lay down these
various types of molecular and cellular
damage at a slower rate than it
naturally would that of course will have
the appropriate effect it will delay the
age it will at which damage reaches a
level that causes pathology to emerge
problem with the gerontologist approach
is that yes it's a fine idea in
principle but we just don't understand
metabolism well enough we know pitifully
small amount really about how cells work
let alone how organisms work and the
result is that we end up essentially not
being able to adopt this approach in a
productive manner if we try to interfere
in metabolism than 90% of the time
metabolism just last in our face and
gets gets on and does what it was doing
anyway and the other 10% of the time if
we do actually manage to have the effect
that we want to have we turn out that in
general we'll have a whole bunch of
other effects that we haven't expected
because of the aspects of metabolism
that we don't understand so that's why
the gerontology approaches and
approaches time has not really yet calm
and this led me way back in about 99
2000 to the realization that a third
approach might be the way to go the
engineering approach as I like to call
it I think I was the best of both worlds
because there what I'm saying it we
should do is let
metabolism lay down these various types
of damage at the rate that it naturally
lays them down but then let's go in and
actually repair that damage ongoingly
or periodically so that it doesn't reach
the level of abundance that would cause
pathology to happen and the engineering
approach has the best of both worlds in
the sense that it's sufficiently early
on sufficiently pre-emptive that it
doesn't suffer from the downward spiral
that the geriatricians approach does but
at the same time it's late enough in the
chain of events that it's not actually
interfering in metabolism itself and
therefore it's not attempting to be
cleverer than evolution which is always
a dangerous thing to try to be alright
so I've told you that the basic
philosophy and as I said if you wanna
know more and you know where you can
find it find it out what this main inner
actual practice what is this damage
thing that I've spoken about in the
abstract
well it's quite easy to to see what it
is if we just look at what the human
body's made of it's the body what we may
know we're made of cells and stuff
between cells you know that's a simple
breakdown of what we're made of so what
can damage accumulate in and in what way
well let's think about cells first of
all you can imagine that you could have
the wrong number of some type of style
you could have too many or you could
have too few secondly you could have
cells where you have the right right
number of them but somehow that contents
was inappropriate either they had stuff
in them that you didn't want to have in
them or you had stuff that you do want
but the stuff in question the molecules
inside the cell have been damaged in
some way so we can imagine that in terms
of cell number it's straightforward if
you've got too many as sometimes cell
you just wrapped them somehow if you've
got too few you put them back in and of
course that's what stem cell therapy is
about it's basically putting self back
in when the body isn't doing it on its
own in terms of the contents of the cell
you could think of a cell that's got the
wrong type of contents as being an
example of a subset of having too many
of a particular type of cells you could
just say well I can't exactly cells that
have got the wrong content and replaced
them with other cells that are okay but
it turns out that that's not always a
convenient option because the cells in
question may be rather hard to replace
so it may be actually easier in some
cases to replace repair the cells rather
than to replace them
and if they've just got stuff in them
that you don't don't want you can get
rid of that stuff in digestibility or
garbage basically if alternatively this
things in the cell that you do want but
those molecules have been damaged then
you've got to do something else
ideally you'd like to be able to repair
the changes that have to reverse the
changes that have happened to these
molecules in the cell
maybe however you will need to maybe the
molecules have have undergone changes
that are not actually pathogenic or at
least not within what we think of as a
currently normal lifetime and there are
in fact a few examples of changes to the
contents of the cell which seem to fall
into that category well we just don't
need to worry about them because the
change happens too slowly it doesn't
actually cause anything any any problem
for metabolism so those are two options
but there's a third option which is
going to be rather important for this
talk which is what I'm calling obvi a
ssin the idea here is simply that okay
the damage it happens and it's bad for
us
it causes pathology in the end the idea
is to make some little tweak to the role
of this particular molecule in the cell
such that the type of change that's
happening to it suddenly becomes a
harmless change when previously it would
be a harmful one and that sounds a
little bit like hand wavy but you'll see
that that's actually a genuinely real
option in in real circumstances and I'll
come to you shortly
oh and then finally of course when we
talk about stuff between cells that's
basically the same deal as stuff inside
cells either you get rid of it if it's
not wanted or you can repair it if it's
damaged same deal really okay so that's
basically the essence of how I look at
how to go about combating aging and I'm
gonna talk now about the mitochondrial
DNA and I'm gonna actually go back one
slide and explain why I'm gonna do that
yep so what can your DNA is DNA inside
the mitochondrion the mitochondrion is
inside the cell so in other words it
falls into this category down here
damage that happens to the mitochondrial
DNA is damage to something that's inside
the cell and we don't want to get rid of
the mitochondrial DNA we need it we want
to fix it if we can but there are these
various options as I said can we ignore
it are going to be answering that
question in the moment can we repair it
I'm going to be having a look at some
options for that
and then can we obviate it alright so
first of all can we ignore it and the
answer is going to be no here's why what
damage do we need to repair damage that
we need to repair in other words damage
that we can't afford to ignore is damage
that contributes to pathology in a
normal lifetime and of course if not
repaired automatically by their existing
in inbuilt anti-aging processes now
another way of answering this question
is that the damage you need to repair is
damage that happens to long lives
molecules and the particular molecules
whose function in the cell is essential
this is about a short live molecule
let's say a protein a protein is
constructed in the cell and you have
some job to do it does the job for a
while and then it gets damaged in some
way let's say it gets oxidized in some
way alright so what that happens well in
general what happens if the protein will
simply be broken down and the undamaged
amino acids that the protein contains
will be reused in some other proteins
and the damaged ones will be excreted
now that means that the damage isn't
accumulating the damage is gone so that
cannot count as damage by the very
narrow strict definition that I'm using
for this talk
the only molecules in which damage
actually matters are molecules that are
not broken down and recycled but
molecules that live for the last time of
the cell and the obvious example of
course is DNA in fact really we can say
that there are only two types of
molecule that we that classified at
qualify as damage in this way well if
DNA and the other is indigestible
molecules I mentioned ingestible
molecules earlier on things that the
cell creates usually by accident but
then when it wants to break them down it
finds if it hasn't got the enzymes to do
it somehow for whatever reason the
molecule is over type that the machinery
that it has to break things down doesn't
work on and sometimes for various
reasons cells will not want to X creat
the molecules in question into the
environment either so molecules like
this can accumulate inside the cell and
those things cause a whole bunch of
other problems if you want to know more
about that then read chapter 9 of the
book or come to my next talk which
hasn't matured you'll get you understand
but anyway so that's one thing that goes
wrong but
is the main thing that accumulates
damage that we have to do something
about another mentioned there are two
genomes in our cells one is the genome
that we're all very familiar with that
consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes and
a very large number of base pairs and
the other is the mitochondrial DNA which
is present in between a few hundred and
a few thousand copies depending on the
type of cell in most in nearly all of
ourselves and which is much much smaller
who are sitting near the front we'll be
able to see here the number one fell
sixteen thousand five hundred and
sixty-nine that is the number of base
pairs in the mitochondrial DNA of the
human of humans so in other words it's
absolutely minut fraction of the size of
the nuclear genome and indeed there are
only thirteen proteins encoded in the
mitochondrial DNA this is a dream map of
the mitochondrial DNA everything except
this little bit up at the top here
encodes something or other these two
little gap little things over here
encode RNA molecules that do not encode
proteins and all the other ones encode
proteins except for the few little tiny
things in here which are transfer RNA
genes so it's very very small indeed and
that turns out to be quite convenient as
you'll see so i mentioned first of all
can we actually ignore damage to the
mitochondrial DNA or do we have to do
something about it well the first thing
we can say is that unfortunately it does
accumulate damage it's pretty easy to
demonstrate that older people have more
mutations in their mitochondrial DNA
than younger people does the damage
matter well I have to be honest with you
here and tell you that at the moment
biologists do not know for absolutely
sure in certain whether or not
mitochondrial mutations actually matter
in a currently normal lifetime but it
looks as though they probably do there's
lots of correlative evidence lots of
circumstantial evidence that suggests
that indeed these things do matter and
that's bad enough to be interesting I
take the view that it's not appropriate
to spend too much of our time gazing
into our navels and trying to work out
whether such and such a phenomenon
actually matters in aging or not it's
actually better to go out and damn well
address the
problem even if we don't know that it's
the problem if we end up fixing a few
things that we find out in the end we
didn't need to fix no real harm done
whereas if we spend too long not doing
anything because we're too worried about
whether something matters or not then we
may actually delay progress so this is
sort of evidence that exists that shows
that mitochondrial mutations may
seriously matter and what this basically
shows is that mitochondrial mutations
are not distributed evenly across tissue
what what what's been done in this slide
is someone's taken a chunk of skeletal
muscle and sliced it perpendicular to
the muscle fibers so the reach of these
circular things is a cross-section
through a muscle fiber and then they
stained it for the activity of an enzyme
called cytochrome C oxidase which is one
of the enzymes that a sum of some of
these subunits are encouraged by the
mitochondrial DNA so if the
mitochondrial DNA is damaged then the
cytochrome C oxidase enzyme is not going
to be constructed now what we see here
is that there are entire muscle fibers
well muscle fiber segments any way in
which there is no starts grunts the
oxidase activity I told you happen to go
that there are hundreds of copies of the
mitochondrial DNA in each cell in the
muscle fiber there are thousands per
millimeter of the length of the muscle
fiber and they've all or more or less
all anyway lost the ability to make this
enzyme or otherwise there would be
activity being shown here for this
enzyme in these in these particular
muscle fibers and their art so what
we've actually got here is somehow cells
or muscle fiber segments being entirely
taken over by mutant mitochondrial DNA
whereas the neighboring cell is
perfectly fine and does not have a
detectable deficiency of mitochondrial
DNA so that's a pretty interesting thing
it allows the possibility that these
cells even though they are relatively
rare in even in old people are
nevertheless toxic or in some way
poisoning the rest of the body and a lot
of my work back in the late 90s was
actually focused on the detailed
mechanisms for that and I'm going to
talk about that today now I said earlier
on that when there is a molecule in a
cell that's damaged we have a couple of
options if we decide that we have to do
damage-wise to repair the damage and
actually restore the molecule to struck
the structure it had an earlier age and
the other is to obviate their problem so
I'm going to look at repair first of all
now there are various options for how to
go about repairing the mitochondrial DNA
and the most obvious one of course is
just to take new copies of the
mitochondrial DNA that are not damaged
that have the normal unmuting sequence
and introduced them in large numbers
into the body especially into the cells
that have been affected have been taken
over by mutant mitochondrial DNA and
that sounds like a dang good idea
it sounds pretty tricky you know getting
molecules that there are 16,000 base
pairs long into cells in the body is a
lot more ambitious than most gene
therapy but various techniques have been
tried over the past 10 12 years and
actually at this point it would be
premature to dismiss out of hand the
possibility that we could do this so
this is something that we might usefully
think about but there's a big big
problem with using this to tackle the
phenomenon of mitochondrial DNA mutation
accumulation and the problem is that the
reason we have this punked age
distribution where some cells are
accumulating mitochondrial mutations and
others are not is because when a
mutation happens in a one copy of the
mitochondrial DNA in a set in a cell it
seems at least sometimes that that copy
somehow gets a selective advantage it
gets replicated more often than the rest
of the mitochondrial DNA and you have a
phenomenon which is called clonal
expansion of the mutant mitochondrial
DNA at the expense of the non mutant
I've got a picture of how we found those
sort of things out those of you who know
better biology will recognize this as
something called a southern blot which
is a way of determining whether what
essentially a way of determining the
length of a particular chunk of DNA and
what this is showing to cut a long story
short is that if you take a whole chunk
of a whole number of muscle fiber
segments and you look at the DNA that's
in them there's
while the left is a control sort of
measurement purposes if you look at the
amount of DNA it might a control DNA in
these things and you asked what length
is it then
most of these self has all the same
length of this particular segment of the
mitochondrial DNA showing that
essentially if they've got any changes
to the mitochondrial DNA then the
changes are not changing the length
there will be point mutations of one
sort or another whereas these three have
got different lengths for that
particular chunk of DNA indicating that
the some DNA missing and as you can see
there's just one particular length in
this cell there's none of the normal
length there's also none of any other
length it's not a smear they're showing
a range of different lengths it's just
one length and a different length in a
different cell this is the sort of thing
that was discovered way back about a
decade ago and discovered to be
absolutely Universal in this that you
get this clonal expansion of single
mutations now that's really bad news for
the idea of putting back new copies of
the normal mitochondrial DNA because if
you put them back yes the cell that you
got that you put them into may be happy
for a short while but only a short while
because they wild-type the non mutant
mitochondrial DNA that you have
introduced will go the same way that the
original mitochondrial DNA did it will
be eliminated in favor of the wild-type
mitochondrial of the mutant
mitochondrial DNA and the exact
mechanism for this clonal expansion is
still a matter of debates even though
people have put forward a large number
of theories of this over the years but
it redoes matter what the mechanism is
the fact is it happens and therefore
replacing the mitochondrial DNA seems to
be a bit of a non-starter well here's
another possibility okay there's this
clonal expansion going on why don't we
try and introduce impose superpose so we
say on that phenomenon a reverse
phenomenon in other words why don't we
just make it really hard for the
mitochondrial DNA that's mutant to
actually be replicated so that
essentially we impose a selective
advantage for the non mutant
mitochondrial DNA that would outweigh
that without paste so to speak they
select the natural selective advantage
that the mutant DNA
variances and people have been trying to
do that actually a group for Newcastle
have been really leading the way they
found some very weird analogs of DNA
that are able to bind to DNA in a way
that stops it from being replicated and
these molecules are sequence specific so
you can actually introduce these
molecules into cells that have a
particular mutation and the mutant
mitochondrial DNA won't be replicated
and the wild-type any what any residual
wild-type mitochondrial DNA that's left
will replicate instead and the cell will
be restored to some sort of
mitochondrial health and that's a pretty
good idea in principle but there are a
couple of things wrong with it as well
first of all I've shown you already that
even though in each individual cell
there is a clonal expansion of just one
particular mutant sequence nevertheless
in the next cell that's affected
there'll be a different mutation that's
clonally expanded so in other words a
single DNA analog that's stopping the
replication of a single sequence will
not be very much used in terms of
combating the accumulation of mutant
mitochondrial DNA in aging there's also
the second problem which I could go into
details about later if you want but
basically that it's possible that you'll
end up making cells that have no
mitochondrial DNA at or whether it be
mutant or non mutant and that's just as
bad as having entirely mutant
mitochondrial DNA so anyway the long and
short of it is this really doesn't work
however it turns out that one shouldn't
give up a couple of years ago some
friends of mine working in Virginia came
up with a very creative idea which has a
good deal more promising which is
essentially to combine the two ideas
that I've just told you a hopeless into
an idea that's not quite so hopeless the
idea here is we again introduce
mitochondrial DNA that's working that
that does include all the 13 proteins
it's supposed to but we mess around with
it in such a way that it destroys the
DNA that it comes across that's there
naturally well what the method that
they've used to make this happen is by
introducing into the mitochondrial DNA
something called a restriction enzyme
gene such that the DNA doesn't only
encode the 13 proteins it normally would
it also makes this thing called a
restriction enzyme which is something
that
cuts DNA and it considered a specific
sequence and the trip that we've used
was to use a restriction enzyme that
cuts a sequence that actually does occur
in normal mitochondrial DNA preferably a
couple of times so that both normal
mitochondrial DNA and more or less any
mutant version of mitochondrial DNA will
be destroyed will be cut up by this
restriction enzyme that the new DNA
encodes and the way that the thing has
been made to work is by altering the the
engineered mitochondrial DNA so that not
only does it encode this restriction
enzyme but also the places where it
would normally be cut by that
restriction enzyme has been modified so
that it's no longer a substrate for the
enzyme so the enzyme doesn't cut it
anymore so this is a sort of invasive
mitochondrial DNA molecule it's an
incredibly clever idea and the most
amazing thing is they've more or less
got it working but it's also rather
preliminary most of this work hasn't
been published yet so I can't tell you
all that much about it at this point
however this is the name they've given
to it proto fection so if you come
across that in the papers any time then
you'll know what it's all about another
approach to all of this that shouldn't
be just missed out of hand is something
that I alluded to towards the beginning
of the talk which was that we could
actually replace the cells we could
actually zap the cells that are affected
by mitochondrial mutations and put new
ones back and that's not completely
ridiculous but unfortunately there are
some problems with it the first problem
is that the cells that are mainly
affected by this ourselves that are
actually not very easy to replace muscle
fibers I've told you about also neurons
in the brain maybe we could use stem
cell therapies to replace this but it's
a bit of a tall order and it's a
particularly tall order for skeletal
muscle because it turns out that in
skeletal muscle if you try to kill just
a small segment of a fiber that's been
overtaken by mitochondrial mutations for
example then you're very likely to kill
the whole fiber because of separating it
from its motor neuron and that's
something that we'll probably do more
harm than good so I don't have very much
optimism for that approach either
all right so what I've told you so far
is that there are a whole variety of
different ways that we might go about
combating the mitochondrial DNA mutation
problem by repairing it and they all
look well maybe some of them might work
maybe some of them won't but it's all a
little bit iffy it would be nice if we
had an approach that was a little
cleaner and we might have one and that's
what I'm going to spend the rest of this
talk discussing it's an operation
approach in other words what it's going
to be about is let mitochondrial
mutations accumulate don't try and
repair them just make them harmless so
how do we do this well first of all we
have to ask what does the mitochondrial
DNA encode I told you it encodes 13
proteins I haven't told you what those
proteins do what they do is they are
part of the machinery that does the
chemistry of breathing that is oxidative
phosphorylation the process that
combines electrons from nutrients like
carbohydrates and fats combines those
electrons with oxygen to make
essentially water and in doing so it's
extract energy from those nutrients and
makes ATP which is of course the
universal currency of energy within the
cell that allows us to do all the other
things we do like protein synthesis and
DNA replication and whatever now ox last
is something that we're not going to end
up being able to do without we need ox
bus because you know if we couldn't make
ATP in the amounts that ox for stars
then we basically wouldn't be able to do
most of the things we do so we could in
principle make a sort of substitute
process that did what oxidative
phosphorylation does but that is an
unimaginably tall order oxidative
phosphorylation has only been invented
once in the whole of evolution it's a
very elaborate system we ain't going to
reinvent it one possibility is that we
could look at some of the components of
oxidative phosphorylation the components
that are incurred by the mitochondrial
DNA and in some way create substitutes
for them and there is one there are one
or two options along those lines that
well I haven't time to discuss now but
that involve essentially going and
looking at what other species do some
other species have found ways to do
without certain components of the
oxidative phosphorylation machinery and
it's been
any way that we might be able to exploit
those tricks but that's the we're
probably not going to be able to solve
the whole problem that way so they
approach that I want to look at in more
detail if the bottom one here the idea
that yes we need ox fast yes we need to
encode up to create ox fast using the
same machinery as usual but let's make
that machinery let's introduce that
machinery in some other way that does
not rely on the mitochondrial DNA and
that turns out not to be completely
implausible
so I mentioned already that the
mitochondrial genome is very small that
it's only about 16 and a half kilobases
long and that it only encodes 13
proteins well I haven't mentioned yet is
that the mitochondria in itself is a
really really complicated machine in
which there are at least a thousand
protein thousand different proteins all
the others are already encoded in genes
in the nucleus of ourselves in our
normal genome so this is a graphical
summary of how mitochondria are
constructed you've got a normally now up
here and you've got a mitochondrial
genome here the mitochondrial genome
encodes 13 proteins and the nucleic we
know apart from all the non
mitochondrial proteins that it obviously
also encode it encodes maybe a thousand
or so proteins that are part of the
mitochondrion there's a machinery in the
membrane in the surface of the
mitochondrion which imports those
proteins that are encoded in the nuclear
genome into the mitochondrion so that
they're in the right place just as if
they had been encoded in the
mitochondrial genome in the first place
and then there's a whole bunch of
complicated process of assembly of those
proteins into various complexes and so
on to make the extremely intricate
machine that we call the mitochondria so
mitochondrial biogenesis comes from two
different genomes now here are some
convenient facts the first thing I've
just mentioned to you is that something
like 99% of mitochondrial proteins are
encoded in the nucleus not in the
mitochondrial DNA second thing is that
that's actually true for ox for as well
the oxidative phosphorylation machinery
in the mitochondrion is only one of the
things that mitochondria do but it can't
eat confess' of perhaps
a hundred odd Oh coming like 80 proteins
so something in the region of 80% of the
proteins that are parts of the ox force
machinery are already nuclear coded now
here is the really useful fact the
really convenient fact the nuclear DNA
does not accumulate mutations anything
like as fast as the mitochondrial DNA
now exactly why that's the case is a
matter of some speculation I think that
it's got a great deal to do with the
fact that mutations in the nuclear
genome can give us cancer even if they
affect just one cell and they can kill
us that way whereas mutations in the
mitochondrial genome can't give us
cancer and so therefore they can only
kill us if quite a few cells get
affected and the talk I gave here in
June was an elaboration of my views on
cancer and how we are going to go about
it that also is of course online if
anyone wants to know more about it but
anyway the fact is that the nuclear DNA
is much much better protected it
accumulates mutations much more slowly
we know I've told you that this this
machinery in the surface of the
mitochondrion VAS imports proteins from
the outside onto the inside of the
mitochondrion so that they can be
assembled into the mitochondrial
structure and we understand the
machinery the the protein import
machinery pretty well it tends to be
called the timtom complex believe it or
not translocase of the inner
mitochondrial membrane translocate of
the automatic on your membrane
another useful thing that I'll come back
to in a minute is that nearly all the
mutations that we actually see in the
mitochondrial DNA in normal aging
mutations are the type that knock out
all thirteen proteins so you don't have
mutations that cause the construction of
bad proteins it's either good proteins
or no proteins that seem to be a very
useful fact so what does all that add up
to in terms of a proposal well this is
what it adds up to and this is a
proposal that was first put forward back
in the mid-1980s actually and it's
called ala topic expression the idea is
that we take these thirteen James from
the mitochondrial DNA and we modify them
in various ways so that the proteins
that they encode
if those proteins found themselves on
the outside of the mitochondrion would
be imported into the inside just like
the thousand proteins that are naturally
imported in that way having made those
modifications to these 13 genes we put
the modified engineered genes into the
nuclear genome using standard methods -
in therapy transfection whatever
depending on what you're doing now
what's the effect of that going to be
well the first effect is that these
these genes these proteins that the
genes are creating will be harmless to
healthy mitochondria you may think well
maybe they'll be too much of some
proteins in the mitochondrion turns out
that the mitochondrion is really good at
coping with flexibility on that so
that's not a problem secondly once a
mitochondrion does end up being mutant
it won't matter anymore because the
proteins that the mitochondrion is no
longer making on its own because it's
mitochondrial DNA is no longer making
proteins those proteins will be arriving
from the outside of the mitochondrion
and so the mitochondrion will be able to
assemble its oxidative phosphorylation
machinery just the same way that it ever
was able to when it had the proteins and
here's the real kicker there's a hell of
a lot that we don't know about the
detailed way in which the various
oxidative phosphorylation enzyme
complexes work and how they're assembled
and all that sort of thing but we don't
need to know any of that in order for
this approach to work because what we're
doing is we're putting the same proteins
into the same place that they naturally
are so that the machinery for assembling
them into complexes and making them
function in the normal way can be
absolutely unaltered and because that
all that machinery is already encoded in
the nucleus that none of that machinery
is going to be broken in a mutant
mitochondrial so it all just ought to
work irrespective of the things we don't
know this is in other words a classic
case of an engineer's approach to
anything really you know sidestepping
our ignorant sidestepping the things
that we don't know so this is
essentially what it comes down to going
back to the picture I showed you before
this is the standard situation and
rather than relying on the mitochondrial
DNA to make these 13 proteins we take
the genes we do some molecular biology
to them we stick the modified genes back
into the nuke
so that a few more proteins are
constructed in the cytosol in the
outside of the cell inside of the cell
phone and in point into the inside of
the mitochondrion so they work normally
a lot of people have been skeptical
about this proposal over the years
including before I even got involved in
this but all of the proposals that have
been put forward for why this won't work
have been shown to be flawed in fact a
little bit a lot of them didn't even
need to be shown to be floor that we
just obviously flawed things like for
example the mitochondria uses a
different genetic code so certain code
on certain Triplets of nucleotides mean
a different thing in the mitochondrion
than they do in the nuclear DNA that's
something that's trivial for us as
molecular biologists to alter totally to
reverse in the process of making our
engineered genes so it's something that
evolution would find a find to be a big
barrier in spontaneously naturally
moving these genes to the to the nucleus
but we don't have a problem with it at
all well some people have said that
maybe if these proteins were constructed
in the outside of the mitochondrion in
the main body of the cell then there
would be toxic in some way but actually
people have been looking pretty hard for
evidence of that and they haven't found
any but some toxicity if you make much
too much of the protein so that it a
grenades and generally gets in the way
of stuff but if you make a sensible
amount no one's found any took this day
at all some people say well actually
maybe the problem is that the machinery
that targets proteins to the
mitochondrion doesn't actually work
perfectly on these particular proteins
and it will miss target them especially
people were worried that it would target
them to the cell surface again that
seems to be completely not true people
have I said been worried as I said
they've been worried about the
possibility of having too much of some
proteins relative to others and lots of
experiments have shown that actually the
mitochondrion is really good at coping
with a wide variation in the relative
abundance of different proteins and
getting rid of the ones that are present
in excess and so on so that's no problem
and then finally some well some
basically some some botanists in general
who were looking at chloroplasts and
extrapolating from them have put forward
a proposal when I talk about what this
stands for but essentially it's an
alternative reason why evolution has
and done the job for us and put these
games into the nucleus already and it's
a well it's again it's a completely
broken proposal um so in the last part
of the talk I wanted to discuss how far
we've actually got with this so far it's
all a nice trendy idea but the question
you'd probably like to know is is it
going anywhere and I mentioned that the
idea was first put forward 20 years ago
so you may be thinking well it can't be
that easy can it and you're right it's
not that easy but progress was made
early on in fact the main reason why
people got interested in it was because
when some when when this was first
attempted the first gene out of the 13
that people tried it on they got it
working first time in like only a couple
of years the this group from Australia
took one gene which happens to be a very
small one that turned out to be rather
important and they put it into the
nucleus and they would they were able to
show that it was really working they
found they created a strain of yeast in
which the mitochondrial copy of this
dream was completely broken and all the
other dreams all the other 12 games were
working okay and they got they said that
this nuclear relocated version of this
one gene was able to rescue oxidative
phosphorylation in this yeast they tried
it with another gene that with a bit
bigger and they couldn't get to work
that was a few years later and that was
the beginning of a period of
extraordinary inactivity in this area
where basically people couldn't get any
funding for it because everyone thought
it was far too hard and people
essentially got discouraged
there was one isolated breakthrough a
few years ago after a very long time a
group in Bethesda succeeded in getting
one of getting a bigger key in to work
and furthermore it was in mammalian
cells so it was very interesting but
that hasn't yet been reproduced and a
couple of other papers that came out
around the same time from a group in New
York and a group in Florida and which
also looked very promising have now been
shown to have been basically
misinterpreting their data they that
they thought they were seeing successful
function of these genes in mammalian
cells when in fact they weren't so it
all didn't look
fairly good but that one isolated
experiment from Bethesda was something
that was really very promising indeed it
was very direct evidence that it was
really working this is the key figure
from the paper that they published um in
which essentially what they were able to
do was to show that whereas normal cells
whose mitochondria DNA is functioning
perfectly
are able to grow like this until they
get up to a level of density of the
cells in culture where something called
contact inhibition happens and the cells
stop growing because they're too close
to each other so that's substandard
curve for healthy cells that you're
seeing there on a log scale you'll note
you've got these cells here the ones on
with the with the open circles which are
cells whose mitochondrial gene is not
working and which grow for a little
while but eventually just give up
because they can't make any ATP and then
the important one is this this one here
with the open triangles where they take
a little while to get going but once
they do they grow nearly as fast as the
cells that have their mitochondrial DNA
working these of course other cells that
have that mitochondrial DNA mutant but
that have the nuclear version of the
thing so this was a very robust rescue
of mitochondrial function from this
nuclear this relocated gene that was
pretty good news so then well what's the
problem why has it taken 20 years to get
anywhere and why is progress still so
patchy there's a one-word answer because
this hydrophobicity it turns out that
the process of getting proteins from the
outside of a mitochondrion to the inside
is non-trivial it needs to be done in a
manner that preserves the integrity of
the mitochondrial membranes if the
mitochondrial membrane is punctured then
it collapses the electrochemical
gradient across the membrane and that
electrochemical gradient is an intrinsic
component of the way that mitochondria
work in the first place how they
actually create ATP from nutrients but
it's also a critical component of the
way that the machinery works for getting
the proteins across at all so basically
the machinery that gets proteins across
the membrane
has to get this enormous molecule a
protein is obviously a seriously large
molecule has to get it across without
letting protons across charge across and
protons of course are pretty tricky to
hold back if you've got a big hole in
your membrane so it turns out that the
way that the machinery does this is by
unfolding the protein completely and
that's something that hydrophobic
proteins proteins that have a lot of
amino acids that really like not to be
next to water
how do phobic pleasures just don't like
to do that they like to fold up into a
globular state minimize the surface
exposed to water and they just refused
to unfold so it turns out that all
thirteen of the proteins that are
encoded in the mitochondrial DNA I like
that they're really hard to unfold and
sometimes you can just by sheer force
get the thing to go and that's why that
one tiny protein in yeast was
successfully relocated in the mid-80s
but this is in general a that's very
hard indeed so the question is well has
evolution given us any clues and yes the
answer is that it has the first thing
that's rather good news to know is that
there is a certain amount of variation
of hydrophobicity in the normal human
population it's important for proteins
that need to be imported into the
mitochondrion not to be too hydrophobic
or the machinery won't work as I
mentioned but it doesn't matter how hard
to fur back the proteins are naturally
occuring the mitochondrial DNA and so of
course what's happened is that they are
if you like unnecessarily hydrophobic
and minor changes reducing the
hydrophobicity can be made without
actually affecting the function of the
protein that's shown quite graphically
here so the blue line is that what's
called the hydropathy plus the degree of
hydrophobicity along the length of one
of these thirteen proteins so the peaks
the work that they the high parts of the
thing are the most hydrophobic amino
acids there were two hydrophobic regions
of the protein and as you can see there
are a few Peaks which correspond to the
most hydrophobic parts of the protein
now there's a ton of algae called
chlamydomonas reinhardt di which happens
to have succeeded in transferring this
particular gene to the nucleus it's the
only species that has more or less and
as you can see the purple line which is
the hydropathy
for this protein in that species is a
good deal lower the hydrophobicity is
lowering all the places where it's it
was particularly high originally but if
we look at the wide variety of different
sequences of human mitochondrial DNA
that have been put into the database
over the past 20 or 30 years we find
that actually there is a quite a lot of
variation so this red line is a sort of
artificial human mitochondrial sequence
constructed using the least hydrophobic
protein amino acids across the whole
protein and you can see especially at
this beginning of the protein if you
take the least hydrophobic amino acids
everywhere you can get to a situation
that's pretty much the same
hydrophobicity as the climate demureness
mitochondrial gene much less hydrophobic
than the classical sequence
unfortunately you can see that elsewhere
along the protein it's not so good in
this point for example you could only
reduce the hydrophobicity a little bit
not nearly as much as you could in the
in the chlamydomonas sequence but maybe
we don't have to reduce the
hydrophobicity by that much or at least
not everywhere so this could be progress
furthermore as I mentioned this is only
human polymorphisms things that are
actually seen in natural human
populations it may be that if we allow
ourselves to go a little bit further out
phylogenetically
looking at other mammals for example
it'll still be okay we'll still get
sequences that are function that still
function that still do the job but we
may be able to find more reductions of
the hydrophobicity and that's what was
found here the human sequences in yellow
and the Clemmie domesticus is again in
purple the black sequence is the best
you can do using any mammalian
polymorphism and as you can see here in
this peak for example we're still more
hydrophobic than the Chlamydomonas
sequence but much closer to it than we
were in the previous slide all right so
that's pretty good news that's certainly
a way to go we could just create
versions of these genes that were
somewhat less hydrophobic than normal
and we would have a respectable chance
of being able to do that without
compromising the function of the genes
but it turns out that there is an even
more promising approach there are
various times in which it seems that the
hydrophobicity of a protein doesn't
matter as much as you thought too so to
speak
first of all in chloroplasts
chloroplasts are organelles of course in
plant cells which are very like
mitochondria they have their own DNA
they have a lot of proteins that are
encoded in the nucleus as well but a lot
of people have said well that they
provide counter examples to this whole
hypothesis for why mitochondrial genes
are actually still in existence but
there are good reasons why that doesn't
actually count essentially there
topology is different they do things
with electrochemical gradients that are
on membranes that do not surround the
chloroplast DNA so this really isn't
irrelevant even though it's been pointed
to a lot there are some genes that we
have that are very hydrophobic but our
nuclear code in anyway and it turns out
that they've invented a completely
different way of being imported using a
different version of the timtom complex
which is thought 7:22 and some people
have thought well maybe we could use
that as a way of getting these teams
getting these proteins across turns out
there are reasons why that's probably
not going to work but the biggest and
most interesting thing about which
proteins get across successfully is that
when they've only got one big
hydrophobic segments then that doesn't
seem to stop them getting across it's
only if the protein has lots of
hydrophobic segments that there seems to
be a problem and that's pretty strange
because the process of import is
something that you know happens the
thing gets pulled through as a single
amino acid chain you wouldn't think that
having more than one transmembrane
domain would would make a difference and
we've now found out what's going on it
all comes down to a bizarre phenomenon
called Coke translational import which
was discovered even back before anyone
started thinking about how the topic
expression 35 or so years ago we still
really don't know how it works in fact
we don't know the basics of how it works
it turns out that it's really rather
common it looks as though it might be
the big solution for importing things
even if they have lot
two transmembrane domains all right so
what is coach translational import well
as you all know when a protein is made
the first thing that happens is that the
DNA is transcribed into RNA messenger
RNA and then that RNA is translated by
the ribosome into a protein
now what I've told you so far is that a
lot in fact 99% of the proteins in a
mitochondrion are encoded in the
mitochondrial DNA and then the protein
is targeted to the mitochondrion and
dragged through the mud a corneal
membrane and for a long time it was
presumed that that was the whole story
that the messenger RNA was constructed
in the nucleus like all messages are was
exploited into the cytosol and son sonic
ribosomes will decide to do it and make
the protein then the protein would be
translocated to the mitochondrion and
that's the scenario that's being shown
on the left here where you've got these
things these are ribosomes tracking
along this like this this thread here
which is the messenger RNA and the
protein is being created these are each
of these amino acid being created
gradually eventually the protein is
constructed completely here it is and
it's targeted to the mitochondrion and
pulled through the timtom complex simple
turns out that for a lot of proteins
that are nuclear coded but mitochondria
localized what actually happens is that
the messenger RNA itself is targeted to
the mitochondria it's not imported it's
just targeted to the outer surface of
the mitochondrion and it sits there and
the ribosomes sit there constructing the
protein on the surface of the
mitochondria now the big big deal about
that is that the proteins can then be
imported into the mitochondrion while
they are still being constructed while
they're still being synthesized and that
it seems is a massive boost to the
import ability of hydrophobic proteins
because even hydrophobic proteins they
take a little while to fold up into this
globular form that is unimportant
so if they're being imported immediately
if there's only this very short sequence
of amino acids on the outside of the
mitochondria
that have been constructed but hasn't
yet been imported then essentially the
hydrophobicity problem is sidestepped
the protein gets in however hydrophobic
it is and it does its folding up on the
inside of the mitochondrion but that's
fine because that's where the cell is
already equipped to cope with the
globular proteins so that's the concept
of Co translational import and here was
the big discovery that happened just a
couple of years ago a few years ago made
by a group in Paris that the Methuselah
foundation my foundation is now funding
it turns out that the thick and I said
we don't know how this co translational
concept works but it turns out that the
trigger for it the thing that determines
whether a particular messenger RNA will
be targeted to the outside of
mitochondria or not is encoded in part
of that messenger RNA itself and in
particular it's encoded in a part of the
message that does not encode the protein
the messenger RNA tends to have bits on
the beginning and end that are called
untranslated regions because that's what
they are the messenger RNA is just a
sequence of nucleotides but there is a
point on that nucleotide sequence which
says right this is the beginning of the
protein that's where the ribosome starts
doing its stuff and synthesizing the
amino acid sequence and then towards the
end of the of the messenger RNA molecule
there's a point that says right this is
the end of the protein but there are
some more nucleotides after that as well
the part at the beginning is called the
5 prime untranslated region the part at
the end is called the 3 prime
untranslated region and the three prime
untranslated region turns out to be the
part that matters most and essentially
determines whether the message will be
targeted to the mitochondrion so what
people have succeeded in doing is taking
the protein that the genes of interest
the genes that in the mitochondrial DNA
that incurred these very hydrophobic
proteins
they've stitched onto the end of these
genes the sequence for these
untranslated regions from naturally
nuclear genes that are found to localize
their RNA really really thoroughly
really faithfully to the mitochondrion
works the proteins are synthesized on
the outside of the mitochondrion and it
really works functionally as well in
terms of imports this is a graph very
similar to the graph I showed you about
ten minutes ago but it's even more
robust essentially we have here again
the black line control controls where
the cells have perfectly functioning
mitochondrial DNA the line down at the
bottom is one where the mitochondrial
DNA is not working and or it's not
working well enough and there is nothing
in the cell there is no nuclear version
of the gene in question and then you
finally got this one here which is the
cell where much control DNA is not
working but one of the genes has been
replaced by a version in the nucleus and
it's been given this appropriate three
to three prime untranslated region so
that the protein is synthesized on the
outside of the mitochondria and sure
enough the cell is really happy for even
longer than the previous experiment that
I showed you earlier so that's that's
the situation that we're in at the
moment we seem to have more or less
cracks this problem at least in vitro it
looks as though mitochondrial mutations
would certainly accumulate during aging
probably matter as a contributor to the
pathology of aging it looks as though we
may well be able not just to repair
those things but actually to make them
harmless by putting copies of the
mitochondrial DNA into the nucleus
therefore therefore making the
mitochondrial DNA superfluous and making
mutations in its ineffective in terms of
loss of function progress in all of this
has been very slow for most of the
history of the idea most of the 20 years
that people have been looking at it but
progress is seems to be very fast at the
moment so watch this space there will be
a lot of news in this area over the next
couple of years and I'm very pleased
that the Mozilla Foundation has made a
lot of contributions to making that
happen and I'm also very pleased that
you came along to listen to the talk
thank you very much
happy ones questions of cost cowards all
right go
has any progress conveyed I'm aware
I think it's a straight visit partners
have made bond attempting to
target but to reduce the group so the
question was have we made any progress
recently in altering the selective
advantage disadvantage of mutant
mitochondrial DNA relative to non mutant
mitochondrial DNA and yes there has been
some recent progress in that area the
group that really pioneered that whole
approach started off working on it maybe
as long as 15 years ago and then more or
less failed at that time they were using
a type of nucleic acid called a PNA a
protein nucleic acid where the backbone
has had a different structure and this
type of nucleic acid that binds very
tightly to DNA to double flared DNA and
stops it from being transcribed but for
reasons that they never really worked
out they couldn't quite get it to go it
was too toxic in various ways to I think
it was too nonspecific though working
with a different one now and they
reported in a graduate student from the
same group came to my most recent
conference in September in Cambridge and
gave a preliminary report which looks as
though it's going a lot better
but it was very preliminary she only
really came because I twisted the guy's
arm and I think it will probably be
another probably probably another year
before we really see much in the way of
detail on that but yeah certainly the
approach has not been given up on a lot
of the reason why I haven't been given
up on is because it may be a lot more
useful in mitochondrial diseases
diseases where people are born with an
inherited mitochondrial mutation so all
of their cells have the same mutation so
that avoids one of the problems I
mentioned and also they have a much much
higher proportion of their mitochondrial
DNA that's affected so in that sort of
scenario this may be a genuinely useful
approach
the idea just is a little crazy but if
you thirteen that just damages
for damages
probability that damaged so right so
your proposal here is that if the
mechanism for selective clonal expansion
of the mitochondrial mutant mitochondria
is along the lines that I've proposed
namely that by vert but by their by by
their inactivity they somehow don't
damage their own membranes and they stay
out of trouble and get broken down less
often then maybe we could actually make
normal non-mutant mitochondria also have
low membrane potential and generally
damage themselves less often and if at
the basement that's what I'm saying yes
Colton everybody so that they so you
poke holes in the non mutant and the
mutant mitochondria so that's basically
there's less difference between them now
that's an intriguing idea the problem of
course is that we need a respectable
proportion of our mitochondria to be
functioning or we won't make enough ATP
and that's the problem in the first
place of course so if we do that then
you know we might reduce the selective
advantage but a rather rather profound
cost and we probably wouldn't reduce the
Selective eyes very much either because
remember if they let's suppose that
you've got a factor of two difference
between the mutant mitochondrial self
damage rate and the non mitochondrial
self damage race what what matters is
how often a particular mitochondrion is
going to be broke and broken down
targeted for destruction and that will
simply be whether it gets there first so
if you reduce that ratio of rates to
let's say 1.3 or 1.2 it'll still mean
that the non-mutant mitochondria guests
