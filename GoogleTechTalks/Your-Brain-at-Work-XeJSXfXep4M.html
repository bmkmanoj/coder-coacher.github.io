working with senior executives from many
large organizations and many technical
people I find my day job is kind of
translating what might be thought of as
soft skills for technical audience to
understand how to optimize you know
processing so that's enough about me I
want talk about these four surprises
the rationale is overrated massively
overrated the emotions we've got
emotions backward social issues our
primary literally primary and attention
actually changes the brain we can spend
most time on the probably the first and
second and a bit and a bit on the third
I'm going to stop after each and see if
you have questions or comments and if I
go too fast you can slow me down if you
want me to speed up it's Google I can
speed up as well just take you know get
to the point we can do whatever you like
all right and the rationale is overrated
what do I mean by that let's do a give
you a little a little metaphor when
you're trying to hold information in
mind we try to actually hold information
you're going to start using your
prefrontal cortex PFC for short I
shortened it sort of takes less space in
your PFC when you try to hold
information in mind which is to
understand decide recall memorizing
hibbett we try to do that you've got to
use your prefrontal cortex which is a
very limited region of the brain you
know those of you who drove to work
today
you didn't really use your prefrontal
cortex to drive here you're using deeper
regions that you can use without
thinking like you know you can drive
with without having to think about where
you're going if you've gone somewhere a
lot if you're actually consciously
thinking you've got to use your
prefrontal cortex and this is where the
trouble begins let me do a little
experiment what's just call back corn
answer out what's 1+1 know prefrontal
cortex right no effort what's ten plus
ten no prefrontal cortex what's 56 plus
175 laughter no one wants to do it okay
do you get that G key like why don't you
want to do it why don't you want to do
it because you've got to put in a bit of
effort you better actually stop other
things you might be thinking about
because when you use this process it
becomes a serial process you can do one
thing at a time you've got to use effort
and
sounds like a little bit of like oh
don't take me there like I'm not going
there it's a subtle threat
the reason it's a subtle threat to have
to think as we evolved at a time when
resources metabolic resources were
really limited you know war and famine
we live to 20 at best and so we're we're
kind of rewarded for minimizing mental
resources you know it's very easy in
this country in particular to make an
absolute fortune basically helping
people you know put in less and less
effort into any particular thing if you
notice that it's very difficult to kind
of do the opposite and many ways Google
exists because it helps people find
things with less effort as well okay and
you know can measure that in
milliseconds
so using this cortex when you have to
you know do an addition week sort we
sort of avoid it we go I don't really
want to do that it's a threat response
and that threat response does something
so we kind of don't do it very much and
this is a bit of a bit of a challenge
now let me give you the metaphor to
understand it if the amount of
information you can hold in your
prefrontal cortex at one time sometimes
it's called working memory and has other
titles but if the amount of information
you can hold in this region is
equivalent to say a cubic foot okay a
cubic foot then the amount of
information that the rest of your brain
holds is equivalent to about the Milky
Way so the kind of different you get
that sense right it's a little ambiguous
to say but they're really massively
different and this explains a tremendous
number of life's experiences because
what we do is we firstly try to avoid
using this region of the brain we do
things that we know how to do well
rather than doing something differently
and anything that we do do a few times
we quickly start to embed the pattern so
we don't have to think about it and
essentially when you're trying to make
someone think like trying to change a
pattern or change a system or install
some software do anything
you know you're going to get this threat
response because people are you know
going to have to think I mean you know
they're attune not to so it explains a
tremendous amount but this is this
rational resources what people put so
much kind of credence into you know
we've really got to be rational and
spock's
you know spock was all about really
being deeply rational it turns out the
rationale is really really overrated and
it's overrated in two ways firstly what
you can do with it and secondly it's
actually not how we solve most problems
the rationale is not how we solve most
problems which I'll come back to but
there's some studies showing that every
time you do a little math puzzle like
that or any conscious decision you
actually use up a limited bucket of
resources every time you make a decision
solve a problem your blood glucose goes
down and your performance on the next
task goes down so it's really a limited
resource that depletes very quickly and
you can actually start to look at this
and sort of pull apart three types of
thinking that we do and start to treat
this resource of your prefrontal
resource as something that you've got to
kind of manage so you know level one
thinking is basically stuff like 1+1 you
know you don't have to think and isn't
it fun deleting emails does anyone else
get joy deleting emails it's wonderful
is this like ha you know I fly a lot and
one of the things I love to do and I'm
flying for really can't do anything else
is delete and one time I was in a long
flight I saw the bottom of my email
inbox
isn't that incredible it's just like
never happens you know anyway so you can
do that without thinking level 2
scheduling a meeting you've got to hold
things in mind what time where who when
maybe five seconds ten seconds we're not
writing a pitch writing some coding
building a plan building a strategy that
takes a lot of glucose and it takes a
lot of effort energy now what many
people do they get to work they do
number one and then number two first and
then they've got very little energy left
for number three and their brain
actually becomes tired and noisy and
I'll talk about the noise in a moment
and they become really really
ineffective so there's sort of intuitive
approach that we have to you know
tackling our day is wrong from the
brains perspective so this is one of the
first things the rationale is overrated
it would be really rational to get to
work start working on emails and you
know work through that's regression or
it's not how your brain really wants to
work now it's kind of a question that I
posed to people often and it's sort of
one of the questions in the book which
is you know if you truly respected
attention as a limited resource what
would you do differently if you're
really accepted that you've probably
only got a few hours of really quality
deep processing time level three
activity what would you do differently
if you really like thought about that
and it's it's quite an important
conversation to to have I believe in an
organization that is processing a lot
intially now here's the challenge though
most problems we solve are not solved
rationally and in the lab we see that
the PFC not only isn't the source of the
solution but is actually the source of
not finding the solution the prefrontal
cortex rational resources actually stop
you solving problems a lot of the time
and in the lab we see that about 60% of
problems that people solve they actually
can't explain how they solve them it's
just you have the experience all the
time you know you you're walking to work
and suddenly you get an idea where that
idea come from you weren't working on
anything where did it come from you know
you're in the shower
you're on the treadmill you're doing
something and suddenly you have this
this answer coming to you why couldn't
you have that when you wanted to you
know that feeling
why couldn't have solved that problem
when you well you can if you understand
your brain a bit better
and it turns out that the very thing
that you normally use to solve problems
is the inhibitor of solutions if the
problems are complex
it's the inhibitor your prefrontal
cortex is the inhibitor and there's a
whole framework around this that I won't
go into too far but there's a study of
insight now about the last five years
there's been a study of insight and this
was published in my last book that a few
people here have been reading called
quiet leadership and you can actually
now understand how insights occur and
I'll give you just a cliff notes kind of
the most valuable piece and that is that
in order for insight to happen you
actually have to stop thinking you have
to stop any form of conscious mental
deliberate process to have these
insights and there's a couple of complex
reasons for that but let me give you a
demonstration of it first
and let's see kind of how you go with
this this is a simple puzzle you've
basically got five words they're time
flies like an arrow and though it
normally means time moves swiftly in one
direction you know time goes straight
ahead time goes forward can anyone think
of a different interpretation of those
five words like quite a substantially
different interpretation anyone think of
one over here
very good okay so that's a record for
that answer so you guys have very good
hiring processes because of people never
get so quickly to an answer like that
anyone else get one yeah up here very
good okay anyone else get one absolutely
so what does it require to come up with
these different solutions what does it
require mentally you've got to kind of
dampen down this solution in your brain
you've got a conscious and it's pretty
easy to do with just five words much
harder to do with a complex project but
you've got to actually dampen down the
existing solution and go and go I'm
going to think about this fresh I'm
going to unlock you know the word time
and in this sort of structure it is in
the sentence structure I'm going to
reimagine it okay and I'll give you I'll
give you five of them check the speed of
flies the way you would time an arrow
check the speed of flies only if they're
similar to an arrow check the speed of
flies the way an arrow would and my
favorite time flies a type of fly are
fond of arrows which you guys and
there's more if you get subtle but many
people have tremendous difficulty with
this because they're not experienced at
dampening down their own thinking and
clearly you guys have developed great
cognitive control you know when it's
time to kind of stop thinking one where
and try thinking another way it's a very
very important capacity for maximizing
internal processing so insight involves
stopping thinking about the problem and
allowing a completely different solution
to come through and this is a summary of
mark Beeman's research on inside they
see an alpha wave which is you can see
the purple line up there the alpha wave
is the brain going to idle just for a
couple of seconds the good news is is
not two months it's two seconds but when
you put the brain into idle it's like
putting a car into neutral and things
just kind of can come through the basic
science of this is a little complex to
explain a short time but essentially a
thought like if I say picture an
elephant if I say picture an elephant
that's going to be a connection between
millions if not billions of neurons and
the electrical activity given off as
that circuit
creates is quite high it's kind of a lot
of it's like a high amplitude electrical
activity on an EEG but if you're trying
to solve a problem the solution that
your brain comes up with in your
unconscious it's your unconscious that
solves that not your conscious mind the
solution might involve a circuit between
only a few thousand or a few tens of
hundreds of neurons and so there's a lot
less electrical activity an electrical
activity means arousal and it means
dopamine and you need to be able to
notice spikes of dopamine to be able to
notice information so put all that
together you basically get the fact that
if you're operating really with a loud
brain all the time you're not able to
see the subtle signals and it's like you
don't kind of hear a quiet cell phone at
a loud party if you know if it's really
really loud so the ability to have these
insights very much comes to this ability
to quieten down your overall mental
activity at any time and people who can
do that people who have strong cognitive
control which you can tell in a scanner
before you give them a task those people
have a lot more insights and the other
thing that I can tell you about insights
that's kind of surprising is basically
an answer to the question of where they
come from where they come from is weak
associations if you want to have
insights you've got to practice
detecting weak associations and there's
a story about this which is a true story
it involves a monk so but it's not an
apocryphal story it's a real real story
with a monk and this monk went into
market Beeman's lab to test out kind of
what happens when he has insights he
went into the machine and he tried to
solve problems with insight and he
didn't really solve any and that was
very unusual and Mark said to the guy
what what are you doing what strategy
you using and the monk said you know I'm
really focusing on the problem and Mark
said right don't focus on the problem
focus on being unfocused focus on
letting anything come into your
attention on being actually completely
unfocused and what happened was the monk
became an insight machine and this
ability to detect weak associations it's
really really important and there's a
very very strong correlate between this
and anxiety and happiness the more
anxious you are the less of these weak
connections you notice and the more
happy you are the more of these weak
associations that you notice and we
think it's because you literally open up
your field of view when you're happy and
you
close down your field of view when
you're unhappy and that occurs
internally and externally okay so the
table tennis table on the pool table and
all that stuff where you just kind of
goof off and just have some fun that
turns out to actually be very useful for
complex problem solving if you can shift
yourself from anxiety to happiness
you'll get a pretty substantial shift in
the total number of problems you'll
solve from insight okay so that may be
explaining a few things that you already
know but just to kind of summarize this
idea we we seek we significantly over
emphasized the rationale and it turns
out that our rational resources are very
limited a few hours a day and our
rational resources are not used to solve
most problems and so just I'll just pose
a question to you before we go on a
question to you is what does this
explain that you already do and what
does it suggest maybe you do differently
it's a kind of a question I posed for
you or you can pose a question for me
we'll just see if anyone has any
questions or comments before we're going
to take one over here from a
neuroscientist fantastic okay its
remediate threat response you know give
me a pop quiz okay flow is an
interesting phenomena obviously and
generally what happens with flow is
you're using deeply embedded circuits
that you don't have to think about much
to use but you're using them in a
slightly different way so you're doing
something you know how to do really well
but you're doing it slightly differently
in a way that's really stretching you so
it's not completely uncertain then
what's happening is you're getting a
positive feedback loop of dopamine
because novelty creates and new circuits
create dopamine but you're not having to
put in all this effort to create this
this wide scale new circuits you see
that and so you get this lovely positive
feedback loop in dopamine that happens
so if you're doing something really
difficult that's brand new you get a lot
more norepinephrine or noradrenaline
more of a threat from the uncertainty in
that way yeah anyone else yeah over
there
well not really much given it's only a
cubic foot in terms of the information
it can hold that I mean they think of it
as kind of the caretaker of the building
it does a little you know sweeping
around the edges and kind of keeping
things tidy and I mean it does a lot of
things it's the only region of the brain
that actually is connected to every
other region and you guys had Dan Siegel
here he's one of my favorite people in
the world and he talks about you know
that the model of the hand where the
prefrontal here is connected to the
whole brain and it's really the only
region of the brain that has a braking
system and this is one of the important
functions braking as in stopping not
braking it's the only region of the
brain that has a braking system in it so
you've got all these brain regions which
are huge which are like you know Milky
Way sized for thinking for a motive for
moving for all these different functions
and you've only got one brain region
which is the right and left temple that
is in the prefrontal it's called the
right and left ventral lateral
prefrontal and this region is involved
in stopping both motor motor functions
and thinking and feeling and everything
else so it's it's your task
it's your structure for inhibiting
automatic responses is one of the things
that we think and and actually
deliberately I mean it's for many other
things but that's one of its really
important functions without that you're
an automaton
if you don't activate your brakes you'll
do whatever your you know your fears and
motivations will have you do which is
often not in your or everyone else's
best interests to put it mildly the
other thing that prefrontal cortex does
is very unusual lower primates don't
have much it allows us to imagine so if
you think of this as a stage you think
of your prefrontal cortex as a stage
putting aside the breaking structure
what you actually do is you get
information from several places you can
get information coming in right now and
hold it on your stage and compare it to
existing information in your brain and
understand a new idea as a result and
that's kind of cool but other you know
creatures do that a bit what you can
also do though is you can get
information from inside your brain and
combine it with other inside information
from inside your brain and make up
something completely new so you can take
info from long-term memory and you can
combine them in different ways so you
basically get this kind of playing field
where you can do stuff you know they
call it sometimes a mental
ketchup add as you've got this ability
to imagine and make stuff up and that
includes imagining what it's like to be
you imagining what it's like to be other
people imagining all sorts of things and
those are two sides of the same coin as
well by the way so I think those are the
two really significant things you
remember it's dramatically smaller than
the rest of the brain but the braking
system is really important so that you
actually regulate automatic functions
and the other one is so that you can
actually invent and create and this
issue of regulating is really
significant because your capacity to
regulate emotions which is where we're
going is a nice segue question thank you
your capacity to regulate emotions is
absolutely central to success in life
and as anyone heard of the marshmallow
experiment you might have had someone
talking so you know we're like a few
more minutes on that is you know many
extra scores in your SAT that is pure
self-regulation it's pure right-left
federer lateral prefrontal activity
that's enabling you to to dampen down
other things so this ability to regulate
emotions is really critical now the
thing with emotions is we have them
backwards though and we've we've really
completely misinterpreted how to manage
emotions in the wider society I'd say
people who are successful in this
organization probably would not have
this problem where you wouldn't succeed
but the wider society we tend to have it
backwards
let me give you a little primer you're
sure you've heard about the limbic
system I won't do brain 101 but the
basic thing to know is it's extremely
skittish and your limbic system is
constantly on the lookout for potential
threats and it does something very
interesting I'm going to turn I'm going
to turn this one on and do a little
drawing here we've got that working
there we go I could do a little drawing
here this is a not an anatomically
correct drawing in any way but if this
is your prefrontal cortex here and
you've got the deeper limbic system and
the limbic system is making a decision
every moment about everything that you
interact with in the world so every book
cover that you see you decide hey that's
you know that's good I'm going to go
toward that or that's a kind of a threat
I'm going to stay away from that it's
potential water it's a potential threat
you do that with every chair
that chair looks comfortable that chair
looks dangerous with every person you
actually do it with every phoneme every
sound and your brain does it with
nonsense words that have absolutely no
meaning they classify them into reward
or threat and it's a very important
overarching principle in fact it's
probably the only major organizing
principle of the brain according to a
meta study of thousands of brain studies
that the organizing principle is firstly
minimize danger secondly maximize reward
that's the organizing principle
companies have organizing principles
don't they minimize costs maximize
revenues the Orcas you know some
parallels there any way with the limbic
system it's dramatically more likely for
you to go the threat state because your
brain is kind of evolved at a time when
you know the people who are hyper
sensitive to threat survive basically
you've probably heard that but what's
fascinating is the difference between
the threat and reward and if this is a
if this is a reward and this is threat
and this is time you know you're walking
along the street to work in the morning
and assuming some of you walk and you're
walking along to the street the street
and you see someone that you really like
you don't like you don't stop and think
about them you just see them you notice
them in that moment this is time in
seconds you know your brain will slowly
kind of get a little slight reward
response and it'll start to taper off a
little reward response those of you a
little low is a little technical
challenge there then you're walking
along and you see someone that like
attacked you last week at work not
physically but they just you know said
your ideas were crazy which turns out to
be actually as bad as a physical threat
for your brain but we'll get to that
anyway what happens is you you see that
person you go woof and you go straight
down immediately and you don't just go
down faster you go down much deeper you
stay down and much longer and it takes
it's much harder to displace so the
statement bad is stronger than good
doesn't do a just as bad as stronger
longer lasting deeper harder to move and
all the rest of it which is why you know
in a really tragic situation you know
happens like last week you know it's
something difficult you know terrible
news
the only people who are really happy are
media conglomerates who know that it's
going to get a lot more people's
attention because this literally bad
gets attention this is
what this is about attention you know it
goes to the negative okay so this is an
important function to understand because
your brain is going to go to the
negative all the time and you might say
well so what why does that matter well
the reason it matters is this limbic
system has a very important function of
keeping you alive but I'm just going to
draw this here this is the threat
response and this is the reward response
this is a sorry threat and reward there
we go so you can see it there it's easy
to hold things there that hold it in
your mind
less less glucose to process so what
happens is the degree of activation of
this limbic system which can be either
threat or reward and this is activation
right that's a lot of activation a
little bit of activation the degree of
activation of your limbic system is a
degree of deactivation of your
prefrontal cortex and it turns out that
even a small thing like seeing someone
that you don't like much has quite a
measurable impact on your ability to
solve problems and make decisions and
the more this is aroused the less
function you have here so this can go
very quickly from a cubic foot to a
cubic inch or even less and it's really
remarkable how this happens at such low
levels and I'll give you one story I
write about in the book it's a study of
two groups of students completing a maze
it's just a piece of paper one group of
students the the maze has a mouse in the
middle and a piece of cheese at the end
the other group is a mouse and an owl
and there's no priming deliberately
involved that's the experiment is just
say complete the maze and then do some
creativity experiments afterwards and
the differential in problem solving
afterwards was about 50% there's about a
50% better problem solving ability in
the people going for the cheese so this
is like an amount of threat you can
hardly even sense you don't even know
it's there has a very profound impact on
all sorts of things and the other thing
to know is that's deliberate
problem-solving but also the unconscious
problem-solving the insight you know
that little bit of threat creates a lot
of noise and your brain needs quiet to
solve problems so what we need to do is
learn to regulate emotions and this is
where we get it backwards this is where
we get it backwards because in society
we tend to do the exact opposite of what
we need and let me give you a little
context this is from actually James
Gross from Stanford who's down the road
from here is the founding father of
emotion regulation research and his
works been repeated by Kevin oxen and
other neuroscientists in the last five
years and some fascinating findings what
we see is that when you experience a
threat things change when you experience
the moment when it's sort of something
kicks in your world changes what happens
is this bit gets aroused and this goes
down by the way it happens with strong
positive threats it's just they're much
rarer okay is anyone here play poker and
willing to admit to it anyone here will
handle it there you go what happens if
you get like two aces on the flop you've
had internally smiling and you feel
you'll feel pretty good have you ever
lost a lot of money getting two aces on
the flop have you ever noticed like that
yeah yeah most people I've spoken to who
play bit you know until they learn this
trick what happens is that you the
strong positive actually inhibits your
you're processing and you miss things
that you wouldn't normally miss you
become like too happy and too happy
actually isn't a really good state what
you want to be is just to the right of
neutral for maximum processing memory
this session is about maximum optimizing
internal processing okay you want to be
just to the right of neutral just
slightly positive and so what happens is
when an emotion kicks in everything
changes strong negative or strong
positive strongly active more likely
you've got three choices you can make at
that moment one is the one my
six-year-old does very well which is to
let the emotion out okay we all came out
like that didn't we we came out kicking
and screaming and then we learn - what'd
we learn to suppress we learn to push it
down which is to try not to let other
people fear you know see that you're
feeling it one of the funniest things in
the world is watching a six-year-old try
to pretend that you can't see what
they're feeling when you can absolutely
see what they're feeling it's very funny
anyway you try to UM you try to suppress
the emotion and the other techniques
which we'll talk about is cognitive
change cognitive change requires the
very thing that diminishes very fast
when an emotion kicks in so you may only
have one or two seconds to use the
cognitive change straight
when a threat response kicks in because
your square foot which is your braking
system is needed for cognitive change
that square foots shrinks fast like in
fraction of a seconds it's going really
fast downhill so let me explain this to
firstly let me tell you about the
challenges of suppression when you
suppress an emotion actually your limbic
system stays as bad or gets worse your
memory goes out the door and you make
other people uncomfortable people's
blood pressure goes up even third
parties that know nothing that's going
on so suppressing emotions has a
terrible cognitive effect and it's
really the worst thing to do and it's
the very thing that most people do
cognitive change strategies on the other
hand there's no impact on arousal no
change to memory and no effect on others
so they're very very good but they
require being aware of internal states
quickly if you're someone who doesn't
know what you're feeling anytime and you
sort of oblivious to that and you're you
know thinking about the world that you
never think about you know what your
stakes are it'll be very difficult to
use cognitive change strategies so what
are the two major ones well firstly let
me tell you the two major ones put on
the brakes automatically whether you
mean to or not and the two cognitive
change strategies activate this more and
this less so they reverse the the seesaw
that's the other way the first ones
called labeling or emotional labeling
it's where you define an emotional state
in a word or two you define an
experience without going into the story
of it if you go into the story it'll
make the emotion worse the ironic thing
is when people are polled people say I
don't want to talk about emotions
because it's going to make them worse
and so we instead suppress but actually
in the lab we see that when you speak
about an emotion and just label it in a
word or two even when you have no idea
you're in an emotional regulation task
it automatically puts on the brakes and
automatically dampens down the threat
response okay so you're in a meeting and
you're feeling just weird and
something's going on and just go ah
don't know what's going on and then you
go oh that's right I'm hungry that's why
I can't focus that's a kind of gross
example of the situation suddenly you
feel more able to focus by knowing that
you're hungry or or or I'm angry you
know at this person over there it's
really taking up cognitive resources and
as you put words on it decreases it if
you can say that out loud if it becomes
part of the culture to say it you
activate a stronger braking network and
it
is it down even more than just thinking
it okay because speaking is more
attention density than just thinking so
that's one strategy it's not what we do
in society we do the opposite we
generally suppress with a terrible
cognitive load as a result okay the
other strategy is one that anyone who
wants to make it as a leader in any
organization has to develop
it's called reappraisal it goes by other
names like reframing recontextualizing
and all sorts of things in the lab we
call it reappraisal it's what you need
for strong hits it's very simple it's
changing your entire interpretation of
an invent all right so you're driving to
work and we seem to have a theme of
driving to work today I've been doing a
lot of traveling can you see can you
tell are you driving to work and um you
hit some traffic and you suddenly find
you're absolutely stopped and you're
starting to get really anxious and you
notice that and you say hmm I'm going to
have to reinterpret this I'm going to
have a really bad day you know and you
go how can I do that you've got to use
your resources fast you know what gosh
what kind of opportunity could I turn
this into and if you don't do it quickly
you won't see any opportunity in it
you'll only see a threat if you do it
quickly you can go I know I'm going to
call my mother and have a great chat
with her I'm going to use the time to do
something really great I'm going to use
the time to pull over and do some yogurt
I've really wanted to do I'm going to
really get into that like it's changing
your interpretation of the event you
know the other night is the airport and
for the second day straight my plane was
massively delayed and you know I had a
big presentation the next day and you
know I reinterpreted and said I'll call
I've got two and a half hours totally
unplanned of total downtime undisturbed
where I could plug in and just let it
really get some some things out and I
just focused and really got some things
out so you all do that you wouldn't
survive in this kind of organization
without you know strong capacity the
trouble is people who are logical and
linear say no I want to deal with the
data
I just want to grin and bear it I want
to suppress men and more likely to do
that I don't you know I don't want to
make up stories and reinterpret I'm
going to see things as they are that's
not so good and I'll show you the
evidence there's a study of about
several hundred people by James gross
actually
he classified people in just very simple
diametric he said what do you do when a
strong emotional hit comes along when a
strong emotional experience you know
comes to you what do you do do you
suppress it or do you invent a different
story and you know reinterpret it and he
then measured them on all sorts of
scales
middle line is the average I should
probably point this one that time to see
a lot of it
middle line is the average and what he
found is people who suppress more
significantly below average on optimism
environmental mastery positive
relationships and life satisfaction
the people who reappraised more was
significantly above average on this side
the only definer whatsoever was do you
suppress or do you reappraise its ass
excuse me it's a really significant
determiner of success as a leader or you
know even just as a team member because
you get strong emotional hits all the
time if you're someone who suppresses
your problem-solving abilities going to
go down every time your memory is going
to go down other people won't like you
if you learn to reappraise it's
different now one of the coolest things
I ever heard and it can blew me away so
much I sort of had to lie down for an
hour was that the more you understand
about your brain I listen to this the
more you understand about your brain the
more you can actually reappraise all
sorts of internal strong threats that
come along because you can go oh gosh
I'm so crazy I'm such an idiot what Oh
hang on that's just my brain you can
actually recognize internal experiences
and reappraise them as brain functioning
you know not you as things that are you
know something that you can change but
you change the interpretation and you
shift from a threat state to it towards
that you start to see more options
question over there
yeah expression the question was what
happens to the third axis what if you
express well that will depend I've got
an actor friend and you know she
expresses all the time it's great if you
express you just get this off and you
express that's fine but it's how should
we say it's maladaptive in the workplace
you also known as will get fired fast
because it no one wants to work with you
some expressions fine if it works for
your environment you know it's just non
adaptive I mean as a leader what you'll
want to express all the time is your
intense desire to throttle your
employees they're not doing what you
want you know you won't have many
followers pretty fast so you know
expression is fine the emotion may pass
it may go but it stays in the people
around you so that's often not so good I
want to get to the third piece because
we've got little time left and then
we'll I think this is where it kind of
comes together let's bring this together
into this this final piece which is that
social issues of primary and-and-and you
know we've really as I said we've really
got emotions backward we tend to
actually do exactly the wrong thing to
manage them but there's even bigger
insights from the brain about social
issues and it's quite surprising as
anyone here heard of Maslow Maslow's
hierarchy of needs and the triangle it's
really great to reorganize there's a
really teeny tiny small problem which is
it's kind of wrong and it's right in
many ways just to you know honor his
work it's it really helpful but Maslow
sort of says you know primary needs are
primary and that's what we focus on
first like food and water and shelter
we've got to have that stuff and social
needs where does he put those you know
right up there that's not how your brain
functions how your brain functions is
social needs are primary needs okay and
experiments on this from the social
cognitive affective neuroscience field
are phenomenal may give you a little a
little metaphor let's say what's your
name again Johnny let's say Johnny you
come to work and on the way to work you
you sort of trip and you hurt your leg
and you got a little bit of pain then as
you try and focus on a coding project or
something every few minutes the pain
will take over your attention because
it's an alert signal it's a threat
response saying your life is in danger
you know focus on this pain and so you
won't be able to focus as much okay now
if you then take some aspirin which
inhibits the pain in five different pain
regions you will be able to focus more
because the
response goes down so pain is a threat
response saying you're in danger you
know do something now if if you don't
fall like that but you're on the way to
work and someone says to you you know
hey I think there's a real problem with
that project that you worked on and you
decide that that means maybe incorrectly
you decide that means that they're
putting down your work and saying that
you know you've made a mistake you're
going to get also a threat response and
you might feel really angry and actually
in a kind of pain and what's really
surprising is if you also then took an
aspirin that pain would also diminish
and you would see diminished activation
of the same five pain regions as if you
are feeling physical pain and in placebo
controlled studies we've seen very
clearly that social pain activates the
same regions of the brain as physical
pain and social rewards like even saying
to someone good job in a computer voice
to a simple task activates the
dopaminergic reward center more than
money it's insane it's not rational but
the brain is deeply deeply social now it
does make sense and here's how if you're
a wolf you get resources from the wild
so you've got great wiring for smell you
know smelling a dead carcass a thousand
feet away my daughter can smell
chocolate from the other room but you
can't smell a carcass you know across
the across the suburb right but you
don't get resources from the wild do you
where do you get them from the moment
you're born from other people so you've
got massive circuitry for other people
for reading their intentions that's one
of the biggest ones for reading their
goals intentions their emotions can I
trust or distrust you've got huge
swathes you know at six months old you
detect there's jealousy all sorts of
things so we've got massive amount of
social circuitry and I summarized a
whole ton of the social neuroscience
happen that that's been happening into a
paper that's been currently one of the
most popular papers out there in sort of
the business world called managing with
the brain in mind and it's a summary of
the major social threats and rewards
that are actually driving our behavior
and these are actually the brains own
goals when it comes to the social world
the first one is is status the second
one is certainty the third one is
autonomy
the fourth one is having taller
whiteboards the third one is relatedness
and the final one is fairness I'll put
this up on the screen so you can see
this it'll be a little bit easier I
didn't think ahead that far for how low
that would go status certainty autonomy
relatedness fairness let me just put
this up on screen so you don't have to
hold it in mind it'll be easier to see
it okay here's how it works your brain
keeps track of pain and when you
experience pain you get a threat and it
keeps track of pleasure when you
experience pleasure you want more of it
you go toward it it keeps track of
domains like water like temperature your
brain keeps track of a whole series of
environmental domains using the primary
reward and threat circuitry your brain
also keeps track of these social domains
using the primary reward and threat
circuitry when you feel like there's
more food coming you get rewarded less
food you get hunger when you feel like
your status is going up you feel
fantastic when you feel like your status
is going down because that is stronger
than good you feel like death okay when
you feel like certainty is going up you
feel you know pretty good when you feel
more certain about something when you
feel uncertain you again feel like pain
is coming because bad is stronger than
good
uncertainty activates a threat response
in a big way even ambiguity lights up
the limbic system in a big big way just
a little ambiguities and autonomy when
you sense that you have choices a small
stress or become sorry when you have
when you detect you have choices a big
stressor becomes small when you think
you have know what I mean you just got
to do what someone else once a small
stress becomes really big and finally
fairness which is going self-explanatory
but fairness fairness in and of itself
is activating either a reward or a
threat now in study after study after
study from about 400 different
neuroscientists working on these and
other fields what we're seeing is that
these threats and rewards are very very
overwhelming and much more than people
realize much more than people realize
okay so yeah question related I cited
sorry about that uncertainty suddenly
rises up relatedness is a decision that
you make about are you in my in-group or
my out-group and you make very different
decisions when someone's in your
in-group you actually you don't feel
pain of someone in your out group you
don't feel empathy when someone in your
out group speaks to you
you don't really listen to what they say
we know that intuitively but in the lab
you actually don't create maps of what
they're saying you use different
circuits to actually hear them when
someone's in your in-group you do
experience their pain you do actually
see what they're seeing you actually see
what they're saying literally your
occipital lobe lights up you see what
they're saying
so it's Friend or Foe it's trust or
distrust it's a decision we make with
people and by the way foe is the default
so we automatically decide that everyone
is a foe until proven otherwise with a
couple of exceptions one is really
attractive or familiar people babies
they're all everyone stares at babies
and the final one is if you've had too
much to drink and in that case everyone
is your friend moment everyone but you
know in some instances that you suddenly
feel like able to talk to strangers you
know that feeling you've got a party
don't know everyone who freaked out have
a few drinks I talked to everyone you've
shifted from foe to friend now this is
very important for collaboration because
you don't collaborate well at all with
people that you think of foes you know
even a slight foe you'll get in a very
poor collaboration compared to if people
think that you're friends so now you put
this together you see a whole bunch of
things as a tremendous amount to say
about this but the biggest two seem to
be status uncertainty although
everyone's different it runs individual
you can't maximize them all at once
because too much certainty is no
autonomy but it's about recognizing
ahead of time kind of what's going on
and using this to improve rewards this
concept of workplace engagement of being
really into what you're doing means that
people are experiencing rewards there on
the right-hand side that's what you know
engagement is engagement is a brain
that's making you connections has lots
of dopamine is experiencing flow and
it's going for these kinds of status
rewards now what does it explain well
firstly let me just say this if someone
comes up to you at work and says you
know we need to talk about that project
what's that feeling that you get in your
stomach it's like oh it's like a jolt
it's a threat ok and what about if
someone says to you I need to give you
some feedback it's it's a job right it's
like a little you know it's a concern
that's the status threat status is kind
of the scary one we don't talk about it
much but status is really driving our
behavior massively and I'll tell you
what when we feel like we're smart
better than or worse than when we feel
like we've gone up in status in the
communities we're in it's not about
Rolexes and houses it's just about
number agreed pecking order when we feel
like it's gone up we get a wonderful
reward and when we feel like it's gone
down we get a very intense threat the
same with the expectation we feel like
it might go up we get a nice reward we
feel like it might go down we get an
intensely strong threat so we really
really avoid threats like we avoid pain
and so we avoid things where our status
might go down and where this plays out
is you get this tremendous pushback when
you try to change anyone in any way if I
want to change you in any way I've got
to start with the premise that there's
something wrong with you and I've got
more information or I know something and
immediately you're going to get people
pushing back because it's a status
threat you see that it'll happen with
your kids it'll happen with your partner
it'll happen at work it'll happen
everywhere when you know when you cut
try to change someone you get a big
status through it and a certainty threat
as well of course now what about there
are two things that are pretty much
guaranteed to create very true and full
emotional responses that sort of
overwhelm you
one is the threat of physical violence
if you think you're about to be you know
physically attacked and going to have
pain you'll stop everything and freak
out and really freak out right you know
that now the other one is the expression
let me tell you what other people have
been saying about you
it also activates maybe not as intense
as real physical violence but it
activates a really strong threat
response and it's also known as the
performance review okay let me tell you
what others have been saying about you
and what's been going on here it's a
very threatening response so you know
we've got to work out how to mitigate
that and we try and do that and it's
also known as you know you're getting
some coaching now you got to watch out
for that because people will go you know
what if people have been saying about me
why am I getting coaching unless you you
reframe that it's quite dangerous
so as someone who you know in this room
some of you will manage people as
someone who's a manager it really really
plays out because it's very easy to be
very logical and when you manage someone
tell them all the things that they
should be doing which impacts their
status and to not provide clear
expectations and to micromanage and to
not trust them and to not be open and
you get a jackpot you get a negative
jackpot
which is not so good so it's very easy
to drive people crazy Azzam
you may have experienced that with your
managers when they don't let you have
autonomy and they you know all that
stuff sends people really crazy now when
you're experiencing lots of rewards your
world is bigger you actually perceive
many more layers of data you perceive
more you know width of data you perceive
more information because you've got more
prefrontal function and more insight
capacity so it's not a small thing to
minimize threat you know minimize threat
in these social ways are really
important now what about when you find a
project that is kind of yours and you
can make your mark and you think it's a
project that's really cool and maybe it
sort of helps the world in some way even
just a small world like your team what
if it's sort of like improves and right
to wrong in some way then you get
passionately you know behind that that's
what deep engagement is okay now deep
engagement actually involves people who
feel like they're increasing their
status and they're increasing their
certainty by fixing something that was
uncertain and they're increasing their
autonomy by actually doing something
taking action they're increasing
relatedness because you can't do this
alone you've got to connect with others
and they're increasing some unfit or
decreasing some unfairness and you have
to get the positive jackpot so the more
you can focus on how what you do makes a
difference in the world the more you'll
also get that and the more as an
organization you focus on how what you
do makes a difference in the world
the more the organization gets these
positive rewards as well so there's a
whole bunch of layers that you can look
at this framework for on and if you want
to know more about this I'm not going to
I'm not going to say by the book because
you're getting immediate threat response
and class me as an out-group rather than
an in-group but I will say they'll send
you a paper I'll send you this paper
just drop your card up here if you want
to kind of read into this more there's a
paper the called managing with the brain
in mind anyone who wants to drop a card
and I'll you'll get one email shot for
me you won't go on a database you'll get
one email shot with this and some other
links to other resources okay so the
social is primary and it really has a
huge impact social issues are primary
the final thing to say then we've got
five minutes of questions the final
thing to say is that tension changes the
brain attention actually does change the
brain it changes it in seconds it turns
out not just in months or weeks or days
or hours it changes it in seconds the
trouble is your attention normally goes
to the negative that's where it always
goes if you want to focus your attention
on the future
on something uncertain it's tricky if
you've got a threat response because
there's space shrinks if you want to
focus your attention on a goal you need
to be kind of feeling safe first because
the tension won't go easily there but as
you focus attention on things that are
intangible which require a lot of space
here you actually thicken those circuits
and you start to see those you know
pieces of the world become alive so
attention changes the brain what you've
got to do is develop the capacity to
control your attention and I want to
finish with this one idea that really
the more you understand the brain the
more you become able to control your
attention to make attentional choices
and it's almost like this issue of a
kind of brains of Swiss army life and
the more you're able to understand
what's in this brain of yours the more
you can actually go now I'm not going to
be problem-focused now I'm going to be
solution-focused now I'm not going to be
driven by status here I'm going to focus
on the organization's goals now I'm not
going to be you know thrown by all this
uncertainty I'm going to actually quiet
in my mind down for a minute
so the more you understand your brain
the more language you have to make
different choices the only trouble is
the brain is a little bit more like that
so you want to practice this and all
this but there's tremendous benefits
from very short amounts you know like a
week of starting to practice just noting
noticing what your brain is doing you
know for a few minutes a day is having
very measurable impacts on all sorts of
mental functions and processes there so
you know I'm not an advocate for trying
to teach people to do long-term
attention training there's tremendous
benefits in literally a few minutes a
week of practicing different things so I
want to wrap up with this one statement
is that it's possible to optimize
internal data processing and one of the
ways to do that is by understanding your
brain better the more you understand the
brain the more you can minimize that
threat response maximize the space in
your prefrontal cortex and maximize
insight problem-solving thank you very
much
we've got a couple of minutes for
questions people have any questions one
over there there's some mics will use
those mics thank you very much in in the
dichotomy between
reappraisal and suppression yeah how do
we evaluate something like I'm thinking
of a Buddhist monk who's extremely
serene is that extremely suppressed
extremely reappraised or something I
think they've practiced staying in a
toured state there's a funny quote that
comes to mind from me from the Dalai
Lama which someone asked him I don't if
you've heard that someone else and you
know why you're always so happy he said
because it feels better you know in
other words he's redoing a reappraisal
he's constantly choosing to be happy
choosing to look at situations and
choosing that kind of compassion that
happiness and it seems that you know
anything you do over and over it becomes
easier to do and becomes more of a trait
not just a state so that kind of
training is is what happens so I think
you know there's subtle distinctions and
you've got to kind of find the
differences in your own in your own
brain but you can it's very obvious to
external person or to some skin
conductance technology or to a scanner
you know it's very obvious and to
ourselves when we're suppressing and the
emotions are still there versus when
we've actually changed and one of the
troubles with reappraise although it's
fabulous it's really hard to do on your
own because it takes cognitive resources
and I'll give you a trick if you need to
reappraise and you know you have got
much time you're overwhelmed the
cheapest form of reappraisal is humour
when things are tough and you go oh I'm
just going to laugh at this what do you
do you actually completely reduce the
threats trigger the stress dramatically
don't you so in an extreme emergency
laughs and it shifts you from a threat
to a towards state and that's one of the
ways that you can you can manage this
thank you another question
hyped in a little bit late so you'll
have to forgive me if you cover this at
the beginning um David is mine that's
where I started - okay great
a friend of mine afforded me your paper
neuroscience of mindfulness of alright
the the article that you gotta cool yeah
yeah and I was trying to paraphrase it
for somebody and I did a bad job I want
to see if maybe you could help me out
Oh fantastic I've got one minute to
explain the news
lines of my awesome well I'm gonna do it
okay you talked about basically kind of
the brains in two modes there's a pretty
explain it basically that you have two
ways of experiencing any moment one is
called the direct experience circuitry
you're taking in data right now okay
right now you're taking in data not
focusing on it much but you could
actually stop and take in data like the
sound of my voice going oh just see me
saying oh you could listen to that data
when you listen to that data and focus
your attention on it you dampen down
what's called a narrative circuitry
which is all the stories and thinking
they're two separate circuits and when
you actually can focus on direct
information coming in right now you
actually then perceive more information
in all senses and you stop the kind of
story and threaten and you know rambling
that goes on but more importantly you
see more choices and this is both in the
external world and in the internal world
so when you're able to distinguish
between directly taking in data and
story about data you've become much
better at cognitive control and you can
practice that for just moments every day
you can practice it in the shower for 10
seconds a day and you'll get benefits
you can practice it anywhere the start
of a meal what you just want to do is
focus on any kind of incoming data and
see how long you can focus your
attention on it and notice when your
attention goes back to the narrative
which is story so you're tasting some
food notice yourself tasting the food
and the flavors and then notice yourself
thinking about something else entirely
and go oh narrative and come back it's a
tasting and the more you can split you
know and see these things that you
developed this great cognitive control
that really helps with many other ways
the the articles called the neuroscience
of mindfulness it's being one of the
most popular I had a whole lot of
Buddhists put a fatwa against me which I
only say half jokingly although if
you're gonna have a fact whether it's
probably the best religion to have won
by but interestingly the the dalai lama
center retweeted it thought it was
fabulous because they thought it's
really important for people to
understand mindfulness sake because I
sort of said something is important as
being aware of internal states shouldn't
be tagged to any religion right and I
kind of said that's really a problem
that it's been tagged to that religion
and everyone should develop the capacity
to notice internal states is how you
optimize data processing is the only way
to
optimize data processing so it's kind of
a controversial one but the neuroscience
of mindfulness I'll send that as one of
the links one last question we don't
give up just you're talking about the
direct experience thing reminds me of
I've done a lot of my mom's in our
teacher yeah my family are artists and
I'm sure you've heard the book drawing
on the right side yeah great book here
which reminded me a lot like the whole
way that that sort of gets you to push
down your sort of representations of the
world and just look at the and just
experience directly absolutely and that
right half is a little bit more about
direct experience body and emotions and
directly in the left is more about
language and verbalizing and you know in
schools we tend to teach the left
massively and not the right I'm involved
in a project with Dan Siegel we're both
on the board of a school kind of a
showing a whole other way of building
you know education and it is more about
the right as well yeah so I have it seem
have you I don't even know what my
actual question is here but just about
you know have you looked at sort of
artists and the way that they're they
work while they're doing their sort of
thing because you don't look at a sort
of it I think this issue shows up
everywhere and you know whether it's an
artist or a kite surfer or a table
tennis player or a coder somebody's
encoding whatever many people have
experienced this feeling of like taking
in data in real time and how amazingly
energizing it is and how much more
information you have and how much
smarter you are how much more creative
you are you know many people have
experiences they become so excited by it
they become evangelists and build a
whole body of knowledge but it's
essentially people discover the impact
of the direct experience circuitry and
you notice a lot more information about
the outside and the inside world you
notice many more things about internal
visceral States it's nothing to do with
meditations nothing to do with a
religion it's simply your ability to
control your attention to optimize data
processing and I think you know
especially for senior executives who
have massive amounts of data to process
I think it's extremely important that
they develop these muscles in any
organization that they develop these
muscles to be able to shift between
these two states as needed and it's not
about being in one or the other all the
time it's about being adaptive and being
able to know when you need to be in
which state so I think it's extremely

happy anyone was on a laptop which I
don't know if that's a record or what
but I'm really impressed with that and
hopefully you've made I think you've
made some new connections and some
insights drop your card up here I'll
send you links to that paper and a bunch
of the papers to kind of read and listen
to things and all the best with Mac with
optimizing your internal data processing
