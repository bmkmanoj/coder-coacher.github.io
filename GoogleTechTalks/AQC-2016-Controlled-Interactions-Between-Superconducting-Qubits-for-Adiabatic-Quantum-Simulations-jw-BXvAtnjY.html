qubits for adiabatic quantum simulation
in particular about controlled
interactions with superconducting qubits
and that's a work in collaboration
between suruc research IBM Zurich and
IBM in Yorktown and I should
particularly point out David McKay did
many of these experiments so the system
that we are doing the experiments with
is a superconducting circuits system
using transmen types transmen types
qubits and the main goal is basically
for the future regions to do digital
quantum computing Universal quantum
computing with this finally error
correction using Clifford gates
and so that we have already heard what
you can do with it but now it's
everybody now figures out that it's a
little bit a hard task in the near
future to do either so we need to do
something more for the near term and
that's adiabatic and an analog quantum
computing where you can do adiabatic
dynamics use shallow circuits and this
you don't probably need error correction
and so using this kind of platform for
all these different types we need to
somehow find out what the what can we do
in terms of interactions what kind of
interactions can be introduced to the
system to get for example to shallow
circuits so and the basic requirement is
we need to get two qubit gates and
interactions in these systems so let's
have a closer look what we have is a
superconducting qubit of the transmen
type hmm we have and as usual the
nonlinear Josephson Junction making the
qubit out of it and the interesting
thing is not that we get with this
system at t1 and t2 of 7,200 microsecond
and it's because we are using the most
simplest device that you can think of
it's just two electrodes which are
connected where one Josephson Junction
so it's a fixed frequency Hewitt and
that gives us no problems with flux
noise and long t1 times the second
element on this chip is microwave
resonators and these micro resonators
are
hopefully no transmission line
resonators as you probably all know or
most of you know and they serve
different purposes for example as noise
filters for either of qubit States but
what I am now interested in is how these
are used for multi cue with quantum
buses and how you can actually replace
this element by a different element
which gives you more flexibility in cup
coupling qubits something so what we
have at the moment here and there was
some sorry for this this slices so what
I should again point out now you see
that there is not so many tunable
elements the transparency is a single
Junction there is no flex to mobility
here there's no flux to mobility here so
how can we induce gates and the gates
that we are inducing is using microwave
control and how this is done at the
moment is using the cross resonance
gates and in brief you have in the
Hamiltonian that you write down you have
a C X interaction so a controlled X
interaction if you drive in this qubit
wire the first qubit so you have a
control qubit and you have a target
qubit if you drive now at the target
frequency the control qubit you see that
there are B rate of driving this qubit
depends on the state of the control
qubit and that's this controlled X term
here so with this you just have to wait
a little while until you get either the
qubit being in the ground state or in
the excited state depending on the state
of the first qubit so with this you can
make a gate you can make a controlled X
Kate out of it typically gate times are
400 nano seconds gate fatalities 94% but
there has not been recent results also
within IBM is that they can push the
gate fatalities 99% and about 160 nano
second gate times by using more clever
techniques in how to control these gates
but these gates have a little bit of
drawback and one of them is that the
qubits must be closed must be closely
based in frequency and that's what's
shown on this graph here there is one
region which is the good cubed limit
there is a leakage regime where you
don't want to be and there is a regime
where the gate is just weak and to be
here means that the cubit has to be
close in frequency and that's a problem
if you want to scan the system up to
multiple qubits we cannot do this simply
because due to the fabrication
constraints which give us approximately
5% are about 200 megahertz of a 5
gigahertz scale fabrication precision we
it's hard to get the qubits at the right
frequency so that's one type of problem
the other type of problem is that we
only get the control X term if we want
to use this for analog simulation or
adiabatic computing we need more
flexibility in the interactions we need
not only this term but we also want to
have other terms in this Hamiltonian you
see there SCC terms for example but they
are not easily controllable so we need
something else so let's compare what we
can get and how this compares to other
cubed gets what alternatives there are
so I just discussed the cross resonant
gate the advantage is that we can use no
fixed frequency qubits with long
coherence and long t1 and t2 times we
can unfortunately not have a low
microwave server has to use strong
microwave drives and the cubes have to
be close in frequency as alternative we
could not introduce flux tunable qubits
and use for example C phase gates C C's
which are relatively fast which have a
good on/off ratio the drawback is that
you suffer from one over F noise and
until this problem is not solved yet it
will degrade our t2 times and this is
not what we want the cousin of this gate
here is the swap gate so that's basic
about human to qubits on resonance again
we need flux to nobility but it would
give us a complementary interactions
which give us this xx plus YY gate there
is also other gates like geometric gates
they might be robust and they might be
good but at the moment
they are all slow as well so we're going
to have fixed frequency and long
coherence times we want to be relatively
fast and on the order of the coupling
strength between the qubits we want to
have a good on/off ratio and if possible
we want to have different types of
interaction at the same time so what can
we do we can actually follow an idea
which has been brought up by Patrice
Patti
in 2006 for flux qubits actually and and
redesign our coupling element in between
so we still keep our qubits as a single
junction of like a non tunable transmen
devices but we introduce now some
flexibility in our coupling element and
that's now also recently in a different
inductive version described in this
paper by Eliot Capet and also used in
the Martinez group so what we are doing
here we want to modulate now this J
coupling the coupling between these two
qubits and get to a time-dependent
Hamiltonian and this Hamiltonian is now
written in this way so we have this X X
interaction the interaction between the
two qubits which we can modulate in time
so what this means now if we go to the
rotating frame of the qubits and expand
this cosine and add the terms to this
Sigma X Sigma X interactions so you see
now I expand the Sigma X in a Sigma plus
plus Sigma minus term and I add now the
frequencies of the Sigma plus and Sigma
minus here so I what I get here is a sum
of terms where I get Sigma plus Sigma -
so that's the swap interaction where one
qubit excitation swaps to the other one
I get the plus plus terms which means
that both Hewitt's gets one excitation
and both lose one excitation I get these
terms from the cosine and each of these
terms has a certain frequency so now you
can easily see if I select now this
frequency properly I can get rid of some
of these terms for example if our jusnow
the modulation frequency to be the
difference frequency of the cube
it's like here it's only that this wop
term the Sigma plus Sigma minus is left
whereas these are oscillating so rapidly
that they can easily detect them in the
adiabatic eliminate those terms and
that's what I described here so this
gives you now certain flexibility in
using this modulation frequency I can
now either take now the choice of
frequency that I modulated that the
cubed difference frequency as described
here and I would get a swap indirection
this corresponds to xx plus YY
interaction I can also go ahead and
drive the system night to some frequency
which is going now from the zero zero
both Q is in the ground state to both
qubits in the excited state with this
choice of drive frequency of modulation
frequency I retain these terms and
that's just the blue sideband terms well
I transfer both qubits into the excited
state and what I can also do is I can
not only drive this transition here in
this transition I can also drive the 1 1
to 0 transition so either the double
excited state to the one qubit in the
second excited state and that
corresponds to than the C phase gate and
this gives me a CC to a type of term and
so with this type of gate I can actually
create xx YY and Cece interactions at
the same time but driving these
different interactions how can I do this
now one choice is you just insert here
another transmen type system or you can
have an anharmonic circuit something
which is tunable in frequency and so
making this choice just gives me again
the similar tone Ian there's something
missing here sorry for this
so what I do now I have this other
anharmonic system this is a third
unsimilar transmen and this changes in
frequency so with this change in
frequency I see now that my modulation
term changes here which should be here
and this modulation term is actually
dependent on the difference between the
tunable coupler and the qubits so there
should be a 1 over Delta here 1 over
Delta between Delta frequency between
the tunable coupler and 2 cubed and
tunable coupling to the second qubit
with this now I can get a gate the Sigma
plastic - gate witches can be up to a 50
- 25 megahertz is rough rough guess with
typical numbers for the coupling
strength I can get go to large cubed
cubed e tunings that means I can place
them apart by gigahertz and not only by
a hundred megahertz or so and I can also
maintain the coherence because the t1
and t2 is only affected in second order
the qubits basically don't see this
other coupling element if it's far away
in frequency and also during the gate
there is never a photon in this coupling
element it's only virtually populated
with it the experiment and that's the
sample so you see here there's the
readout resonators does qubit one qubit
to readout resonator for qubit - there
is a cup this univille bus coupling
element in between which has a squid
loop and the squid loop can be driven by
a high-speed flux line and what we get
if we do the experiment for example the
swap experiment I do now I excite key
with one eye
soon the modulate the coupler for a
certain time induces coupling here and
see that there is oscillations here and
I can extract now from the target state
estate preparation fatality of 97.4%
that was we got 9 preparing from the one
qubit excited state the superposition
bail state here I can also - randomized
benchmarking with forming a clifford
gate out of it so we're doing a nice
swap
and from this benchmarking randomized
benchmarking I get a number which is 98
point two for the interleaf benchmarking
of ninety seven point two for a standard
randomized benchmarking so for this
experiment it's pretty good and there's
room for improvement in yuning the
parameters properly to get more
separation between two univille cup
length cubed so what do we want now for
example for analog quantum simulation or
adiabatic optimization protocols we have
seen that they can get now these three
terms what I want as well is actually to
nobility on the single qubit terms and
this I can get as well by driving the
qubit so I can go to a driven system and
by driving the system I write down the
Hamiltonian
that's the qubit sigma see the qubit
frequency and in the Trivium system I
add now this X transverse drive
interaction if I go again to the
rotating frame and write down how these
translates into the rotating frame as
see now that by tuning the amplitude the
phase and difference between the drive
to difference frequency of the drive and
the qubit I can see that I can get to
this Hamiltonian where I can till now
the x y and z component individually by
choosing the parameters of microwave
drives and here I can go easily between
zero to fifty megahertz in in the
parameter range if I use at this
protocol for adiabatic annealing for
example I have to keep in mind that
municipal now works in a different way
it doesn't go to the crown's that will
go to a steady-state and that's probably
an interesting physics problem but just
to keep it in mind and that also means
that whatever I do I should be much
faster than than the coherence time so
what can I can this be used for and for
example we can you we can use this for
simulation of molecules adiabatic
simulation of molecules for example the
toy model of having a hydrogen molecule
like it's a pretty early
shown last year shown was in the
Martinez group I can tell it to a
different representation and in terms of
two qubits it has been shown in our
group that you can reduce this problem
to a two qubit problem where you have
these white terms so the same cubed
terms and xx and YY interaction which
should be tunable individually so we can
now go ahead start with the transverse
field Hamiltonian we can now go to this
adiabatic protocol driving the change
and pass parameters adiabatic Li I can
have not the ability in principle to go
to switch on simultaneously the XX + +
xx minus YY drives that this works at xx
+ - y white robes will be checked we
just have to do now at the simultaneous
driving and then I can find out with
this protocol the adiabatic Li going
from the initial state to the ground
state and when doing now a numerical
simulation and checking whether this
will can happen within the coherence
time of the qubit I find that the need
approximately for a certain range of our
parameters of Ray of a variety I of the
age to Adam I can find that I have to be
faster than approximately 10 micro
second and that's well within the
coherence time of our qubit another
outlook is I can use now for the CC
interaction for quantum adiabatic
optimizations of worth driving this
transition here I can induce a phase
shift on to the 1 1 term and I can we
check that this chaser
so the CC interaction we can get up to
and similar strength in this interaction
and so this should be useful then also
for quantum adiabatic optimization
problems another thing I want to mention
here that this bus architecture this bus
design can be extended and it's also a
nice thing is now you can not only
couple to two qubits at the same time
you can also imagine that you have now
more than two for example here it's
four cubits you can have one coupling
element and because now all these
transitions that are discussed are
driven we have frequency selection you
can drive now between different cubed
frequency you can drive selectively
interactions between the different
qubits and this could be useful for
looking into spinning cubic lattices
with nearest neighbor coupling and it
could be useful for the parity adiabatic
quantum computing architecture where we
would need a five-way coupler and this
will be discussed in the talk by working
tomorrow
so with this I come to the conclusion
and so what we have is a tunable
coupling gate which retains a long
coherence of our rotating frame qubits
it provides us with stochastic and non
stochastic xx YY and Cece terms it is
controllable in amplitude phase and
frequency it is fast relatively fast of
the order of the J coupling strength
between the qubit and we get high
fidelity at the moment which is 98%
randomized benchmarking for the swap
gate and this can be useful for it as a
tunable interactions for quantum analog
adiabatic quantum simulations and
computation but also for gate primitives
in surface called quantum computing
architectures and we just want to thank
you for your attention for the 98%
randomized benchmark what was the time
at the gate I missed that I 150
nanoseconds okay and what were the
coherence times of the qubits in this
case it was 30 t2 was 30 microseconds
okay approximately in t1 was I think was
50 or so so in this it was a little bit
lower than the standard qubits and
that's because the coupler was still hot
so there is room for improvement in this
but in principle it's the same it's like
good the other question I had is going
back to the recent result from the
yorktown grew with about 99% yeah that
was because they got the cubed
frequencies close to each other they
were able to make it fast and accurate
exactly so it was the main thing was for
the cross resonance you need strong
microwave drives so there was not a
sample was that you had a direct
microwave drive there and then you can
actually have the power to drive the
gate but then you have to worry about
all these other terms like the CCI C and
C Y and all these terms and then you
need to introduce compensation drives
and care unguent
so lately they got it all compensated
right it you have to be able to
compensate this and know what the system
does so that is that way do you know
what the off kathleen was because that's
an important figure of Merit - it was a
think of the order of don't hundred
kilohertz - a megahertz so it was
because the qubits were closed easier I
mean that's the on/off ratio which you
cannot avoid because you have two qubits
to be closed in frequency thank you so
you're proposing this hardware to do
quantum annealing in a sense right
that's what I said yeah so but all the
interaction you are getting for
tunability and interaction with your
driving the system so do are you
proposing to do any link in some
rotating framework
okay I think there are many open
questions answers yes that kind of work
yes I agree
yes so you get this stochastic and non
stochastic terms but this is achieved by
the single drive of your coupler so how
to nibble is this ratio between all
terms since all of them are different so
you can drive the couple at different
frequencies and basically the amplitude
really drive the coupler tells you about
the ratio of sort of the coefficients of
the X X plus y Y or the coefficient of
the X X minus y Y so in principle you
have tunability over all these
components simultaneously right not just
amplitude it should be also some and
phase I mean we can also make them plus
minus so in principle you can tune them
as you wish nice in the sense of cross
talk and noise of stochastic noise I
think crosstalk will be an issue because
if you're driving the qubits you will
offers mental drive or other transitions
and then you have to be able to avoid
transitions or being able to calibrate
it properly so and that will be will
tell you about how you have to space
your qubits and this will tell you how
many qubits you can actually put onto
the same coupling element okay thank you
one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
