know the people who write code which
really hasn't changed in 56 years which
I just still very true that's easier to
you guys do it but it's easier to write
code than understand something that
somebody else did so hopefully I'm going
to give you this very deep historical
picture of how this is the world we're
in got here at the beginning but
hopefully you get something from it the
text it actually is useful so I'm going
to talk mainly about von Neumann who who
really brought Touring's ideas into into
the commercial world touring head was a
logician who at the time was was
probably seen as like the least likely
took various disciplines in the 1930s
logic looked like about the farthest
removed from reality the logicians were
were left very much to themselves but in
the end it did it did have real effect
so if we go I had all these documents
chronologically organized I can look and
so I could look to this morning see well
what happened exactly 60 years ago on
the 9th of April this is the monthly
report on Von Neumanns computer project
there's transcribed there so for the
very first time they're actually taking
a coded message that was coated on
magnetic wire and reading it into the
shift registers inside the computer they
were trying to build and then outputting
it back out on the wire and having
actually getting the same message out
that they put in when that was a
tremendous breakthrough and that
happened exactly 60 years ago so here's
the typewritten coded input and the that
this was their wire drive so this is the
ancestor of your hard disk this was a
spool of electrical recording wire on
two bicycle wheels that were
differentially coupled so it was as you
ran that path force power motor it was
unwinding from one spool and winding up
on the other at a very high speed you
need
you needed the high speed to get the
high you know the high bitrate and it
would burn up the heads and stuff that's
that's a picture with iron filings
showing so each of these is a bit and
here we have a silly Graham a silly
graph of a that's a 40-bit word they
used the machine was 40 bits wide ran
bit parallel structure which was
revolutionary at the time so that's
actually a 40-bit word and get so
getting useful computation out of that
was a it was a real stroke of
engineering genius so even when they
were at that dismal stage of getting the
hardware to work hanoi minh and
goldstein and others were already
working on the codes that were going to
run on this machine that they thought
was going to be ready in six months but
it was actually more more like for you
know three or four years still actually
get the thing running but they were
writing the coast that's the first
essentially the first software manual
and Von Neumanns view which which he
always credited directly deterring there
was never any conflict at the time that
that what phenomen told the engineers
who came to work for me we are going to
build Touring's crazy logical machine
we're going to actually do it in
hardware so if annoy minh who lived 1903
so when Vinay minh was my age he already
been dead for one year so you got an
awful lot done in this short period of
time starting out very young in had the
good fortune to be born in in budapest
between world and sort of go to school
and grow up in budapest between World
War One World War two is this incredibly
fertile time that produced Vinoy minh
eugene wigner layouts allarde Paul Erdos
a whole galaxy of people somehow came
out of that world and then and then
fortunate enough we gave them visas and
they came to America so this is young
Johnny up there you see what he's
actually sitting on it on this giant
piece cyan't cannon a piece of artillery
yeah he had a great fondness for weapons
and this just stayed with him throughout
his life here he is with John von
Neumann and very
Brown so the rocket guy and the computer
guy who they you know they all came to
America at age 12 he's already doing
math this is his cousin Lily he's
founded you know he has his gift for
mathematics it was almost appalling how
how many feels about six major fields in
mathematics that he revolutionized this
is his class at the lutheran gymnasium
which was sort of like the Bronx High
School of Science but but squared just
incredibly rich but and it's unclear
I've been part of very study something
figure out why things worked so well and
hungry at the time if art it was
desperation part it was a Hungarian
language nobody else learns Hungarian so
if you're Hungarian you have to learn
some language that the rest of the world
is ready to listen to and that's I think
why we have so many great Hungarian
mathematicians musicians Hungarians
cinematographers filmmakers all so had
to find these universal languages by
which they could survive in the larger
world and the culture if you read you
know the Diaries and people who grew up
then their parties that went on three or
four days there were sort of mix of
partying and drinking an intellectual
conversation was there was sort of rich
intellectual life that that and then
teaching was really honored i mean the
the best teachers went to teach high
school actually not university so was
very rich that's phenomenal his family
and but very hard to get jobs so he
immediately had to get a job in he's
working in berlin at and already
publishing serious papers and then in
nineteen thirty comes to America he and
bigner are given a time princeton
university had a quota against jewish
students very strictly and against
jewish professors not as strict so they
they offered one professorship tool
ignorant and vana me that they shared so
they both got a telegram they each
thought that there been a typographic
error in the telegram with a salary they
were offered he was about ten times what
you got in budapest and then they
compared notes and realize it wasn't a
mistake and came to the princeton
university then in nineteen thirty
the bamberger's who were the equivalent
of Jeff Bezos here in Seattle so the
merchant Prince decided to start this
institute for advanced study where there
would be no instructions as to what
you're supposed to do you just could
work on whatever you felt like working
on and the private was started the money
came from the bamberger's in the idea
came from Abraham Flexner who believed
in this usefulness of useless knowledge
and it worked very well produced a lot
of useful ideas and a lot of people
waste wasted threats our lives there
they gave two classes of memberships you
either were invited for one year or you
were invited for life was very little in
between and it still exists that way
today and so phenomena is a guess an
appointment there in 1933 which is
impossible to resist versus going back
to Hungary where things looked really
bad so the Institute was built it was
this very much like like Google
headquarters and mountain view just
built to to be everyone's dream come
true free food free places to live
cafeteria was on the top floor a very
comfortable lounge in the bottom floor
was home to the first professor was
Oswald vemlan who was a very much of
applied mathematician and a pure math
Asian and then the second professor was
a sign which gave them their reputation
so their famous is the place where
Einstein ended up if you go in the main
entrance you see professor Veblen an
actually professor Einstein of an island
whose right next to the common room
because he's so so social so that's the
first floor on the second floor who's
above vinoy minh is good good and this
is important because the computer
project actually started in this room
next to girdle and I think good goodwill
had an impact on the on the birth of
computing we don't really recognize that
this whole idea that you could address
40 bit numbers give them a 5-bit address
and then manipulate those five bit
addresses and you actually are
manipulating 40 bit numbers that was
really what led to the explosion of
computing and that was really good as I
yeah because that that's how he proved
his you know he's big theorem that
revolutionized the role was by this idea
you could give concepts numerical
addresses and then manipulate the
concepts with arithmetic and then and
then prove that the true things would be
unprovable so there's girl who lose very
close friends with nice i'm primarily
they both spoke german and in good old
great paper of 1931 which was sort of
the predecessor of what touring did he
course credits one no i mean he'd been
collaborating with anointment back in
europe so that the all these ideas came
sort of to america at the same time the
institute besides job very much of
rescuing people from Europe so here in
1939 they're trying to bring all the
people out they can and paying very
little so so you know the air goes to
has this reputation if he's got going
around sort of begging for food and and
sleeping at people's houses camping out
but he you know he got 700 few dollars a
year those are the yearly salaries Kirk
Godel was was two hundred dollars a
month so they maximize what they could
was a very low budget to bring these
people so infinitely showed up with all
this computing money from from the
Atomic Energy Commission IBM that was
that was really something it was like
again like Google showing up and giving
all you guys jobs so mine island is
there and he immediately sees that this
is a letter that's a historically
important unknown to historians but
preceded the manhattan project where he
saying the basic he's heard through the
grapevine that the Germans are starting
to work on nuclear efficient for weapons
and this is a proposed he's actually in
Ozil Veblen Veblen ran the ballistics
programmable over one they're proposing
to the rockefeller foundation to start
bringing european physicists out of
Europe the Manhattan Project had not not
started yet and this was actually very
important because it's one reason when
Manhattan Project did begin we already
had a lot of these physicists in on our
side and so nominee he could he couldn't
look at any he just loved problems if
there was a practical problem he would
figure out some new kind of mathematics
so he looked at the problem how you
would create a
atomic bomb and the real problem was
getting a high pressure you needed to
get an implosion of conventional
explosives he figured the math out for
that that led to shape charges and a
bunch of other things and led to the
implosion weapons that we still all of
nuclear weapons we use today are based
on that design this is the first one the
Trinity test in Alamogordo in 1945 and
that sort of gave people who worked on
that were a lot of worthies purim
athletes who sort of went bad during the
war von Neumann Richard Feynman who
never worked on weapons again and Stan
ghulam who went on to do the key
breakthrough on the hydrogen bomb so
suddenly these sort of people who've
been working in pure you know my name is
started in the foundations of set theory
and so on suddenly they're allowed to
have machine shops and work with you
know hundreds of people helping them and
so on it was very very seductive so
after the war was over in the bombs are
going off the question being what was
next and for vanilla and the answer was
very clear that the next big thing was
going to be computers but not only
computers it also was going to be more
more bombs and that the so the real push
to do this project and where have I
known even got the money was to design
the next generation of weapons that
needed was really a computational
problem the big I mean you know all our
cell phones now more computing power
than Los Alamos design even when they
designed our current stockpile weapons
so the big decision was not you know
dropping the bombs on Japan was a huge
decision but even bigger one was this
this decision to go start testing in the
Pacific and that's really what pushed
the course the Russians to keep up and
started the whole Cold War race we
didn't need to do that but we couldn't
resist 19 we could know what would
happen as a hydrodynamics when if you
set off a 20 kiloton explosion
underwater that you know that was so
couldn't resist doing that and they did
and that's really how the explosion of
me the people in England and elsewhere
we're also thinking about computers but
it was this American push through the
through the weapons for me that really
led to them the money and the resources
to actually so in that sense fun I mean
he didn't ideas were not original to him
but he was the right guy in the right
place the right time to make it happen
the ideas came had been sort of
fermenting for four centuries this is
thomas hobbes this is the beginning of
that darwin long machines book who
really was the first in the English
language to talk about what we now we
call recursive functions the idea that
all the processes of logic and even
thought can be reduced to simple
addition and subtraction I think if you
build an adding machine you can do
everything else you can get the the
other functions and then as good ol
showed if you have a risk you know if
you have arithmetic all everything
becomes possible and also Hobbes thought
about machines ultimately having a life
of their own which which was van Owen
was obsessed with for the end of his
life and Leibniz who is the was Hobbs
his colleague on the on the continental
European side who worked deeply in
binary arithmetic trying to showing how
all the algorithms could be developed to
do all this stuff with with binary code
and in this manuscript of 1679 so well
i'll tell you a 303 or fifty years ago
he proposes building a machine that the
adding machines at the time worked with
wheels and cranks and he's talking about
now a machine with with using black and
white marbles that run down tracks and
by shifting them you can do all the
functions of binary thematic so he what
he's done is invented the shift register
which is essentially how all computers
still work except instead of marbles and
gravity its electrons in a voltage
gradient but all the principles were
there and and this is of course that's
the quote that sparked Neal Stephenson
to write his last trilogy that sort of
all based on the idea what could have
happened so there's the shift register
that phenomen and his engineers designed
so is it actually it's exactly live nits
idea brought to life and people at the
time you know they call these things
mechanical brains
and and now we think that's very silly
but it really wasn't that silly of
course in the context of the time
everyone was thinking that way this is a
proposal to the Air Force from RCA you
know for a memory system and you know
they're using the brain as there is
their model this is a hundred years
earlier Alfred Smee who did the first
real work on neural networks and had all
these I'd crazy ideas about the
electrical networks in the brain you
invented electric type printing to make
counterfeit proof banknotes a whole
bunch of other crazy things he also then
fat I've message for sending fax similes
and actually compressing the images very
much like JPEGs where you have a very
small number of pixels convey more
information and here and he also
explained I think it's still the best
explanation in print of you know people
write these long 600 bucks about
consciousness and that's that's really
it in three sentences that if there's
reality and there's thought as you can
tell the difference that's consciousness
and I think that's what that's great and
then this is as far as I know the first
document that really describes a search
engine he describes this giant machine
that would contain all concepts and be
able to search out the the points of
contact to the differences so it would
be good for deciding you know
similarities and differences between
religions and things like that and then
the faneuil horns quoted him so the idea
was in the air that you know that
networks were going to take over the
world it just took another 150 years for
you guys to really make it happen and
then the old question of artificial
intelligence I think was answered
clearly in 1930 by Louis fry Richardson
who here has a unstable sort of
quantumly unpredictable circuit here
that he calls it's a mind having a will
but capable of only two ideas so it you
know there's no point at which
artificial intelligence necessarily
begins it's like life we don't we may
never find the exact origin of life just
sing slowly became more and more
lifelike and Louis fry Richardson was
actually very serious he this was not so
serious but he did the first work on
numerical weather prediction in world
war one trying to divide proposed
dividing the whole world into into a
network of cells and then solving the
differential equations between the the
cells you would they if you estimate if
you had 64,000 human computers working
together you could do this you would
actually keep up with the weather itself
so we had 65,000 you could start to
predict the weather and his his math was
wrong but the idea was is actually how
we how we do our numerical weather
prediction today and that obsessed hanoi
minh later and hg wells with this book
which is this would be the bible of
google is really explaining how we would
be able to distribute all knowledge to
make it accessible to everyone in the
world got an incoming call and and keep
it safe which is the beauty of it if
something exists on a conferencing with
our neighbors and he makes the political
point that this would that this could be
which is still your argument today this
could be used by dictators to control
the world but it would be more likely to
be used by anti dictators to keep keep
the world free from dictators so that it
really is where where we are that we and
then touring comes along and asks really
the as a mathematician can the question
of Ken machines think can we actually
deal with this in a mathematical way and
so he also had like fun I mean it's very
short lives 1912 to 1954 even even less
than vinoy Minh it does a tremendous
amount in that short time right to this
paper in 1936 it seemed completely crazy
at the time it proposes this machine
that has an infinite supply of tape and
can do nothing but right and remember
ones and zeros on this infinite tape and
in the end shows shows both the power of
what you can do and what you can't do
with that with what we now call the you
know the touring universal machine and
then so what are you proposing at what
girdle had done that if you could build
these machines you could all you could
take everything that that people think
is ingenuity you could dissect it and
replace or what people think is
intuition you could replace with
ingenuity and that's that's essentially
what what computing is still doing just
replacing intuition every place you see
some intuition you can replace it with
enough ingenuity now we have sort of
unlimited ingenuity at the time of
course the war came along and that
became that's the same way that but
nyman suddenly could realize his dreams
through the bomb project touring got to
realize them through the cryptography
problem the problem that that the
Germans were sinking u-boats by having
better codes that we couldn't crack so
this was this machine called the
Colossus which is running these tapes
running the German signals on tapes and
and using very clever sort of Bayesian
statistics to eliminate the probably
wrong keys and and overnight find the
right key so Tory and the tragedy is
that so much of what Turing did was kept
secret but after the war so the same
time as von neumann's this is 1948 the
small group in Manchester starts
building a bond diamond computer to
actually get the they get the design and
the the sort of blueprints from vanai me
but they build a smaller version and
they get it the British style to get it
done quicker so they get this Manchester
machine actually running in 1948 the
president machine contains the minimum
set of facilities for a universal
machine it only has 31 bits of memory of
core memory but in that but it still is
if you give it you know half the time of
the universe it could do any any
turing-complete that's touring with his
first commercial machine and the point
he made that you know that the important
thing was being digital more important
than being electronic so on the British
side the Turkish was thinking very hard
about artificial intelligence and
mechanizing sort thought processes that
didn't go anywhere so quick as on the
American side which again is unknown to
historians but von Neumann already in
May 1945 he had a he i was on retainer
to IBM and that's one reason that that
so much of these ideas became
commercially somewhat successful in
america was that the in Britain they
were still being kept secret in America
IBM was was starting to look at
commercializing up but even 1990 46 that
the you know the maintenance manual for
the ENIAC is still a restricted document
so the secrecy really hurt the NOI Minh
gets the job of being assigned to build
the next generation of the ENIAC which
is going to be called the egg vac and
rice this report which which he was not
the sole author of but but he he got his
name on the cover
and good time for questions here we go
okay great so and immediately you know
one of the most important parts of the
whole the whole spectrum is the code so
he's really doing exhibits had done 30
years earlier figure out how you can
build all these binary processes and how
do you things that we complete take for
granted now we adder is an adder we
don't think about how do you build an
adder but at that time how do you
actually design an ad or out of vacuum
tubes were a lot of different ways of
doing it and then what now we call the
von Neumann architecture with a central
arithmetic unit now we would call the
CPU in the central control the internal
memory the input output and the
recording medium which would be our like
the hard disk so all those elements were
there and we're sort of stuck with them
ever since and so he starts getting the
money from the Army in the Navy and
starts building this thing but
immediately is thinking of it as a you
know as an instrument scientific
instrument there would not be that he
made very clearly wanted to do this not
in industry where it would be patented
and protected and not in the government
were to be secret but at the Institute
where it would be open and copied all
over the world and that actually worked
pretty well so the first meeting was
november 1945 in flawda mere workings
office the guy in the middle who is a
russian the russian guy who brought
really brought televisions to america
and now wanted to bring computing to
america until rch sort of got cold feet
so in this first meeting they lay out
the sort of 10 commandments and these
are the three important ones the most
important that words coding the orders
are handled in the memory just like
numbers and that really makes this big
fundamental sort of breaking of symmetry
like in physics we're up until until
that moment we use numbers to represent
things numbers would represent
quantities or mean things and then
suddenly now we have numbers that acts
really can do things numbers are given
are allowed to control the operation of
the computer and that that's really why
the whole world we ended up with and
that's the actual document where that
idea first came up it let orders let a
word they didn't have bits yet 40 binary
digits be two orders each order is a
command and an address so it's the
origin of the command line that we
actually would have an instruction in an
address and then do that and then go on
to the next step that's really how it
all started and it started that Goodell
had an office for a secretary but he
didn't want a sec made him nervous
having a secretary so hit 211 was empty
so when they started out the issue it
was very crowd it was after the war they
couldn't build new buildings but they
said well you could use this little an X
next to Google's office so that's where
the computing group started out and
wrote these first reports when as i said
earlier think probably getting some of
their ideas by osmosis from good old
budget very low so the first four months
it's only four thousand seven hundred
dollars less than five thousand dollars
and then the next month you see the
beginning of the end it's the first four
dollars for electrical work so it's
finally now that you know there was it
was a school of pure math decisions who
really didn't want this to happen at the
Institute things like an and or gate all
that has to be decided sort of and then
cast in stone and doing all this with
vacuum tubes which are not not really
very digital finding this sort of binary
you know coaxing vacuum tubes to behave
in a binary way was not easy and
figuring out how to how to do the
structure of shift registers and all
this stuff so the whole machine had 3474
tubes the ENIAC at 18,000 so it was it
was compared to the ENIAC it was a
microprocessor Fred if you have time
please tighten all nuts everything done
by hand so for the Institute it was a
shock where all this pure abstract
thought it wasn't just Einstein it was
there was Greek history
in art history and so on these were
suddenly disturbed by guys walking
around with soldering guns and so Julian
Bigelow who had worked for Norbert
Wiener as his engineer in World War two
became the lead engineer Herman
goldstine came from the Army and managed
the project robert Oppenheimer who
became director of the Institute that
would come from Los Alamos and von
Neumann they were sort of the
supervising group and then all these
young people came in and helped build
the computer and then went on and built
like this is Jerry Estrin over there
with a bowtie who then went to Israel
and built the first computer and Israel
copied this so von neumann's idea that
the thing would propagate throughout the
world worked worked very well and and
then a lot of women doing the
programming and coding so it's very
crazy happy group of people in a very
fertile environment but nowhere for them
to live so here there and nowhere to
actually build the machine here the
director is proposing it really the only
place they could start building it is in
the basement next to the men's
laboratory and that's where they started
which actually today now is the server
room for the Institute so it's still
doing except now there's you know
astronomical amount more computing and
even here he's one of the classical
historians is complaining that the
engineers are moving into the basement
so they haven't had a hard time and
mathematicians in our wing over my dead
body that's from the historian so it was
with it so these were you know the
original computer geeks and now the
director directors complained of an
annoying minh that that these guys are
coming up and take putting too much
sugar in their tea which was rationed at
that time so after the war sugar was
still rationed they should come up and
have their tea under proper supervision
but the programmers got the revenge
because now if you go to the institute
today the only places has 24-hour tea
and coffee is Shimoni hall which was
built by charles Shimoni the microsoft
program or so
in the end the historians were lost out
they never did at the doll all is
computing was dumb as the machine was
done just by inputting by hand but they
they envisioned the console to make this
thing look sort of sexier this was their
mock-up of a you know but this is who
didn't support sort of carrying this
forward any but that was it which has a
binary keyboard where you has a 40-bit
keyboard so you can you can program
directly in in binary code straight
there was no no alphanumeric keyboard
envisioned by these guys so that they
thought and and wrote reports every step
of the way which Jack good who was the
he's the guy who brought Bayesian
statistics into he was touring
statistical assistant so a whole lot of
the ideas that you use now in making
search working song really where Jack
Goods original ideas and made this
comment that that you know they not only
explain what they did they explain why
they did it so all these reports were
collected and distributed widely if you
look on the you know where did they go
in her library alone IBM RCA National
Cash Register company so all the idea is
that the flowered into the commercial
computing industry most of them came
from from this project and then things
like the basic machine order codes once
they were developed they were like our
own genetic code it sort of stays
unchanged for billions of years because
you don't you don't change these
fundamental things that start at the
bottom and the machine itself was very
beautiful was Bigelow he was a real
engineer he flew his own airplane and
worked on his own engines and so the
thing was built it was essentially a v40
engine and each of these cylinders is is
a cathode ray tube that has a 32 by 32
matrix of bits so there's 40 bit words
and a thousand words in each so one bit
of each word is in a different tube so
everything had to work perfectly or it
didn't work and then the so it really
was like no v40 engine with overhead
valves literally
there's a statistic so you 16 kilowatts
was very little at the time 24 micro
second at memory access so that was the
first time we had a machine that had
fully random access to the memory you
could you could take any address and get
the data out at any time whereas the
British machine was still serial you had
to wait for this loop to come through
and grab the bida as it went by the
classmate was variable with vary between
two kilocycles and 16 but you could
actually slow it right down to manual so
you could go one click at a time and you
could see the bits every bit was visible
so if you if something if you were
debugging you could actually step
through the calculation and very clever
and the good cooling system so these
tubes actually have so that what
happened was a situation now you know
there's solid state memory inside this
laptop and it's being displayed as
pixels on the screen in this first
computer the the pixels actually were
the memories if you take a you have an
old television and you turn it off for
about a second or two there's static on
the faces of glass so they were using
the the surface of the tube they had to
figure out the rule what numbers roads
you could only use off-the-shelf sort of
war surplus parts so these are standard
war surplus oscilloscope tubes and then
they put a screen on the face and an
amplifier with a 30,000 gained 30
thousand fold gain on the amplifier and
this this was an idea that was sort of
jointly developed between the British
and the Americans during the war for
storing radar images so you have this
matrix of spots 32 by 32 so that's a
thousand k and each spot is refreshed
every you know in milliseconds but if
you go back in microseconds you can read
whether a bit is is dark or light so it
became a random access memory where the
pixels actually were the memory they
were
not the display of the memory that's
sort of a profound the way things work
in biology where things get completely
switched in their use so incredible
clock cycles to get this to work to keep
this thing refreshed it's sort of like
storing information in between the cycle
refresh cycles on a television but was
quite effective but then the difference
between a a1 and a0 between a dash and a
dot is this very sloppy kind of
difference and things were always going
wrong that's the first as far as I know
the first bit map display we're actually
displaying memory that's inside the
memory of the computer and effort so
every tube had its own log book
documenting its problems and
idiosyncrasies and and here the if they
went bad the first thing was to take him
out and tapping because maybe it was a
piece of dust he's sitting on a bucket
of tape of coding tape so the Neyman was
became very interested that this problem
that how do you how can you get reliable
compute a shin using sloppy components
and if we had not got two transistors
and so on we would have gone much
further with the ideas but now what the
world today is exactly reversed it now
that the hardware is essentially
completely reliable you know billions of
cycles you have no failures but the
software is unreliable but the problem
is the same how you know and it was
exactly n what what you guys are doing
is how do you get reliable reliable
systems using unreliable parts and
people doing unreliable things so Phenom
became fascinated by that as a whole
sort of theoretical problem on its own
but in reality the poor engineers they
had no time to think about it figure
they just had to get this machine to
work because we were trying to design
these bombs so that's the first log book
November 1951 they finally get the
machine running and I'll just show you
some of the some of the I hope you guys
keep log books like this too so you know
they keep track of the good time in the
bad time 25 minutes bad time 37 minutes
of 20 minutes of machine error 37
minutes of human error so they're always
trying to differentiate between the
human error and the machine error no use
went home everything
hexadecimal before closing down and
discussed burning the midnight oil so
they essentially the bomb guys usually
ran late at night and the media they
were doing meteorology as some was as a
smokescreen for the bomb work but during
the day they were doing meteorology so
he's looking in to number 36 trying to
you know trying to understand what was
going wrong here's a demonstration for
dr. von Neumann so they're hoping that
works and these are all checksum so
every every step of the way they did a
checksum across the whole machine and
all calculations were duplicated you
didn't you everything was they could
have built two computers but they just
ran the same one twice so you did every
calculation every step two times and
didn't move to the next step until you
had the same answer twice so here the
memory has turned into garbage they're
not getting it you know does everything
we just suddenly grind to a halt
impossible to follow this damn thing
where's the directory so they're ready
they're looking for for manual they were
doing a core dump what we would call a
cordon of yon stay big trouble now they
got a drum they started putting some of
the secondary memory on the drum they
abandoned the wire drive and the drum
was having a lot of trouble surface all
scored right down to the prime coat
looks like a bane bearing let go
telegram sent to ER a arithmetic not
even put a flick so now do you know
everyone's always trying to blame the
other guy it's not our problem it's you
know terrific false start machine or
human maniac that was the it was a
successor to the ENIAC which was
electronic numerical integrator
calculate this was the mathematical and
numerical integrator in calculator maint
known as maniac they gave up the name
Coderre machine not guilty so thank you
for starting to change found trouble in
code I hope damn it I can be just as
stubborn as this thing
what's the use good night master control
off the hell with it way off so sunday
we just set down and here at physical
problems because Princeton is a very hot
place yes yeah yeah code yeah it's
interesting code was there right from
the beginning but not even always called
them codes I don't think he invented I
mean it just came from I mean code was a
but it became the common you submit is
interesting because bit really has been
nailed down that was that was John
Tookie finally got tired of saying
binary digit so let's just call it bit
and that that was apparently january
early nineteen forty six &amp;amp; word i don't
know who came up with word but word
again as soon as they decided to do this
parallel architecture they called it a
word fact they even called it i don't
think they calling words in the delay
line memory they didn't because the
other phone memory was where you had a
tank and you just ran the recycled to
think she would tank so let's
so this one that there's a tar-like
substance on the cards and then it
realized it's the targets from the roof
it's getting so hot in the computer room
the tar is melting out of the roof and
then hear a mouse climbed into the
blower behind the regulator rack set
blower to vibrating result no more mouse
and a hell of a racket and here lies
mouth born ? died 450 am a 27 so they
were working late one day a 415 the
morning after a long night of bomb
calculations of smiles died and then
some Joker has written here lies Marston
mouse and if you're repetition you know
the the purest of the pure math editions
there was Marston Morse who was one of
people who objected me the truth is he
didn't object to the computing front he
thought it was a great project but it
should be done somewhere else it didn't
belong at the Institute so that that's a
dig at Marston Morris so high speed
which was 16 kilocycles even eight
kilocycles was high speed and there's
low speed to kill of cycles and so
everything had to be duplicated I've now
duplicated both results how will I know
which is right assuming one result is
correct and if they're duplicated the
wrong answer this is now the third
different output I know when I'm licked
so and then now so that we're getting to
1958 right the whole project is about to
be shut down but Norman is already dead
and now things that really changed all
troubles were code troubles they've got
the machine running smoothly and they're
sort of coming into the world we're in
now we're really the problems are mainly
software not not hardware they haven't
invented drivers yet and but and then
sometimes just perfect running and then
they weren't supposed to reveal that
they were actually working on bombs but
here the engineers put back over to
blast wave and in the logbook so the
results were you know fantastic the
calculations you know this machine we
got the first hydrogen bomb mighty Mike
was huge success the second one was 15
was actually an ran away it was three
times the yield it was supposed to so it
you know these little numbers in the
computer that suddenly we're having real
major effects on the real world the the
stranger get like touring in the war
that it was a tragic way the things had
to be kept secret so Oppenheimer who got
in so much trouble really lost his job
because he was seen as having opposed to
hydrogen bomb actually they were you
know they were essentially building it
right there under his command but he
couldn't talk about it so things were
really looking bad that's from some of
unknowns you know private letters to his
wife and you're saying is that the he
thinks the next war is between two years
and ten years away and it's definitely
going to be nuclear and it's probably
going to involve hydrogen hydrogen bomb
so he was actually seriously pushing
that we should attack the Soviet Union
before they grew strong enough to attack
us which which again seems crazy now but
in his rational way as a game theorists
it was the thing to do so here we see
the very dawn of this computing project
stand and Nick that's Stan Frankel can
now say they're openly coming from Los
almost instead of just state they were
coming under assumed names and renting
apartments and so on and again van I
mean look at the problem in what with
who labs help invents it's a whole new
form of mathematics between we now we
call a Monte Carlo method ideally suited
to computers so here they're running the
first Monte Carlo problems but they're
running them on the ENIAC this was
nineteen forty seven so the Princeton
machine was nowhere near ready but
they've invented all this coding so what
they do is they figure out hey we could
actually run these programs on the
immigrant kind of retrofit the ENIAC use
these numerical registers were built for
storing ballistic constants and actually
put program very short programs in them
so here klar even know him and his wife
is explaining there's a new method based
on a vocabulary ie a set of orders which
is conveyed to the machine on two levels
the background coding and the problem
coding and that's the great sort of the
origins of the Opera
system the fact that you have one level
of coding to set the Machine up and then
run your programs and this sort of
answer is a huge historical debate which
was whether the you know von Neumann was
first or whether the ENIAC was first
actually running stored programs and the
truth is in between it makes a lot of
sense that they actually invented this
for the vinoy machine but then they
figured out later they could get it to
run on the ENIAC so in the classical
genealogy of computing the ENIAC is
right at the bottom the IAS machine is
up there and and what what I've done is
historian is somewhat show how the
influences actually went the other way
and the IAS machine actually influenced
the uniacke that's clari by no means
second wife who he married 1937 and all
I managed to find it's like finding
somebody's dead disk drive all the let
private letters between the two of them
for 20 years from 1937 257 so it gives a
real pic a first-hand picture what
happened during that time they drove
they were driving from no
air-conditioning no seatbelts no iPods
or nothing just AM radio and leaded
gasoline you know 28 times so a lot of
time to think and write handwritten
letters so Clary he taught on these long
drives he taught Clary how to program so
she actually all these early montecarlo
programs she did and here in her she
kept a journal she's explaining how you
know he needed a guinea pig to teach
programming to and there she was so he
taught it to her and she loved it she
became sort of the first with everybody
see the word coder she became one of the
first coders an occupation which is
widespread today so to have the first
hand record of the very early
programming here that's the program for
one of these a spot problems and all
these letters back and forth which is
the handwriting a sense it just brings
it to life in a way you don't get with
email and the conventional view is that
that the women who did these programming
they did all he understood was the
original a burnt they were supposed to
know they were working on bombs in fact
they didn't they didn't know what they
were working on they just did the pray
but it's really not true if you read her
journal
this one letter it's clear she she
understands the physics of what's
happening they're doing a neutron
diffusion problem for hydrogen bomb
calculation in 1949 which didn't work
but they're trying to see so these these
are long long calculations the
calculation might take in this case six
weeks on the ENIAC and you're you're
getting a 1-bit answer you're getting a
yes/no answer does it explode or fizzle
out so along the way she's watching the
calculation and writing back you know
saying well I think we should change the
tamper it's it's starting to fizzle out
which so clearly shows she wasn't
supposed to but she didn't know what the
physics was about and here it was
explains why did he take all this money
it was sort of deal with the devil the
AEC sort of said well you can have the
computers but we get the bombs but if
the aec got the military got the bombs
then the scientists could do whatever
they wanted with the computers and
that's the so here he's talking to
Edward Teller really how the factor for
which is showing that the hydrogen bomb
might work it's a gift of God or a gift
of the devil and does that deal was
macer lapa Tyra made that deal to that
if he would give the government the bomb
then the government would give would let
the people of Samos do whatever they
wanted otherwise in science and they did
and that changed the world a whole lot
of the what revolutionized genetics and
everything else came out of work that
was done at Los Alamos and that sadly
missing now now it sort of been closed
down there's not so much real science so
if I never wanted what he wanted to do
was biology the he figured out the
hydrogen bomb that was a way of
completely destroying life the next
problem was how about creating life and
he worked on that too which again was
unknown he didn't publish it while he
was alive because it was so far out and
weird and would have scared people that
they're looking at ways is what we now
would call artificial life he brought in
Neil's barcelli the crazy Italian
Norwegian mathematical biologists who
looked at you know whether we could
start an evolution process inside this
little five kilobyte memory of the
computing machine the first person to
talk about
being an artificially created universe
and of course doing it all directly in
binary and allowing these these numbers
to evolve the same stuff that Wolfram
reinvented without any credit too bright
jelly and dealing with the real problem
something's wrong with the air
conditioner the smell of burning v-belt
is in the air berry jelly claims machine
is wrong code is right so he built this
cyclic universe because it could you
know there's only five thousand bits let
it run over and over and over again
watching if and he's acted for like a
field biologist going in afterwards and
seeing signs of parasites and things
like that had a sense of humor about it
that that you know this wasn't was it
real life or not you know who could tell
and warn people he wasn't you know
wasn't trying to create life he was just
observing what was happening in these
self-reproducing numbers but he saw all
sorts of things that like in biology
parasites symbiosis here's his first you
know viruses a program is starting to
take advantage of cycles that the other
program is using and then he started
realizing you need diversity so you
built different universes and allow
things to migrate back and forth between
three universes you know I was only
running like five thousand generations
but but the problem is these things just
stayed numbers they didn't become
anything else so you had to he saw that
you needed the equivalent of in biology
you know we have nucleic acids but they
code for proteins and the proteins go
out and do something so you need you
need to allow these patterns in the
computer to go out and and do something
in the real herbs is what happened in
the real world of computing suddenly we
had programs that evolves and did start
doing things and competing with each
other but he was seeing all this you
know at a time when there was you know
there weren't even operating systems
this is the mid-1950s but saw it in a
very biological way that these early
codes would be like like what we now see
a certain iron RNA world in biology
where you didn't you didn't yet have
proteins yet you had self
production and this was talking about
here is very much like like languages
like Java and so on the did will go out
and actually recreate themselves on a
remote host and act and and now we do I
mean all the things that Barry hle sort
of dreamed of are actually now part of
the real computational ecology and he
what he wanted was to learn he was
interesting question of how did our real
genetic code evolve and he's had an
insight i think i think was a good one a
lot of ideas were crazy but this one is
good with it that that these nucleotides
were actually going out and collecting
amino acids and bringing them back to an
S or like like social insects and then
slowly becoming more growing more and
more complex until we ended up with a
genetic system we have today so you know
he's wondering could you if you let a
process like this just keep running in
the world of computers where would it
end up and now we we've come actually in
the real world now we do have computer
programs that code for for proteins and
so like but nothing barrett le died
before he could really see this come to
life when i went digging around in
princeton trying to find relics of these
projects there were seven boxes in this
basement that it supposed to have been
thrown away and in the bottom of one box
was another box it actually had one of
mary shelley's universes the whole thing
just fossilized all the cards and the
source code and everything else you
could actually let it run and bring back
to life there's a note from the engine
to the engineer and then a note back
from the engineer mr. Barrett celli
there must be something about this code
that you haven't explained yet and
that's still the way it is today we
really and goodwill really prove that
that you can have a code you know within
formal systems you can always have make
fertilizations that that lead to things
you cannot prove or understand what
annoying was fascinated by that that's
the book he was working on when he died
that never got finished after he died he
was trying to collaborate with Stan who
lamb but who lon was was just so lazy he
never wrote anything up but in their
ladders their notes for the book you see
the chapters so chapter one is wiener
which was cybernetics and chapter 3 is
touring ! chapter 5 not touring the
things that are not touring computable
chapter 13 is Alam and what was that I
think this is what it was this is idea
that lululemon von Neumann were kicking
around in 1952 for what if you had a
real digital universe like we have today
just sort of an endless matrix of bits
and you allow turing-complete organisms
to evolve and start competing with each
other which is essentially what's
happening today in the real world and
then what happens and do they start
evolving and you have the equivalence of
our of our biological cells and you end
up can you end up eventually with
metazoan digital organisms and in a way
I think we have that's what's what's
going on on the web then he he also was
wrote this book was published after he
died probably the most misunderstood
title because he's not talking about
what why the brain is like a computer
he's talking about why the brain
competing in the brain and computing and
computers is completely different and
computing in the brain is statistical
it's not it's it's not digital computing
it's its analog computing but it has a
statistical element where the
frequencies of pulses are counted again
it's sent exactly it's like page rank
for neurons that were you if a if a
neuron has a high page rank it it
connects two more things back to ya so
this idea that the language of the brain
is pulse frequency coding and it's a
statistical language it's not a digital
code and I think that's very profound
and that's what's I think what you guys
are doing in the world of computing is
that we're we're building there more of
an analog statistical system on top of
the digital substrate and that's where
they're very interesting things are
happening the and you have
template-based addressing you're no
longer restricted to this phenomen
numerical matrix and um sort of always
able some everything up in one sentence
what makes you so sure that mathematical
logic you know is the way we think so
Julian Bigelow who was oh no he was just
brilliant engineer never got enough
credit
in 2003 he wanted to bill all different
kinds of computers he was just they just
had to get this one done to design those
blobs no idea that we would be stuck
with this for 60 years so he saw all
these different ways of doing it you
know you didn't need to have strictly
sequential coding and so on you could do
completely different forms of
computation and that you know this whole
numerical addressing was was it was a
very restricting limit newer other
things would happen and I think he
eventually will be proved correct that
you know you're really stuck with having
to just constantly juggle these
sequences of addresses in the you could
allow things you know computers now you
know this computer ninety-nine point
nine percent of time is waiting for the
next instruction and it's not getting
any because no reason computers couldn't
actually be computing without in human
instructions and then another insight
that they that they eat up instructions
so fast the only way that humans are
able to generate enough instructions are
through these recursive processes but
that actually there could be completely
different kinds of programming and von
Neumann was thinking about that too this
is 1949 so we're really living in the
world that he imagined and Julian's
comment you know always wants to know
when you talk to these old timers what
were they thinking at the time you know
they knew that this was going to
completely change the world that's why
they worked so hard that's why they gave
up their all these engineers sign away
their patent rights they could have
become millionaires but you know they
wanted to get this out in the world and
they knew it would change everything and
so the sort of end messages it's not
they weren't all of unknowns ideas lots
of other people's ideas but he's the guy
like the orchestra conductor who sort of
could put it all together and he wanted
to then go on and revolutionize all the
other fields like biology here now the
Institute F is saying what should we do
with this computer lab the school of
mathematics is divided into three groups
one consisting of pure math one
consisting of theoretical physics and
one consisting a professor of Unknowing
they didn't know what to do with him so
they sent this out to these illustrious
advisors and this is the kind of answer
they got
back so but but but he did want a
revolution he wanted to use the computer
to revolution SEO so what he made a deal
was tragically he died first but he he
was going to become professor at large
University of California and UCLA was
going to give him a complete laboratory
he was going to bring out the
meteorologists in the engineers there
the biologists they were going to do all
you know science would have been
probably 10 or 20 years ahead of what
really happened because he wanted to do
all that right then in 1955 first he
went to become head of the atomic energy
was seduced by power and politics was
the other tragedy but then on the other
hand it meant that the generals in the
site you know the president listen to
the diamond in a way that you know no
you know our president doesn't listen to
many computer scientists now so he got
the metal from promise' but ready he's
in a wheelchair and then he ends up in
Walter Reed Hospital where these notes
notes were taken by somebody was just
constantly wanted stimulation so someone
who spent time and leftist I don't know
who it was left this note we r vinay he
couldn't longer remembering from day to
day what he had said the day before so
he he wants this machine that that sense
he was like a laptop where he could or
like power point where he could project
books on a surface and make notes you
know with a luminous pointer in
different colors with a message of a
racer so you know we live in that world
that he that he dreamed of it was
possible but you know you want to be
able to think without physical
interference and and and we really get
to do that now and februari 8 October 57
he dies of cancer probably from
breathing a speck of plutonium or
something and the Machine finally gets
turned off so midnight July fifteenth
nineteen fifty-eight Julia Julia an H
bigelow off 12 midnight the machine was
shut down but by then it had completely
come to life everywhere else you know
IBM was building copies um had the the
you know the last word he died
prematurely he saw the promised land but
you didn't get to live in it but what he
what he imagined really was it was the
the dreams of Lima it's in Hobbs
everybody else brought to life at this
digital world would would really become
a world unto itself that was as rich as
the real world itself and that's where
touring attorneys Cathedral comes from
the touring had this idea that that when
we built these intelligent machines we
weren't we weren't creating souls we
were building mansions for the souls
which which God creates and i think
that's that's really what what all
people in this business are doing now
you really the are the days of the grand
architects are over it's it's it's now
the people working on you know one brick
at a time this great Cathedral that the
touring imagine so keep up all your good
and interesting work and it's it's you
know it was amazing so you'll have to
you have to live 50 years any longer to
see all this happiness I mean I when I
wrote that Darwin book that was ten
years ago you know Google didn't really
I mean altavista was the that was the
search engine so things things are
happening fast thank you yeah I ask what
you're working on alright anyway but no
it is I mean my sister's involved in the
you know the 23andme genetics project
which which also is just beyond
comprehension that we you know we know
how to consumer I mean you pay a
ridiculous price now but that you you
really get a fraction of a sequence
I don't yeah I don't say it doesn't
matter but it's not really the point
it's not going to be human I I
completely disagree with people like
like reycarts while you know who want to
set this benchmark that well when the
computer understands a joke it will be
conscious and that's going to happen in
five years and then five years later
something else I mean it it
consciousness is is so driven by
culturing we're conscious because we're
part of you know we're part of six
billion people who have evolved
consciousness as a society and so
consciousness among computers would be
something incomprehensible different so
if you use sneeze definition of that
there's thinking there's thought and
there's reality and consciousness being
able to tell the difference you know
we're heading that way and again what
you guys are doing is if you look at
Google as a whole and i think that the
brilliant thing is is is trying to keep
the process there's actually working
ninety-nine percent of the time instead
of instead of waiting what your google
machines are doing is is all the time
when they're when someone isn't
searching something those machines are
optimizing themself and and in their own
way thinking about moving data around
stuff and doing things and that's that's
not reality that's something else and
yes well the best answer that i was at a
conference with him and he gave his
speech again about 10 years ago he gave
his speech about we needed I think it
was 100 billion transistors and that he
showed his grass that when we're going
to have a hundred billion transistors
and at that point it's going to be a
singularity and then this little
Hungarian voice got up in the back of
the room it was trial Shimoni you know
it was quite short and politely said
when when you have your hundred billion
transistors we're going to use 50
billion for the operating system and and
you know it's that's the humorous answer
but you can't
you know maybe there will be cursed
while singularity but the person who
articulated out a lot better was Jack
good who worked with touring he wrote he
wrote some fantastic papers one of them
is the ultra intelligent machine where
he very clearly looks at that whole
problem of machines are more intelligent
than their than their creators but I
think it's all going to evolve very
different i don't think kurt swells
dream of this sort of desktop machine
that becomes intelligent has i just
don't think it's going to happen I mean
I guess I was going to bet I would bet
no but I would bet yes it's something
else is going to happen that we're going
to be probably quite unaware zone it was
a very went to a recent Lenormand
conference in Princeton that had a game
theory element and one of the game
theorists gave it from Scotland gave a
talk on if if God exists what he would
God reveal herself and the answer was no
that the that if I any payoff metric you
have the payoff will be higher if if God
does not reveal its existence and that's
that's probably true of artifice
intelligence oh well as well it is if if
there was real AI it would be opaque to
us so we may continue to have
conferences discussing it and it might
actually be happening I mean that's not
that's not science fiction that's just I
think that's just you can make that
argument from a from a game theory point
of view that the payoff is higher but
yeah I don't I don't know
yeah if we replicating it sort of this
paradox is if you if it's if it's
complicated enough to be intelligent
it's too complicated to understand and
if it's simple enough to be
understandable it's not complicated
enough to be intelligent so it's as soon
as we understand we used to say oh if we
if we had machine translation that would
be intelligent and now we have machine
translation well we understand that
that's not intelligent so we're always
we always move the goalposts to
