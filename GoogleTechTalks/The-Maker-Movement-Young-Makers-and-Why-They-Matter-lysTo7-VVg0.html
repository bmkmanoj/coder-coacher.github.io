engineer here in geo at Google and
today's talk is called the maker
movement young makers and why they
matter this is a very interesting topic
it's so interesting it takes five people
to explore it fully the we have Dale
Dougherty from Make Magazine Tony de
rose from Pixar karen wilkinson and mike
patrick from the Exploratorium in San
Francisco and Michelle flamenca from
maker media all right and we're going to
start with Dale and he's going to
describe pretty much what this whole
thing is about thank you Paul welcome
everyone nice to be here today i'm the
founder of make magazine and maker faire
and i'm not going to spend a lot of time
going over that and i hope you know
something about it or can find it more
about our website but i actually want to
spend more time talking about its
connection to learning in particular the
idea of young makers here and our
general reason for doing this program
today is is to develop and get you aware
of a program that we're working on for
young makers in association with Maker
Faire exploratorium and Pixar so as you
know make is a is a magazine for DIY or
do it yourself but I think one of the
most important things about DIY is is it
it conveys the idea that you can learn
to do almost anything that you can
figure something out you can read about
it you can talk to other people almost
in a very much an informal sense of
learning rather than I've got to find a
class and I've got to find a way to do
that a lot of you who are technical
people know that you acquired a lot of
your technical expertise outside of
school on doing projects on your own and
figuring out what what to do and you
know we really think that's a very
positive thing not going to show you
something that we want to say well
schools ought to do better at this well
maybe we just need to understand the way
that people are learning in particular
how they're acquiring different things
so but behind a lot of what we do it
make is
is it's fun it's it's we're not in a
sense trying to make it a formal
education we're trying to share project
ideas and in a spirit that that makes it
fun and interesting and in particular in
the way that maybe a skateboarding
magazine makes makes skateboarding fun I
didn't when I started make I did not
really think that we would have an
audience say of teenagers and others
that really like the magazine liked
doing projects and thought of it as cool
but to make and through through our
Maker Faires we've begun to see what's
happening there and that we are really
connecting to kids who want to do stuff
and and to some degree this isn't stuff
that are being offered in school so it
does represent you know even we've
talked about things like stem learning
which is often you know it's the sadly
science and technology engineering math
is what that stands for but sadly that's
a lot of book knowledge make represents
a hands-on world that you can access and
start playing with things and going at
your own pace and to some degree that
you know through our Maker Faires we see
kids coming and learning to solder and
they were they really enjoy the ability
in time to focus to do something and you
know part of where I'm looking at as
well if we get them stimulate if we get
them really interested in spired to do
this kind of stuff where can they go in
their own communities to do this well
one answer is this is a lot like garage
bands it isn't formal it isn't you don't
go to school of rock you go and and and
you make your own commitment initially
to say hey I like to do this I want to
do this for whatever reason you want to
be a rock star you figure that out you
make a commitment to do that but
importantly you also look for other
people who have similar levels of
interest and ability you don't go out
and find you know the guitar guru you
find other people that are learning
maybe just a little bit ahead of you but
you also are very conscious of other
people that have great ability
you commit the time to practice and play
and I think if you read about how we we
really learn things this practice and
play is very important it's what we're
able to do as kids to have the time to
become good at something that's why
largely as adults we we often have
struggled picking up something like a
new language exist at the time
commitment is is we're competing with
that on many other commitments and then
I think the last thing that a garage
band does is it looks for ways to get
out and perform and demonstrate what you
can do and I think whether that's a
maker faire and you're taking a robot
there or a musical instrument you built
getting things in front of other people
and showing what you can do motivates
you it tests you and I think it's a it's
a very important part of the whole
experience one thing I kind of want to
mention here we're talking mainly today
about this young makers program but I
wanted to mention something I'm kind of
working on and that's the development of
makerspaces for kids in in communities
so when I say that we get them
interested but they go to school and
they can't do this or they even find you
know their parent recognizes that
they're interested but they dont have
space or perhaps even the expertise to
put together something and in in our new
york maker faire i came across a
building in the this shape and the
structure which is actually cut out of
it using a cnc machine and it's all put
together really with a rubber mallet
it's all press fit and I it was designed
as a shelter for use in Haiti and I got
to thinking that well you know just the
way we've used school gardens and coron
them out in the backyard of the school
and created a space could we just set up
maker spaces that way it's just an
outbuilding something where where you
could go in and and actually the first
action you do in creating a makerspace
is to create the space to build it and
then begin to figure out what else you
need the tools the materials the
supplies and to create a space almost
near a playground where you get to play
and build things so I I just kind of
want to mention that today it's um
we were we're I think going to be
promoting over the next year a lot and
see what particular can parents violent
and volunteers get in and help build
this space kind of cool thing about it
is you can put it up you can take it
down if you can find the wrong school
the people aren't using it take it down
move it somewhere else but it doesn't
require a lot of investment in terms of
getting going and lassie just you know I
I've always been a little bit
self-conscious about using this term
maker movement people use it in the
media a bit and I go with oh gosh is
this really a movement and and someone
recent told me says you've got to start
using that term because it really
reflects a reality it is something
that's that's growing and and you know
really this year we did three Maker
Faires large ones in New York the last
one was in New York in September we did
Detroit in midsummer and then the Bay
Area which we've done five of it we did
in May and you know each one is growing
consistently in these new ones we
started at 20,000 people in New York
18,000 people in Detroit we have about
almost 70,000 people here in the Bay
Area and it brings families it brings
kids it brings really all ages together
in this DIY spirit of what can I learn
what can I do and how do we share this
knowledge so we want wanted to really
make sure that we're doing everything we
can to include kids include young makers
in in Maker Faire give them an
opportunity to exhibit an opportunity to
build things and that's really what
we're going to focus on here today but
it's it's you know the opportunity to do
something to make something create
something I mean one hand it sounds yeah
everybody does that but actually they
don't they don't get to do that in
meaningful ways in school there they
don't often get to do that in in ways
that are recognized outside of a few
areas like sports in their community so
sadly if you if I could show you some
things you know maybe 50 years ago the
idea of making stuff of using tools and
building stuff was a lot more
commonplace and it was almost a plane it
wasn't interesting it was so
common today it's it's almost at the
other end of the spectrum where kids
look at stuff can I break it can I get
into that it's I run into parents who
who who don't know if that's a good
activity to encourage in their kids or
to turn them away from it so it's almost
has a radical underpinning today of
getting your hands on technology
changing things and making a difference
one of the things I like that time I
want the early one of the early uses in
computing of the term hacker comes from
a group at MIT the the model rail
student Model Railroad Club and their
it's not a formal program it's a group
of students that are collaborating after
school in it in a small room and there's
two groups one that works on the on the
layout and how the board looks with the
little ferns and and mountains and
villages the other group works on the
switches and it's the group that works
on the switches that starts getting
interested in computing and but
computing isn't something that they can
get their hands on it's something that's
in the administration and they own large
computers and they came up with the term
the hands-on imperative that you
couldn't learn about something unless
you could get your hands on it and it
meant more than just touching it it
meant really getting access and control
of that technology and I think you know
for almost a philosophical view of what
we're trying to do here in the world
we're trying to create we don't want
kids to just passively accept the world
that existed before them we want them to
be engaged in creating it destroying it
if it if it needs to and rebuilding it
in ways that are useful to them so I
think there's a lot more here than just
simply getting your hands on technology
well I'm going to induce Tony and let
him talk about last year we really this
young makers program originates as an
idea that Tony came and brought to make
magazine and exploratorium and said hey
I've been involved in this and this
seems like something I'd like see more
kids involved in so I'd like Tony talk a
little bit about his program
thanks Dale thanks Paul
then ended up in the wrong place that's
right so i'm tony d rose my day job is I
run the graphics research group at Pixar
but for the last four or five years I've
also been interested in finding ways
that Pixar or Disney and Pixar together
can use our storytelling abilities are
cachet to help make science and math
education more inspiring and more
relevant to kids and that was really
part of the effort that led to the
piloting of the young makers program
last year coupled with my own personal
story with my family so I'd like to
start with that personal story and
that'll I think kind of set the stage
for some of the things we're trying to
do for the broader community so I have
two boys Sam age 16 and Joseph age 12
Sam's always been a builder and Joe is
really more of a storyteller when Sam
was younger and he got his hands on
every construction kit he could find
Legos connects whatever and you know
build elaborate structures but along
about age eight or nine he really
started to want to move beyond those
construction kits and we realized there
really wasn't much for him to graduate
in two so we started working on the in
the garage on a series of projects most
of which were left unfinished and in
2006 we had the good fortune of sort of
happening on the first Maker Faire and
at that point we realized gee we're not
alone there are lots of other people
like us and now we have a label for
ourselves we're makers and we really
connected with that with that label
somehow so we continued to go in 2007
and in 2008 we exhibited for the first
time we exhibited this thing which is a
large multi-touch computer display so
it's a it's a big iPad in today's terms
but in 2007 when we were building this
you know iPads hadn't yet been announced
and this is a project that I originally
started with a couple of people at Pixar
but the kids rapidly jumped in and we
took it to maker faire we exhibited it
here's Sam you know working one night in
his pajamas in the garage on part of the
sensor so you know this just becomes a
kind of an after-dinner sort of activity
instead of you know TV or YouTube
nothing gets YouTube so we took it to
maker faire the the kids showed it and
explained it to several thousand people
and it was just terrific as a parent to
kind of step back and listen to them
talk about you know all the design
trade-offs you know all the geeky little
details with the folks that would come
through and that would really know what
was going on and not only did they learn
a lot in the explaining but through the
course of the project it just introduced
so many teachable moments in really
relevant and ways that were important to
the kids right because they really
wanted to see this thing come to light
so this was a you know project that
combined physics electronics computer
software woodworking it wasn't you know
just a science project it wasn't just a
physics project it it really combined
everything in a package that was that
was really exciting it was picked up by
the online version of Popular Mechanics
so that kind of give us a little jolt in
addition to the the attention that we
got of the fair so at that point we were
hooked so in 2009 we started what has
really become a family tradition
actually it started back in two thousand
eight where around Christmas time we try
to find a design challenge work on it
during the christmas break and then
continue to work on it and take it to
maker faire so for 2009 we took as our
design challenge a gattling gun version
of the popular potato cannon so how many
of you know what the potato cannon is
yeah good right so it's a piece of its
some PVC pipe
you you glue it together you RAM a piece
of potato down the muzzle you spray
hairspray in the back end and you can
launch a potato about 400 feet which is
great if you're a teenager or a former
teenager so it dinner one night we were
talking about the Civil War and that's
when Gatling guns came in and that's
where those two ideas came together so
here's our potato gattling gun that we
took to maker fair 2009 and again that
just the number of problems that we had
to solve to pull this together it's not
something that we had were aware of
anybody having built before we had no
clue how we were going to do it at the
beginning we just started talking to
people and sketching out designs Sam did
the mechanical design of the of the
basic assembly and Barrel mechanism
prototyped and sketchup and then
together we worked out the the trickiest
bit which was the firing mechanism so
we're using spark plugs here to ignite
the hairspray and the barrels ignite
automatically as they spin around and
when they reach the top of the arc there
are some contacts that you can't see in
this picture that are hanging down from
the transformer the Transformers needed
to step up the voltage so again we
learned about transformers we learned
about you know how much electricity was
required to make sparks we learned about
air-fuel ratios we did all kinds of
experimentation with different fuels and
and which ones stay volatile for long
periods so that we could load it up and
not worry about it misfiring and I'll
never forget that the key insight for
the firing mechanism came late one night
as we were racing to meet the fair and
sam and i are both standing there were
both sketching and we had that aha
moment at exactly the same time and we
just looked at each other we didn't have
to say anything we just knew instantly
what he shows us were thinking and you
know as the leader of the research group
at Pixar I get paid to invent things all
day but that moment of discovery in the
garage that night before Maker Faire I
have to tell you is one of the most
satisfying moments of discovery I've
ever had we were standing there solving
real problems together as a family took
it to maker faire the nice folks that
make
made a video about it put it up on
YouTube it's now been seen about 1.4
million times so there's a real appetite
for this stuff and you can't tell you
what kind of confidence that inspires in
the kids for 2010 we took as our
challenge to build a an animatronic
fire-breathing dragon the Disney lineage
you know couldn't help but be expressed
somehow so this is a pneumatically
controlled beast it'll blow about an
eight or nine foot fireball it's
controlled with an Arduino connected to
a laptop this is a project that we did
as part of the pilot run of the young
makers program and so we we partnered
with another teenager and his father and
spent you know five months building this
thing to take it to the fair it got
quite a bit of attention there so at one
point we had several camera crews
stacked up at the at the booth waiting
to interview the kids so there's Sam
talking to the reporter next to him as
Alex Jacobson who was our partner on
this and Joseph my twelve-year-old CM
ended up doing most of the mechanical
design and manufacture Alex was
responsible for most of the software and
Joe ended up being the documentarian and
also he became our most proficient
puppet er you puppet her with that
joystick now if you know Joseph you'll
know that this is a common pose for him
so again he documented the thing let me
show you a quick 40 second trailer that
he did for the making of
so that was shot edited scored by Joseph
which shows you how kind of
all-encompassing these these projects
can become there's there's sort of a
piece for everybody at one point we had
both of both of the families our family
and the Jacobson's together in the
garage you know painting and doing set
construction in preparation for the fair
so that's by way of background and I
can't tell you you know how meaningful
this has become it's a big part of our
family life we spend a lot of time
together no scratching our head solving
these problems and the question became
about 18 months ago well how can we
provide this kind of experience to other
families and and two other kids if for
instance I I'm imagining that there are
lots of kids who are makers that don't
happen to have parents that are makers
or don't happen to have access to shop
facilities or maybe the parent knows
certain aspects of making but doesn't
know other aspects of making and so that
was really the motivation for creating
the young makers program is to try to
create an infrastructure and a community
for like-minded kids and families to get
together to share tips and tricks to be
inspired by one another so in talking
with the folks at the exploratorium and
make we thought that we could try
piloting a project starting in january
of last year with the idea being that
we'd take kids that like to build things
pair them with mentors that know it you
know one or more forms of making combine
that with shop facilities and then do
monthly design reviews and exposure to
making with the monthly meetings
occurring it at the exploratorium so we
started with 18 kids here's one of the
open make sessions these are two of our
our participants in the program and that
they're working on a LED circuit that
responds to
cell phone signals in this particular
workshop so through these monthly
meetings the kids kind of see the
progress of all the projects together
get inspired by each other and do some
group problem solving let me tell you
about a few of the projects that ended
up being exhibited this is nathaniel
he's 13 as always enjoyed making and his
project vision was to turn his broken
electric stand up scooter into a
sit-down chopper thing that you could
drive around the fair and since we had a
flame expert helping us with Saphira he
thought oh what the heck why don't we
add something flaming out the back too
so it became the flaming chopper that
was his project vision and I should say
that that's another idea behind the
program is that the role of the mentor
is to help the kid find a vision if they
don't already have one and then once a
vision is decided on to help them first
of all make it realizable because
generally the ideas are too grand to
really work so figure out ways to pare
it down and then get it to the get it to
the fair so as part of this project
Nathaniel learned how to how to weld and
do oxy cutting we also learned a lot
about electronics later here he is
working with his dad so his dad really
kind of played the role of mentor and
then there were a few of the rest of us
that were kind of meta mentors that were
helping the dad and the and the Sun kind
of learn how to do some of these
techniques here they are working on the
frame here's Sean Neely the flame expert
he and Nathaniel are you know puzzling
over some mechanical aspect of how to
get the the frame to work here's
Nathaniel driving the flame chopper out
in front of my house with the big
flaming thing out the back he had a
blast showing this off at Maker Faire
this is another project this is Evan his
idea was to create a container that
could carry tools and materials up a
ladder to someone working on a roof
so completely different kind of project
probably something you could build a
business around he called this the
latter Vader and you see the prototype
there they ended up he at his dad and
worked together to build a final version
that they showed up the fair this is
team habitable they had several project
visions during the the program but what
they ended up constructing was a
modification of an Ikea table that
doubles as a hamster habitat and the
motivation for this came from the mother
of one of the girls she's a teary and
has always been frustrated by how
unaesthetic had habitats are and so
their idea was to make an aesthetically
pleasing but also useful habitats here
they are working with their mentor it's
reconfigurable as well this is Colin and
Joseph there they go to the same high
school they're both into this version of
skateboarding called longboarding where
you've got a big long board and you go
really fast and they had an idea for a
new design for a skateboard truck that
would give them a lot more control
especially at high speed skateboard
trucks are traditionally very simple
mechanical devices with with just a
pivot this has a gear built into it and
they worked with their mentor to design
the whole thing in in SolidWorks a CNC
mill debt they tested it they didn't
quite get it to the point of being able
to demonstrate by the fair but they did
have the prototype sitting there and
were able to talk to people about their
design so I hope this gives you a sense
of you know just the range of creativity
and projects that that these kids
brought I want to go back to the faneuil
for just a second before i turn the
podium over so the Angels project worked
great all the way up until the fair gets
there on Saturday morning he invited his
parents from out of town you know his
whole family is there you know a lot of
people standing around the fair waiting
to see this
and it wouldn't charge it had been on
the charger all night and for the first
time ever it just failed to take a
charge so death Angela's mentor Sean and
his dad and and I grabbed grabbed a
multimeter and we started tracking down
the problem eventually collectively you
know all the guys standing around here
group problem solving narrowed it down
to a blown diode in the in the charging
circuit Nathaniel soldered around it
plugged it back in got it to charge and
work great the rest of the rest of the
time so this is another aspect of that
these programs can help develop and that
is failure and how to recover most of
these projects involve a lot more
reengineering than engineering itself
the whatever you start thinking you're
going to build of course it changes
after several prototypes and that's not
something that kids are typically
learning in school these days right if
you don't get the right answer first
time there's something wrong with you in
school typically so this is an
opportunity for us to fail together
learn learn how to respond to that
failure and make improvements so in
closing let me just read a quick quote
from Nathaniel's mother as kind of a
testimonial so I think Nathaniel's
project was a success on many levels he
realized his concept learned many new
skills managed the time it took to
complete the vehicle and met new people
in my mind however the biggest success
was that a devastating end to maker
faire was averted through support team
work and tenacity he learned something
about overcoming adversity and you can't
get a better life lesson than that so
with that I'd like to turn over to Mike
and Karen who ran the monthly meetings
at exploratorium I think we're going to
wait until the end to take questions if
that's okay great and we're going to
have plenty of time for questions
I'm going to say a few things show you a
little video to kind of give you the
sense of what we were doing at the
exploratorium and then Karen will follow
up at the end so at the exploratorium
we've always found pride in the fact
that these are staff at the
exploratorium who get interested in a
project they take materials and
expertise sort of pull them together in
the exhibit shop and then outcomes and
exhibitor outcomes a program usually for
teachers or for school groups in the
safe confines of a workshop setting what
we wanted to do is prototype a new type
of idea in conjunction with the young
makers program last year and what we
thought we would try to do is build an
environment on the floor that had loose
parts tools materials and some ideas for
getting started with projects some of
these were electronics based projects as
you'll see some of these were mechanics
based projects we weren't sure what was
going to happen but we figured if we got
the right group of people together to
lay out materials and tools and the
right group of adults together to help
some of the youth and the adult visitors
to get started we might see some
interesting things so what we did is
once a month we hosted an event it was a
program at the beginning of the day for
the young makers who got together to
share their ideas with one another and
then in the afternoon we opened it up to
any visitor who wanted to stop in and
try to work on these things with us so
I'm going to show a four minute video
it's a for its four minutes that shows
four months of experiments with
activities and projects and I'd like to
look for a couple of things some of the
things we're most interested in are sort
of intergenerational learning some of
the opportunities for people to be
working together with one another not
because an adult usually knows the
answer in fact in most of these cases
the adults think they know the answers
but when faced are confronted with the
real projects tools and materials they
finally don't really understand how
electricity works or how mechanics works
and also watch for the fact that even
though a lot of people tend to be
building similar types of things there
isn't a cookie cutter activity that
we're asking everybody to build we're
wanting to get them started and inspired
by showing them in an example but then
the final outcome is ultimately up to
the visitors visitors decide when to
come into this space and when they
decide they want to leave so anyway I
won't talk over the video and then Karen
will talk a little bit about what
happened afterwards
you should share this one again because
there should be at least 30
well is that what you wanna do is you
want to try
this
ok
just take design face it
it's really crater both
okay so that will kind of give you a
sense of what we're after in the
tinkering studio but I kind of want to
say Mike and I have been huge fans of
make and making from the get-go we've
been at every single fair and I think
there's a real affinity at our place
because we are a creative culture that
has in fact created the exploratorium to
really kind of place at a really high
level of importance this ability that
people have to think with their hands
whether they even know they have this
ability or not so these open make
experiences are a little bit broader and
reach anyone who comes to the museum can
participate and we really want you to
bump shoulders with makers from the
magazine and the blog and give you and
the people you come with a chance to try
things out like in the earlier one on
the electricity circuits people were
wiring things the traditional way but
then they were also given a chance to
look at conductive thread or this fabric
called zelt so you could think about
electronics and clothing so those kind
of interesting juxtapositions we also
really like as part of the open make you
also get to go to the theater and hear
from featured makers so folks that were
there last year were people who he way
made the ocarina app I don't know if you
guys have seen that but that got a lot
of excitement but you know you would you
would have someone making an iphone app
but also an 80 year old who is
incredibly passionate about solar things
kind of attaching and remaking junk and
making it solar-powered so we place a
really high level importance on people
who make things and we so much so that
this has actually become a strategic
initiative I don't know if any of you
have heard we're moving down to the
Embarcadero and this tinkering endeavor
will actually grow into a gallery so you
will be able to come in and tinker at
the exploratorium as a visitor so while
science museums have had interactivity
as a thing we know how to do i would say
we're wanting to shift that equation a
little bit and have it be
much more participatory and creative so
we're really looking forward to that and
maybe I'll end with this a pitch to get
you to the exploratorium so every third
Saturday of the month between the
beginning of the year and maker faire we
are going to have these open makes these
days of celebrating making and I'll just
give you a few hints of some of the
things that our group is talking about
offering where I'm treating the theme
this year based on materials so we want
people to come and try out tools and get
tips from makers so one of the things
that we're thinking about is we're going
to have a big skate boarding ramp
constructed for an after-dark program
that happens for adults during that same
time we'll be having an open make so
you'll get to hear from people who make
their own skateboard equipments there
are people who laser cut into
skateboards we want you to meet people
who are really incredibly good with
chisels so laser cutters and chisels we
think they're both great tools having a
chance to see those things we also have
a group that same time who really wants
to make fire so will I be looking at
tools that allow you to make fire anyway
I guess I shouldn't go on too much
longer but we're really thrilled by some
of the things that are starting to be
lined up and use that time to get people
jazzed about Maker Faire where we'll
also set up a tinkering studio as we've
done each year and see you at the fair
so it's my great pleasure now to invite
you all to do it yourself along with us
we've told you how we've done it and
we'd like you to try it out too and
become part of the young makers program
and this year we we described how we had
a couple dozen kids and parents involved
last year at the exploratorium for our
feedback sessions are plussing sessions
where they were sharing their projects
each month in association with the open
make this year we're inviting people to
start maker clubs in their own
communities we're looking to have each
of these clubs have about a 6 to 10 kids
in that served junior high to high
school range each of these clubs would
have mentors so makers who either have
kids of their own who they want to
mentor or people who want to work with
kids to realize the projects the the
wild imaginations that they might have
or the very concrete practical things
practical problems like the ladder Vader
that they want to solve each of these
clubs would be run by an adult who would
serve as the club manager who would be
in contact with us and also each of
these clubs would have a shop host
someone who opens up some kind of
fabrication facility and it might be
something like a Tony's garage where a
few of the projects you saw happened or
it might be someone who has access to
another another spot that has more
sophisticated machinery like a CNC kinds
of things that we're offering on our end
for the infrastructure are a
continuation of these monthly meetings
at the exploratorium where they give
feedback to one another on their
projects and the third Saturday of each
month as Karen just described will
continue to offer these open make
sessions and the featured maker
interviews with these people who are
doing this kind of thing either as a
vocation or an avocation something that
they're really passionate about that
we feel could really inspire the kids
and any of the many directions that
projects at maker faire can go in arts
crafts engineering green design music
science technology and then as Karen and
Mike just described these open make
activities out on the museum floor the
the kids who are part of these young
maker clubs around the bay area will be
able to take part in those as well at
exploratorium and these round robin
reviews is we also call them plussing
sessions giving each other feedback on
how they might improve the projects that
they're working on tips for making the
project's work better and making them
more appealing to the 80,000 people or
so that we'll have at maker faire and
how to find the tools and materials and
so forth that they might need to make
the projects happen and of course we're
another thing that we offer as part of
the young makers program is to host this
grand event in May Maker Faire now you
don't need to be a part of a young
makers Club to par-tay participate in
Maker Faire but it's our great feeling
among the those of us who have come here
to talk to y'all today that being a part
of this organization is really critical
for having making progress towards
completing something in time for may and
again last year we had a special area
where the young makers exhibited and the
motivation of having the deadline of
this event we find to be the most
effective way to get kids to finish
their projects there's no competition
anything that's cool is fair game we'd
like to say so if you'd like to join we
have a website Google site I believe
young makers org you can tell us your
name and what kind of role you'd like to
play as a mentor a young maker a shop
host a club manager we're going to be
having a mean
at the exploratorium in early December
which we will let you know and there we
go I think we're ready for questions now
all right vc ops if you unmute everybody
who can add questions from other offices
and anyone wants to ask question here
please come to the might and we'll have
our expert tag-team panel tag each other
so two questions one is how do you get
your kids to give up their video games
and look up from it long enough to to be
interested in this I think my kids have
some inclination for it but the video
games are just too easy and gratifying
and the other is sigh you know the the
building stuff in your garage with your
kid I was certainly a maker when I was a
kid how do you keep from taking over as
the adult because I totally envy all the
great toys I mean tools and stuff that's
out there these days so the so there
were two parts of the question one was
how'd he get them away from video games
one answer is to hijack their interest
as an example my son Joseph was really
into a video game called Metroid and
there's a character that he really liked
so we talked about him making a costume
of that character and we ended up
building a costume which was a you know
consisted of an arm cannon with an
embedded Ord we know and sound and you
know we spent three months building this
thing to take it tweeted on Halloween
and we're going to work on mark two of
that to take to maker faire so he didn't
have to give up his view video game
interest we sort of leverage that so
that might be one one strategy how to
not to take over that's hard it takes
some discipline being a mentor is you
know takes a lot of taste and judgment
knowing when to push knowing when to
give an idea knowing when to you know
step back and let them make a mistake so
I don't throw any you know one answer to
that and that's one reason that I think
a network can really help because if we
can bring mentors together to sort of
share tips and tricks and strategies
then we can all learn from each other
I'll just make a quick comment on the
second one about taking over with
projects for our work at the open make
part we actually want we look for those
parental take over moments we think
those are really good signs and sort of
invite parallel play so if we see a
parental take over happening we sort of
rush in with either more materials or
suggestions to get them both working
towards a project rather than mom or dad
taking over where the kid steps behind
but we we really do this I mean it
sounds like a joke but I'm not joking
about it at the Museum you see most
often parents are being good parents so
they push their kids forward and want to
either step back you know and there you
can just see it on their face they
really want to get involved and when
they do take that step to become
involved we really we want to be there
to support both the adults and the kids
it's actually the same kind of answer
really I think often is yeah you know
there's there's a difference between say
under 12 and over 12 in terms of
engagement but I think when parents have
asked me how do I get my kids involved i
said if you're involved it really helps
it matters a lot if they see you making
things they'll be curious and even if
they don't come in immediately and do
what you're doing they're exposed to
that activity obviously the teenagers
are often more interested in doing
independent work then say a young kid
who often it's a good pairing up to do
parent-child things and I think we're
all still trying to learn that I mean I
don't think the video games are
necessarily you know the kids have a
passion for that and we really want to
show them there's other things that they
could be passionate about I think that
partly why getting clubs together of
this model is important to see what
other kids are doing
and and police is like maker fair and
even the magazine again I at least
anecdotally a parent say I dropped
magazine in my kids lap he actually read
it you know you really liked it and
wanted to you know inspired to bees it
was asking do we have a shop you know do
we have a place to do this work so
there's no magic bullet but it's it's
something like that another question
from the group I I also have two
questions one is why now why is the
maker movement taking off now and second
I think young people are making and
experimenting a lot with digital media
they're producing digital objects and
programming things and I was wondering
if you had any thoughts about how young
people of different ages and parents and
their children could collaboratively
tinker and work together on digital
media and on code for example if a kid
likes playing video games if they could
collaborate to make a kind of simple
video game together
start off but I mean I you know in terms
of now and the maker movement you know I
I don't know completely uh you know it's
surprising to me III think part of the
answer is there's a lot actually
interesting new technology out there to
get your hands on so we're seeing things
like 3d printers and Arduino and stuff
which are really new capabilities
bringing new things to a new level but I
think there's something culturally going
on here to that I tried to indicate in
my remarks that it's about empowering
people to do things you know you have an
idea and you know if you're a 19 year
old and you have an idea for a website
you you almost have no obstacles in your
way to build it right if you have to
manufacture something well you've got to
you probably have to get access to a
physical space and get access some tools
but those obstacles are diminishing
quite rapidly in comparison to say ten
years ago and there are more things you
can build with off-the-shelf components
today then then almost ever and the
knowledge that you can find online about
how to do it and from other people you
know I have to think like you know the
loan tinker we often talk about is like
someone in the garage in the 50s or 60s
I mean they really were alone often not
by choice but they couldn't they
couldn't find other people easily who
did what they did and and if you were a
kid growing up then I mean if you were
lucky to have a parent who exposed that
to you may be a teacher maybe a neighbor
but you're kind of out of luck if you
didn't get exposed to this and I I tend
to think that you know exposure is what
matters when you see other people doing
this stuff it's but it sparks an
interest so that exposure part is so
much important today when you see
someone build something crazy and it's
up on the YouTube video you kind of want
to you know ask how they do that could I
do that and I think part of the mega
moon is the answer is yes you don't jump
in and learn how I'm gonna let Tony talk
a little bit about the digital media
stuff but I
it's a really interesting you know
actually my initial idea around make was
that I'd done a series of books on
hacking and I saw the people not just
hacking software but they're hacking
physical things and if you take
something like Arduino you're hacking
code and you're hacking something
physical and you see this actually
surprising that a lot of art that's
combining art and technology and I just
thought a lot of our world is going to
be sort of this dialogue between the
physical and the digital there's an
economist article out on smart systems
and it's time about sort of mirror
worlds and so I think there's there's
actually a lot of interesting
opportunity here yeah so on the digital
media front I hope you got the idea that
there is an opportunity to kind of blur
a lot of lines here so there was a
digital media component to the to the
dragon for instance and we're going to
be encouraging project teams to really
document you know what they're doing
online in the medium that is theirs
which is which is mostly video these
days in terms of video games I think
it'd be great to you know have a maker
club you know focused on on video game
construction is I'm particularly
interested in seeing again lines blurred
between the virtual and the real so
we've been talking at home about our
next project and one idea we're throwing
around is a video game with a motion
platform you know that you sit in and
it's controlled and so they're building
a video game but there's also a lot of
mechanical engineering involved so I
think that a lot of opportunities for 44
crosstalk as well so I had a question
about these are workshops how do you
deal with liability issues when kids are
welding drilling using mills and lathes
and things like that I think it's
awesome to get your
hands on things and I wish we didn't
have lawyers but we do I mean for
instance if you're working in your
garage do the homeowners insurance
policies cover things like that or as
they say I'm not a lawyer but it you
know I we think so in the terms of the
homeowners thing you know safety is a
really good thing to be conscious of
places like tech shop hackerspaces we've
all had to deal with this you know the
average shop clasts at least one theory
is the reason they're not around as much
as liability issues but it probably has
more to do with nobody knew how to
maintain the equipment after that old
fella retired you know I think we have
to work our way through this I I have
not seen it really as an obstacle we
have to really make sure kids are aware
of this but you know I mean look there's
risks in sports to bodily injury there
there are other kinds of risks you know
I running 70,000 people through maker
faire with fire and everything else I am
acutely aware of the risks and something
bad happening would definitely hurt what
we're trying to accomplish so we're
really attuned to it but I have to say
the other side of its like Sean working
with the kids on fire the elephant of
danger is a selling point and don't
forget that in yourself I mean you know
to be a long walk along that edge and
both to trust yourself and to know
what's required to do that that walk is
really important and I think it's what
makes this interesting that they're
there you could screw up you could hurt
yourself and and so rather than sort of
have someone else watched it out for you
you know you have to really internalize
what that means so I mean that's that's
you know it's it's definitely a great
question something we paying a lot of
tension to and talking to mentors about
and doing safety training and I think
that's an area particularly I'm Lionel
we could we could do a lot more to have
safety certification in process for
various tools and
processes so they're sort of legal and
practical concerns that that we've been
faced with one idea gabar tally the
found of tinkering school and he's
written a book recently the 50-50
dangerous things you should do with your
kids so he's been looking legally into
this and what he realizes that most
homeowners insurance policies will cover
and protect you from these types of sort
of legal issues but again there's a
practical approach to this you know we
brought 25,000 people through our
tinkering studio and there were saws and
drills and hot glue glue hot glue irons
and soldering irons and nobody got hurt
and we believe part of that is that
there were a couple of us around to kind
of watch for things but the other thing
is that the tools are being used in a
purposeful way because there were
meaningful activities that the tools
should be used for oftentimes and you
may know this if you've ever cut your
finger or if you've ever burned yourself
it's usually when you're not paying
attention or when you're not using that
you're using the tool for a purpose that
it's not intended to be used for which
is certainly a creative and tinkering
way like hairspray so it's it's the
combination of being smart and being
safe but also being purposeful with
whatever tool or technology you're using
we're pretty much out of time till just
has a couple of comments who wants to
run out just you know I mean the one
reason we're really here is to encourage
you to to form a makers claw young
makers Club we'd love to hear from you
will stick around here and if you have
any questions but you know getting
getting six to ten kids in an area where
they get an opportunity like this still
experimental we haven't figured it all
out we just we have no national
structure know anything we're just
trying to make some things happen give
kids and experience whether they are
born makers or just curious we'd like to
get them in the program and and and work
with them this year so please let us
know and thanks a lot for your attention
