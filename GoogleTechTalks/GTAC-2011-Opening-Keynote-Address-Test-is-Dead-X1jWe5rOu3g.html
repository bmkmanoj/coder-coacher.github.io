am a little bit worried about this
opening keynote to be perfectly honest
this gentleman is not known for his
shall we say sanity he has been a friend
of mine for a long time
I'm not so sure that that will extend
into the future once you understand this
talk and I do want to say that this is
not Google is not responsible for this
man Google is not responsible for what
he says
these are his opinions so I wrote this I
hope he has an edited you haven't put
into something else all he did put in
something else but he thinks that this
is the way of the future now if we can
only find him he has been missing for
quite some time hopefully my voice will
be heard and Alberto Savoia will appear
is the air
you too
the
Oh
thank you very much I'm afraid I have
some bad news
see about a month ago this Alberto
Savoia character posted something on the
Google testing blog announcing the test
is death and that he is the executioner
well I'm the only executioner
so I had no choice but to take Alberto
out a little bit before his time it
doesn't really have clean living however
since I took him out before his time I
asked him I could grant him a little
wish and his first wish was well I would
like to embrace Jessica Alba before I
died
he didn't say embrace some kind of
paraphrasing but you get the idea
so I told him Alberto said a little
crappy wish I mean Jessica Alba is so
out of your league is not even funny so
can you ask me for something smaller and
he said you know I committed to doing
this presentation at G tach last year
they asked me but it was somewhere in
India and frankly I couldn't be bothered
to take the trip for a invitation-only
conference and so I just did a crappy
little five-minute video for them but
this year I accepted to be a keynote
speaker and if I don't do it they're
stuck with the likes of James Whittaker
so I told him okay I was hoping was the
TED conference but gee that sounds small
enough and crappy enough so I decided to
grant him his wish so with that in mind
the this is the new opening slide I am
the Grim Reaper I've had a pretty bad
reputation so I'm trying to be to
modernize and I'm trying my new hip-hop
name dodgy R which i think is going to
be a little bit more successful now in
1882 Nietzsche wrote these famous words
God is dead this words were not
particularly well received in some
quarters in some particular quarters and
about 12 years later I had to take
Nietzsche out and by the time it was
kind of mentally insane suffering from
complication due to syphilis but either
we want to know the details the point is
that you know anybody that says that
something is dead will have to deal with
me sooner or later and usually sooner
so this Alberto character now comes and
tells us this test is dead let's see
what he actually has to say what he had
to say sorry before about it so here's a
quick outline we're going to start with
the Old Testament
a little I said it would be a
presentation of biblical proportions
then talk about the new testamentality
why there's been this change and then so
what and now if you excuse me this is
very very hot
I assume human form so you wouldn't be
too repulsed all right let's talk about
the old testamentality
in the beginning there was a
requirements document
who remembers requirements document yeah
anybody over 30 yes now
the requirement documents was literally
carved in stone and you didn't mess with
it you know get busy or look busy and
the requirement documents beget the
specification the specification begat
the design and the documentation the
design and the documentation beget the
test plan the test plan began the test
suite and the test suite begat the bugs
and as we like to say there was much
weeping and gnashing of teeth it wasn't
it wasn't really a funny way of doing
things so in the old testament ality
things were very very top-down they came
from the top and at some point they
split between developers and testers and
the two didn't meet until the tests
crashed heads what happened to crush
heads with the with the code and we got
the bugs now all of this happen at a
glacially slow pace weeks months
sometimes years the cycles were
painfully painfully slow and there were
artifacts our visit who knows who this
is these are horrible conference right a
yapper chart and purchase had sub per
charts everything was organized this way
and you were supposed to fall in oh no I
never made aperture that anyone actually
followed so actually my name for this is
the road to perdition
I wonder if Twitter has any per chart
now let's talk about testing testing in
the old testament ality what happened is
a companies hired one two three four
developers and then they realized well
we need some testing they didn't do it
themselves so they hired typically a QA
person they notice the Upstairs
Downstairs you know they were separate
but unequal and and so that's how
testing when they just tossed crappy
code over the wall and called every bug
a feature so that's all part of the old
testamentality so in summary the old
testamentality was
up down thou shalt follow the speck was
rigid thou shalt not deviate from plan
and we're distinct roles and
responsibilities developers shell
developers and pastors shall test and
never the twain shall meet
and finally there was this very strange
attitude that we didn't really suffer
until somebody said it it was ready to
be released right don't release the cell
no one before it starts actually QA had
some power but list on on paper
well some people call this the waterfall
model and said a lot of people didn't
like it you know kind of got them into a
lot of trouble something call it water
fail model and it led people want to
change so they came up with this new
change the new testamentality now in the
new testament ality yeah it's it's the
same number of fingers and there's still
a finger being pointed but it's in the
different direction and it's a different
finger so we kind of flipped the bird to
authority said no no no don't tell me
what to write we decide what what to
write and so whereas the old
testamentality had kind of these
principles you know focusing on building
things right the new testament i'll it
kind of just threw that away and came up
with this different set of principles so
cycles became very fast you know days
weeks sometimes minutes we launched
software before it's ready you may have
heard this quote actually a working
group where this is actually the mandate
you know yeah you're embarrassed you
think it's not very perfect we shall
ship it now now this did lead to some
problems sometimes software go out the
door with some little toilet paper stuck
on its foot but that was okay because it
all paid off in the end in what actually
mattered and let's talk about the role
of QA in this new testamentality
remember the old model well the first
thing that happened is that the role of
tester was minimum
ize outsource offshored and sent
somewhere in the ether and use the extra
resource to say let's hire one new
developer of course they knew that this
sounded a little bit irresponsible so
they made little excuse and they said
well you know you see this barrier
between developers and testers we're
just gonna burn it and we're going to
ask developers to take responsibility
for testing their code some testers did
some testers don't some do delete some
some did a lot some did a little now how
many of you are surprised by what you've
heard so far many people went oh my god
I've never thought this my career is in
trouble what's happening how many people
have been under the rock for the last
five years nobody okay so this is not
the reaction I expect to get from you in
fact I respect cannabis nudey reaction
something like this hey Alberta
sorry hey Dad you just described agile
software what's so new here boring well
not quite because you see I read the
books and then I go and look at how
things are practice and the two things
are very very very very different
so let's look into that I call it
actually the post agile movement to be
polite and in other words but I decided
I didn't want it on the slide so post
agile has a much different in
laissez-faire attitude about testing and
for those of you are not
colloquial in French here's what laissez
faire mean casual floppy careless
carefree procrastinated in other words
in post agile people don't give a shut
door about testing in general some
people you know it's they call it agile
but what they do is actually much more
freer than agile some people have called
it fragile which is a which makes a lot
of sense because it definitely the
artifacts are are fragile the question
is why why did we go down this path
there are two reasons sorry and in by
the way what's the problem with
testament tell with the old
testamentality no after all a lot of
great working software was built that
way with the old testamentality and the
problem sorry the answer is because we
can know with the in the past if you
build a piece of software you have to
put it on a floppy disk and then later
in a cd-rom and you package it and if
you have to make changes it was a really
painful process now with this web
development i believe this thing is
called the information superhighway
you know i'm not very busy here we can
just release things very quickly and
it's more fun and will move faster but i
believe that there is a much deeper and
more important reason and the reason is
that it's not a software quality issue
that you are trying to address it's an
issue of building the right it versus
building it right and I will explain a
bit more for this the thing is that when
people move from this waterfall model to
this fragile post-agile
model they had some stunning
assessors despite paying little or no
attention to testing any kind of testing
functionality scalability security you
name it now actually I'm not going to
name it
I think I'm a-gettin enough in trouble
for this talk I mean I mention Nietzsche
syphilis New Testament God Old
Testaments so I'm not going to get into
more trouble by naming some of the
people in companies behind these quotes
but you can trust me
these are bona fide I may have
paraphrase them because I didn't
remember them literally
now this quotes come from people and
companies that are among the most
influential wildly successful and
world-changing company these are the
companies where a lot of you work or
would love to work so let's see what
some of these people have to say about
testing in this post agile model here's
one 250 developers and three testers so
how's that for a tester to developer
ratio but actually in the big scheme of
things this is pretty good because there
are some other companies where they just
say we do not hire testers the one of
the reasons I'm giving is that for us
quality is secondary to speed and
probably lower than that what do you
think that they think that testing slows
you down you know testing test even if
they're will written the require lot of
maintenance and a lot of work so the
theories that look by the time somebody
has as well tested software with our
crappy software we have millions of user
guess who wins it's pretty obvious now
the DX and finally you've heard the prod
quality is free well apparently some
people think quality's not free quality
is very very expensive in terms of time
and effort so by now you're saying okay
that that's about the old kind of
testing where you hike you a higher QA
and you separate it people are stopping
to do that kind of testing and say what
they're doing is unit testing developer
testing well they're saying that they're
doing it but when you actually go and
look under the cover you come up with
expressions like these you know from
managers of the
developers I think our developers do
some unit tests so you think when tests
keep failing we delete them
I may have done that myself once or
twice or or did you say I want to go
home so I'm sometimes you engage yeah
yes yes we run automated tests and
asking well what's the coverage and this
is an actual bona fide answer that I got
from personally no better medium okay
yeah I think you get the point
so and I want to emphasize this is not
just some rickety rickety little startup
somewhere in some no-name place this
isn't Silicon Valley some of the most
influential wildly successful and
world-changing company this is the post
agile attitude a lot of mouths you know
a lot of people speak about testing that
how people do actually do it now you
have to ask well I haven't these people
worried about bugs and yeah a little bit
but the real bugs that they're worried
about are not the bugs that you know
they're worried about what I call idea
bugs so when you typically when we could
have talked about bugs in the code we
mean about we talked about the wrong
behavior for a product can anyone guess
what an idea bug is obviously defined
the wrong product exactly so if the
little innocent code bug this is what
the code bug looks like you know me pin
shoe in the butt give you a little
pimple but this is this is what the idea
bug looks like right the idea bug is
actually I can take him
actually here here it is let me
recognize I took care of the idea bugs
but idea bugs will kill you they will
kill your company so no wonder that they
are worried about that and let's look a
little bit at this concept of idea bugs
where are they born when somebody is an
idea for a product this idea is born in
a place I like to call thought land so
in total and you have an idea and you
tell your idea to people and what you
get back is opinions
now ideas are abstract opinions are
abstract and subjective so you don't
have much to
right and this leads to some horrible
horrible problems and I'm going to give
you two example first of all in thought
land every idea can be a winner even the
lamest idea who remembers Webvan right
okay for those of you who didn't at the
head of the bubble when Internet babble
when the internet came out web man had
this brilliant idea people would order
groceries online and it would be
delivered to their door within a
30-minute window and they presented this
idea to a lot of people and everybody
seemed to like it I mean even Borat 9 so
based on that they went to venture
capitalists and there is 100 million
dollars or more they took that money the
building or spent the loading website
the built refrigerated warehouse they
bought a lot of van the bought a lot of
food they stuffed it and then they
launched it and how many people here
regularly use web banner at home grocery
delivery 1 per well a handful of people
so clearly there is a small market for
you but definitely not the market that
web man was expecting so if you look on
Wikipedia web man is listed as a poster
child for the bubble bursting so but in
a deal and it sounds like such a great
idea so ideal and can lead you to false
positives now something even worse
happens in a DLN is that some great idea
are killed now how many people here the
first time you heard about Twitter
thought that it was just crazy at the
end it would never work yeah a lot of
you and some people still probably think
I don't understand how it works so when
they presented it to people they told
them you got a bit crazy and what's with
this 140 character limits you know you
got to send photos you know I've got to
send attachment and everybody told them
no well we know what actually happened
right Twitter is not only wildly
successful it's changing the world is
changing politics is changing things
that we never imagined so in that but in
a deal and it sounded like loser to a
lot of people so the problem that you
get in a deal and sorry I over the
problem you get in at the Elan is that
you never know if an idea is good or bad
until you actually build it and let me
let me tell you how many people here
have worked at startups they pour the
heart and soul to build and test a
product and that
our tap failed okay quite a few the rest
of you you're young enough it will
eventually happen if you don't pay
attention to this so I call it the
innovators nightmare I worked at several
startups the one will we actually spent
the most time you may have heard of it
adjectives ears we built this beautiful
product we tested they was due out of it
and yet it did not work the way I like
to summarize it we spent 25 million
dollars of venture capital to sell 24
million dollars worth of software you
know that equation doesn't quite work
but Matt did we test it well yes we it
was a beautiful tested product but the
key is if you really want to test
something and this is the key of the new
testamentality you have to test the idea
I'm not saying that you don't want to
eventually build it right but you have
to make sure that you're building the
right it and you need to test the idea
because just like code it's very hard
the first piece of code works right
that's why we test it you have to be
aware of the law of failure most
products fail in the market
you probably heard it 95% of all mobile
apps fail four out of five startups fail
restaurants I mean this is true in every
business we have a lot of ideas that
sound good but eventually they go
failing now here's a corollary that
applies to us most products fail in the
market even if they're very well
implemented or tested even if you do all
the right things the idea if it's not
the right idea fails and let me tell you
there's nothing more upsetting than
having a beautifully tested product then
you launch it and nobody uses those
features that you spend so much time
testing so idea bugs are like weeds bad
ideas come up all the time and the
question visit can we actually test idea
bugs by the way this is Alberto who's
going out of testing the traditional
he's now into still in another testing
area and that's idea testing and
hopefully you will find this relevant so
Alberto came up with this work called
pretotyping and that is testing the as
cheaply and as quickly as possible to
make sure that you're building the right
it before you're building it right now
this is a boring definition let me give
a couple of examples
drive the point home about 30 years ago
IBM a tremendous computer technology was
also in the typewriter business remember
30 years ago managers didn't type know
right that stenographers and that the
secretary is doing the tapping so they
thought wouldn't it be great if you
could just speak into a computer and
without a keyboard and you have stuff
happens 30 years ago computers were not
fast enough 4.7 megahertz and somebody
thought yeah but if we solve this
problem if we build this product and we
make sure it works well we make a lot of
money but we'd have taken a lot of money
to actually build it and somebody
thought before we make this massive
investment why don't we do a little
little experiment why don't we put
somebody in a room this customers who
told us they would pay $10,000 for a
speech-to-text translator put them in a
room with a screen a microphone and tell
them that we have a prototype and let
them test it for a few hours so they did
that but in reality that it's something
very clever they hid in another room a
stenographer by the way here are two
stenographer they're doing an amazing
job because I have an accent and a speak
class
so what was the thing that this
sonographer obviously I had a pair of
headphone and they implemented it looked
to the users if they had the perfect
speech-to-text
translator shut up you know this is an
interesting idea but it's not a
prototype it's not like the tried to
miniaturized stenographers and put them
in a box right you guys wouldn't want to
be in a box so I looked at this and I
thought well this is a brilliant idea
it's not a prototype and I came up or
Alberto came up with the word pretend
o-type which was a really horrible world
which later he shrank to the word
pretotype and what happened with this
idea testing remember that and build
anything that before people told them
yes
of course we would want to buy speech
attractions later but after using it for
a few hours your throat gets sore
imagine working in cubicles with
everybody dictating public static main
open parenthesis it just just would not
work or dictating confidential like fire
James Whittaker it just it just wouldn't
work so after that they decide the
attesting they realized that most people
told them I thought I was going to buy
but I decided no we don't want to buy so
imagine the amount of time and effort be
saved one more example to drive the
point home some of you may have owned
the original Palm Pilot the person
invented the pen pal of Jeff Hawkins was
also the co-founder of grid computing
the company that tried to add the first
tablet or iPad like computer he had an
innovators nightmare he spent years
building the product testing and let me
tell you it looked beautiful I wanted
one was like eight thousand dollars so I
wasn't ready to to pay but it was
beautifully designed beautifully tested
and then nobody bought it so the wasted
years and tens of millions of dollars so
before doing his next company Palm Pilot
he decided before I build this thing let
me pretend that I've built it they
actually went and had a little piece of
wood and put some little papers leaves
and a toothpick and it would go around
for a few weeks carrying and pretending
hey James are you free for lunch
tomorrow okay pull all right so I make a
note it would put memos phone numbers
etc etc so it pretended to have it and
use it and discover you know this form
factor I would actually use and of
course it has become the form
for all the products all the mobile
phones that we on now so why why do you
do this you know you know the good test
fail it is tested always passes is
usually not a good test and the same
applies to testing ideas and it has to
fail fast
so with pretotyping what you do is you
try to minimize the time you spend on an
idea because if you spend too much time
with it you become too attached so
imagine you have a product you've worked
on it for three years even if you don't
think it's going to work how easy is it
for you to say ah we just forget it
let's stop you don't do it you know in
American in America winners never quit
quitters never win so what do we do you
raise some more venture capital and you
go for a couple of more years before the
product is actually killed with
pretotyping with idea testing you spend
a few days or weeks to do that and then
if the product was not to be the right
one you stop you stop working on it now
a lot of people say well you're just
describing prototypes you know you just
invented a new word you say frito I say
proto but there is a very important
difference between the two this is what
a prototype for the Palm Pilot would
look like you know we would take weeks
months to build you're trying to answer
question can we build it will it work
will the graffiti hand rod recognition
work with the praetor type you try to
come in much earlier in the game you're
trying to find out will people actually
use it if we build it now why am I
telling you all this first of all to
give you one of the reasons behind this
movement we kind of know that we're
going from the old testamentality to the
new testamentality most people are aware
of that most people are not aware of why
it's happening and it's important to
understand because as we will see it
will affect your career I'm not the only
person doing this how many people have
heard of the Lean Startup movement a
handful hey the other the rest of you
are subject to suggest you go and buy in
by the book the Lean Startup is the way
that most startups are being funded and
run these days gone are the days of
saying hey here's 10 PowerPoint slides
give me ten million dollars in two years
I go stealth and bring your product so
this is Eric Ries he came up with the
term lean
our top and I use the term pretotype he
came up at the same time with another
term equals minimum viable product but
the idea of the two is the same
pretotyping is make sure you're building
the right it before you're building it
right and that's why these things are
happening so let me give me an example
of something built right I show this in
a flight magazine as you can see it's a
a few years ago it's very well designed
it's licensed by Apple which must have
got a pretty penny it has two speakers
it's in stereo it is waterproof now I
don't know what kind of intestinal
problem the inventor of this thing had
that he felt he needed a I pod with
recharger and speakers next to his
toilet but at some point he thought that
it was a good at the end apparently
found people to actually fund it and
build it I don't know I would sell this
you know it's pretty hard to explain and
yet
notice how well-built it is right it's
just the spent a lot of time testing and
it's not the right product what about an
example of the right it now will not
twitter's you know especially in the
early day it was very flaky it crashed
you know in fact the Twitter whale
became almost as famous as Twitter
itself right when you had an outage but
you know what and this is an important
election I think this probably the best
example Twitter is the right it so even
with all these problems people keep
using it and they keep using it more so
if it's down
who cares we'll come back and it's up
again Twitter was built using these
ideas that we are discussing now it is
post-agile
the worried about scalability after they
achieved scalability so there are two
books if you care about pretotyping an
MVP the first one is mine it's in fact
it's not a book it's a pretty tight book
actually print and staple it myself
I will sign autographs copy for $20 in
the lobby no just just kidding it's $25
or you can just print it download it and
print it yourself from pretotyping
org and the other one is in more formal
book by Eric Ries
now if you want to stay in this business
whether it's testing or other areas you
have to know about this because this is
the direction that people are going
you're asking who's following this new
testamentality I don't see it in my
company well if that's the case then
maybe you know your company may not stay
around for much longer because these are
the people that you have to worry about
the new generation of company if you
work for a well-established company you
think it would be invincible it's never
going to change the truth is the things
will change and in fact entrepreneurs
are getting younger and sloppier they
just put code Detroit out see what
happens and if it doesn't work they
pivot which means they change the
business plan the emphasis has shifted
for new companies from building it right
which used to be true say 10-15 years
ago - let's make sure that we're
building the right product and clearly
clearly this has to have implication for
you guys and that's Mike so what now
when I say test is dead do not take it
literally right Nietzsche didn't mean
when he said that God is dead literally
that somebody can and went and hacked in
but it's a change of attitude a change
in belief so do not take it literally
but take it very seriously and I will
give you four signs of the test
pocalypse that I've noticed the first
one is hiring and recruiting of testers
is way down I used to know recruiters
whose only job will suggest hire tester
Matt do you remember we work with some
of those right they just hurt us or the
specialize in QA well they go out of the
business because demand dried up
dramatically testers are being
commoditized let's be frank
they were never treated as first-class
citizen some people put good words to it
but now it's even worse they're
completely
replaceable it's being offshore
outsource it's going it's going out and
sometimes it's outsourced to people who
are not even tester as we will learn
later in the conference I think when
James speak you know we have the cloud
to do the testing for us now this is
particular scary but also exciting for
some of the people in this audience
there's been an exodus in test
leadership well we know what happened to
Alberta James is doing very different
stuff these days a lot of the people
that I know that were some of the test
luminaries are doing other stuff and yet
where is the new blood where is the new
James Whittaker I don't see them I see
just a lot of aging people who write
used to write books and speak and where
is the new leadership I think there may
be some of you in here but you need to
kick Swift in the pants and you know I'm
a very good motivator so we've talked
about that in a second and finally I see
more and more companies shifting to this
fragile post agile testing and they're
fully aware that they're not paying
enough attention to testing they're
fully aware that they're going to put
stuff out before their time and they
don't care because they want to make
sure that they catch idea bugs before
they catch product bugs so what does
this mean for us
right there are career dangers now if
you're in all fashion QA testers or even
if you're working on test automation and
building framework you still may find
employment but it's going to be very
hard to find employment in the hot new
companies I think ten years ago if you
find the hot startup they would have
test automation people they would have
QA people right now it's much harder
they just don't want testing the way
that they use once so you have to keep
your eyes wide wide open as I said don't
take it literally but do take it
seriously and the road ahead of us is
wide open
it's full of potholes and as a James so
poetically put you know the future is
Cloudy with a Chance of tests you know
this would be a great photo so come on
there you go
the future is cloudy all right on this
what a poser
yeah the future is cloudy with the
chance of test is a sub-theme
of this conference here's the road and I
really see it like this it you know it
doesn't look very inviting right now but
it's wide open the old leadership it's
either dying or you know on the way out
these are huge opportunities not only
for new blood but for new models of
testing right so we went from the way
you tested waterfall we went through
this agile period that some companies do
well most companies do not do well they
just use it as an excuse to say oh we
don't have tests or QA you know we do
agile and then they don't actually do it
very well
so the road is wide open because the
truth is that at some point once you
find that you have the right it you will
need ways to test it and companies that
found the right it by moving very
quickly and sloppily and carelessly are
not going to slow down once they find it
they will continue to move very fast
even at Google we have some products
that we launch every week some of them
more often so from my point of view
there is a gigantic opportunity for the
people here that have the passion and
energy in testing to become the new
leaders not just as personality but also
in terms of developing a new philosophy
of testing just like in regular
philosophy you go from the idea the
empiricists to the existentialist to the
you know post modernist whatever it is
the same happens in our business the way
we develop software has changed so the
way that we test software has to change
and right now I don't know who the
leaders are literally no names come to
mind and if you're interested in testing
which hopefully you are if you're at
this conference maybe the leader is
among you
so with that
the
but wait James James okay say you still
have a few more years yeah you stay away
from me
that's good that Benson okay okay so gr
has time for questions so don't address
him to Alberto he's dead and you are
right I'm a development director now
that's a secret that you just and
there's a reason because I agree with
Alberto test is dead I purposefully
didn't talk to him about this before his
death because I wanted to make sure that
I wasn't just influenced by Alberto's
bigger-than-life personality and and I
do agree that there's an opportunity
here and I'm not sure who's going to
step up either but I'm certainly
stepping aside to allow people to step
up so questions for de gr what's up
what's your name okay hold on what I
want to see I don't know what you're
gonna pull out of there thank you wait
wait first I want to make sure if it oh
yeah no you're you're fine you're fine
so thanks it was a great presentation
thank you
so my question is you're just you what
you describe is actually very well
applicable to like startups some ad hoc
projects like 20% time project but what
about do you think this is really
applicable to like enterprise great
software like large systems medical
devices so do you want your like an
artificial heart be driven by something
that was tested in fragile protest well
then I would want my artificial RP being
driven by anything that James tested but
how long so tests artificial heart
that's a good ethics so so let's good
it's going to take times for this
transition and you know there are some
products where actually you cannot place
these take this post agile testing
attitude no now we hate to fight fly in
a plane we said oh good welcome to our
new 777 we're just flying with the new
release ten point four three point four
five six alpha so I try to be careful
there still are some industries and some
companies where the traditional way of
testing is what dominates but those are
shrinking and for those of you who
actually don't want to work for say
Boeing or in our phaser pharmaceutical
if you want to work in startups you
really have to be aware of this yes
there are products were testing will
continue to be very systematic but I
would say all the new exciting products
if you look at the market cap of the
largest companies in the last few years
a lot of them have been you know came up
this way even Google I was in Google in
the early days I can guarantee you we
had 200 developers and three testers so
a very good question there is still some
job safety in the old testamentality
okay thank you thank you
hi as Annavaram with Oracle so a
question what do you think about the
future of Quality Assurance in the US
now everybody is offshoring yeah so
that's a very good question the future
of Quality Assurance in the US as I
mentioned I know that recruiters and I
know cause they call me all the time
that I want to sell me people say have a
great person here the ones that we're
working in testing are pretty much
disappearing so if you're a great let's
say traditional QA person you're one of
the best and it's your passion you will
you will have safety I would say easily
for the 10 or 20 years but it's not
going to be in some of the most exciting
company now if you're not one of the
best if you're just a tester you're
being commoditized commoditize right and
we we've seen it in companies and again
I'm not going to name names we're
they've taken 300 testers that work for
the company let them go and replace them
with offshoring to do blackbox testing
so the future there's definitely a lot
of clouds there so once you've found the
right it or you think you have and
you've built it a fragile sloppy and
you're actually trying to allow it to
scale and actually make a real
sustainable product what do you think
the role of quality there and building
it right is so the question is once
you've found the right it how do you
build a tribe I think one of the biggest
mistakes that we make in our industry is
to conflate the the first phase
are you working on the right product
with building it right afterwards you
know we take code that was designed to
be a prototype and then we say it's
successful and we keep slapping more
onto that code and what happens there
you have this gigantic I think it's
called a technical debt is that the name
they use yeah Oh code that so again I'm
not going to name name name but so the
most influential companies they went
through the spirits were it became
intolerable to stand on the on the old
Coast bed code code base so they went
through this very painful transition
to the new code base so first last one
is make sure that you're clear this is
the right it you know it's successful we
scale the to 10,000 people to go to a
million people we need a different
environment but what's not going to
change is that people that have learned
to do this fast iteration even if
they're we architect the system for the
new way they're not going to slow down
so anybody that's involved in testing
they're going to hate you if you slow
them down in any way and the testers of
the future are going to be successful if
they actually allow them to keep their
speed or in the best case accelerate the
pace of development so so I want to
underscore that because the when I made
the transition from tests to dev in July
first we took on two things right I
looked at this project and I thought
testing all it's going to do is create
more bug that it's not going to help us
at all
the two things that I did was remove the
existing technical debt and that was a
development issue right there's a lot of
refactoring and redevelopment that
needed to be done
higher quality zero tests and then the
second thing I did was get a faster
release cycle so that I could get my
product to the crowd right real users
doing real testing faster well you heard
you heard James Whittaker lino testing
the no more I can get closing on you're
not in danger you're fine just just cut
the salt okay hear me cut this all this
all got the salt yeah blood so you heard
James a person who Michael finally
understand you now that I can see what
you're saying for the first time in
years yes the you heard James a person
are called in previous attacks the
Octomom of test book publishing say zero
tests now if this is not a sign of the
test pocalypse I don't know what else
what else is but he mentioned something
very important which I was hoping
somebody would ask that question but it
was a follow-on to your question it's
not the testing as gone the cloud allows
us to do the testing with a fraction of
our users you have a new release you
launch it to one percent of the users
and if things don't blow up you just
push it you had a very interesting
metric that we
yesterday about the 200 bucks you want
to do it now or save it for your present
yes they say that over later you know so
but seriously there is we're spreading
tests out over a larger population I see
tests moving into development and into
the user community so there's that
middle clump that we've been doing for
so long I mean literally if you would
have been able to take a software tester
from 1970 and move them forward in time
to say 2010 they would have had to learn
anything new to test that's a problem
that's the last renovation we're not we
have we have people like me and you know
other people who talk about say for
example exploratory testing you know
there's nothing in this book that we
didn't know in 1970 testing has kind of
been stagnant for decades we're just
better at explaining it because we've
had more time to think about it yeah you
can take most testing books and recycle
them into adult diapers I think that's
uh that would be able a a good use so
another interesting way that you
mentioned it which I hadn't thought
about it is you test traditional testing
is caught in the middle right
the developers do some of their
automated unit tests and they then we
let the user you know use the feature
and tell us what is broken before we
launch it to a larger audience and so
testers really traditional testers are
caught in the middle and that's not a
good place to be so when I when I
introduced my team my new Google+ API
team we all sat around we said okay this
is our new project this is what we're
doing and they looked at me in civil
where are our testers and that it struck
me that they were looking for their
crutch you know they were looking for
the thing that would allow them to
continue to write crappy software and
when they found out that they were both
the developers and the testers they
wrote better software absolutely
so how many think that this is a
disheartening message just if you're
honest be honest well yeah all right so
the good news is it's a minority and
it's fine for a small number of people
maybe even twenty thirty percent
actually it's not a small number a lot
of people the traditional way of testing
will continue but think about I don't
want to get too philosophical on you
right but when somebody says things like
God is that some people took it oh my
god where are we going to get our
morality what's going to happen but on
the other hand think about it this opens
the road for creating our own way of
thinking our own morality and come up
with something entirely new
which should be an extremely exciting
thing so as I said the leaders are
moving out you know the old guard is
moving out the old ways of developing
are gone there is a huge opportunity for
people here that the energy the
enthusiasm the passion to come up with
something extremely new and you know if
you are lucky you could be the next
James Whittaker now at that example so
hopeful is there anybody here that would
love for that to happen you know there
have to be some new ideas and new ways
of approaching testing any suggestions
from this audience yes oh it's waiting
for the mic and while the max gets there
this is the opening keynote well first
of all cause I would agree to do nothing
but the opening keynote but also because
this is the theme of the conference
right if Tess is dead is cloud on the
horizons what are we going to do about
it when you sit at those tables that's
what you should be thinking about
so exactly sometimes you think you know
so testing is dead probably getting to
look for another job and my comment on
this is we really need to reinvent
ourselves where I work I hate the word
testers because I think we're really
quality people and quality should be
implemented all across the development
lifecycle so we just need to reinvent
ourselves and stop calling ourselves as
testers we're just like process monitors
we're quality people we really need to
really need to put quality in every step
of the development lifecycle
so by the time the code gets to us which
is the QA phase like James just said it
doesn't eat testing or we hope it
doesn't but again for everyone you know
it's not testing what we do it's Quality
Assurance and we really need to make
sure monitor it and have it implemented
all across that's just my comment agree
disagree but I wish Al Green than with
two more questions
in fact if let's make up a term right
now to replace testing testers let's
call them writers as in not the ones
right like making things right so here's
how a writer and this is a horrible name
so I have a horrible name so you can
come up with a good name the job of a
writer somebody who set things right is
not necessarily to do testing as James
the scrub one of the tool for writers to
make sure that your company has the
right product quality wise and in other
ways so the right tool maybe you know
instead of testing it in-house let's
send it to 1% of our users and see what
happens someone in that role somebody
needs to own that role right because
companies also do that very slowly so
the job of a writer is to take into
account all right we have unit tests
automated testing offshore QA but one of
the tools that we have in our arsenal is
actual the actual public the actual end
users and find ways to use the users to
make sure that you have the right
product so it's even beyond quality
right quality also is a little bit
tainted you want to make sure move from
testing from you know finding the bugs
to make sure that you have the right
products and the right features and they
and that they work right using whatever
means are available to you and you're
stupid if you don't use the users that
you have available to do that for you
so X and one one question here and then
I saw a hand there yes sir
can we take like one question then two
more and then we have a little break
Troy Thomas ultimate software so great
ultimate I don't know what's that I
don't like people using ultimate online
game okay but that's just a talk so so
one of the questions I get asked pretty
much daily let's assume we build the
right thing we meet and exceed
expectations of users or customers the
question I get asked consistently is do
we focus more on unit test GUI test
exploratory testing how do we in teve or
increase quality people are always
saying how do we achieve quality overall
with the assumption that we are building
the right thing so can you can you
address that how do we achieve quality
taking the assumption of the exploratory
test with unit tests or do we ask the
question of do we GUI test more do a GUI
test less do we focus on your testing do
you focus on exploratory so how do we
how do we drive that I would say no
testing along with quality is award I
would almost take it out of your
vocabulary because let's face it those
words are tainted they're tainted
themselves the practitioners of those
words are tainted
you want to reduce your salary by 20 30
% call yourself a tester or say that you
work in QA right so with that
understanding the the focus should not
be on quality should be in making sure
that you're building the right it and
then the future future features are what
people actually need so when you ask me
should I focus more on unit testing or
GUI testing you focus on where the
problems are what is going to make your
product less right and less competitive
with the rest so there isn't a clear
answer because no for Twitter you know
the goo is pretty simple so there isn't
much work there so they would probably
focus on scalability and reliability
testing if you do tax software then you
better have the right answers but again
try not to use the word quality or
testing because I found out that they're
tainted you know they're they're the
sound boring quality sounds really
old-fashioned and testing will lower
your salary by 30
and it doesn't get enough respect but if
you go and you tell your company hi my
job I'm a writer
or whatever name we come up with right
my job is I will make sure that whatever
we put out by any means available to me
users whatever it is the right product
that people like to use it and will
continue to use it and that will depend
on what kind of product it is it's
complicated right we cannot address it
here in 10 minutes but I hope you guys
will one question there and then one
more hand and then we're done I am from
HCl so I primarily agree with what you
had said till now because we actually
have seen a change of shift wherein we
have found that we have development
budgets which we get they are suggesting
for having a j-unit selenium mix
framework which will probably test with
the development cycle itself this was
starting up a couple of years back till
about six months back
last six was missing an interesting
trend companies which are having a very
stable unit testing framework are today
asking us to do some kind of exploratory
or a manual testing on the end
application that's outsourcing to India
so how does this relate to the whole
picture PEEP customers who have already
moved to the new propose agile they are
today coming back to us with like kind
of a stress a service model where they
would like to a testing a service model
when they would like probably for every
testing someone does manual exploratory
some something like that kind of testing
they are coming back to us so how does
that fit in the whole picture well
actually so the question is in fact tell
me if I understood it correctly
companies that practice post agile in
the last six months have started coming
to you and say can you test the whole
thing the product yes exploratory yes
good I kind of bring us to a regression
cycle but not have any kind of
automation anything they're more looking
at manual exploratory and that kind of a
system so that's actually very
consistent with the message that I meant
about testing being commoditized right
you you work for a company that does is
you're not part of the company right and
you're not in the US yes that's right so
that's
exactly the message the companies
realize well we need to do some kind of
testing because testing is important and
a rightist writer that's a horrible name
may decide to actually do that that in
addition to you doing some user testing
maybe if the product they're very unsure
they will go to a company like yours and
say please Bank on it manually before we
put it to the public so I would say it's
entirely consistent with this technical
debt that I've seen people accumulate
and they want somebody to know to go and
look things over before launching ok one
more final questions there so one
possible way of getting early testing of
the idea that you mentioned as testing
releasing it to 1% of the users or
targeted users in the current generation
with the electronic media so powerful
what there is a huge risk that you might
get a lot of criticism and negative
publicity to the product even before
it's fully baked how do you mitigate
that that there is a risk of you so I
didn't hear it very well there are blogs
which go out and might create negative
publicity of the product before it's
even fully baked very good yeah yeah so
the question is what if you do this fast
development you launch product you send
it out and it doesn't work so let's say
it crashes or it has a wrong
functionality before it's fully baked
that is clearly a risk if you read books
like pretotyping and the Lean Startup
you will find out that you actually the
stupidest thing that a company could do
is to launch ahead of time to a huge
audience so you do it on a smaller scale
and you see if the restriction and you
do that for two reasons one of them two
about this huge global embarrassment
when people think that the product is
ready but more importantly you do to
make sure that it's the right product
now having said that I know of companies
that they had horrific launches where
the product crash and didn't work or at
all kind of security issues but it was
so much the right product that people
stuck with them through that particular
phase so in summary the stupidest thing
you can do is not test at all and launch
globally now take a full-page ad on The
Wall Street Journal and say hi the
product is ready so that's not what
pretotyping advocates that's not what
lean startup
advocates in fact it says start with
small groups see if the feedback is
worth it and then before you go and put
a full-page ad on the Wall Street
Journal make sure that you have the
right it which you will done before and
then at that part you want to test that
it works at least well but having said
that a lot of company had those launches
the crash and people kept coming back
users would you agree users are becoming
more tolerant of failures because they
know that they can hit reload or come
back an hour later which is you know
just we're becoming more sloppy and the
users are becoming more forgiving so
with that I want to make sure I leave
enough time for the transition it's been
a pleasure
send your good wishes to Alberto and
