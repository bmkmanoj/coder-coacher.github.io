performance and test teams I've been
working on cloud for over two years now
up in Seattle and don't let my title
fool you it says engineering manager but
managers at Google are different I
really do get my hands down in the code
in fact I check something in last week
and about five minutes later somebody on
my team fix and check them again so you
know I've done I've done a bunch for
cloud some of the things that are
externally visible for cloud is I
created the google compute google
compute engine units GCE use and we'll
talk more about what Google compute
engine is later we you know being the
engineer I am I thought wow GCE you it's
really cool we should call that Gigi
juice because he doesn't want gqueues or
I mean which engineer doesn't want to be
GQ and and now you know I have an
engineer okay great so here's what we're
going to do we are going to talk about
cloud computing so I'm going to take a
quick step back talk a little bit about
what cloud computing is I'll take you
through some history about how we got to
where we are today and in 2013 this is
you know a history of cloud computing
then I will definitely take you through
the google cloud i'll give you pivots of
what the google cloud looks like how we
think about it how the industry thinks
about it i'll run through a series of
demos and then to prove i'm an engineer
i'm going to take you to the pitfalls
and this is how you know i'm not a
marketing person gives a my slides are
not pretty and be i'm going to tell you
why things may not work for you from
kind of hot and in the end I'll just
wrap it up with the the team and
questions so with that let's dive in so
what is cloud computing it's a good
question i have this question two years
ago in fact I probably still have this
question today but one of the things
that I did to try to figure out you know
what this industry is as I started
looking different places you know i go
to webster search google search i looked
up at you know how stuff works and they
had a really interesting definition they
talk about remote machines owned by
another company and like maybe your
email and word processing would be out
there and this seems like a really dated
Stephanie
but it's actually still fairly accurate
I did things like go out to conferences
because there are several conferences
that happen throughout the year around
cloud computing and in there you'll see
interesting terms like Hadoop you know
elastic environments grid software
there's all these terms that start to
pop up I even went out and started the
survey my peers at Google like what do
you think cloud computing is and you can
see down here they start talking about
oh it's this computation that you can do
and the cloud you don't have to worry
about stuff so what I did is I said okay
well with any definition let's pull
together the properties of cloud
computing because there are certain
things we're hearing you know often in
these definitions you know one was
nothing you know nobody cares where it
is everything's accessed over a network
so you know cloud computing is something
that happens in the network that's sort
of like the beginning of what cloud
computing is the second part was is a
really important part which is utility
you could turn it on or off you pay for
what you use and when it's not on you
turn it off it's like a light switch so
if I want a database now I have a
database and if I don't want a database
and five minutes from now I turn it off
and I'm not paying for it there's an
elastic component where you know
resources grow and shrink on demand and
you've seen this you know many times
across like YouTube scalability we you
know broadcast the Olympics and like
whether one user is watching or eight
million users or watching it all seems
to work and so there's this elastic
component of cloud that grows and
shrinks on demand for sure it's
programmable programmability is an
important aspect of cloud and then
access control models so here's where
like there's some pieces will talk about
later we're like software as a service
versus you develop your own code and
like platform and infrastructure as a
service layers where access models are
different there are some models where
the end user owns the control and
there's some where the person providing
the service owns the control but there's
some method of controlling access to
data and resources and you know while
not required there's this thing that
often comes up which is multi-tenant
your workloads run side by side with
somebody else's some companies this can
become
you know why is company a and Company B
running on the same server where
competitors we don't want our data
anywhere near each other and it's really
the cloud providers that create this
partition or there's barrier between
those workloads so there's no flow of
data from one to the other and this is
called multi-tenancy so I try to be
really smart I'm like okay this sounds
really good so let me give a definition
of cloud computing that tries to roll in
like all these sources of information
and my definition is it's a set of
programmable resources that are that's
paper use it happens over a network it's
elastic and it removes the developer
from having to worry about the hardware
resources the operating system or all
these minutiae is that you know she
doesn't want to worry about and she can
just focus on delivering the application
that she wants and it's there and it
grows and shrinks on demand so that's my
definition so that's cloud computing in
a nutshell so here's a little mini quiz
I'll just take quick show of hands I'm
only going to go through a couple
questions to see if things are already
resonating with everybody here so is
gmail cloud computing yes it could
depend on perspective one perspective is
cloud you know gmail is a hosted
software service that companies can buy
you can buy gmail and for some nominal
fee per month you can host your mailbox
there so no you know on the upper end of
software-as-a-service this is where
google started yes gmail I would say is
cloud computing now what about hosting
Python applications is that joy hands is
that cloud computing yes yeah it has the
programmable aspect we talked about its
elastic you know this is where like
Google App Engine enters the picture and
here let's try one more our physical sir
you know servers posted by a host ER is
at cloud computing yeah at the pens yeah
this is the one that gets sort of tricky
is if if you can on demand request these
servers and have them go away on demand
then you sort of enter into the cloud
computing versus just pure hosting we
tried this whole thing in a 90s called
applique
Hosting and server hosting and so what
was what's different today is this whole
elastic component and you might be
thinking already like why is all this
importantly why is this definition of
cloud computing important and so I ask
that question to actually like why is
this important and so I went out and I
found this Forbes article and I realized
that not only can google help you you
know find dating sites we can also help
you on your dates where it says you know
some take it to make it where there's
seventeen percent of us apparently that
on our first dates lie and tell people
we know what cloud computing is so so
I'm here to help you with your dating
that's really what this was all about so
so cloud computing okay so let's go back
let's go back and let's talk a little
bit about history though computers
they've been here for a while almost 60
plus years now hard to believe we've
lived with technology that long but in
1961 John McCarthy also sort of dubbed
as the father of a I was living in a
world where there are very few computers
relative did today there were 6,000
computers and he had this thought he
said you know computation one day will
be a utility for him this was really
important because there were so few of
them it was a constrained resource but
it kind of made sense he sort of was
predicting the future that's it one day
we would get to a utility now the way we
got there is very different than perhaps
you expected but nonetheless you know
some credit goes to goes to him in terms
of you know thinking about yes computers
could be a utility one day but before we
could get there something had to happen
we had to have the internet happen we
didn't have an Internet 1961 we had some
sort of point-to-point stuff you know
people are trying things out but it
wasn't until nineteen sixty-nine that
that ARPANET the predecessor to the
Internet happened and at the time you
know transfer speed between computers
was 50 kilobits a second and to give you
an idea of like what that actually means
because it's hard to sometimes think
about all these bits your cell phones
about to style
times faster than computers could talk
to each other back in nineteen
sixty-nine some other things had to
happen we had to have the microprocessor
revolution that started you know roughly
in 1971 and so after the the
microprocessor revolution the Internet's
kind of there we have these acoustic
couplers and modems in the 80s we have
the VBS era this is where you know you
had laptops they were called luggable
should carry me around like this you're
like 67 pounds or something like that
this is an example as the k pro but
something interesting happened where
services started to show up like
compuserve and Jeanie and you would dial
up and for ten cents a minute you could
access this super awesome service that
all you wanted to do was find out where
the free DBS was so you can go connect
to this free thing and start to share
you know files or data and so you'd go
connect up to something like you know
koala country which was free and so
there's this whole sort of culture
around the internet starting to happen
if you know connectivity sharing you
know data should be universally
accessible so you know roll time for it
a little bit so from the 80s if that was
our DBS era we really needed the 90s to
happen because these are pretty
important to where we are today so in 93
if you can believe it this was the
mosaic browser was first to enter in the
scene and make the internet a lot more
accessible prior to that we'd all run
like command-line tools like Archie and
all these things we hope to forget one
day and users started showing up and
there are a few users there were about
25 you know million users connected up
to the Internet 93 roughly by 95
something interesting happened we had
six million hosts serving data on the
internet and so we have like 25 million
users and so you have to figure the
users have grown a lot and you'll see
this on the next slide now i'm sure i'm
not going to pronounce his name
correctly so rama's k chellappa i
apologize if you ever watch this video
but this really smart guy was out there
and and gave what's often deemed to be
the first definition of cloud computing
where ramnath he says he says cloud
computing he basically says computing is
going to be a pair
we're computing is determined not by
technology but by economic decisions
yeah look at that and that's surprising
yes economic decisions uh and you know
when we were all really flushed with
cash in the late 90s nobody was too
worried about you know server rooms and
the fact that you know ten percent of
you know the CPU you know CPUs we all
owned were actually being utilized
ninety percent you know you know unused
was just fine we had plenty of money to
run you know all the air conditioners
and power but you know computing
resources grew 2000 we had 72 million
hosts and then by 2006 we had almost
four million hosts on the internet and
that is astonishing growth if you think
of how fast that happened and then the
number of users that are using the also
grew which obviously grew the servers
and we had like 400 61 million users in
2001 using internet pretty astonishing
so 2006 was kind of a magic year this
was the year where people like Eric
Schmidt our executive chairman of the
board for Google super smart guy started
to piece things together and started
connecting together these ideas of likes
offers a service in fact by all my
reading he was deemed one of the first
people that ever use the term cloud
computing because as I mentioned before
the 90s we tried app hosting nobody
wanted to hand over their data nobody
want us thrown their applications but
somehow magically in 2006 when you call
it cloud computing everybody seemed a
lot more comfortable at least beginning
to be comfortable with this idea and
then also in 2006 amazon launched amazon
web services and this was the first
provider that was out there and i love
this picture here because it's kind of
like amazon's the baby you bright-eyed
i'm due to the party and you know the
older sister is really looking they're
like did we try this in the 90s called
application hosting and as the way with
technology sometimes you know if you
know nothing you or you're going to win
because you're just sort of looking at
it from a different perspective there's
this whole notion of innovation cycles
that you can read about that happen over
and over again and pick all
so where did Google under the picture so
Google entered into this picture in 2008
we launched two things kind of
simultaneously hitting different parts
of helping to make the cloud happen one
part is we launched chrome beta which is
astonishing because just recently it
looks like chrome has become the most
popular browser in the world and that's
in like four years which is astonishing
growth but chrome came out in data and
Google App Engine this place where you
could host you know python and java
applications came out so we're trying to
tackle the cloud from two parts one was
the usability and we're making the
internet easier to use with the browser
and we were starting to create a
platform where you could actually create
applications and host applications on
the Internet in 2010 we launched
actually Google Cloud storage I can't
tell you the number of you know Terra X
petabytes whatever happened to be in
cloud storage I can tell you it's
sufficiently big so Google Cloud Storage
is an object store in the cloud towards
a ton of data on there are many many
places you probably hit this whether you
go to a website and images show up or
things like that but we launched that
service actually in 2010 then 2011 we
took a pin Janata beta this is where you
could tell Google was very serious in
this market we put on an SLA where we
said hey we will guarantee certain sets
of api's will be around we'll have a
deprecation policy and so forth very
important to all of us you know as
developers and engineers that if you're
going to build it it will still be there
a year from now if you're betting your
business on it and then in 2012 last
year we shipped a couple of things we
ship something called Google bigquery
which is this amazing query technology
you can query excuse me terabytes of
data in a second I know it's astonishing
we have hosted my sequel in the cloud
and i'll talk more about this later and
we launched Google compute engine which
is our virtual machine offering in the
cloud and I noted here that it's limited
preview google differentiates your
limited preview means there are
workloads in production people are
paying us and we are happy to have you
come and try to compute engine but we're
just not going to open up the door
you know fully open just yet but we are
happy to help you use it data is
different beta means we're not totally
sure maybe it's going to change and so
forth and this is something that has
kind of confused the market a little bit
where people think oh you have compute
engine but it's in beta actually it's in
limited preview people are paying as
money to use the service and then so we
go through this whole history and then I
learned something new from Eric so we
learned like all this technology stuff
and I thought I was really smart with my
definition of cloud computing but it
takes somebody like Eric to really bring
it home he goes you know I'm not sure
anybody knows that cloud computing is
but I do know one thing its marketing
firm so there you go it's a marketing
term so if anybody asks you what cloud
computing is you can confidently now
answer it's important to my dating and
it's a marketing term so so let's talk
about the stack and oftentimes cloud
computing is thought of as a stack a set
of sort of tiered services from from the
lower level which is called
infrastructures of service I I IaaS
which is maximal flexibility and maximal
complexity this means you're your own
administrator you have to have your own
backup plans retention plans it's a lot
of work in fact a lot of times it's sort
of perceived as the IAS layers like
taking the server from underneath your
desk and like sticking it up in the
cloud whatever that means um hold that
thought let's do that later somebody
said without without their privacy
actually I disagree with that but I'll
tell you why I disagree with that later
and I'll show you some of the things
that Google is doing to be very very
very careful about end user data and
I'll talk about some of the messages
around that but infrastructure as a
service is is really kind of the thing
we're familiar with it's interesting
whenever I've given talks about this
next layer up called
platform-as-a-service a lot of people
ask me where the server is the platform
is a service to your tries to remove the
user from this infrastructure layer but
you have a different programming model
and in fact it's very hard for
developers to think in this model but if
you can get into this model it's very
powerful and then at the top of this
tier I'll go through each of
use a little bit more as
software-as-a-service this is where you
have things like you know Google Drive
Google Docs you know Google Spreadsheets
Gmail YouTube all these things like you
can use at the service layer you can
even build on top of them they are
programmable you can put you know
javascript in your your google
spreadsheets and you can pull data from
the lower tiers in the infrastructure
layer up and there's all these examples
out there that allow you to view this
it's super cool but that's the
software's a serviced here at the top
what's interesting about SAS is it's
less less flexible but it's lower
complexity so it's easier to use but you
you don't have perhaps all the controls
you want so there's trade-offs at each
of these layers so let's talk about each
one I'm just a little bit more and then
I will take you into how the Google
pieces plug into these tears so
infrastructure as a service layer as I
had mentioned these are the building
blocks these are the pieces that we know
today where we talk about storage like i
got i have disks we talked about you
know computing resources i have machines
we talked about databases i have
databases and this is the layer where a
very thin layer will come on top of it
it allows you to access it over the
cloud but it looks familiar i'll show
you an example later of compute engine
where we can log into Google compute
engine it's a machine in the cloud I get
a you know a UNIX prompt and I can do
stuff like configure web servers or run
computational workloads whatever I want
to do on it there's some terms here to
that you you can watch out for at the
infrastructure layer because there is
all this decision making to be made
there's this notion of zones like where
where are these resources and so are
they in the US or the in Europe where do
I want them to be how do I have
disastrous and so yes all this
complexity suddenly enters in at this
layer platform-as-a-service is different
so this is things like Google App Engine
salesforce com amazon elastic Beanstalk
and so forth there's lots of examples of
these out there but this is a different
model this is where you can't just take
the code that you've always written and
just suddenly put it in the cloud some
amount of rewrite some amount of rework
is going to happen in the platform layer
but what you get for it is you get like
authentication models somebody else will
handle verifying who the user is that
using your application you'll get
services like data store AK google big
table where you have like you know
infinite key value pair look up and it's
redundant and reliable you have things
like you know versioning control where
you can do experiments like I want to
deploy only one percent of my users on
to my new software versus ninety-nine
percent on my old software and as I'm
confident that my new bits work i can
actually kind of move the dial over and
these systems in the background are
automatically moving users to these
different servers and services so you've
given up some flexibility around
configuration and control but you've
gained a whole lot more around
scalability and then there are you know
obviously test services and payment
systems and things that you can
integrate in at this level there's all
of this resonating so far with everybody
okay good then we have the last layer
which is the software as a service here
this is actually where Google started
it's very interesting different
companies have taken different
approaches to cloud google has sort of
come from the top down we started with
software's of service things like you
know Gmail and search and all these
other things move down into the platform
layer with Google App Engine and further
down with these infrastructure
components I'll show other you know
others in the industry started
differently and fundamentally their
design points are different where they
started at the infrastructure layer and
moved up and you can sort of see this
permeate through their architectures and
then you know even a third one which I
can't name but sort of started in the
middle and sort of moved out from the
platform layer kind of up and down which
was probably perhaps one of the hardest
points to start out so I'm software as a
service layer your you have a model
around computation in code but you get
capabilities like I want to run a query
on a terabyte of data but the data has
to be structured or particular way for
example I'm you have things like Google
translation service and other things at
this layer so reduced you know
complexity the least complex but the
least flexible so how does this look for
Google and how do we how do we sort of
shape across these tears just one quick
segue the language of cloud
there's basically two languages of cloud
there is rest and JSON and soap an XML
every provider out there speaks one of
these two languages google made a set of
choices i'll talk about those in a
minute really around rest in JSON we
wanted you know simple simplicity you
know unless state fulness but there are
different languages of the cloud these
are important these will impact you know
how you actually develop your software
so Google where are we here's how Google
layers across these services yes I
realize this is a little bit of an eye
chart for those in the back of the row
so hopefully have like twenty ten vision
but I will walk you through these and
and give you a little bit of an
explanation of these technologies and
certainly we can talk more about these
laters I actually have demos of a couple
of them so I will definitely be doing
the demos so where do we start so at the
bottom tier we have the infrastructure
as a service so we have Google Cloud
sequel this is hosted my sequel in the
cloud so if you use my sequel sequel
server any other sort of you know Oracle
sequel based language my seek will look
very familiar to you the data types are
familiar the syntax is familiar you know
sequel 99 or whatever types impacts on
in the cloud you get this service and so
whether you're programming an app engine
compute engine or even outside of the
Google Cloud you have a database it
looks like a database right then you can
run queries and put data in and run
transactions and so forth what's unique
about the google google cloud sequel
that's different than others is though
is our monetization model the way you
pay for it you'll you we have two models
one is you can sort of get a
subscription model the others you can
pay per use and so for like ten cents an
hour you can have a hundred gigabyte
abase or something like that and when
you're not using it it automatically
shuts down for you when you go and you
run a query will automatically spin up
your database attach you to it let your
query complete I don't know of anybody
else in the industry that gives you that
level of flexibility for for their
sequel service so that's actually pretty
cool by the way I spent my whole career
and like these infrastructure layers all
the way up so what's totally cool to me
is not always cool daughters right
that's my nerdy where I've spent my
whole time doing operating systems
lighting operating systems are cool
we save one bit most people are like one
bit why don't even care one bit like I
got more bits on my phone then I like
all existed in 1961 um anyway so um to
the storage layer so Google Cloud
Storage has been around for a while it's
growing we've added capabilities like
static web hosting into the end of the
service so you can serve web pages out
of here we're one of the first companies
to support cores this is like
cross-origin request you know request or
whatever where you can say oh this
server can request data from Google
Cloud storage and make it look as though
it's coming from my own site and so this
fixes a lot of permissions problems when
you build applications on the internet
we have some really cool new features
that are probably not supposed to talk
about that will be coming down the road
here with this which makes a lot easier
we added a file API into App Engine so
it's easier to manipulate files in
Google Cloud storage we continue to
innovate quarter after quarter week
after week you know new bits are shipped
it's astonishing that will ship
basically new kernels every week in
compute engine I don't know anybody else
that does that at that speed and so with
that compute engine is our virtual
machine offering in the cloud we offer a
couple different versions of you know
os's they look very familiar and will
login you have different images you can
choose at the some point we'll let you
you know upload your own kernels and and
very interesting stuff but it's you know
we have data centers all around the
world and allow you to host bm's and
i'll show you that so that's our
infrastructure as a service layer very
cool growing there's more that will be
coming in the coming weeks months and
years and that layer the platform as a
service is like Google App Engine which
has been around for a while and we
continue to innovate services and we're
always trying to find ways to better
blend like programmability of inside of
the App Engine with compute engine so
you can start to move your code more
flexibly between the different services
we're getting better at that App Engine
you know has different models of
computation you can host Python code
Java code go code up in the cloud it'll
scale up or scale down it integrates
directly with the server
is down below so whether you're pulling
objects or queries you can also you know
have workloads run over inside of
compute engine I'll show you a demo that
uses Google App Engine as a front end
for hosting like the website and the
kind of the interaction of the data
model with compute engine where we're
doing some scalable computation um we
have some other things that are coming I
discovered that there is a sting out
there called Google endpoints it's in
trusted tester mode like I thought it
was safe to put it on this slide because
I like type this in and it showed up on
google so let's be okay that's the
engineering perspective by the way but
this is where we're trying to make it
easier for you to develop services so we
give you this API layer that handles
things like authorization and
authentication and payments and allows
like mobile phones and end browsers to
send requests in your service you handle
the cert you know the request and you
send back a response and so if you've
used you know Google Maps API to these
other api's they are actually this type
of Google endpoints layer that we use
internally and now we're going to offer
that externally and then moving up the
stack into the software as a service
here we have Google bigquery and this is
our service where you can upload
terabytes of data run a sequel query and
the answer will come back in second the
first time you do this it's actually
quite astonishing I grew up building
like sequel server technology and things
like that in years past and databases
could never do this I was astonished the
first time I did it and then you know
most people are probably familiar things
like translate if you build front-end
web pages and you want to get a google
assessment on the performance of your
page and how to optimize it we have
services like Google PageSpeed you can
actually go use we have a set of sort of
artificial brain models anybody see that
we took like ten thousand CPUs went out
and trained it on every video on YouTube
and and what did it learn to do anybody
know yeah just learned all about cat I'm
a dog I was kind of offended we have the
Google prediction API which does a lot
of that it's easy I models in the cloud
where you can train them with sets of
data ask for answers and then we'll give
you a prediction of what's there it also
does linear regression
models and lots of other interesting
things and of course at the top is docks
i mentioned box on this slide because
the ox can integrate with all these
other tiers to this like Google
endpoints set of AP is that we expose
out so everything we expose we have is a
restful api and in docs can actually
program around these whether it's in the
spreadsheets or forms or other areas
it's actually pretty cool so how does
google view the cloud so this is by the
way this last slide this was how the
industry views cloud they think of it as
this tiered model of infrastructure
platform and software as a service
google we kind of think of it
differently though we think of it as
apps there are set of things that we
built that you use and then we have
these other buckets of how we think
about the cloud platform we certainly
think about how do you build your front
end stuff like you know websites and
apps you know whether it's in your
mobile phone or you know android apps
whatever they are we kind of have this
part that we think about is apps we
think about your data data is very
important and this is where privacy of
your data is extremely important we are
one of the first cloud providers out
there to have encryption at rest so all
data and Google compute engine is
encrypted and we're taking that same
meme and value to the rest of our google
cloud so that basically means there is a
key we don't really have your key you
lose your key your hose because you're
not going to get your data back but
there's probably one engineer who's
highly audited somewhere that could get
the key but it's very very very
controlled so we think about storing
your data we think about computation at
scale we're very interested in
scientific workloads and we've done all
kinds of interesting things like you
know genomics you know video rendering
and so forth there's been some really
great articles that are written about
our computational capabilities and those
are out there and then of course you're
analyzing your big data which is which
is a problem but you know if you have
terabytes of data actually how do you
analyze it there's another interesting
problem which is I have terabytes of
data how do I get it into the Google
cloud turns out we I know I'm don't
really want to admit it you can send us
a disk not everybody's internet is
like google's internet but once it's in
the Google Cloud it's extremely fast yes
but you can send us a disk and we will
actually upload it into the cloud for
you so this is more the Google model we
think about apps computation you know
data and analyzing the data so what do
we do to build cloud so there are a
bunch of principles and properties that
we've really held to which our security
and by security I mean security and
privacy we we are highly highly audited
there's hardly there's nothing that I
can think of that to be touched in cloud
that isn't audited so if somebody has
touched a piece of data it's known who
it was when he did it how long they
touched it for what purpose they did it
and we have a very tight set of audited
controls and you'll see more about you
know audit processes and other things
later in the year we have strong off
models so we chose this off model called
oh off to it's a little complicated from
the developer end which is why we've
uploaded to github a bunch of code
samples like how to program the Google
cloud so if you want to use cloud sequel
or compute engine or whatever else and
we put a bunch of example apps out there
but there's some cool properties of
OAuth 2 which is like revocable access
if you give somebody an access token you
can actually go in and just revoke
access to that access token which is
something that's important so because
once you've given somebody access to an
app you want to be able to revoke it at
some point you don't want them to have
you they've got your key and they always
have your key that that's a problem all
too has other things like time limits
like you may look at the data for the
next five minutes and after that you
can't get it and so you see things like
that show up and our storage tier where
we'll give you at least five minutes to
pull the image and after the five
minutes you can't see it anymore and so
while there's some slight complexity for
developers there there's a lot of power
that comes for security or on that
consistency was a second mean we've held
I'm actually very happy to see the the
blog's picking up on this where they go
out and they say things like Google
compute engine is the most consistently
performing you know virtual machine the
cloud like if I'm getting you know 100 I
ops 2 2nd the disk now I see it now
tomorrow no matter how much seems are
you running the the workload seems run
exactly the same time and time again
that is extremely
hard to do but something we value a lot
is consistency open and flexible we're
giving all the examples out in fact all
of our UI that i'm going to show you
later I'm you can develop all these UI
yourself this is something that we've
we've held as a principle we want people
to build on cloud from all layers
whether it's the management
orchestration layer all the way up and
then yes we have code and I'm a security
guy so I try to use some leet speak on
you there yeah we has code I tried to
trick you and then proven so we actually
do use all these services today
ourselves in production Google is one of
the few companies I've ever been at
where we actually use all the all the
things that you use we don't use
anything different we use the same
things which is very cool so we prove
the technology and we won't ship it
until it's ready so I sometimes get the
question why the Google cloud while that
sounds all great Tony you know you have
security you have like consistency you
have all these tears offerings
everywhere i can write my mobile apps
and host them in the backend cloud you
know why Google Val well we know
something about data centers if you
haven't gone and done the the virtual
tour of the google data centers you
should go out to google type google data
centers it's phenomenal we have you know
powerful machines network services do
you located all over the world we've
been running these services obviously
for a long time and we're really taking
the best of what we have and allowing
the world to actually use google as
their computer and so why Google because
we care and we listen we take the
feedback you know every time I've gotten
feedback within weeks or months we've
you know we've actually acted on the
feedback so as you use the Google cloud
please do send us feedback we really do
listen so why Google because we listen
and we had the experience around these
big data center so some demos my
favorite parts here so I'm going to do a
couple demos first are going to take you
to the cloud console I'm going to click
on a web page that's going to be a very
sophisticated demo but then I'll take
you through very briefly some App Engine
demos but I'm going to spend a bit more
time on compute engine and show you some
of the power of you know what
fully generalized computation in the
cloud looks like we will spin virtual
machines up in Europe so while we're
getting close to sleeping there are wide
awake and so we're going to go to spin
up some machines over there and then
I'll just kind of round things out after
this so with that the cloud console and
by the way I closed all my email so if
anything personal shows up start
laughing so I know to close the window
very fast just very likely to happen so
cloud it's all together now so if you go
to cloud google com you can actually try
all these things that i've been talking
about here you can see different sets of
customers that we have you can click
into computing at scale you can go and
learn more you can dig through this i'm
not going to spend very much time on
this in fact i'm just going to go dive
into some of the other demos but we have
an amazing amount of help out of here if
there are examples you don't see
examples you want really like i said
please send us feedback and i'll take
you through it so cloud google com
that's your starting point for all of
Bob's if you walk out of here with
anything three things know that we're
helping with your dating because like
you need to know this stuff
cloud.google.com is what you want and we
care about security and privacy so
that's a demo number one there's cloud
like google com which year ago didn't
even exist so we go back here you can
tell I've done demos before because just
in case it didn't come up there it is
okay so cloud so let's go talk about App
Engine so App Engine is our platform as
a service here at Google this is the
thing that automatically scales up and
scales down dynamically for you it's
where you can host your your data it has
lots of services you can use to build
interesting things like we have an XMPP
service where you can go do like live
chat and at the back of your chat you
can have a robot trying to predict what
the answer is and so you've probably
experienced this somewhere on the
internet where you're typing into you
know oh I need help with my flowers and
it comes back and it says all here have
you done these things it's very likely
it could be an app engine app I'm using
this XMPP protocol out there App Engine
as I said started out in 2008 and you
can just
see like the phenomenal growth that has
happened with App Engine and year after
year after year after year we've added
services to make it easier to develop
interesting applications that are out
there we have customers across many
different tiers for App Engine and this
is to give you an idea of the scope of
how App Engine is used clearly line of
business apps at the bottom business
apps lots of businesses use us in fact
you probably hit an app engine app and
didn't know it at the consumer tier we
have companies like Khan Academy and
there's a bunch of other really cool
ones i wish i could could have talked
about but i can't but you know mobile
gaming is out there lots of mobile
gaming in fact the biggest mobile gaming
vendors out there you can think of are
all using the google cloud in one way
shape or fashion and then on the mobile
tier we have you know like newsreaders
likes Imperium you have pulse and others
and so App Engine you know obviously has
some big usage in terms of the number of
users or something like five point seven
point five billion hits over a million
applications on App Engine being hosted
24 by seven and we have a ninety-nine
point nine five percent reliability and
we're trying to drive that up you know
all the time so um so that's app engine
so let me go go pop in and do my my two
little sample app so I actually went out
if you go and you look if you google
apps com appspot are actually all App
Engine hosted app so if you want to see
who else is sort of out hosting apps on
App Engine you can go to an appt appspot
search I found this one which was kind
of geeky because we're all developers
here which is called shell appspot com
which gives you a thin interface to
Python so you can program Python in the
cloud and you know do like everybody
would want to do which is you know up
have a typo that's that's me I'm not
agree who bear print Tony I have taken
over the Internet thank you but that's
an example app right like you may have
apps that are programming apps there's
other obviously you know much more
sophisticated
vendors out there doing cloud
development and they're using App Engine
I found this other site which was called
beat the boot this is the this was a
chrome site that Google had built where
you could actually go and try to play
games to see how fast you could do
things you know how much faster you were
then chrome and booting and I was
failing miserably but this is all hosted
on App Engine the back end dated here
the front end you know presentation and
I believe that this one was I'm supposed
to race it in brushing teeth or
something like that and and clearly
chrome beat me so there you have it you
can you can write games on App Engine
yes it's very sophisticated okay and
then the demo is that I wanted to spend
a little bit more time on we're actually
compute engine and so compute engine is
one of our newest offerings we launched
this last year at Google i/o it's in
limited preview and so a few short facts
about compute engine and then i'll do
the demos which is these are some of the
things that people are saying about a
pin or a compute engine here and what i
like about this site here this was like
a genomics site and if you go back and
watch the google i/o launch it shows you
like differences between you're trying
to do this locally on your workstation
where gene association takes about 30
days / / association unlike powerful
workstations in your office and on
compute engine we're doing associations
like every kind of five seconds so it
fundamentally changes the way research
is done um we in the last six months
since we ship this we beaten the
terrorists sort record on compute engine
so a partner of ours map map are they
did this analysis where they were
looking at like why would you want to
move to the cloud but what's the
economics of cloud and how is it
different and so they went out and they
did a pterosaur and they said well what
would it take to build a pterosaur like
if I was going to go build a set of
machines what would it look like and so
they did this one thing where it's like
okay we'll need roughly 1,500 servers
12,000 cores it takes a lot of planning
investment it's going to take us about
six million dollars roughly to build
this the
data center that in a minute could sort
your data or optionally in 53 seconds
you can sort your data on compute engine
and at a cost of five hundred dollars
and by the way the five hundred dollars
will let you do it 60 times because it's
like 13 and a half cents a minute for a
core multiply it out you pay by the
upper there so in 60 you could sort 60 x
4 550 four dollars cloud is completely
changing the economics of how we think
about building software bar none here's
a video of the terror sort happening
this was produced by by map are and what
they're doing here is there actually
kicking off a script that's programming
to the rest api is on the on the backend
for compute engine they're pushing you
know software into the nodes telling you
know the you know have to go do the the
MapReduce could do the sort the red are
CPUs that are fully engaged the green or
the idol and this is what a sort
actually looks like computationally wise
it's pretty cool it almost looks like
the game of life where all the CPS are
engaged and then sub sets and subsets
and subsets and there you have it a a
pterosaur and second but let me go give
some actual live demos here quickly so
one is this so we actually have a UI for
for spinning up and shutting down
machines in compute engine and so here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
actually create an instance i'm going to
call it NYC because it's New York like I
said I have a couple choices where I can
spin up machines in the world I can go
to the middle of the u.s the east coast
or somewhere in Europe so I'm going to
go to Europe I'm going to ask for a two
core cpu and i'm going to tell it to go
kick that off and so one of the things
that you'll see and compute engine is
the first stage of booting a virtual
machine is called provisioning this is
where we go look in the data center
figure out what physical hosts we could
host the virtual machine on once we
figure out where it can be placed we
place it then we go into this mode which
is called staging and that's what you
see happening right now this is like oh
I have to boot an image
the operating system that I need let me
pull this operating system down to my
host let me tell my machine about the
operating system and then let me
actually start booting operating system
now what's interesting about Europe is
the image takes a little bit longer
because currently the images are mostly
hosted other places than x2 those data
centers and so it's booting and then now
its transition into this mode called
running this machine's me is the machine
is on it's powered on now so somewhere
in Europe right now I started up a
machine so I just use my 14 cents and so
I'm going to go make use of my my 14
cents here so I'm going to switch into
the end of the command line here so a
one thing
I will attempt to type my password in
for you okay so so what i'm doing here
is I actually have a workstation I have
a developer workstation in kirkland that
I actually logged into here because I
needed some gateway to get into my
machine like I said this is
infrastructure as a service layer
somehow you have to get into the machine
you know you can you can you know get an
external to it or whatever else I'm a
developer I'm going to go to the command
line so what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to go SSH into this
machine that's in Europe and I'm going
to use the set of local command line
tools that we have for compute engine so
we have command line tools for all these
different services this is called gcutil
so Google compute util I have a project
and so one of the first things I'm going
to do is I'm going to say list all the
instances that are out running for me as
a user and I wish I could check it yeah
sorry
okay actually what it really doesn't
like is the fact that yeah I have two
mistakes here no pressure no pressure
life typing okay now I'm definitely sure
I'm running um and and I know it's a
little hard to see in the back but here
what you can see is I actually have a
machine that's booted it is this NY
machine two cores tells you what image
it is gives me an external IP address
one of things I can do with the tool
though is I can just say SSH into NYC
which is my machine and the tool
automatically look up the IP address and
getting in and so here I am actually
logged into a server in Europe running
in a Google Data Center which like I
said for an infrastructure guys very
cool so yeah it actually worked so now
let me give you a more visual kind of
depiction of what this looks like so for
compute engine I showed you the front
end you I so there's this UI here I can
click on the machine and when I see it
tells me where it is I showed it to you
running inside the command line so I
could actually get command line access
and I can configure apt-get run all my
software have both programmability um
but here's a slightly different demo
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to spin up 16 virtual machines and this
is an app engine app front-end hosted
application and what it will do is as it
starts to go through the provisioning
stage you'll see green um so we have
gone off we told 16 servers to boot
we're 13 seconds and machines are
already in this provisioning stage then
they get the staging and then when
they're green that means they're fully
up and ready to go my co-workers will
often show this with like a thousand
nodes and it takes about the same amount
of time actually to start a thousand no
it's roughly under a minute we could
start up a thousand machine so there's
now 12 16 machines out there that are
running on my behalf somewhere in the
world and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you what this looks like
visually to have this powerful
computation at your fingertips so here's
a fractal generator
on the left side is a single CPU doing
computations on the left side are the 16
virtual machines I just spun up in the
world and if I click in one of these
watch carefully they'll bulldoze oom but
start to look at the details so I'm
going to zoom fairly quickly into this
this one on on the left watch the
resolution differences of these two
images okay here we go so if you look
this one is very blocky and fuzzy that
one over there with 16 nodes is already
computed you know seconds you know
before this one over here and so here we
actually have an application running an
app engine using compute engine as a
background processor literally with
these you know CPUs in the background
doing the computation and you can see
with you know even 16 processors it's
maybe shape I don't know half the time
off for three quarters of the time a
thousand CPUs this would just be just
like this I could literally fly right
into the great end of the fractal so
there you have an integrated demo of App
Engine and compute engine working
together and since it's getting late I'm
going to start to wrap this up so there
are some demos of cloud but as I said I
would give you the pitfalls so it's kind
of like when the dog grabs your sock and
we'll come back there are pitfalls in
cloud needless to say when the dog gives
back that pink sock I'm sure it's going
to be wet so let's watch out for in
cloud what is a clot is interesting the
copy the monetization models are
typically you know by the hour by the
day by the month I'm you have to be a
little careful it does feel a little bit
like you know death by a thousand cuts
where every day you go spend just a
dollar and at the end of the month like
oh where did I spend three thousand
dollars on this credit card bill you
have to watch out for this with cloud we
are trying to do things that Google to
make this easier more predictable but
we're not there yet right so just be
thoughtful of the services you're using
um as you move from the infrastructure
as a service layer so the software is a
service layer there's more locking
remember i said it's easier to do these
things but it also means you're sort of
more locked in all of us as developers
worry about locking google is worried
about this for you too and we've done a
lot to make sure you can get your data
out we have this whole
we called the data Liberation Front any
data that Google has you can export it
there are other things that we're also
doing here to make people feel more
comfortable about using the value-added
services without feeling locked in
location matters there are different
geopolitical rules different governments
depending on what you build you have to
pay attention to location if you start a
virtual machine in Europe you may be
subject to European laws so while it's
very easy for me to start it and use
this thing depending on data retention
policies and so forth you have to be
familiar with those laws so well it's
super easy to do doesn't mean you're
sort of divorced from having to
understand the legal end of things so
that's kind of a gotcha and then you
know sort of disasters happen right like
Christmas we couldn't play videos and
you know you hear about things but what
I want to say is it's really hard to
keep cloud services running on but it's
even harder to run them yourselves I've
been there and and so you don't have to
take my word for it build your own data
center run it for a year and then when
you're done please come to Google and we
will help you use our data center it
will be better for you so there are
pitfalls out there so with that people
ask me a lot of times where is the team
come from so where else would you build
the cloud than in the cloudiest city in
the world which is Seattle Kirkland in
fact almost all the cloud providers are
up there and we actually tell everybody
it's really cloudy all the time in
Seattle so I had to sort of synthesize
this picture with some clouds but this
is actually mount rainier in the
background going over the i-90 bridge
here trust me it doesn't look like this
ever ever it rains all the time please
stay in New York the second-biggest
location for cloud is San Francisco
followed by mountain view and as already
mentioned we actually have a team here
in New York that's actually building
cloud which is super cool so we have
sort of 24 hours of coverage we actually
have a team in india and hyderabad we
also have one in in sydney australia
that are helping keeping keep these
services off you know 24 by 7 for you
and with that I hope you learned what
cloud is I hope you're dating is
successful and thank you for coming to
Google
and I'm happy to take questions you
don't have to stay because this is
probably the last call for the beer but
if people have questions I'll be up here
you know feel free we can answer
questions so or not
so the question is are there Google
services running on Google yes in fact a
lot of the properties that are out there
are running on Google I actually checked
with marketing and unfortunately they
like to these golden handcuffs on me so
I'm not allowed to talk about it but
there are open sores you know you know
build servers and like you know all
kinds of interesting things are built on
cloud now I'm inside of Google there's
not a single line of business app that
isn't built on App Engine these days in
fact a lot of our external apps are
built that way too so yeah we are
definitely using the services we're
building you know day in and day out our
business depends on it I have a question
about the redundancy inches of pitfalls
like you said things do happen if I were
to get a virtual dedicated virtual host
I would go to the hosting company try to
figure out what kind of redundancy they
have all these backup fell over things
how do you guys handle things like that
have used amazon in the past so like you
said that everything is phase ago you
start up your machines but think if
something does happen how are you guys
pretty transparent in trying to figure
out what happened then just work with
customers yeah so the question was like
how transparent is google we're very
transparent I'll actually show you a
quick example so one of the things you
can do with the API that is super useful
so let me get out of this VM we actually
have something that's a that if you look
at the tool this tool here we actually
publish things like our down time that
we're going to have on our servers
through the API so if we think that
there's a service outage that's coming
will actually go list that I was going
to see if I could find it here it's uh
yeah I get get PCR is I get the sea hare
delete I guess my question was more in
particular like Amazon hat some of their
regions have been down in the past
unexpectedly so if my service is in the
middle of doing a bunch of
confrontations and one of the region's
happens to affect that or you guys work
closely what customers specifically try
to figure out what happened
yeah so for failover and disaster
recovery yes I mean there are things
that we're going to do I can't talk
about today because they're not released
yet that will help with these disaster
recovery scenarios right um we're very
cognizant of this if you noticed I was
talking about oh there are multiple
zones out there in terms of where you
can actually start services and so the
fact that we have like two zones in
Europe tells you something about
redundancy so we're building this level
redundancy end there are certain things
that you know customers will want at
some point like load balancers and
failover an automatic restart today it's
a little bit more salt service you know
we will get their specific individual
customers we're happy to share a Google
experience on how we've actually done it
successfully and how we've like scaled
up and you know kept search and you know
Doc's and all these services running 24
by 7 that's one of the benefits of
actually working with Google is we give
a lot of insight into actually how we do
that and how to sort of create your
environments which is why I also talked
about the pitfalls of disasters are
going to happen if you put everything in
a single zone and there is a you know a
planned outage or a unplanned outage yes
you're going to have a problem with your
application don't do that right like
today don't do that the alternative is
to use something like App Engine which
will automatically migrate and move
around failures for you which is why you
sort of move up to this next year that
you might start asking well could you do
that for virtual machines and then I
can't say anything thank you you hear me
yea though I serve Lodge evil
enterprises so my question is twofold
first of all other plans for a private
or hybrid and enterprise cloud so the
first question is is there plans for a
hybrid cloud and what this means is
typically part of the cloud is in the
Google Data Center the other part is
hosted locally this means that there's
generally a VPN service you know an
encrypted channel into Google we
actually have some documentation today
on how to do this with things like App
Engine apps talk to us more I'll talk to
you and I can't say anything here but we
can talk more but
it makes a lot of sense to a lot of
these hybrid models to exist though the
second question is what operating
systems are going to be supported in the
future or the compute engine the
question is what operating systems will
be supported in the future so today
there's they're sent to s and there's
another derivative that's very familiar
to most people which I'm not allowed to
say but you can go find it we call it a
G cell but it looks very familiar to
something else we will be providing more
you know more operating systems in the
future outside of you know linux
derivatives at some point when it makes
sense part of that's going to come from
demand from customers but yes it does
make sense to support more in the future
at some point okay thank you hi I heard
the how that poo was with them I do the
can you come in a little bit they do you
use that maybe you don't want to stay
there the other the other question is am
I heard the google app engine support
python go yo parental support crow for
which pro pearl oh it's a great question
um I can't say anything about future
features but we have heard many times
PHP is popular pearl is popular hey you
know could you just work your google
magic and do all this automatic scaling
with any you know language we bring
we've heard it I can't say anything more
than that right now but yes we recognize
and it's really important so that was
one question the other one is around to
do um we actually I believe we have some
white papers around how to run Hadoop
really well on top both compute engine
and it makes sense that a lot of cloud
providers have provided like software
that makes even faster and we definitely
recognize that too like yeah I can't say
if something is coming or not but I can
i can tell you yes we recognize and even
for both of those thank you i'm just
wondering is syrup like a long time ago
they used to be on grid computing
stuff like that I mean peer-to-peer and
things like this arm is it possible to
pick if one's doing could appear for
gaming some of the assets could be in
the cloud again for some reason I mean
mainly would be running peer-to-peer
portsea like if this far out then you
can come yeah so the question is is you
know will you start to see models of how
you leverage like access from the phone
and fell over to the you know fell over
the cloud or using the cloud in fact we
actually do a lot to make this possible
this is one of the things for the Google
end points to make programming easier we
also have things in App Engine like task
queues XMPP we have this thing called a
channel API which will call back into
your cell phone the deliver notification
so there's a lot of social sites out
there that use App Engine where you're
walking around and it's sending like you
know GPS location or whatever to their
app and then it's like oh hey you have
three of your best friends right next
door and that's all built on top of the
services and App Engine so absolutely
what you're asking for is there and it's
getting is Thank You securio City a when
you upload or a or you access a street
view image on the computer how many
machines do you have working in a
typical browsing like Street View image
yes so the question is is when you do
like Street View how many machines are
back there working on that I can't tell
you but what's interesting is is in the
last year Google used to have this thing
called pile servers and we'd serve out
these tiles we actually moved away from
that now and we're actually rendering
now in the browser so we're sending the
data and we're allowing you to cash it
locally on the phone so if you suddenly
drive out of you no Wi-Fi area but the
map keeps working for you on the back
end of that go look at the google data
centers and we tell you like where all
the google data centers are all over the
world and you can just start to like wow
there's probably a lot of servers out
there handling things like gmail and
maps maps in particular is heavy with
data so i can't tell you but it's
probably a big number
alright so I want to thank everybody for
coming um you know thank you Tony also
for taking your time to educate us on
all these things um there are quite a
few Google people around if any of you
have questions for any of us we're all
wearing Google shirts Tony's also going
to make himself available for the next
few minutes to answer any questions
thanks again everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
