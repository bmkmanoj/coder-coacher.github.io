invitation and Google this is a
the whole field is very exciting I think
the way that Hartman presented it was
spot-on I would like to make two
comments on his intro one is this is
perhaps half frivolous but there is no
absolute proof that the human brain does
not factor large numbers okay and in
fact people like ram anujan would be
considered evidence to the contrary so
what I guess what I'm saying is that we
we know so little about how the brain
works that we can't rule out that it
actually does things by brute force okay
and the second thing is that I believe
and this addresses Hartman's comment on
Stuart Hameroff I think that we're in
the age of guesses here we're guessing
people are putting their money on
certain hypotheses I personally think
the brain is a quantum computer if it
can be done at all it will have been
done by by the four billion year our
indi program and I think Stuart was the
first to to basically state that guess
which is still a guess but I I think
it's correct I and we're working on
hunches here but everybody every
scientist worth a damn has to have a
hunch and I think that hunch which was
Stuart's contribution will turn out to
be correct
okay so let me see if the events approve
me one now
okay Penrose Hameroff so now going back
to monster owners categories we had
level 1 trivial level 2 semi interesting
and level 3 interesting my talk will be
firmly stuck at one point - ok
just barely rising above the trivial the
thing is not being a quantum mechanics
specialist I find even the trivial
really interesting you guys have been
living such a high life with
entanglement that you've become
completely blase about the ordinary but
let me assure you this plenty of
ordinary quantum mechanics and biology
that deserves worrying about so this is
the first time I give this talk so bear
with me if there are any sort of rough
edges but the the work I'm going to talk
about was done by myself in
collaboration with two very good
condensed matter physicist Marshall
Stoneham and Andrew horse field and I'm
a biophysicist Marshall and Andrew
physicists and we were dealing with a
lot of chemistry so when we run out of
chemistry which was several times we
asked world Hoffmann at Cornell who very
patiently very patiently answered some
seriously stupid questions and abdel
raste who did some computations with
world huffman he was a postdoc there so
been through there has a penis and sorry
i should mention that all the
calculations are done we're done on a
SVM's wonderful software suite ADF which
is a density functional theory software
which is suited to idiots like myself
and and the people at SCM are incredibly
helpful and of course DARPA provides the
energy for all of this
that's my email in case anybody wants to
get in touch so benzodiazepines this is
a picture of Leo Sternbach who died two
years ago who discovered benzodiazepines
accidentally in their late 50s and he's
holding in his hand I haven't quite been
able to figure out which one it is
because I'm not sure what that Green
atom is is it a bromine or chlorine but
I suspect it's florida is that book side
which was the very first one that called
Librium and he was a wonderfully candid
pharmaceutical chemist it's very rare
that you see chemists admitting to the
fact that they don't you know they don't
have a clue and they just made it you
know they basically wanted to have some
fun with chemistry and some of the
products turned out to work so this
statement is our knowledge of the
processes occurring in the brain was
rather limited I think is the
understatement of the century so their
knowledge may have been limited but they
got extremely lucky and in in in the
early 60s they discovered a string of
molecules including for example
lorazepam now I assume everybody in this
room has taken benzodiazepines at least
once how many people here have never
taken benzodiazepine I don't believe
that for a second
I don't believe that for a second you
probably haven't you don't even know it
Librium valium rohypnol if you're lucky
temesta ambien no no ambulance different
ambience is a non benzodiazepine okay
step it fold it again
oh I don't still don't believe it okay
you guys have far to a plane of life so
benzodiazepines are extremely potent
remarkably potent molecules they work at
milligrams levels in the human body of
you know 70 80 kilos they're sedatives
they're hypnotics the axial enix the
really powerful ones like rohypnol for
example which we'll come back to in a
second are a mixture of all these things
they can send you to sleep they can make
you completely relax they use as pre-op
medication for most even minor
operations some of them are cause I'm
nizina which is a midazolam for example
makes you forget what happened in the
previous half hour which is if there
ever was a philosophical drug that has
to be it you you feel the pain when they
set your your shoulder and then ten
minutes later you've forgotten that it
happened did it happen nobody knows so
the terminology is that that's
nitrobenzene as a pain you add a own you
add a nice ring with a electron
withdrawing group on the side you add
another methyl and you end up with
flunitrazepam which is rohypnol also
known as roofies what's interesting
about the rohypnol molecule and this is
the first thing that were all Hoffmann
pointed out to me was that there's a big
deal alized
there's a big conjugated system of
electron bonds here that goes all the
way up to the aim I'd a might is not a
double bond thing but it's sufficiently
conjugated it behaves like a double bond
in this kind of context and so here you
have a molecule which has the ability to
carry electrons from one end to the
other quite easily and you'll see that
this probably important
so where do benzodiazepines act well if
you if you google it what you see this
is the right place to mention Google if
you google it you will find these lovely
drawings done by different artists they
all act of benzodiazepines act on the
GABA receptor so let me just single out
one of these fellas
and this is a artist's rendering of the
gaba receptor in what I call squash
notation okay in other words all the
subunits of the proteins are depicted as
colorful volumes with some shading that
look like the squashes you buy in
supermarkets in this season and squash
notation in biology means you don't know
how it works anytime you see that in a
biology article remember that's an
admission of ignorance okay and what's
really interesting about benzodiazepines
is that they work on the gamma receptor
together with a host of other things in
this particular instance you have on top
left you have midazolam which is
benzodiazepine propofol which I'm sure
stearate is very familiar with which is
a general anesthetic for now
pregnenolone which is another general I
said but a steroid you know I think
ethanol you're familiar with that how
many people have never isoflurane and of
course gaba isoflurane is the main one
of the main inhalational anesthetics and
so these are a remarkable class of
compounds the one I've highlighted on
the right Brett as Anil is probably not
very well known to any of you it's a
it's a molecular has been proposed as an
ethanol substitute by enterprising
British pharmacologists who believe that
we should stop drinking booze because it
doesn't do the job very well and that we
should actually actively develop an
alternative to alcohol this is a deeply
unpopular notion but I think it has a
great future and I just wanted to
mention this wonderful molecule which is
a promising candidate to replace I
haven't tried it and of course all this
stuff
it does it does have its usefulness now
how do we know these things work on the
GABA receptor people say you know these
drugs act on the GABA receptor how do
you find out that they do well what you
do is depicted here you inject the RNA
for the different bits of the GABA
receptor into a frog egg an unfertilized
frog egg you wait for a couple hours
until it obligingly makes the receptors
in its membrane you put two electrodes
to micro pipettes in the frog egg using
one of these machines on the left and
you measure the current that goes to the
membrane when you put on gaba which is
what the gaba receptors sensitive to and
you get a trace so the smaller of the
two electrical traces is the current in
response to gaba then you put on some
benzodiazepines and lo and behold the
response is increased the receptor is
responding to gaba and is responding to
gaba more strongly when there's
benzodiazepines and this is the
fundamental finding and and and it's
this is what I'm interested I'm trying
to figure out why the receptor cares
about whether there are benzodiazepines
around or not so the gaba receptor is a
membrane protein made of several
subunits and it sits with an exposed
part at the top which is exposed to the
extracellular medium and much of it is
buried in the membrane and it's made of
five subunits the alpha then beta alpha
beta that makes four and then a gamma
again these are different proteins and
each of them comes in different flavors
you can have alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 so
you can sorting out there the the gaba
receptor has been the job of marketable
in pharmacology for the last 20 years
it's a very complex receptor system and
the benzodiazepine binding site is
between the alpha and the gamma if
there's no gamma doesn't respond if
there's the wrong kind of alpha and
we'll come back to that later it doesn't
respond
and that's a benzodiazepine on the same
scale without the hydrogen's patient so
how do these things work well the
standard issue explanation that comes
from pharmacology in general is that
drugs work by a lock-and-key mechanism
so but what what is meant by that is
actually non-trivial what happens when
you put a drug onto a receptor is that
it binds to it and what you see here is
a molecule coming in and the receptor
binding to the molecule by two different
stay interactions at the top you might
have a hydrogen bond and at the bottom
Vander Waals interactions and the theory
of lock and key interactions is that the
energy of binding is used to turn the
receptor on okay that's where the energy
is coming from okay something has to
turn the key and the energy for turning
the key is the binding energy so one of
the things about that that's important
about lock and key ideas is of course
the potency of a molecule should somehow
have something to do with its shape if
it's that if it's if it's a key you
gotta turn it you know it has to have
the right shape unfortunately for us
perhaps fortunately the way that Leo
Sternbach engineered so to speak
benzodiazepines was to have fun as a
chemist and therefore he put in as many
modifiable physicians on the bezel
because what he wanted to do was
synthesize thousands of compounds that's
what chemists enjoy doing and so you
have all these positions on the
benzodiazepine ring that have been
explored and what is remarkable is that
not much sense really has come out of
this vast pharmacology as to why one
particular one works and another one
doesn't so let me just go through that
first of all in order to illustrate
structure-activity relations I've used a
thread on a Russian drug do-it-yourself
drug chemistry site called blue light
those guys are clearly really good ok
because this person says anybody know
how to make a better path of that has a
green
basically as if you're gonna do that in
your kitchen you know and he gets the
following answer all right and this is
this is as good a summary this is on a
thread this is good a summary of
structure-activity relations of
benzodiazepines as you will find
anywhere and better than most okay so
clearly these people somewhere in the
middle of Russia are worrying about
making it better rohypnol at home okay I
find it the web has revealed also it's
effective so you can do all manner of
stuff to the basic benzodiazepine
skeleton and end up with useful drugs
all the things on the periphery here are
useful important drugs and you can even
try this is a very unfortunate
photograph of coral enhance makes him
look like he's wanted by the police in
several states
he's a very distinguished chemist who
has been working for years on on
quantitative structure-activity
relations in other words harnessing that
power of statistics to try and
understand from a vast database what are
the important features and he tackled
the so called QSAR as quantitative
structure-activity relations of
benzodiazepines and after 22 pages of
dense statistics what comes out is this
which is almost exactly nothing okay in
other words even Corwin hatch can't
crack it and so this is a British
expression elephant gives birth to a
mouse so in order to make things worse
just when Corrine hatch thought he was
almost home several new drugs have come
out that have that act on the same
binding site and have nothing to do with
benzodiazepines in structure and they're
listed the three from left here and
they're called the Z drugs
zolpidem is Alec lon the zopiclone and
that's ambien sonata and I forget the
other you can see that the picture is
getting bleaker and bleaker in terms of
understanding
these things actually work now a few
years back there was a Villar it was a
he's a quantum chemist made an
interesting observation which was that
there was a correlation between activity
of benzodiazepines and the energy of the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and
this I remember reading this and
thinking this is kind of weird and
interesting um and then I forgot about
it properly for many years until okay
let me explain what why I thought that
was interesting the the reason why the
energy of the LUMO may be important is
if you're interested in charge transfer
okay if you have a charge transfer this
is these are two molecules that are used
in chemistry as the exemplar of charge
transfer GTF is extremely electron rich
and T C and Q is extremely electron poor
okay so you mix them together and they
form a sandwich which in which the
electron basically Goods gets
transferred from the homo of TTF to the
LUMO of T C and Q which happened to be
at roughly the same energy and this
thing conduct s-- okay the electron this
is actually a room-temperature metallic
conductor the solution looks as a
metallic luster angle so I thought this
was you know when I saw the the the
lares idea about benzodiazepine I
thought it was interesting but it was
interesting for me in a slightly
different context which is to do with
whether proteins are conductors or not
one of the fundamental tenets of
biochemistry is that proteins are not
electronic conductors okay
they're insulators okay and you can make
them conduct but only under certain
conditions and these conditions were
explored by a great man Albertson Georgi
I assume some of you familiar with him
he discovered vitamin C got a Nobel
Prize in 38 I think for it and then went
on to do all manner of strange things
and he had his own lab at Woods Hole and
he found a millionaire that funded his
research the rest of his life anybody
here wants to do that there's my email
was the
he didn't believe in writing grants
because he said if I knew what I was
going to do I wouldn't be a scientist
okay so what he did was he studied the
properties of protein modified
chemically modified to make the
electrons move and how he did it was
this he took an ordinary protein Kazon
albumin doesn't matter and you treat it
with a compound called methylglyoxal
which is also called pyruvic aldehyde
for those who studied biochemistry and
which is very closely related to the
butter flavor of popcorn
it smells intensely buttery and this
thing is very reactive and it binds to
the terminal amino groups of one
particular amino acid lysine and when
you when it does that it makes an amine
you will recall that the benzodiazepine
ring has an amine in it so we're homing
in on to the real problem here so when
you do that you find this is what's in
Georgia discovered you find the proteins
go black they treated with methyl oxide
albumin which is initially white goes a
dark brown and that to a physicist is
immediately a sign of electron mobility
what's happening is the electrons are
absorbing the electron transitions are
absorbing light in the visible range so
you've lowered the energy from the
ultraviolet which is where it normally
lies to the visible and you can see
these are spectra spectrum three is
native albumin two will forget about for
the moment and one is treated with
methyl oxide and this thing at the
bottom is the wavelength you see in the
visible range it absorbs pretty nicely
which is why it's brown now sin georgie
of course had he in his day had DFT
software would have cracked everything
and we'd have left nothing to us but he
didn't so you can calculate things that
he couldn't calculate and one of the
things you can calculate is the
homo-lumo gap the excitation gap for
untreated alpha helix with a with a
lysine and that's on the left and that's
five electron volts that's way in the UV
and
you put an amine on it you treat it with
methyl oxide and you look at the energy
and it's three electron volts so it's
come down quite a bit if you look back
at that graph the the DFT predicts
pretty accurately the peak of the
absorption at three point six one Evy
which is in the violet
now the observant among you will notice
that that excitation that the absorption
sorry of the of the of the protein here
stretches all the way east of that so
that even though we correctly predict
the three point six clearly there are
things that are enabling the protein to
absorb it much lower energies and for a
long time I think that was completely
unclear as to what could be going on why
would it absorb all the way into 456 and
send Georgie's point of view which is
quoted in this line was that electron
mobility was a fundamental thing okay
now no one these days would dream of say
of using the word clumsy to describe
macromolecules that's in biology that's
sacrilege okay and arguably it is
sacrilege because macromolecules do
extraordinary things but he felt there
was something missing now the people's
reaction to his work was well that's
fine but you've modified them with
methyl oxide that doesn't really happen
so who cares okay one word on that
methylglyoxal now is considered one of
the primary agents of protein aging so
that when when an animal ages you get
all manner of covalent reactions that
happen between let's say sugars and and
and other reactive species in the cell
and one of them is methodical exile okay
so I just want to put this in the back
your head that actually st. George II
may have been looking at a physiological
or pathological phenomena and rather
than an artificial but I think no one
was interested because it seemed too
artificial
now what happened recently or when I say
recently I mean the last twenty years
when you get to my age recently extends
further back Peter Kovaks issues in his
early 80s and still very active took the
whole idea of amines one step further by
implicating in minions the amine group
can be protonated and become an iminium
and peter Kovach's has documented the
effect of iminium containing molecules
in pharmacology in biochemistry all over
the place now why is this why is this
interesting
well because you can do this and you can
go from amine to iminium you just
protonate it at a charge now what
happens to the energies we've seen that
the unmodified thing huge huge gap no
absorption the visible the modified
amine three point six let's say but the
iminium is point two electron volts now
point two electron volts now we're
talking this is no longer the UV or the
visible this is in darkness okay so if
you managed to put an iminium somewhere
you may have electronic transitions from
let's say that the valence band to the
conduction band so to speak that that
happen in darkness so you what you've
got yourself is a proper semiconductor
now cuz I just pointed out that this
could be possible but he I don't think
he's he's very fond of quantum chemistry
software so I had to do it myself if you
look at the electron affinity of
benzodiazepines you have the bare
skeleton the Nitro group introduction
makes gives it electron affinity because
nitro is electron withdrawing you add
another fluorine you get a bit more
electron affinity but if you put that
extra one hydrogen atom on it all of a
sudden the LUMO falls through the floor
and you end up with an electron affinity
with respect to vacuum of five point
four V's now that the five V's is that
is the magic number because if
in order to take an electron from the
vacuum into the molecule you gain five
V's that's basically valence band for
solids how do we know that because it
takes five EVs to get electrons out of a
song that's the photoelectric effect so
this is not just theory there's plenty
of evidence out there that visit a
Zippy's actually do this in real life in
fact they're just about the only drug
that can be measured in an electron
capture detector directly without
modification the molecule they have such
a high electron affinity then you see
them in electron capture detention so
why is this interesting from
pharmacology standpoint well because if
you go back to the structure activity
relations ever mentioned is the fact
that if you don't have the II mean the C
double bond n on the Left if you if you
saturate that okay the data pins don't
work
that is a fundamental si R so you have
to have the in main and therefore
possibly the iminium in order for it to
work there are two exceptions I know
these days that people will look things
up and then email me so let me forestall
that there are two exceptions that two
perfectly good benzodiazepines don't
start out with an indian katana lemon
clucks as alam their pro drugs they
actually break down through the compound
that has the amine before they start
acting now why is a mininum really
interesting well it's interesting
because all the drugs all the Sonata
there's all peden there's a LeBlanc
zopiclone they all have an iminium with
PK's in the right region so this is
beginning to look like it might actually
do a bit more explaining so can iminium
cause charge transfer and therefore
conduction in dark in proteins
thus in georgy charge transfer complex
was covalent the t TF T C and Q is non
covalent so we're thinking of a non
covalent we're thinking of basically the
drug sticking to the to the receptor and
causing electrons to jump from protein
to the drug you can actually calculate
that I mean it's boring you can watch
these calculations roll
twelve hours I do that all the time I
just sit in front of my computer and
watch the iterations but you can
calculate an alpha helix is a structure
on the right is an alpha helix with two
phenyl alanine and we'll attach it to
rohypnol molecule and you calculate the
homo-lumo distance with and without the
iminium and without the iminium just -
you mean 2.8 electron volts with the
iminium 0.19 more than a factor of 10
okay so and this what this tells you is
that if benzodiazepine form iminium x'
they're in a position to suck up
electrons from proteins in such a way
that the protein that gives the electron
is probably going to conduct in the
manner that sin georgy discovered now
how do we know that this may be
happening in real life well it you have
to know where to look is the answer
because there's no direct measurements
of conductivity of of gaba receptors
nobody's doing that part of me because
nobody cares but they've done it
accidentally and this is what I'm going
to talk about people discovered some
years back that you could alter gaba
receptors function by putting more by
putting electrons so to speak in the
outside medium electron donors they're
called redox regions that if you change
the redox state of the receptor it would
behave differently
I just want to say by the way that this
discovery was made in Russia in the
cévennes Soviet Union in the late 70s by
pupi in Kazakh Shenko that their paper
by popular Schenkel was utterly utterly
ignored for twenty years that they got
zero credit for discovering this very
important interesting part of
pharmacology and they're still getting
very little credit they mentioned
they're sometimes cited and sometimes
not but this is a perfect illustration
of how much good biophysics was going on
in the Eastern Bloc that has just
basically been
forgotten so what they do is they put
drugs that push redox Regents act on a
particular type of chemical bond in
proteins the disulfide group and if you
push you can push them towards making
disulfide bridges between two amino
acids or you can push them towards
breaking the disulfide bridges and what
they find is totally remarkable you
you're measuring the GABA receptor and
you put gaba and it responds every time
nicely then you put something that
breaks that sulfide bridges and you get
a bigger response that's the dtt in the
middle the peak of the red bit and when
you remove the dtt it goes back and
that's perfectly normal because
disulfide bridges will spontaneously
that the 2's H's will spontaneously
reform to make a disulfide bridge so
you'd expect the DCT to be reversible
but then the fun happens you put DT and
B which causes them to make it as self a
bridge and you find that the effect of
DT and B is reversible okay now this is
very strange this is just not an
isolated observation the other group who
did that and published at the same time
found exactly the same thing almost the
same trace okay so why is this weird
well because the that's no v bridge
they're working on is in the outside
medium it's actually known which one it
is there's only one okay and it's in
this in a place called desist loop of
the of the subunits so there are no
electron donors in the outside meeting
every disulfide should be as a bridge
should not be as to SH s so the fact
that you can they should be fully
oxidized but when you put an external
oxidant like DTMB it acts transiently
the think clearly re breaks something is
keeping those extracellular sulfides
reduced
okay that something can only be
electrons there's nothing else will work
and therefore the electrons must be
coming from inside this now I contact
when I figured this out I contacted
Trevor smart who who had actually done
the experiments and he said you know we
always wondered why these things work
we're switching back but we couldn't
figure it out the biologists aren't used
to thinking of electrons crossing member
so let's just take it one a step back
here and look at how the how this
circuit might work
you've got the benzodiazepine binding
site is on the outside between two
subunits you have the cyst lope which is
not far from the benzodiazepine binding
in fact it's extremely close it's only a
fragment it's a long one of the protein
ribbons and where are the electrons
coming from okay they're coming from
inside but they can't just you can't
just give an electron to a protein part
of the you know in a random way there
has to be a binding site on the protein
to accept electrons from one electron
donor so what I did was I went looking
for electron for four sockets so to
speak in the primary sequences of gaba
receptors and this G this is a amino
acid sequence G is glycine than anything
then either glycine and alanine than
anything anything and then either
glycine or alanine
so this gxg excited G or a is a
diagnostic sequence for electron binding
sites incidentally there's nothing
SuperDuper mysterious about this these
are very small amino acids the smallest
side chance so basically what you're
doing is peeling off the insulator to
expose the peptide backbone okay the
peptide backbone is probably what's
conductive so when you have like scenes
and aliens in this arrangement the that
the month the donor molecule can
approach the backbone enough
to give it like transitory okay and you
find this binding site in the alpha
subunit okay of the type of subunits
that are sensitive to benzodiazepine so
there's a very good indication that the
socket is present in the right place and
the socket binds a soluble electron
donor so here's the electron circuit
that I'm postulating exists in the gaba
receptor you have any th givin giving
electrons to one subunit the electrons
travel across to the benzodiazepine
binding site jump across probably
through the PES of as appearing very
like them and reduce a sis look which
then opens up and controls controls the
the function of the receptor so what
we're looking at here is actually not a
lock-and-key
it's a field effect a chemical field
effect transistor it's chemical because
you need to protonate the bends of the
acid paint in order to make it work okay
and it's it's once it's turned on it
acts as a gate for electron flow between
subunits now how would you test this
well you could the thing about molecular
biology is you can have fun you can do
all manner of stuff you can mutate the
NADH binding site the electron socket
you put a big fat amino acid it won't
work any more easy to do I mean on a
scale of 1 to 10 3 easy to do ok not 10
you can measure and I can flow through
the protein during the experiment you if
you have electrons flowing hopping
through you should see a change in
capacitance basically the protein
becomes conducting it's in an insulator
you should see that as a capacitance
changing
you could try ligands with a very very
high electron affinity in fact I'm
thinking of some of the others
have a very high electron affinity it
would be very interesting to see if you
can trigger off if that's the mechanism
that they used to turn on the gallery
and finally you can mutate the electron
path to D so in conclusion next time you
take well those of you who don't think
Vince dies it means we'll be unaffected
by this but next time you take a
breakfast of champions like this when
you're looking at these molecules in the
form of pills think of them as
electronic components you may be
swallowing a bunch of transistors this
clearly you would agree with me that
this is one point one right triviality
level it's this is step one I'm very
concerned with doing things that are
experimental II measurable because I'm
not enough of a theoretician to have a
good time with theory okay so this is
step one but consider the possibility
that there are actually quantum effects
within the molecule people have
demonstrated wonderfully interesting I
mean since the beginning of molecular
electronics there's been an awful lot to
talk about interference between
different conducting paths of a molecule
I would I for one would not be so
surprised if somebody based on this
tomorrow showed me that the reason some
benzodiazepines work in some don't is
because some have a constructive
interference of electron flow through
them and some have a destructive
interference this is very much step one
we don't know where this takes us we
don't know we I don't know whether it
connects in any way with what's T really
say but what I'm saying is here's a
situation where we thought we had it
pretty much locked down and no electrons
no quantum stuff was involved and it
turns out it may be that the very the
level one quantum stuff is thank you
very much
depends on creation in a completely
normal way the pka's of these things can
be anywhere between let's say two and
and and eight of course pH bulk pH is
relatively meaningless if your drug is
is is bound next to an acid group you're
effectively dealing with a very high
local concentration of hydrogen ions so
yes it is pH dependent but whether it's
dependent in situ is not known
yes let me just find the slide that that
deals with that
you know that's the one
yes the GX g XX g is a universal not
Universal but is a very common and
binding sequence Stuart
okay okay
well not really
if the conduction has to take place over
the entire span of the protein it won't
find a if you want phenyl alanine type
network to do so very likely what's
happening is conduction along the
peptide backbone and the reason for that
is that the peptide bond itself is of
course conjugated but there's also there
are some interesting aspects to it sort
of a hyper conjugation such that the the
it may be that there's a low
conductivity all the way along the
backbone this is still pretty
contentious but as the FT techniques
improve excuse me and as in particular
as the linear scaling DFT that enables
you to calculate whole proteins comes on
stream we'll find out whether the
electronic structure of proteins
actually includes low-lying conduction
band States directly probably answer
this one I think the answer is it
depends how fast the tunneling
phenomenon of course scales viciously
with distance okay
exponential distance squared so if you
only interested in one electron every
two weeks they can probably be quite
fine okay the thing about these
receptors is that as you saw the
timescale of reduction is tens of
milliseconds possibly so and two
electrons every 100 milliseconds is not
you know is not a very stringent
requirement for tunneling that's a low
tunneling current so the answer is
probably further than we think um we
were talking a little bit about this
during the break but how does the the
drug molecule find its way there is
diffusion explain everything yeah I
think I don't think this I mean I think
diffusion explains I let me clarify this
diffusion explains how it finds its way
to the active site shape explains why it
binds to the active site with high
okay but binding isn't everything you
can have perfectly well have an
antagonist what we call antagonists in
in pharmacology or things that bind like
mad and do nothing okay
in fact the flumazenil which is the
number one antagonist for benzodiazepine
does not have any meat on it it just has
the right shape okay so the the equation
the mental sort of association of
affinity with efficiency is of course
very easy to make pharmacology don't
make that mistake they have it another
thing which is called efficacy okay so
something can bind like crazy and do
precisely nothing because it has an
efficacy of zero the problem is once
you've called it efficacy you haven't
still haven't got a clue as to what is
actually happening
thank you Oh tragic drug interaction on
the psychoactive drugs
other than psychoactive drugs yes if you
read Kovach's papers he has found the
iminium x' in all manner of strange
places I can't recall all the categories
but the answer is yes yes absolutely
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
