stage dived on to Twitter about a year
ago and has been carried along by the
crowd ever since and I thought she'd be
a great person to come here and explain
the appeal of Twitter to us and why so
many people are now saying twitter is
about to take over from google as
there's a search engine and everything
else Laura ok great I well I wouldn't
say it's about to take over from google
has a search engine but there's
certainly some pretty interesting things
going on in terms of what Twitter is
sensing and picking up and signaling
about life all over the world in real
time from approximately 14 million
distributed mobile phones at this point
in time and that number is growing very
stiffly we saw a very clear hockey stick
in April that I'll go through let's just
open with real quick basics um everybody
raise your hand I promise this is not
calisthenic just ever I raise your hand
go with me I'll explain why I'm doing
this you drop your hand if you do not
tweet so leave your hand up if you
already know Twitter okay good thanks by
the way if you you can put them down now
if you're a presenter that's the trick
because people are too shy to put their
hands up so start with everybody up
you'll get a more accurate number i
taught presentations for about eight
years so if my presentation stinks you
can laugh at me all right so Twitter
what is going on I obviously do a lot of
speaking on Twitter for business 101 I
actually strangely enough Twitter for
business 101 has now been taught at
Harvard Business School I know that
because I was the unlucky schlub who got
to do it it went over pretty well they
didn't throw tomatoes I was pleased
these are some of the key bullet points
I go through with my business clients I
work with J&amp;amp;J and Ford and a bunch of
other companies to help them understand
the opportunity sadly too many business
use of Twitter people are looking at
like oh great new channel to market
through you know let's let's figure out
how to sell on this and I take a much
more holistic look I think the important
thing is to build Twitter literacy to
understand the potential to understand
where it's going and understand how it
can filter down and blend into the
entire business it's not something that
belongs just up on that
customer interaction layer with the
marketing and sales there's a whole lot
more to it obviously the Twitter
ecosystem is is busting out everybody
saw this the equivalent of a slide like
this for the social media ecosystem this
is just a fraction there's about twenty
five hundred different apps being
developed for Twitter at this point it's
very hard to find the ones you want but
there are some pretty cool ones once you
get going even more interesting is that
a lot of these apps are not Twitter apps
per se but applications that are
interfacing between Twitter and a lot of
other applications so something we're
learning very fast is that Twitter makes
an excellent command line interface in a
way because it's a very simple UI it's
mobile and lots of people have it and
have learned it so I for example update
my expense ur account you know I get the
bill and I send a direct message which
is a private tweet and it tracks the
dollar amount and the time and where I
was because it knows where i was already
I can set up Doppler through direct
messages on Twitter so it saves you
having to go around to a lot of your
different sites you have that one
interface it's very simple you go and of
course Businessweek recently picked up
on kind of 20 classes of apps and all
the different things that are
flourishing these apps themselves were
actually seeing like series VC money
being put in two or three companies have
raised two million dollars just for
their twitter app another's raised
500,000 interesting stuff so there's the
first official tweet i wrote to Jack and
I said Jack I need the first tweet there
is one that's earlier than this but he
doesn't count it because it was machine
generated so if you ever see the
inviting friends to Twitter that's no
this is the real one and from one to
well over a billion this number is
already pretty old i think i captured
this in january it was one and a quarter
billion the growth the growth i cannot
change my slides frequently enough to
keep up with the growth it was 10 *
growth when you measured it january to
january it was 14 times when you
measured it just the next month after
that so it had already doubled from
november to februari more than doubled
just in March and then Oprah showed up
the weekend after Oprah did her show
with Ashton Kutcher it's estimated that
over 1.5 million people joined Twitter
in two days during social foo again
wildly outdated numbers these were
before any of that point of inflection
2008 December estimated eleven percent
of adults had used some kind of Twitter
leg thing this is research that's quite
old this is just an informal poll I did
a friend of mine wanted to write you
know to classic disruption kind of case
study on Twitter and she asked me what I
thought it disrupted I did what I always
do and I turned around and I asked
Twitter I was not surprised to see
Facebook come up so highly I was very
surprised to see right down the bottom
isolation I threw that in there almost
like a wild card cuz I know my personal
experience I literally may 17 2007 was
when i first got like oh there's some
value to this twitter thing at that time
i was a homebound mama two kids under
two in boston with no business network
and seriously if I kind of paraded out
who I've had meetings with this week in
the area you'd think I was the name
dropping loser so I won't but it's just
been an incredible way to connect my
mind to people all over the world find
common interest find mentors find
opportunities I it's really hard to
explain so why is it so valuable I kind
of recapped a couple of the big
historical tweets anybody not familiar
with the student who got out of jail in
Egypt James buck it's its ability to
detect earthquakes is often cited and
you see how remarkable the
mathematicians out there you know you
can see how early on in that time
horizon you can see that a point of
inflection is happening so when we have
the right sensing tools in place we're
going to be able to pick up events in
like 30 60 seconds as you can see in the
case of this earthquake which was last
July it took the AP eight and a half
minutes to get it the first tweet was
instant but obviously the first tweet
alone wouldn't have done it but you can
see that nice strong inflection point
there around 30 seconds in the future
we'll be able to tap into real-time
events as they're happening like I said
sensing and signaling Jana scrums was an
internationally published
photojournalist by the time he got off
the hudson river ferry that had
to pick up survivors of the well thank
God everybody survived oval Hudson crash
and the reason that was able to spread
so quickly and so fast was instead of
just being an iphone photo that he had
to then later download upload maybe send
a one person it was instantly broadcast
to his relatively quite small following
so here's a very first really
interesting point that I want the type
of minds who work at Google to be
thinking about very weak signals that
are good get picked up an echoed and
radiated and propagate so quickly
through the system it almost constitutes
a whole new model of influence and
influencers I do happen to have a lot of
readers in the system so I get pitched
all the time you know okay tweet about
my thing got it and I try to explain to
people look you know someone like me or
scoble or Loic or Gary Vee we're
tweeting 10 20 30 times a day not every
single tweet is going to take off and go
viral and be popular and get a lot of
attention so much more important that
you have a good important message so
this came out of a very remote part of
the Twitter network in terms of the
number of followers he had but it was
instantly replicated spread along and
passed such as the news media had it
within moments so obviously you guys
know how it works you've seen the
interface I think why it works so
powerfully is that there are so many
different ways to interact with it we
don't have an inbox problem with Twitter
the way we do with email right so some
people when they're beginning and
they're trying to read every tweet feel
a bit of an inbox problem but
realistically it's a stream you dip into
it you dip into it from mobile you dip
into it from many different types of
interfaces and platforms from the
website itself to bunch of different
ways to access on your phone you feed it
into Facebook you can pick it up in RSS
it's highly highly versatile and that's
one of the things helping it gained
acceptance frankly um if you've ever
considered trying to get one of your
bosses or your executives or your
c-level executives god forbid to blog
that's a huge time commitment and it's a
browser-based time commitment those two
things are not compatible with an
executive lifestyle however the ability
to pass on mission critical news forward
a link for an article that's important
to the company important to the work
group from your mobile while you're on
the run very well suited to executive
lifestyles among other job roles within
a company these are the kinds of things
we're seeing people end up doing the
fact that I came became a nano Laliberte
or whatever the heck you want to call it
was like a bunch of readers and stuff is
a little bizarre I'm really just kind of
this mom who's really curious and gets
really excited about stuff and loves
business and love seeing how things go
when you have someone who really is a
star you know Oprah obviously is just
joined to me more in Ashton Kutcher
everybody is probably sick of hearing
about how they're tweeting they can do
some stuff I could get into the whole
celebrity economy there's a lot of
backlash against it right now on twitter
but i think the funnest part of it for
the celebs is they're buying back a
piece of the paparazzi economy they're
parsing out their privacy on their own
terms companies are doing some
interesting stuff there's specific
business uses the external ones probably
more exciting to me because I've seen
how someone's career and professional
development trajectory can be affected
are the internal ones getting teams
better connected to each other making it
easier and lightweight and faster for
you to hit the entire Google ecosystem
with a query with an observation with an
important breaking article and have that
accessible and passed around without the
the obnoxious things like reply all I
mean who's not sick of email burnout and
reply all and those unnecessary chains
that go on and on and on the companies
that have implemented Twitter like
systems internally have seen significant
fall off in that type of annoying
behavior there are ways to tie it social
text as interesting work with their
internal tool signals there's ways to
tie it to actual work flow so that
you're kind of observing each other
without that obnoxious status meeting
that takes up a lot of your time so it
breaks down silos it lubricates you know
communication blocks and can create some
pretty interesting network effects again
because it's helping you harness the
power of loose ties sometimes the
randomness and silliness and stream enos
of it and activity streams focus allows
people to kind of peek in and find stuff
they might not otherwise know or see
a lot of ways it can build business
value certainly in a market in context
there's an interesting switch people are
coming to terms with in social media
marketing that it's no longer about
standing on a soapbox and making
everybody see you it's about talking to
others it's about providing general that
genuine value and interest to people I
do a cute little thing here it says look
guys social media is not anything new
people have always expressed
artistically or record keeping the
things of financial significance
important to them social media is
obviously knowledge how do we know what
we know usually because someone we trust
has told us in some way knowledge social
media hahaha markets are socially
mediated some very interesting stuff I
know Kevin put in the description for
this session the fact that is actually
true i'm a terrible shopper i hate
shopping i will not buy anything
significant without asking twitter first
so i get this tremendous social shopping
crowd sourcing thing that makes it a
whole lot easier for me now i'm an edge
case but i'm also kind of a prototype
for what could be explored and of course
i encourage companies not to take this
as their strategy for adopting social
media and I'll kind of skip quicker
through the ways companies can actually
get started I think we have a version
Amir with the thumb drive to apologize
some of these were meant to be in here
here's some examples of the types of
people using Twitter publicly in a
business context broke them down to a
couple categories here there's a lot of
executives there's companies trying to
do customer service customers try to
companies trying to build those other
points on there these are fairly old
screencaps so there's a lot new faces
and names on there it gets pretty
exciting when you can find someone who
is a leader in the segment of industry
you're interested in and this amounts to
a really really pure highly distilled
google reader shared items because the
links they actually bother to tweet are
guaranteed the best things they've seen
that week so in a way it can be used to
speed up your workflow and your
knowledge absorption by getting only the
highlight reel in a very highly curated
way from a specific
if you will thought leader so companies
using it in lots of different ways again
that's a lot of the company facing some
of the interesting stuff that is not
really happening yet but that's out in
the offing think about Google's
fundamental objective to kind of index
all the world's information right so
very important part of that is the real
time living web psychographic what are
people thinking about what are they
doing it in a given time sorry there's
just a bunch more examples in the
average day how many google searches do
you guys do like probably more than the
average audience but it's still maybe
five to ten maybe twenty Google searches
in a day but right and each search
you're giving maybe two three words
maybe five words and it's it's
phenomenally interesting I've seen down
in lobby to watch the search stream as
it pours in and and you know that that
gives you a sense what people are
thinking all over the world well twitter
at much much smaller numbers obviously
than the number of people searching
Google is doing something similar so
there's about 25 words in the average
tweet and people are tweeting 10 20 30
times a day so they're actually per
person for a really engaged user giving
a whole lot more words like almost in
order magnitude more words about what
they're thinking what they're seeing
what they're observing what's important
to them people say you're answering the
question what are you doing but frankly
people are answering what has my
attention they're answering and also
asking what we have in common and the
type and quality of information just as
an example in a commercial setting is
incredibly valuable because when you go
out and do focus group research and
explicit market research people freeze
up a little bit and you know don't quite
get the right natural answer about how
they really feel about a product how
they really experienced a problem that a
product might solve how they really
interact with information but when
someone bothers to tweet about it that's
a very natural authentic thing so the
quality of data and the volume of data
they're flowing through it are
potentially extremely extremely valuable
and I think we're just starting to see
good search tools both
study how memes propagate to study how
the the nodes on the network are
interacting and also to look at what
people really think about things so
again you know some kind of business
advice on using Twitter and some serious
examples of you know question I get a
lot is well you know if if I'm a
business and I'm using Twitter and my
customers aren't on Twitter well who
that cares so we've seen sorry again i'm
having a little version problem here
five really clear off platform benefits
right so if you're a company you don't
even have anybody on twitter who might
use your products a john deere there's
probably not a big substantial overlap
of john deere tractor customers on
twitter yet right so there's now and
then there's future right away you can
get search engine optimization if you
google the word pistachio right now well
i don't know how it comes up in
california i know in Boston it's always
number two behind Wikipedia is my
Twitter account a couple times it's been
number one ahead of Wikipedia which
which really blows my mind companies are
able to do research off of this they're
able to understand more about the
problems that they solve they're able to
use as a content generation engine we've
seen widgets on sites like ABC calm
during the State of the Union that were
relaying content from people related to
the actual event as it was unfolding
live there's a very strong word of mouth
pass along and as a PR tool is pretty
insane largely because the journalists
have jump on it so fast and I can you
know kind of go through the details on
that but i really want to skip through a
lot of this real set what businesses
need to know about twitter and get into
your specific questions because i know i
don't know what composition of people
from what parts of google we got here
but obviously this is a company where
there's a lot of really interesting
research going on a lot of understanding
of search dynamics data and I'd like to
know I'd like to hear from you questions
and I would like to hear from you your
thoughts on that an amis ISM of the
system and the types of things that
Google might need to be able to
understand to adapt to it so I'm going
to leave this one up so we can talk
about it later after some questions but
any questions now challenges things you
want to call me on and I forgot to start
with my signature line which is Stu
Twitter's the stupidest app you've ever
seen you know it is not the software it
is very hard to understand when you
first see it and it's only after you
catch a specific use case that seems
interesting and helpful to you that it
gets really exciting so maybe some of
you who actually use Twitter I'd love to
hear some of your stories about like oh
wow you know I was going to Geneva and I
didn't know where to eat and I asked and
got some great restaurant tips even for
something that simple it can be really
exciting and interesting are we not a
big question answer audience great
thanks you don't you totally don't
twitter twitter has you know one of the
nice things about Twitter versus
facebook is the symmetry but they really
need a third type of relationship which
I call permit dms the only reason my
account pistachio follows everybody back
is so that they may send me a private
message because I'm in a business
context and I have some visibility and
it's kind of manners if I could find a
way to do that without actually
following all those people to be helpful
because frankly spammers bounce off
accounts like mine in order to ratchet
up their Twitter follows because mine's
on auto follow back and the reality is
that i use a separate account to
actually read twitter so of the 30,000
people reading me they've all been
followed back the numbers a little
different because of the spam turn
people follow you wait for you to fall
back and then unfollow you yeah but I
use a separate account for people i
actually know also i use a lot of search
tools i consumed twitter in about five
different ways yes
I didn't catch the whole question why do
I think those were Kevin's words other
people are saying that I wouldn't see it
as a threat to Google but frankly I've
been scratching my head for about a year
now about why Google hasn't tried to buy
it yet because of that fire hose it is a
constant consumer sentiment engine it is
a constant signaling and sensing of
what's going on worldwide you know
simple stuff like earthquakes and
wildfires but also much more subtle
things if you get the right search tool
in place it is no problem with natural
language understanding to pick out focus
groups right you could pretty easily
track down five hundred twenty to
twenty-five to thirty-five year old moms
who happen to live in the Midwest right
keep it anonymous I hope that no one's
going to unethically go in and start
stalking people but for commercial use
you get five hundred women you
understand their demographic because
you've been watching the content of
their streams now you can wait and
detect trends within a very specific
group so if you are a marketer and you
want to know what is the day of the year
those moms start thinking about their
Christmas shopping you know if you guys
all heard the pop tarts a story with
Walmart they watched the hurricane
forecast like crazy because pop tarts
are the first thing to sell out when a
hurricane is coming who knew right so
now that we have something like this
that could potentially be picking up you
know and again it's going to be much
more powerful if it goes full-on
mainstream but with the current growth
its projected to be 350 million people
by August twenty second if that growth
keeps up I'm not saying it's going to
keep up don't email me in August and be
like haha you're wrong the reason I left
the zappos example up here is he's not
you know people know that Tony Hsieh the
CEO of zappos is tweeting a lot
personally himself most people have
heard that he encourages his employees
to tweet so he actually has one in four
employees tweeting back and forth to
each other and tweeting out to customer
version just kind of interacting and
being part of the brand out there in the
open he also literally has every single
brand that he sells he has a Twitter
search set up so you click through on to
any of those and you're seeing you know
a mix of false we need better search
tools you're seeing a mix of false
positives so in this case the brand is
free-style so there's plenty of people
saying the word freestyle it doesn't
really work that well but if you take a
more unique brand you're seeing a
constant stream of opinions ideas people
interacting with the product thoughts
about it I think that type of commercial
information especially when you
interface it with you know obviously
AdWords is a pretty important step
towards what is the future of media and
how does advertising and commerce work
and how does media not collapse on
itself when you start looking at
whatever next three things are coming
down the pike the live web whether
Twitter goes away tomorrow the genie is
out of the bottle on social networks
that are mobile that are based on very
short messages preferably with embedded
link context because that's very helpful
but short messages that ricochet and fly
all over the place and that's one of the
big differences between Facebook and
Twitter right now Facebook doesn't have
dynamic message flow in the way twitter
has like not even a fraction of it and
that dynamis ism is is creating some
really valuable data that i would think
google ruam be on top of Ellen
it's yeah I'm and I'm not the only
person saying this I've heard a couple
other people predict like price points
and time frames and obviously there's
rumors all the time about is Google than
a higher Twitter but there's rumors
about what Microsoft will facebook will
yeah and I think it is a pretty
important question I i was privileged
enough to go to foo camp out east in
boston and was actually surprised that i
kept falling into my usual what heck is
the value of twitter it looks so stupid
conversation and was having it with
jennifer hayes out there who I didn't
even know who she was I was so lucky to
even be there and I didn't really
understand the magnet magnet ood of that
until a few days later it showed up on
business week that she was launching a
research project to follow up and try
and study some of the things that I've
observed and some of the things i
predict are going to happen so i think
there are a lot of people looking very
closely at it building some
sophisticated search tools building
sophisticated analysis and understanding
what's in this fire hose how do we parse
it you know it just seems like so much
of what what gets done here yes you i
just saw a rapport this is among the new
users of readers only forty percent
return the money after suppose it is
true do you see that as a problem or an
intrinsic property of the tweeting
behavior so a problem I perceived for a
long time and I'm not alone in this
because the first time I ever met F
Williams it was like the first question
he asked me um there's a really big on
ramp problem with twitter because it is
such a stupid app you're staring at that
interface and going why would I say what
I'm doing who cares what I had for lunch
right I am not so I'm actually surprised
the numbers weren't worse I saw that
that figure last night that sixty
percent abandoned the accounts I know in
my own case I abandoned my account for
about eight weeks until i saw you know I
kept hearing all this hype this was back
in 2007 I was actually relatively late
to the game on Twitter so i think we
will see a lot of abandonment but i
think if if twitter itself or if the
developers in the twitter ecosystem come
up with some more critical use cases i
think the people will come back i think
we're seeing a curve a lot like email
adoption when people first got email
accounts they weren't that useful
because not many other people they knew
in their social graph had email accounts
they weren't useful because the very
earliest email accounts didn't even talk
to each other they could only talk to
other p
within the same node so there's there's
a trend I see is that Twitter will start
to talk to well it already does talk to
Facebook in the sense that you can use a
single client to follow both you know
kind of the IM model of aggregation and
interoperability but i think these
little status updates are floating
around into a lot of different types of
applications and software and that they
will be able to speak to one another in
the future and you don't get a ton of
value out of a soul fax machine you need
to build up that network effect and see
that thing in your life that's relevant
for me it was being home based working
alone not having colleagues and watching
a guy out here in the valley tweet the
different meetings he was taking it was
just so inspiring and it's so old school
surround yourself with successful people
that was the use case that did it for me
the use case that did it for Guy
Kawasaki was that he could find rumors
fort rumors that was what he wanted to
do and he was wasting so much time in
this RSS reader every day trying to pick
through and find them when I showed them
how they float up quickly on Twitter
he's like wow and then he went off and
found a bunch of other uses I think the
the fact that it can do so many
different things it's hard to hone in on
the useful thing for you will cause a
lot of trouble until that gets worked
out and we will keep seeing drop off but
I do think people will come back in the
back because you haven't asked yet what
issues has twitter head with spam
excellent question a couple aspects of
the environment of the ecosystem make it
unstable in some ways but there are a
lot of other you know there's been a
couple security breaches there's been
some spam there's been some actual tax
the one thing that makes it a little bit
less spammy is that it's opt-in it's
published subscribe you don't have to
follow any stream you don't want to
follow and you even have some control
over who follows your stream and so that
means if someone comes out there and
they're obnoxious and they're just
pitching you all the time and providing
absolutely no utility you don't have to
follow them and you can actively block
them where that's going to fall apart
and people haven't fully really
appreciated this yet
is I'm oh and I should switch over to
our back channel the convention of
hashtags and Twitter that's that's the
tagging convention for twitter is to use
a pound sign in a word that's a totally
uncontrolled namespace and unfortunately
as a result it's completely hackable
it's completely spammable @ replies the
fact that when you put the @ sign and
then someone's username it shows up on
their page whether they follow you or
not unfortunately that's quite spammable
as well and I'm not sure how Twitter
will be able to respond to that one
thing I have seen is accounts that come
in and start doing at reply spam so if
they were like you know at pistachio
blah blah blah at Kevin marks blah blah
blah at scoble Iser blah blah blah and
they're saying the same message over and
over Twitter will step in and shut them
down the other type of abuse we're
seeing is people taking advantage of
scripts auto follow on a couple other
things to jack up their follower numbers
so when you go into Twitter and you see
someone as sixty thousand followers the
perception used to be wow they must be
contributing something valuable and
interesting thank you Kevin's secret
locked computer alright so if you have
tweeted thank you more more spam
problems will come Twitter's fighting
and aggressive ative one technical
person already on board just to fight
spam and they have a customer service
person coming on board to fight spam
there was another question back there
you've been waiting a while talk a lot
about the opportunities
Twitter just twitter itself that
monetization issues and what do you
think of the next monetization steps so
I talked a lot about the companies that
are you know building apps through
Twitter what do I think about Twitter's
monetization issues and what was the
last part of that the next steps okay so
the first I'll disclose I'm adviser to a
couple of the Twitter apps tip joy and
co tweet and i also have a start-up
myself that is related to the whole
twitter ecosystem is kind of a Twitter
revenue play I've never been that
worried about the monetization thing I
get asked that in my press interviews
almost all the time just because that's
the really popular question to ask I see
it very much like early settlers are a
little wagon train and then they circle
and maybe there's a little interchange
between families so you have sugar i
have lard you know whatever but there's
not much commercial activity and then an
ecosystem grows a community grows next
thing you know it's a raging metropolis
and just the fact that there's so many
people in one place means there's all
kinds of commercial opportunity and and
Google obviously is the poster child for
this has done a phenomenal job of
channeling I mean attention in traffic
are what make real estate value and the
way google has approached that and found
revenue models after all the other stuff
was worked out has worked phenomenally
for google will Twitter be able to
replicate that I think they'll be able
to take some of the lessons from it I
think the fact that so much commerce is
already going on within the ecosystem so
many people find each other build out
their business networks find leads this
is a quite a serious lead generation
tool among many other things that can do
for business I think the trick will just
be ascertaining what's going on
economically and how to tap into that
for a fair share of it for example I'm
shocked how much data they give away for
free because frankly that pipe of data
that can be searched in parts is
extremely valuable and it may be there
just waiting for the the mass audience
and the right tools to be built and then
they'll put a price tag on the data I
mean there's so many things they could
put a price tag on now without ticking
off the average users that I'm actually
personally not too worried about it at
all but but less people are
so has been around for more than three
years something and nothing much
happened at some time in two thousand he
seems to have given a lot of the tipping
point so the question is why did it not
happen sooner and what happened in two
thousand a that caused it to cross the
tipping point and what is going to be
driving explore all right again I didn't
hear the very last thing you said was
I'm sorry what's driving the ghost today
okay great questions why didn't it
happen before I would say the onramp
problem is a big one because too many
people you know the number of the forty
to sixty percent where sixty percent
abandon and forty percent stay was much
worse it was more like one to ten in the
early stages of it it looks so stupid on
the surface that people have a really
hard time wrapping their brain around
why it's not stupid and of course the
technical problems I mean a year ago
there were plenty of people saying well
hell twitter is going to lose two
identica it's going to lose to plurk
it's down too much the fail whale made
its debut and rise to cult status the
network itself was not scaling it was
designed as a content management system
and really it's a message relay system
so they had to re-architect biz
described the process as you know your
body's constantly regenerating all its
cells they kind of had to regenerate the
code bit by bit over a course of several
months to totally riorca tech that
scalability um why it's taking off now
you can point to a few obvious things
news events the Hudson River crash
kicked off its own flurry when you look
carefully at the growth curve and I'm
not going to go all the way back in the
presentation to it but you can see
October there was a lot of election
activity that leveled off as soon as the
election happened in November and then
Mumbai over Thanksgiving started to take
it off again so everything that brought
it up onto the world's radar into the
international media scene has been
driving the current growth I hope they
solve the onramp problem enough that the
growth starts being more generally viral
as opposed to media driven because yes
certainly the recent stuff has been very
media driven the 1.5 million
in one weekend that's just the Oprah
effect so it's going to be a really
interesting to see one of the cool
things about it those of you who are not
on Twitter right now you can literally
take out your mobile phone send the text
with the word join to 40404 and you now
have a Twitter account and it pings you
back and it said oh no I'm feel free to
do it and imagine okay so one thing I'd
like people to imagine is how could this
be used for nonprofits say there's a
wonderful speaker talking about a
charitable issue to an audience of a
thousand people who've never heard of
Twitter they could literally you know
like an orchestra conductor have
everybody take out their phones sign up
tweet a message about the charity tweet
observations about the world issue and
that would trend on the search page
because there was a sudden influx of
things you know because you can do
payments through Twitter they could do
real live fundraising from people's
mobiles while they're in their seats
focused on the issue as opposed to
hoping they go home and remember hoping
they send in the form there's a lot of
stuff that can happen in real time and I
think episodes and events of that are
going to drive future growth to how are
we doing on time here oh great okay
awesome let's do more Q&amp;amp;A Kevin yes so
there's a group called charity water
charity water org all one word that has
become a bit of a poster child for the
charity most often used for things on
Twitter biz simply put it in an email
last August that they were going to have
this September birthday things and a
couple people like Pete Cashmore at
Mashable did September birthdays where
they did fundraising for charity water
and promoted it on twitter twitter of
neat thing for fundraising because
you're sending out these little messages
that are very easily repeated and passed
on to other people and in fact there's
kind of an ethic where if something's
really interesting it does get passed
along those messages can have a
fundraising link embedded right in them
Beth Kanter who's probably one of the
best thinkers on nonprofits and social
media stood on stage at gnome decks and
raised twenty-five hundred dollars in
about half an hour both using the
audience it no
and also the messages they were relaying
out to the rest of the world people
bringing attention in in charity water
specific case the next big event that
happened with them was my own thing so
so it's been odd to end up in just two
short years having this like audience
it's not something I ever sought out
cultivated developed hoped for and I
have a love-hate relationship with it
I'm very grateful I've been lucky but I
don't have kind of you know the scoville
eyes or social media like I want to be a
big boy personality so right before
Christmas I was struggling with some
things and one of them was like what the
heck is the point of all this said well
you know I want to do something useful
and meaningful for Christmas I'm gonna
ask for 25 thousand dollars which to me
just seemed like so outrageously too
much money for my Twitter followers for
charity water to go build wells in the
third world because four thousand kids
day died for lack of clean water and
really that amounted just two dollars
per follower and tip joy the company
that does there like a paypal for
Twitter there's a couple others there
now I'm now an advisor because we work
together on this project we liked each
other so much they stepped up and said
we'll do it with absolutely no cost so
people were tweeting two dollars into my
charity and it spread like wildfire
across the network over a thousand
different people contributed there were
like twenty or thirty thousand page
views I was able to raise twenty five
thousand dollars in about three weeks
but even cooler and this gets to my
influencer versus influential message
model was a woman named Amanda in London
who had maybe a thousand followers where
I had like you 12,000 to 20,000 she came
up with an idea hey guys how about you
organize a tweet up in your town all in
the same day and will support charity
water so in three weeks just by
twittering about it 202 events 10,000
individuals 250 thousand dollars raised
in three weeks with no no major
corporate sponsors yeah there are some
sponsors on there but they didn't kick
in big money or organize the
infrastructure it was all self-organized
organically on this mobile network I
think we're going to see a lot of really
phenomenal examples of that moving
forward to it was prequel to watch
and how do government's like the u.s.
view Twitter there's been some
interesting papers on the security risks
the the fact that it is mobile and it is
very good at ad hoc events is fun when
you're talking about oh hey let's go
have a beer and kind of scary when
you're talking about hey let's plan an
attack the fact that the public things
at least are trackable is nice that's
helpful but I think some pretty serious
thinking and research needs to go into
looking at how is this going to be used
now the repressive governments that you
specifically asked about it's an
incredibly important question because
after the cyclone and Myanmar when aid
workers weren't even getting in where
situations on the ground we were having
mad rumors about what's actually there
and the government was being so
repressive about it I was able to find
four or five Twitter streams trickling
up because it's very hard to harness and
control someone on their mobile sending
something out there and they were not so
much a able to provide extensive
reporting about situations on the ground
but they were able to link to the few
blog posts that were getting out they
were able to link to the few photos that
were getting out obviously in the case
where James buck was arrested in Egypt
and as they dragged him off to jail with
his hand in his pocket he thumbed the
word arrested and therefore was rescued
very quickly that's going to invert the
kind of control that they exert over
people at the Olympics people using
nokia n95 connected again feeding into
twitter the way Yanez crumbs picture of
the plane in the Hudson was immediately
broadcast out if you have a nokia n95
you can stream live video right to the
web using flicks wagon or quick or any
number of different things and as the
video starts streaming live it will ping
Twitter so when I do this for goofy
stuff like the tires getting stolen off
my car one morning last twitter which
was thrilling that message goes out
immediately and people watch it in real
time and it streamed to the web in real
time so during the Olympics in China
some of the pro Tibet protests were
picked up by people with n95 s on quick
people were predictably detained but the
video was already out there and not just
out there at one website but out there
socially among a wide graph who very
quickly relayed the tweet
and the videos got spread very fast so
there are is a lot of significance for
repressive governments and and I hope it
changes them one of the reasons I am
obviously frothing at the mouth of
kool-aid over Twitter I make no
apologies for the fact that I am NOT an
unbiased observer but one of the reasons
I am you know well of my work is
business use of Twitter it's business
because you know that's where the money
is right why do you rob banks that's
where the money is the thing that
excites me the most is what can happen
to people when they're connected one to
one on these networks what happens if
you have like little digital SMA space
pen pals from the Sudan and from Kashmir
talking to each other and knowing a
little bit more about each other growing
up and coming up with that being the
normal thing that there are interfaces
between these wildly different cultures
that there are interfaces between 12 1
the messages don't have to get it
channeled up a big media pipe and siphon
down to the one thing that's going to
come back down to the everybody but that
everybody can watch each other and to
find their own interests and do their
own action around it I think there's a
lot of social action freedom government
repercussions again not necessary for
Twitter itself but for this thing that's
out of the bottle now the thing that I
call Micro sharing which is the the
global mobile one to one social network
powered short message exchange
yep how do you deal with how do you deal
with overload a great question most
people who get pretty actively into it
see it as a stream of information
flowing by so the question would be how
do you deal with the fact that your
cable TV is on 500 channels 24 hours a
day right you turn it on when you want
to watch and you turn it off when you
don't you use a content guide to see
what shows might be on that you might
want to see in the case of Twitter that
whole user multiphase thing I showed you
can be just passively watching keyword
search and only see the tweets about a
keyword you can when one of my favorite
things to do is I drop my friends pages
you know if I'm stuck on a train or a
delayed flight I just pop around friends
pages and see what they're up to so the
time it would take on the phone to catch
up with 20 friends in one day would be
your whole day but the time it takes on
Twitter just Co you know what's Kevin up
to what's Joshua up to what's going on
is something you can do very quickly and
easily without getting overloaded
because you're elected to go in and look
at it now that said it is a little
addictive so you have to kind of channel
your behavior and have some objectives
for what you want to get out of it but
the companies that are really worried
like we can't let our employees tweet
they'll tweet all day the waste time you
know sure and their job performance will
fall off and hopefully your company
knows how to manage job performance
because frankly somebody who's really
going to slack off can slack off smoking
drinking coffee going and irritating
their cubicle mates you know you got to
manage the behavior not the tool
everybody said the same thing about web
browsers when they came into the
workplace email when it came into the
workplace even the telephone the
telephone first came to the workplace it
was like I'll just talk to each other
all day I mean heck maybe even the
Telegraph I don't know a lot of the
stuff people think is new is ancient any
other questions you guys have been great
i want to let you out early because
that's another good presentation habit
anybody who wants to stick around is
welcome too but no group was ever
unhappy to be sent home early well maybe
kids who could have had candy iono you
guys have been amazing i really
appreciate you coming out for this and
please whoever wants to hang around
around a while thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
