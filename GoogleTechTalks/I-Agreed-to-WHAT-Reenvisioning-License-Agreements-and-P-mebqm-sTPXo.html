I am at the University of Waterloo am
and I'm going to be talking about some
of the work that we've done here the
primary portion of my talk I'm going to
be talking about work we've done
redesigning license agreements which I
know you're all really enthused about
and this was work that was done with
Matthew k who's sending back there so
okay so to begin with first things first
so Patrick you're here Joanne I assume
she's not here because there's only one
female no needs or any matter and then
Rob kroger not here either Celine says
hi all right so um she told me to say
how do you good very subtle um so I'm
going to give you in this talk I'm gonna
give you an overview of the the work we
do at the HCI lab and then I'm going to
get into this topic license agreements
and so the goal here is to show you how
to put the fun back into dry legal
agreements because they were fun to
begin with at some point I'm sure so HDI
at the University of Waterloo includes
myself and Edward link so we co-direct
the HCL lab we have a postdoc Andrea
bunt and then a number of really
talented grad students whose pictures
you can see here and you can see us on
the web at HDI you Waterloo CA ok so to
give you a quick explanation of the type
of work we do here at the HDI lab the
best way to characterize it is needs
driven design so we identify people's
needs users needs by studying them so
that's the top part of the triangle
right there and so we use methods like
contextual design grounded theory
interviews on site observations to
understand how people use technology and
then use that to drive the desire to new
technology and then we're possible we
like to deploy it put it out there in
the world and have people actually use
it because I think you learn a lot when
you actually you know put the technology
out there for people to use on a
day-to-day basis so some examples of
work that
done where we published recently we
study the gaming practices of the
Nintendo DS so you may not be aware of
it but there's one Nintendo DS for every
hundred people in the world and so with
that type of a penetration you start to
wonder okay how does it feature set
affect the gaming practices and so we
did a qualitative study found out a lot
of really interesting aspects of gaming
with the DS we've also recently studied
the work practices of mathematicians so
tablet computers so pen-based computing
one of the attractive motivating
scenarios for using these tablet pcs is
as an ad very natural input method for
mathematicians and so people are trying
to create pen-based interfaces to things
like maple in Mathematica but they don't
really know how mathematicians works we
went out there and studied
mathematicians to help drive the design
of future pen-based interfaces to
mathematical systems I'm the primary
work that I deal with is open source
software and specifically looking at how
we can introduce usability in a more
principled way into the practices of
open source developers and I'll touch
upon that in a in a bit but first what I
want to do is give you an example of two
representative projects one is kinematic
templates and the others are checker
both these were done by master students
of mine so one by Richard Fung in the
other by Terry Park so kinematic
templates so we observed how artists
work ok and there's this one important
result that came out of the had a lot of
significant implications and it's kind
of obvious when people color paint or
draw they tend to stay within the lines
right in itself not to groundbreaking
but if you dig a bit deeper you realize
that they stay in the lines by
selectively varying their motor control
ok so when they're defining lines they
have very precise slow movements when
they're shading then they're very coarse
with their movements and so they have
you know they have much less care and
attention paid to their movements but as
they approach the areas of detail or the
lines they start to slow down ok so
there arise over time portions of the
composition where they're always going
to be slow with their movements
right so the question was could we
actually make use of that and create
drawing aids for them we did so I need a
volunteer to come on up because you're
actually going to try out some software
all right there we go thanks Andrew
cuanto so this is like a are you joined
by the way so I'm supposed to say hi to
you from saline you missed the slide
great thanks thanks whoever conveyed
that it's all right you just yep you
gotta lay past that's all right so this
is kind of like an infomercial have you
ever tried to draw on a laptop where you
have to use like a trackpad or a track
point or a mouse and the results just
weren't that great yes yes see and this
is not pre arranged alright so what
you're going to do stroud assistant want
to get rid of my taskbar here we're just
kind of light actually what I'd like to
ask you to do is to try drawing a circle
in this blank space over here okay go
for it just click and drag
nice great now I'd like you to do it in
that space up there around the center of
the circle
so your circles are so bad to begin with
it's own marginally better and so what
I'm gonna do is give you a little bit
more help now try it you feel good about
it good all right so hold on now i'm
going to do is throw another template up
here for you okay now try to draw a
diagonal line start outside and then try
to go through that so like at a 45
degree angle so what do you feel
happening once you hit it oh it breaks
my Maris now try drawing a straight line
across the best the best output yet very
good thanksgiving a round of applause
alright so what are these templates are
doing if it's not immediately obvious
immediately obvious it's they influence
your movement and so these were here so
try to draw a circle i honestly don't
know it what your issue was but if i try
to dress circle right there at the same
speed and care you know it's much more
so you can see there's a big difference
there so the tool is obviously helping
you out most users so this right here so
those right there were passive templates
this right here is a different type of
template this is an active template i'm
just going to click the button and
you'll see right there starts drawing a
circle so it's actually putting a motion
inducing motion on the cursor i'm going
to grab another time
flip the Magnetic point template just
throw it on there I'm going to reduce
the strength of it to about twenty-five
percent move this one out of the way and
so now if I click the mouse and hold it
then you see it pulled into the center
so if I take whoops I take this one
right here and overlay it you can
probably guess what's going to happen so
you can combine these things together if
we take that first template one of the
first templates the hatching template
and expand it and we will increase the
strength of it place it over there and
then we draw with it you can see it's
influencing it so that it's actually
squashing the spiral so you can play
with the strength there dial it down a
bit and you'll have you tighter or
you'll have more of a spiral right there
so you can see it's being squashed so
these are kinematic templates they
influence the cursor as you're using
software and they really again drove out
of this observation that people tend to
vary their motor movements when they're
drawing and so can we allow them to
encode the types of influences that they
want to have on their motor movement
within the composition itself just
really quickly the implementation we get
the Delta X and Delta Y between the
cursor movement and then we can scale
that or add concerts to it to achieve
those effects so it's it's a fairly
simple at the lowest level but when you
put it in the hands of an artist you can
get some impressive results so on the
left right there you see the raw input
that we're we're reading off the tablet
and on the right you see the output that
the user seeing as they're using the
templates so you can see right there
that it cleans up the output
significantly but it retains the human
element so one of the big goals of this
work was can we preserve the human
element but improve the
persons output in the moment here's
another example so in this case again
you can see a lot of the lines are
cleaned up with the output from the
kinematic templates now note that doing
things like hatching and shading and so
on using both straight lines but also
curves and it's actually quite simple to
do with our tools so if you're
interested in this work and you want to
see more examples of what it can do and
read more about it I encourage you to go
to our website the second quick demo is
awk checker so non-native speakers make
a class of errors that are not made by
native speakers ok so if you're Korean
you might ask is this guy pure today and
really what you're asking is is the sky
clear today now if you put this if you
type this phrase into Microsoft Word
it's not going to flag is being
incorrect it's grammatically correct but
it's just not set this is not the
convention in English task is this guy
clear today and there are a number of
these types of errors that people make
they're called collocation errors ok now
we built a tool like I said if you throw
this into word you're not going to get
these errors flagged and again it's
because they're grammatically correct
you can spell correctly and so on and so
what we did is we built a tool to detect
these types of errors and offer
suggestions so I gotta do a quick switch
to show this video all right cursor
there we go ok so what you're going to
see is that the person is using
Wikipedia as a backing corpus I'll talk
about that in a second and then he's
typing in phrases so name it a day I had
some powerful t you see right there the
system is working in the background and
it finds that these are awkward phrases
in the English language and its flagging
them ok you can click on one you can get
suggested alternatives including
examples of context of use and so this
is where Wikipedia comes in it so it's
checking how often are these types of
phrases found in Wikipedia and if it's
not commonly found it's saying okay
there's probably an error hair and then
it's developing suggestions suggested
alternatives
with examples and so if you're a
non-native speaker you can look at the
phrases and then also look at the
examples to say is this the particular
phrase I'm looking for I'm so again this
is work done by Terry Park and is really
motivated on looking at how non-native
speakers speak and then the class of
errors that they make okay so very
quickly again we're taking a corporate
driven approach so we create an n-gram
dictionary of common phrases and we use
that to find awkward phrases and there
are a couple of really nice features of
using this approach first of all it's
generalizable to any language right so
you don't have to build rules all you're
doing is looking at frequency of use you
can also select a particular corpus to
achieve a particular writing style so if
you need to write a paper for a medical
journal and you're inexperienced in
writing papers for the medical field if
you have a corpus of medical papers then
you can use as you're backing corpus and
help you write language that its more
common or typical for that field so for
example you might be writing and you say
well you know the patient had stitches
but maybe they use sutures more commonly
so the tool will help flag those types
of errors and then again by using a
corpus we have this nice advantage that
as the language evolved as long as our
corpus evolved then the octa-core will
evolve with language so again if you're
I'm interested in this particular piece
of technology I point you to our website
where we have a paper and some videos on
it ok so my primary focus as I mentioned
is use building open source software and
the motivating research question is how
can we enable open source software
developers to produce more usable
software ok so they've proven without a
doubt that they can make high-quality
server class software the question is
how can they make software that's more
usable by your normal day-to-day user so
we started this project called in GIMP
so we took GIMP which is like the
Photoshop equivalent open-source
equivalent of Photoshop we instrumented
to collect data about how it's used in
practice ok open source software
developers get information through
mailing list through
reports but they don't really know how
their software is used in practice and
this is important to be able to drive
design forward so we instrumented GIMP
all the data we collect is made publicly
available which makes it the first
public corpus of application usage data
over the long term and we've been doing
this for over two years now so all the
data and more project information is
available in gimp.org now as I mentioned
all the data we collect is publicly
available so there are some small
privacy risks okay we know what these
are and so we have this consent
agreement which describes how you might
be at risk at using our software and you
can see right there there's our privacy
agreement but how many people actually
read these things so how many people
read license agreements when you install
software Wow typically okay I have at
least a kind of right typically there's
at least one person who said but this
really surprise me so no one here reads
license agreements ever great um so let
me give you some stats you kind of match
the real world so less than 2% of the
population is estimated to read these
things and so we actually since we're at
Google we looked at some of your
materials they have online and so you
have a number of privacy videos for
different products and so for orkut the
video the youtube video for the privacy
aspects of orc had about 400,000 views
and there's has to be estimated to be
about 30 million users all right so
we're still at the less than 2% figure
and then eighty-four thousand views for
the web history privacy video out of how
many millions of users of Google Apps I
don't know you have those numbers but
this is you know likely far less than
one percent right so people aren't
reading these things right and I always
get this question well do companies
actually want their users to read these
things so again i'm at Google you have a
web page you have a privacy Center where
you're trying to communicate this
information to your users okay so the
question is how effective is this but
you're really not the only example right
you're a good example of a company that
you know
how's the users best interests in mind
output there are other companies who are
interested in doing this kind of stuff
so aviary for example is an online web
application and they have this license
agreement they have with a summary of
the agreement terms on the right and we
recently just gotten some attention on
digg so we're interested in improving
agreements so that people are more
likely to read them and again I think we
can make an argument that some companies
do want to have their users understand
their service agreements another area of
business that's that's concerned with
this is insurance companies so if they
can present their clients potential
clients an agreement that's easy to
understand it's a marketing advantage
for them I think say you know come to us
you know you can read and fully
comprehend and easily understand our
terms of agreement um but obviously
there there are some people don't want
you to read them so spyware is an
example right so for some spyware
applications it takes literally hours to
read all the documentation associated
with their license agreement but we've
also talked to lawyers about this and so
lawyers don't want to be in a situation
where they're in court where someone's
contesting the terms of agreement and
the person saying I didn't read this
right you know I spent no time and you
know I didn't notice it or whatever they
don't want to be caught in that
situation even though the US courts have
typically upheld that the agreements
still binding that you still don't want
to be in that situation so the question
is how can we improve this so to give
you an outline of where i'm going with
us to the talk i'm going to first
discuss some problems with agreements so
why are these ineffective talk about
some goals for redesign explore the
design space of potential solutions and
then i'm going to introduce our
particular solution called textured
agreement we're an experimental study
I'll convey those well convey those
results and I'll conclude with some
future work so what issues do we have
well we have this ineffective
presentation of information so right
here this is the iTunes a gray in it and
you can see right off the bat it's all
bold it's all caps at the top right all
caps text is much more difficult to read
because you don't have that you can't
see the word forms and so it's just this
wall of text right there's no real
visual design that's gone into the
presentation of that content but these
things also have very little personal
relevance okay and the person has little
agency in the entire transaction right
this is legalese where the company is
trying to impose limitations and terms
and policies on the user but it's not
like it's you know being conveyed as
it's in their best interest to
understand me to understand these things
right they're fulfilling a legal
obligation but at the same time it's a
one side of negotiation right you either
agree to these terms or you disagree and
use something else right and so it's
blocking you you you're trying to get a
task done but it's popping up this legal
agreement the you have to agree to to
continue on with your task but we also
see tons of these things right and so
over time we become desensitized to them
and we just get used to clicking i
accept and next without reading them so
these are all issues that are motivating
people just to simply ignore these
agreements so if we take those issues
and we turn around we can say what our
goals we can sense it to synthesize a
set of goals for redesigning the
agreements so first of all we want to
compel people to actually read these
things we want to get their attention
and then demonstrate that that's
actually worth their time to read these
agreements we also want to effectively
present the information in a way that
aids comprehension all right so we want
to get rid of these walls of text that
are not inviting you to poke around and
see what the document all about and
finally we want to be robust to
desensitization and habituation right if
you encounter these often and frequently
right you should be compelled to read
them every time you see them you know in
the ideal sense so how could we address
these what are some possible ways we
could address this problem well we could
redesign the consent process redesign
the agreement process itself so we could
require the user to scroll down to the
end before they collect except now this
is sometimes used and actually we think
there are some real issues with this but
I'll wait till a bit later to discuss
that you can do things like rearrange
the button so the you know every time
you look at it the buttons are in a
different location which makes you stop
and consider the content and we've had
some lawyers suggest that maybe you need
to have like these
comprehension quizzes where people have
to fill out you know you know answer
questions where they're reading the
agreement before they can proceed and we
don't think that's a good approach
either one approach that's been
advocated is to have a one-page summary
of the content we'll talk about that we
actually studied that particular
condition now you could also augment
these agreements with additional
compelling media so you could have video
animation you could have comics so for
example Scott McCloud or Scott said
what's his name who did the comics
discount clown trying to rember so there
you guys had a roll out of a proc and
you had comic like this comic comic
strick narrative anyway so you could
have like a high-profile comic artist
come in and design something for you so
that's another option and then you could
you know investigate actually I visually
redesigning the agreements themselves
and this is the approach that we took
but before we got there we explored this
design space so we engaged in rapid
iterative prototyping of different
possibilities and we continually
evaluated these designs with think aloud
and redesigns on the spot so we had
paper prototypes prototypes brought
people in and then redesign when the
prototypes failed and we have 21
subjects in this particular phase so
this is what our lab looked like in that
particular phase of the project so
completely covered with paper and
sketches we'd bring people and show them
a sketch see what they understood and
didn't understand about it and then
redesign right there on the spot now we
tried things like video we tried
wordless diagrams because we want to
explore the possibility of creating
diagrams that didn't have to be
localized we explored text with
illustrations lots of different
alternatives and so you can see some of
the examples here so not only Rida sides
of the agreement but also some redesigns
of the interaction potential interaction
design so here's a video where we have
some summaries of the type of content
that's on there um so lots of different
possibilities so the result people
ignored all of them right once they
found out that they could skip through
it like if we showed video once they
figured out that they could just you
know
roll to the end and skip through it then
they did that right so these things
didn't seem to be working too well but
we did learn something so people did
respond when we took time to visually
redesign the agreement okay so they felt
like we were making an effort to try to
actually communicate to them right that
we were trying to have this
back-and-forth communication so what did
we do we turn some experts in visual
design so we turn to trashy magazines
why because they're financially
motivated grab your attention right and
the supermarket checkout counter or
checkout line there they're trying to
get your attention right so we got
copies of Star magazine Us Weekly
glamour GQ time National Geographic and
no like I'm not subscribed a glamour or
star anything like that we had to
actually buy these things but we you
know charge them to the University and
then we systematically went through them
and identified and labeled all the
different techniques they use to get
your attention so this then became our
wall in their lab so you can see all
these terror outs of the magazines you
can see posted notes on them we go in
closer you can see we're annotating them
so for example on the right there we
have a post-it note on the sheet but
also a label indicating that the
convention that's being used so right
here they have a bunch of different
authors offering an opinion and they
have a little picture of themselves
right next to the the portion of text
excuse me that they wrote right so it
makes it more personal it's like you're
actually communicating with the author
so we took all these techniques and we
cluster them together to come up with
this toolkit you could think of a visual
design techniques yeah I should mention
one thing so there were two of us two
males going through this after four
hours we would still stop and read
content in these magazines even though
we're not the target demographic for
most of them right we're not yet we're
not young women in their late teens and
early 20s and so the fact that they
still got our attention seem to indicate
that there was a value in these
techniques so we started out with a
consent agreement look
this and then we just redesigned to make
it look like this so this is our
textured agreement so there are a number
of different techniques that we use to
construct this first of all we employ
information layering okay this is a
technique this common in graphic design
in fact none of these techniques are
novel right when we drew them write for
magazines their application though to
this domain is novel so you can see
right here we have we use white space to
create easily identifiable sections we
have clearly defined headings we have
things like bullet points we have things
like bold text and so the information is
layered so that you can skim it you can
find content you can get an overview of
it by looking at the header headings and
so on we also use what we call factoids
which are seen as pull quotes in other
contexts so you can see right there on
the right we have some stats right some
numbers related to the content of the
agreement we have this quote right there
off to the right which talks about
content in the agreement itself and so
these are really bite sized information
nuggets where it can pull you in and
make you feel like hey you know it's
probably not that much of a chore to
read these things you know there's some
interesting tidbits that I can quickly
consumed we also have vignette so on the
bottom right you see this little comic
strip right here and saying hey we
collect command names all right so it's
talking about how the application is
instrumented okay and so these are much
more personable they're empathetic to
the end user right so you're essentially
projecting the end user into the comic
strip again to indicate that yes we're
trying to communicate to you and we have
your best interest in mind we also
employ sensationalism so for example on
the top right says the software collects
what and so it's actually quite easy to
add sensationalist sensationalism to
these agreements when you read the terms
of them because some of them are rather
draconian and so all you have to do is
just point it out you know make these
screaming type headlines and it's pretty
easy to employ this technique and
finally we have visual variety so there
are a number of techniques we employ but
we vary the use of the techniques
throughout throughout the agreement so
there's always something new to look up
all right so it's trying to pull the
person through by you know
compelling them to ask what is coming up
next so right there you see this is the
our latest design you can see right here
two different applications of the
technique so on the left is a moderate
application on the technique techniques
and then on the right is just this
over-the-top application where it makes
it look more like glamour and this was
intentional we will really wanted to
push the space the design space to see
how far we could go with these
techniques so that the one on the right
very dense very visually dense and has a
little puppy there is cleaning with you
we have you know someone that looks like
this the main figure in the screen
painting right you know what what is
this software doing and so these were
different points in this design space so
it's a couple of notes about these
agreements so the first is that we're
augmenting and embellishing the actual
agreement itself okay we're not
modifying the underlying content we're
just adding to it right and so we're
adding content on the panels on the side
but we're also adding visual design on
top of it and so the result is we only
have one document we're still with one
document which doesn't split attention
okay so you know we're not adding new
videos we're not adding new documents to
look at we're not adding comments comics
we're working with this one particular
document and we think there are good
reasons for this that I'll talk about in
a minute now we talked about this
problem of desensitization and
habituation to these things and so how
do we counter that how do we think we
can counter them well we have things
like the factoids we have the pull
quotes we have been yets right the
little comics these can be customized on
a per application basis so you can
continually make these things fresh and
new for every application now in every
am I asked him well what about the
legality these things so you really you
know tweak in the visual design of these
agreements a lot this is going to be
legal so if you ever seen fine print in
a document so this is type of graphic
manipulation where it's you know really
trying to de-emphasize a particular
point this is legal right so fine print
is legal these particular techniques are
likely to be legal of course you don't
know until you have a court case and
some judge decides apartment but all the
opinions we've gotten so far in the case
that these are not going to
effective legality the document if
anything they'll help your case so we
have these redesigns natural question is
do they work so we designed a
between-subjects experimental study we
invited people in we asked them their
particular task was we asked him to
download three different pieces of
software and then choose one most
appropriate for this image manipulation
task so we're saying you know evaluate
these three three pieces of software
tell us which one that you would use in
the long term right so we didn't tell
them anything about our true intent of
monitoring how they were going to react
to the license agreements themselves
okay so is the deception study after
they completed the study then we told
them yeah actually we didn't care about
the usability of you know year yeah
overall rating these applications we
really were you know measuring how much
time you spent on the license agreements
and things like scrolling we also had a
post task questionnaire they included a
Content quiz so we had five different
conditions four of them are right here
so in the top left we have your your
typical text-based agreement so that's
our control now in the top right we have
a another sort of control condition so
in this particular condition we just
threw graphics up there this we call
this the PowerPoint fluff version right
so we just put you know pink circles and
you know arrows and that kind of stuff
just to see would it be enough to have
the visual graphics on there to get
people's attention or did we need to
have more principled application of the
techniques we talked about on the bottom
left is a moderate application that
techniques on the bottom right is just
the over the top heavy application that
I showed you earlier our fifth condition
we had a summary condition so when you
first start up the Installer then you
had a one-page summary of the contents
of the agreement okay you also had the
full agreement later on but this was a
condition to test out this assumption
that or this question of whether these
one-page summaries are effective okay we
had 84 participants about 17 / condition
about half male half female so the age
range was 17 247 mean age of 20
or and we gave them a ten-dollar Tim
Hortons gift certificate which we find
Tim Hortons gift certificates are more
of a draw than just ten dollars cash and
I don't know why this is the current
thinking right now around Waterloo okay
so what are we fine well art we found
that our agreements do make a difference
so on the left you see the heavy and
moderate conditions and then you see the
minimal condition followed by summary
and control so in the control condition
where you'd have straight up text people
spent an average of seven seconds on
that screen now that includes the time
to navigate to the accept button to
click it and then the time spent to
click Next right so they're not reading
these things at all right clicking
accept next done okay we raise the mean
reading time by 30 seconds okay which is
pretty significant when you're going
from 0 right it's you know this is not
enough time to read the entire agreement
but it's a very significant result in
this particular context we also asked
subjects to rate how much they write of
the agreements and so again same
arrangement you can see heavy and
moderate are higher on average we got
statistical significance with a moderate
application that techniques look at the
summary technique it's pretty much at
the bottom not and we'll come back to
that in a second but the important thing
here is that people are reporting that
they're reading the agreements more now
we had a Content quiz and in this
particular study the results weren't
conclusive so we did have a higher mean
in terms of the scores for the content
quiz but the reason why we think it's
including inconclusive is we made an
extremely difficult quiz for them to
perform so we had three different
agreements potential agreements that
they could read right so three different
applications three different agreements
we asked them to pair terms from the
agreements with the actual agreement
that the term was found in with the with
some distracters in there right so they
could choose any of the three agreements
or none of the agreements so is a very
difficult task and on top of that their
primary tasks they thought what the
primary task was was to evaluate the
software and so there was no motivation
on their part
to spend the time to commit the terms of
long-term memory and so we're going to
change our study design a bit to probe
this a bit further because all evidence
points to these things working and so
we're going to revisit the snow version
of uncover engine and future study in
terms of visual appeal people rated
these as significantly more visual
appealing than the control condition you
kind of you know expect this when you
look at just straight up text compared
to someone taking time and effort to
redesign the agreements and finally we
got a number of comments like this so it
got me to read them when i install other
programs i never read them big letters
organized points and cartoons help I
think the organization was most
important right so these techniques were
working now importantly again are heavy
and moderate application that techniques
work during effects but the minimal
condition where we had the power point
fluff graphics was not having a
significant effect across these
different dimensions so I talked about
summary so we have this one-page summary
and and I bring this up because a lot of
people have advocated using summaries to
make these things more manageable so we
found that people did spend time it's an
infinite amount of time reading the
summaries right so that's good but when
you look at the full agreement we have
significantly less scrolling of the
agreement so that's the top chart up
there so they're not scrolling through
the agreement in the summary the full
agreement in the summary condition
they're not spending time so that's the
middle graph right there they're not
spending time in the full gram their
time is being invested in the summary
and so what's happening is these
summaries are short-circuiting them
reading or even considering the full
consent agreement right so while they're
working on by themselves people are
reading them it's causing them to avoid
looking at the full agreement now this
is you know somewhat I don't know if you
want called dangerous but it's it's it's
definitely something where you want to
stop and consider do you want to use
this if you actually want people to read
the agreements and make it legally
binding agreement because there's an
assumption on that being made on the
user's part that every bit of
information that's relevant to them is
in the summary when in fact there might
be terms and conditions in the full
agreement that are more applicable to
more more relevant to them right and so
you're making a choice of what content
you're going to show in the summary but
what that means is that the users
expecting that anything that they need
to know everything you need to know is
in that summary and so this again sort
of cautions against their use all right
so the take-home messages so one visual
design can make a real difference in
compelling people to read these really
pouring dry legal documents right by
spending time to design them and improve
their presentation right people are
going to think that hey you know this is
important to me they're trying to get my
attention they think this is important
I'm going to spend time reading it now
we talked about a couple different
techniques like you know ways to solve
this problem and one of them was you
know maybe require people to scroll
through before they click the accept
button okay this is an example of
providing or of giving them a task to
perform that's separate from the task of
reading the agreement right and we think
this is in the long run we haven't been
able to study this yet but we think in
the long run that this is going to be
deleterious to the the process because
when you get to that consent korean air
that License Agreement screen right and
you see that the accept button is grayed
out your new task becomes how do i
enable that thing right your task is not
how can I read this it's how do I get
this thing enabled oh I have to go and
scroll through okay done except next
okay and so we don't think it's
especially good to give people these
artificial tasks to perform to compel
them to read instead you know show them
it's worth their time right generally
intrinsic motivation to read the
agreements in cells and then again we
think that from the summary data we
collected that when you bring in these
auxiliary documents whether the extra
videos extra documents or extra content
this has the potential to split people's
attention and pull them away from the
full agreement so if you really want
them to focus on the consciousness oil
agreement we think the best approach is
to work on that particular document
itself working in that space so you're
not dividing people's attention all
right so some future work so we have
promising results we want to further
understand these techniques which ones
the most effect which you know whether
we need to use them in concert with one
another we have some intuitions we don't
we just don't have hard data yet to turn
this into a complete model to generate
these things we're also starting to look
at some new interactions hiding
techniques I'll show you some example
mock-ups in a second and then matt has
just started some work that's really
interesting and automatically generating
these agreements and so you know given
content that's marked up he's looking at
ways to spit out an agreement
automatically to reduce the load on the
designer to produce these and we're also
obviously very interested in deploying
these in software surf and services
outside of in GIMP so right now it's
it's really embedded with our own
project so if you guys know any
companies have high traffic you know
software services out there where you
know people are compelled to where the
company is compelled to reach the users
let us know because we'd love to get
these into practice and run more tests
very quickly to understand what elements
of the design are going to make a big
difference okay so some examples of that
we're looking at right now so right here
this is an example where we're starting
to augment the document we're starting
to label aspects of it that according to
the type of content in there so we're
taking these warning boxes that we had
in our original document and then we're
all mounting the scroll bar to show
where these things are in the document
so we provide a summary saying okay you
know there are you know X number
important warnings you know X infoboxes
not summarizing the content but
summarizing the type of content to
compel people again to scroll through
and actually look at the document and so
you can imagine as you scroll down when
you bring up when you hit one of these
warning boxes you can imagine providing
additional information for example
perhaps here in the footer to again make
it a bit more interactive and play with
the unique capabilities of the computer
compared to just a static paper-based
document another example right here so
this I call this the like the pop-up
video technique I don't know if we have
a name for ya
but the idea is as you're scrolling
through it you get these little pop-ups
next to the content to again add
interest to the document and to compel
people to explore the document to see
what else is in there and so you can
imagine as a point comes up we pop up a
vignette and then as you scroll on
another pop-up comes up with some more
information so again you know techniques
to try to help compel people to move
through the document see what content it
has all right so I'd like to acknowledge
our funding sources that we've a lot of
this work has been supported through
grants from in serc so answer discovery
grant us our a and then p gsm there are
email addresses and contact or sar-e-aam
URLs for the projects I'd be happy to
take any questions you guys have been
kind of quiet but hit me up with
questions yeah so I think there's
probably at least a few different
classes of users there's probably the
user who doesn't really care at all
doesn't even know what a license
agreement is strongly the user that most
of us belong to that kind of do care but
are can be bothered to read it anyway
and there's a user who does care and
does read every single letter do you
have any information about you know how
many people are in each of those classes
and I think that would sort of cap the
effectiveness of any techniques that you
did you do to to make these better on
how many people you actually affect so
um I don't have numbers in terms of the
different classes or categories Matt's
got a comment yeah so well we do kind of
have numbers because we have the self
reporting information on how much people
indicate they normally read agreements
so that oh yeah that two percent number
that he was pulling out there was
actually found in some other previous
work by some other people and then
replicated in our own study that's sort
of the class of people who say I read
them regularly and then I can't remember
the numbers off the top of my head maybe
maybe about twenty twenty percent of
people say they read them often and then
everyone else sort of falls into the
like rarely to never of course those are
self-reported number so
know exactly how accurate they are but
one of the things with the ID the idea
of sort of capping this it's that could
be true i mean most of most of the
increase in reading times that we have
are in sort of those top two categories
that i mentioned there was actually a
very strong correlation between the
classes that people were in and whether
or not they had improvement but there
was actually improvement in those in
those classes so it's not like we're you
know helping only sort of people at the
low end and not helping people who
normally read them we are helping people
who normally read them as well so to
build on that we were very conscious of
the fact that different people have
different needs and so we tried to if
you recall I mentioned that we tried to
employ this notion of information
layering right where you have in your
most critical points very obvious and
you have these different levels of
presenting the information right and so
our design was intended to work across
the spectrum where if you're this type
of person who never reads them things
like the pull quotes right the factoids
might draw you in wearing other
situations even there's no hope question
in the back actually sorry actually just
sort of building on that question I was
wondering about the results of the study
of showing a more engagement with the
introduction of the new techniques and I
was I was thinking maybe could it did
you consider whether it could also be
caused or would it be worth studying
whether that's because of the novelty of
the presentation I mean this is the
first time we've ever ever seen a legal
agreement with some of these novel
presentations like did did could you
measure whether wait a minute they're
just looking at it because it's novel
and then if they are presented with the
same thing a number of times they would
just start you know passing through the
same as before so the the condition on
the top right was to control for that
right and so that condition was just
like this does not look like your
typical license agreement right we have
some graphics up there we do have some
minimal design visual or you know
yeah visual design to the agreement that
right there was not producing any effect
so I agree with that but at the same
time it still looks familiar to people
right it's like the people have seen
PowerPoint presentations before and then
once they just figure out oh it's a pout
it's a legal agreement plus a powerpoint
presentation they just figured out
that's what you're doing maybe they pass
through or I don't know I'm just I'm
just wondering I don't know I mean when
we were doing the the qualitative
studies right when we had stuff that
confuse people or they they mistook her
for something else it didn't stop them
and these they blast right through it
right you know when we had like flashy
graphics people were saying follows just
like a tutorial where does this i don't
care i'm going to get through it right
and so I mean I think the thing to
consider is that you're gonna have a
continuum right here and you know maybe
the one on the top right has some effect
but it was it was just simply not at the
degree of a fact that we were sitting
with the other agreements but you know
this gets to the point of what's going
to happen when you know you have these
things deployed and lots of applications
and people aren't counting them we don't
know you know we haven't had the luxury
of having you know thousands of people
looking at these things you know
repeatedly but again I think there's
there are there's a lot of evidence to
suggest that our particular techniques
are resulting in people actually
stopping and spending the time one of
the things that we noticed with the the
qualitative comments so when people
talked about the bottom two ones the
moderate heavy application they mention
things like organization you know the
fact that they could easily navigate
through the the content and so on
whereas those types of comments were not
found in the the one of the top right so
I think there's you know I think there's
against some evidence that there these
techniques have to be you know the
techniques like the factoids techniques
like the vignettes have to be added in
it's not just having it's not enough to
have graphics on there the other thing
to keep in mind that I don't think I
emphasized is that every embellishment
that we have in the moderate heavy
condition is intended to complement the
content right next to it so for example
we have these factoids but they're
strategically placed
okay and we trying to we're trying to
accomplish something we call attention
piggybacking where that element grabs
your attention and then you're sort of
intrigue and then you go over and read
the actual text okay whereas the
graphics in the top right there is there
again the randomly place or not
strategically it's not strategically
placed to enhance the actual content and
so I think that is one of the major
things are major differences between
these conditions II when I go to the
hardware store to buy your product okay
in that Lance I can look at the hazard
signs and I know that the product it is
explosive corrosive or whatever why
don't we have official logos that tell
you what is in the license agreement
rather than you know what are the main
import the main aspects of the the
agreement right so this is kind of like
the Creative Commons approach where they
have the the different emblems right I
think the reason is that the terms vary
widely right and we're talking about
agreements that range from no 2,000
words on up right and so the GPL for
example it takes about 20 minutes to go
and read through that right and so they
might be able to be mixed in but I don't
think they're going to replace the need
to be able to go through the content now
to read the terms I don't think
essentially i don't think that lesen the
terms of the license agreement are so so
general are so what's the word so common
in practice that you could actually do
that I think matt has another comment
too so the there's like the p 3 p
project of platform for privacy
preferences which is attempting to
essentially encode terms in the license
agreements in a machine-readable format
so then another application can allow
people to set their preferences and then
go oh you know this is against whatever
preferences you said one of the problems
that that project has come up against is
that the terms and various agreements
are very ambiguous and it's very
difficult for them to categorize them to
actually make it possible to build an
application like this yeah it just
becomes hard to pin everything into one
particular category on the other hand if
you want to better communicate a license
Thackeray
and nobody will really read those 20
pages when you install the software you
need to find standard saying well those
three paragraphs they appear in every
license agreement and they should be
coming to every software so so i
mentioned we're looking at automation
approaches and one of the things that we
want to do is build a corpus of these
things so that you can start to
intelligently parse them out right and
so the tool can help you flag stuff that
is unusual but I I don't think it's that
easy of a task just another short
question or related I work in a company
where basically we realized we needed a
license agreement six hours before we
launch the software so suppose that in
my software i would like to have those
cartoons and all that the you know how
you could automatic it or yeah so as I
mentioned matt is working on techniques
to automate the production of these
things and we also have some templates
available there on the web where it can
help structure the creation of these
this guy's when we do you have enough
users downloading in GIMP that you could
run live experiments on them yes and no
so we are actually doing this so what
really got us into this particular work
is that our this particular research
problem is that we had a sizable sizable
enough user base that we had more
non-native English speakers of in GIMP
than native English speakers right and
we have this very lengthy consent
agreement it's all in English and so you
know we asked ourselves could we take
this and then create wordless diagrams
so that we can convey the concepts and
not worry about localization we did that
we threw it in the end GIMP and then we
randomized whether that would appear or
not and what we found is that there was
kind of like this novelty effect where
people would look at a few of these
things but then they would skip through
them and ignore the rest and so that
changed our course to really investigate
this problem of how do we capture and
then retain attention so we can do this
but we need to have like
regular release cycles to continue Stoke
interest and to get people to download
it and go through the license agreement
and we haven't released I think for
about a year is there anything that that
go-ahead from from California um just to
come back to the point that was raised
earlier about icons and also p3p so for
the icons there have actually been a
couple of attempts at that most notably
the trustee privacy seals back in the
beginning before trustee really got
launched that was what they were trying
to do they got pushback from industry
nobody who was interested in having
those little icons and if industry won't
sign on for it it makes it very
difficult to get adoption as for p3p
there are a number of pros and cons um
the idea that there's ambiguity in the
policy doesn't particularly make it
harder to author the p3p policies
because they're authored by the people
who understand what those answers are
right there authored by the companies
they know the actual answers it would be
hard for an outsider to code their
policy for them um but the companies
themselves already have those answers so
the question is do the companies want to
eliminate that ambiguity and that's
going to be an adoption problem for p3p
and has been companies like hiding
behind that there has been some great
work on there was a paper that came out
called what's wrong with privacy
policies that looked at deliberate
ambiguity and hedging claims and how
many companies use things to minimize
problems that's over in the privacy
policy world which is a little bit
different from this but pretty similar
so that ambiguity is actually on purpose
in a lot of cases all right
thanks sir another question yeah I did
you go ahead Oh California okay so the
question is you guys are looking for
licenses that are in use and rich Lewis
is promoted as an open source sort of
Licensing and in GIMP was the example of
it how you're collecting information so
the Free Software Foundation last time I
heard they had something like sixty
three different licenses and I'm sure
there's a lot more than that if you take
a look across like sourceforge there's a
huge variety of licenses that are there
have you guys looked at any of those and
sort of why people not only you know why
they can't comment get something common
ground on more of those licenses but
also have just in general how to make
those particular licenses more usable to
the users right so we had um we've
actually talked with them this one
fellow used to work for the Free
Software Foundation and there seems to
be some interest potential interest in
applying this to the GPL but we haven't
looked at this much larger problem that
you mentioned have you know all the
different licenses and trying to
catalyze and categorize them and tag
them I think it's a slightly different
though related problem to what we're
looking at so right now we're just
really focused on you know getting
capturing people's attention and
community how we can best communicate
once you're in the license agreement you
know hopefully that the the techniques
will be generalizable to all those
different types of licenses but now we
haven't looked too much in detail at all
the different open-source licenses out
there okay thank you any other question
in the remote offices all right then
I'll also ask a question so could it be
a problem with this legal agreement that
the agreements are written in both the
legal language and also technical
language like if a legal agreement talks
about cookies and about logs many of the
users might not even understand what
this legal agreements are talking about
so even if they read even if their ad
note page they will see like okay so
this cookie stored okay so what
yeah I think there's a great point and
actually I can fold that into the last
question a bit so when we were looking
at the GPL and how we might augment that
the fellow we were talking with the used
to work at the Free Software Foundation
mentioned that a lot of people claim
they understand the terms of the GPL but
when you talk to them it's obvious that
they have misconceptions about it right
and so there's this you know faq
associated with the license that helps
to explain some of these terms and so
you know understanding the terms of the
agreement is itself sort of a challenge
and so this partially motivated this
design that we are playing with right
now when you wear when you reach certain
sections of the agreement you can
augment it with information like
frequently asked questions right and
that might be another great place for
these pop-ups to come in to help a
comprehension of these terms that people
might not be familiar with okay and the
second question so some of this like can
you go to the previous example that was
okay so in this example the company or
whoever created software decided that's
very important for the user that
particular section well made mad but
maybe in fact the user doesn't care
about that part but Claire's maybe and
about about another part which now will
be more or less hidden because it's less
emphasized right it possible different
users might care about different things
in the particular we log policy and the
company things well these are should be
really concern about this but maybe the
user is not really concerned all that
right so I mean this is a question of
how do you apply these techniques given
all the green seeing which ones are you
going to highlight which ones are your
gun or ribbon to different users may be
driving users care about different
football so this is why we're interested
in and more of a data-driven approach
where we build a corpus of not only of
these agreements but the types of terms
that people that set people off right
and so if we can build a model of which
clauses and agreements people find most
significant and that's a you know one
step forward to addressing this problem
the next obvious step is to build
individual user models right and so that
you can have these techniques emphasize
the content on a per-user basis right
but
you know that's a bit further in the
future them then we're dealing with
right now thank you I think Matt had
some some comments I just I just had a
quick comment about the sort of the
language issue there are also sort of
groups that are looking at this there's
a there's a group of lawyers and
international association called the
plain language association which is
basically looking to try to move people
towards using simpler English that
doesn't require basically a college
level or greater education in order to
understand so there are people working
on that aspect of the problem as well
more questions from the remote office is
any of one locally no okay well thank
you very much all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
