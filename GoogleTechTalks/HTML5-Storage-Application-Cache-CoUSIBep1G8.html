web application because it lets it
provides a spec to the browser's are
actually like loading a page at all when
you're offline so what is an application
cache it consists of a web page or
alternatively a JavaScript web worker
can also be a starting point for these
and that web page points to a manifest
which has a collection of stack
resources presumably the stack resources
will be referred to in the page
somewhere possibly dynamically and the
cache also has some miscellaneous
configuration information associated
with it now why would you want to bother
with this at all
the answer is mainly coal-tar offline
although it's also perhaps of interest
because of the fast startup times if
resources available from an application
cache it can be loaded immediately
without accessing the networks and
network latency is no longer an issue
and also you get background updating for
free if you're dealing with the web
application of much size at all say a
couple of megabytes then pushing a new
binary becomes a huge pain in the neck
as your entire application is blocked
while the new binary is downloaded there
have been a number of other workarounds
for this but application caches have the
potential to replace these perhaps
speaking of replacing things there's the
issue of whether or not you can actually
use this at all in terms of desktop
browsers there's at least rudimentary
support in chrome 5 firefox 3.5 Safari 4
and opera 10 point 6 the spec is still
undergoing changes so I strongly advise
you to test whatever you're trying to do
if it's more than the absolute basic
mobile browsers also notably have pretty
good support for this across the board
as we saw the current major browsers do
the Android browser started supporting
application caches in 2.0 iPhone 2.1
Opera Mobile version 10.1 and webOS
version 2.0 again these are you know
they say that the support application
cache but there's not currently a test
suite and the spec is changing anyway so
getting into a bit more nuts and bolts
for like you know the hello world of
application cache stuff this is a simple
HTML page notably there's the manifest
attribute in the opening HTML tag and
that is what points to our list of
static resources I mentioned earlier
I've underlined some of the stack
resources in this page there's a style
sheet a couple of images one of these
images is added dynamically by a
JavaScript which is part of why you
don't want to you know like just doing
the browser's save a complete web page
features often an aglet the manifest is
at least start with very very simple you
have to have the line cache manifest you
can have some comment text if you start
the line with a pound sign and blank
lines are ignored and then there's just
the list of actual resources notably the
HTML page is implicitly added to the
manifest and this is non optional so
like whatever my HTML page does not
appear in this list but it will be
stored in the cache and available be
available offline
the manifest must also be served with
this special mime tag text slash cache
manifest if it's not served with that
exact mime type it will not be used at
least by compliant browser by default
the manifest must also be exhausted that
is you must have all of your stack
resources available like listed upfront
you can't go back and add something to
the application cache later without
actually upgrading the whole thing
I'll come back to upgrades in a bit
there's also no expiration date so it
will live forever or until the browser
throws it away or the user like you know
does clear all site data or something
like that there's also no support for
redirects if a resource redirects it is
assumed to have failed entirely which is
pretty obnoxious and lastly if it's an
SSL TLS page then all of your resources
must be from the same origin you can't
access like images on Google user
content or blogger.com or G static com
they all has to be on whatever domain
name your application is actually
running on I'm sorry actually just the
same origin and all the usual policies
on tails so any questions so far about
like this is just the bare basics I'm
going to get into more detail but yes
okay so the question is what's a failure
condition what happens is the the page
if like the app cache manifest is served
like with the wrong mime type then the
mana fact then the cache is just not
used or populated and then and if the
same goes for like any resource failures
like the cache is just ignored entirely
so it's actually interesting debugging
problem potentially some of the URL
formats are supported by the manifest
include there shouldn't be a leading
forward slash on the relative path that
you get the idea it's a force relative
has an absolute path as well as full
URLs and it also supports a special URL
format that starts with a forward slash
forward slash and that inherits the
protocol of the host web page so if the
web page is HTTP this is a cheapy with
HTTPS there'll be HTTPS
okay so I mentioned cash updates the
process for this is actually fairly
complicated here's an abbreviated
version of the algorithm that the
browser goes through first of all the
cash is not loaded this will occur when
the onload event fires for the first
time and in the future like if the cash
is successfully created and again it'll
be updates will occur every load of the
page
now if the manifest is served with a
success like an okay response code to X
X or the bikes and the bytes are
different so like a not changed response
code does not trigger an update and also
just having the cache having returned a
200 response code for the cache also
does not trigger an update with this
means practically is that you need to
make the bytes and the manifest change
in some way if any of the resources in
that manifest change you can hack around
it using like digests in the as comments
in the manifest a version number comment
something like that is some tricks that
we've used then it will attempt to load
to fetch each and every one of the
resources in the manifest it has no idea
of just like some resources have changed
but not others it will try all of them
now if they're all successful and they
get like 2x X response codes for all of
them then the caches mark is right and
will be used on the next page load so
your you'll never like get a different
image just because you like pull the DOM
and put it back again and the cache
expired in between that can't happen now
this is where things start to get
complicated and again to the more
advanced uses of the application cache
there's you can actually conclude
different sections in your manifest the
default one is the cash section so if
you include new section at all then this
is what things are assumed to be and
it's just a list of resources as we saw
before
there's also fallback entries which are
a list of URL prefixes and a resource
that should be loaded if that Reese if
something matching that prefix is not
available and lastly there are there's a
network list and these are this is a
list of URL prefixes again and the and
anything in there is going to be fetched
from the network all the time even if
you're offline or whatever ok so we have
an example here of a cache with all the
sections so the cache manifest line is
still always required and we have some
comments as well as one resource URL and
we have a couple of fallback entries we
have a forward slash I'll catch anything
under this domain name and serve 404
HTML and we have a slightly nicer
version for images where we display this
like not found JPEG whatever that is
then we go back into the the default
cache mode so the URL images slash puppy
JPEG will be put into the cache
explicitly and then we have a couple of
white well we have one whitelist prefix
and then we have this special character
that I'll come back to so anything under
the that starts with slash RPC / will
always be fetched from the network so
you might imagine using that for you
know like xhrs back to your server or
whatever okay so I kind of hinted at how
these are actually used and to be a bit
more rigorous about the actual effect of
these differ
sections now what the browser does if
you're diluting a resource and a page
like a stylesheet or a script or you're
making an xhr or any of that type of
stuff that you're already in an HTML
page then the following process is used
first the browser looks at all of your
network prefixes and c interacts to see
if any of them are prefix match if they
are then it fetches it from the network
and it doesn't look at the cache ever
again next it looks to see if there's an
exact match on one of the cache lines
and for this purposes of this exact
matching only the fragment ID is ignored
any query strings or other parts of the
URL are actually considered so you need
to be careful about that
and like if you're using query strings
usually the ordering of your query
string arguments doesn't matter but it
matters here for purposes of this match
it's very simple next there's it looks
to see if there's any fallback prefix
matches so at this point it's already
tried loading any network stuff it's
already checked to see if it just has an
exact match in the cache and now we're
looking to see for any of these kind of
not found sort of resources which are a
bit weird and if that's the case and if
there's a prefix match that tries to
fetch the resource from the network and
if that fails and again the definition
of like success is very narrow here you
need like a to xx response type then you
load the cached resource that's included
on the the prefix match line so like
here if you try to access the resource
/foo then 404 dot HTML will be loaded
lastly if you've made it through all of
that and there's no more matches or
explicit entries that match and you have
this asterisk as a list in your network
section then it will try to fetch it
from the network so this is this changes
the the default of you have to list
everything beforehand or I'll just fail
entirely even if you're online this
changes it so that it will succeed while
you're online but fail miserably when
you're offline in this matches across
domains which is part of the reason
invites an asterisk and not like just a
forward slash will only match everything
under your domain it won't match you
know whatever else okay so some notes
about this the rules I just gave you
only apply if it's a sub resource of a
page that is it's a script an image a
stylesheet xml httprequest something
like that if it's a top-level navigation
like a frame or a new tab or a window or
if it's a web worker then a cache has to
be selected first I'll go over that in a
moment also notably there's a WebKit bug
that I've encountered in my work where
fallback in trees will be used even if a
network whitelist prefix matches it this
was only fixed relatively recently so
it's going to affect so far all current
versions of Safari and older versions of
Chrome including disable one and Android
and iPhone so this is kind of obnoxious
if you were hoping to use fallback
entries in combination with Network
entries so with the bug fixed then
Network entries or things that resources
that match and network prefix never
consult the cache and lastly it's worth
noting that fallback prefixes must wait
for the network
to fail if like the the browser knows
that's like completely disconnected from
the network and that's pretty fast if
you're on a mobile device particularly
then it still has to make the request
and get the four or four or whatever
from the server so it's potentially a
significant latency depending on your
conditions so this is one of the more
complicated and counterintuitive things
about application caches is how they
interact with top-level resources like
the frame
so first the browser will try any if it
if the the page it's loading has a
pointer like if there's an existing app
cache entry somewhere and that app cache
entry points to the manifest that it's
an entry in so like if you're not just
relying on implicit entries and you've
like explicitly listed like food HTML
and an app cache and food dot HTML
points to the same app cache then it
uses that next it looks at all of its AK
caches and see if it's a match in some
way either for an explicit entry or for
one of these prefix entries for these
these prefix matching so now all of your
fallback and all of your network
whitelist rules come into play and it's
not entirely clear what the order of
precedence is like the specification
just says something very vague like try
to show what these are most likely wants
to see so you want to try to avoid that
case if possible and yeah so the the
next is I'm sorry I kind of covered
steps to sort of for all in one go but
is a cache entry and then if it's a
fallback prefix match notably if new
tably if it matches a fallback prefix
and that that prefix gets loaded I'm
sorry the resource associate with that
prefix gets loaded then the document
will have yeah then the document
we'll see its URL as being the URL of
the failed resource so your JavaScript
can actually potentially interrogate
your like window dot location and make
some sort of decision based on that so
maybe you could say something more
specific than your generic 404 or I
don't know so that's basically it for
the HTML and plain text cache manifest
there's a very limited Script API I'm
going to talk about briefly any
questions on why I've talked about so
far yes so the question is I asked if
the caching I said that the caching
happens on the unloading event and I
said and yes it does so the the initial
load of your page will proceed largely
normally and then only in the future
well the app cache be consulted and
similarly any update check will by
default but well there's always an
update check limit long load event fires
this JavaScript API allows a check out
other times any other questions or bit
sites I don't see anyone okay all right
so I mentioned that there's a very basic
JavaScript API
you can't enumerate the listings in the
app cache using it you can't modify them
but you get some basic events and
information there's this application
cache class so to speak and compliant
browsers will have a application cache
property that's lowercase a at the
beginning capital C in the middle that
you can interrogate and you can also use
self dot application cache and that's
primarily useful when you're accessing
this from a web worker
web workers don't have the window object
this application cache object will have
a status property and that will contain
the current state which will be one of
uncashed which means that it's not so
ciose any cache at all idle which means
that it is associated with a cache and
there's no interesting stuff going on
with it so to speak
checking which means that the browser is
currently attempting to fetch the
manifest to see if there is an update
downloading which means that it's
actually that it has found an update and
it's actually trying to fetch the
resources there's this interesting event
of update ready which tells you that it
has not only found an update is
successfully downloaded everything and
like if you if the user hit refresh
right now they would get this new cache
and lastly there's obsolete which means
that an update was found and I'm sorry
no absolutely means that the manifest is
gone in a 404 or 410 response code sense
and if that occurs in the browser are
supposed to delete it which is
potentially inconvenient it also had
this javascript object also has two
methods either which take arguments one
is the swap is the update method which
just forces a check as if an onload
event had occurred and the other is this
swap now method which switches to so
that any new resources new resource
requests that occur will fetch from the
new application cat to the newly updated
application cache instead of having to
wait until the next full reload of the
page there's also some you can also set
event listeners on this object and get
some interesting up status updates about
what's going
there's this checking which is again
fetching the manifest for the first time
or to see if there's a new update
there's downloading which is fetching
all the resources listed in that
manifest there's also some progress
events that you can get as those
downloads progress so you could
potentially even have like a loading bar
to tell people when they're ready to go
offline and then there's some sort of
final state events and this is when the
app cache has done attempting to update
or load for the first time and has
reached some final conclusion about
state so there's no update which is
pretty self-explanatory
there's cached which means that this is
an initial load and all the resources
were fetched successfully there's update
ready which is similar to the update
ready state and obsolete again is
similar to the obsolete state and then
there's the error event which can be
kind of a terminating state yes it's
always a terminating state but can
signal a variety of things like the
manifest might be gone or one of the
fetching one of the resources my failed
or their my parsing error or a bunch of
different things okay so that's the bulk
of my main content any other so yeah
question yes so
we have someone who agrees yes yeah okay
the question is how how commonly used
these application catches right now in
in terms of non Google applications as
well as any Google applications using it
soon or already okay
so currently these are used by some of
the chrome store web applications like
the puppet thing that they demoed at the
launch event that uses an application
cache to make itself available offline
and I believe that some of our mobile
products are using it although I can't
recall exactly which ones but it's
definitely a small number and this is
all very new yeah I'm kind of nave about
html5 if I was writing a email client or
a bulletin board client and I wanted to
save like a thousand recent messages so
that I can edit about an airplane does
this work for that and how do you strive
okay so the answer is no this really
does not cover that because that's like
dynamic user type data this only handles
static relatively unchanging resources
such as like CSS sprites and style
sheets for messages or other sorts of
dynamic information let's say high
scores or something like that you would
need to use one of the other storage
specifications there's web storage which
is basic like key value pair of strings
and there's web sequel which offers
which basically provides asked access to
an SQLite database but it's non-standard
but does exist
unlike index DB which is only just now
appearing in the latest versions of
Chrome but it is actually a standards
track
so you need to use one of those I have a
knee effect
I'm from advertising and so I'm going to
ask this question
if somebody is writing an application
and today we serve actually the in line
in the Dom or in an iframe
if the manifest itself does not include
like the wild card and since most ads
are served from a different domain would
that cause problems or it won't cause
problems for us that would potentially
cause problems yes okay so that means
that we would have to proactively you
know in the era T's from the advertising
side be aware of folks that might be
using this and actually come up with
guidelines to say that if you want to
preserve your ads then from from from
like Adsense for instance then you would
have to code your manifest in a certain
way yes
I'd also argue that there's another like
general design question of whether or
not you want to make ads available when
the user is offline in a way similar to
like most you know say Android
applications display ads when they're
offline but yeah as even a basic thing
if you want online ads to work they have
to include that wild card or they could
include a if it's like a one domain or a
small set of domains that they could
potentially include in their whitelist
section of their manifest they could do
that well typically I guess with you
know party ad serving we really don't
know what what who's who's as we end up
serving so it would be very difficult to
pre-specify what the made they come from
right yeah thanks sure okay yeah
okay yeah he made the point that
advertisers would expect their ads to be
clicked and again this is like you'd
have to use one of the other storage
technologies to keep track of all that
and have some sort of system for getting
these changes back to the server so
they're persistent there
right
yeah
yeah so this summarizes that comment if
you're using application caches at all
for your page and it gets associated and
as part of the top-level navigation then
you need to have that asterik wild card
or ads will fail miserably yes
right
okay so the the question was about how
do you actually figure out what the heck
to put in the manifest was a sizable
application and my general
recommendation for that is to have some
sort of registry if you're already
presumably like when you're pushing
updates to your application to a server
you already have to enumerate those
resources somehow hopefully you can
leverage that same process to make sure
that you still it to also provide the
entries for your manifest along with
like any hacks that you want to do to
make sure that the manifest has a some
sort of byte level change in it when one
of the resources mentioned by it changes
how you do this will of course depend on
how your application is designed like
you might have like a registry thing you
might just you know do a find command on
the command line something like that or
juice as juice multi binders are really
helpful in Javal and you're using juice
and yes go ahead
I have a question on the size of the
application cache like is there like
what is it the typical size per visit by
domain and is it Baker on by desktops
itself that mobile devices so I don't
know about desktop versus mobile devices
I haven't done a lot of testing of the
limits with liberal devices I know that
on desktops the typical limit that you
can expect is five megabytes per cache
and and that is actually potentially
smaller if the if while it's updating if
the updated resources count against your
quota
then you effectively have like a two and
a half megabyte limit um so it's
relatively well I shouldn't it depends
on the scope of your application
basically if you're dealing with like a
trip
Google application then we're easily
into megabytes and if you're dealing
with something relatively
straightforward that just has jQuery
then it's not an issue it's definitely
something you need to think about
there's a larger problem with html5
api's and quota and being able to
inspect that quota and request more
quota right now there isn't a terribly
good answer for it but there are people
working on it
my current recommended workaround for
things that are like Chrome apps is you
can include an unlimited storage
permission and that will let you shove
as much stuff as you wanted there you
still should have some way to keep it
from growing unbounded though so like it
like the issue where HTML pages
implicitly are added as entries to an
app cache it is actually an issue for
that storage management because if you
include like a an ID of some sort that
there's a lot of like if you're doing
like email and you put an ID for every
email message and you're caching like
entire copy of Gmail for every single
email message then that gets quite large
pretty quickly yes yes this is regarding
the cross domain what's the same origin
you mentioned we can only use this cache
if the all the resource off it's from
the same origin right these are cross
domain so about cross domain support if
you're on just HTTP you're not using SSL
or TLS then you're the resources in an
app cache can be from across many
different origins the app cache must
still be on the same origin as the web
page referring to it so you know Google
like foo.example.com cannot
cannot have a manifest on
bar.example.com the manifest must be on
the same origin if you are on HGPS with
SSL and TLS then then you just have to
somehow get everything under the same
domain currently I'm not wear of any
proposed workarounds for that the
restriction was put in place for these
secure sites as a security concern you
probably need to take up with the
security should be address free because
options the questi is what that actually
addresses the security problem yeah I
mean this is a larger design discussion
about how we want to solve this issue
but there's definitely ways that we
could reasonably add like support could
be added to the specification for it I
think in my opinion but any more
questions you okay so the question is
does it make sense to have multiple
cache manifests on a single domain my
response to that would be that you prot
you you probably want to keep the number
of manifests small just because if you
have a large number of manifests and
particularly with the way cache
selection occurs at four top level
browsing it would be very easy to have
things happen a bad way where like a
fallback country matches something
that's like in an iframe a different
page under your same domain but I write
yeah I think there's definitely good use
cases like having multiple applications
under different paths with like
completely different prefixes I think
you could do that reasonably with
multiple application caches
a more question yes yeah how is this
supposed to interact with regular HTTP
browser HTTP caching or is it supposed
to be a replacement for it it completely
subsumes it okay okay yeah
yeah okay so I don't know if you could
hear me BJ but yeah okay so he was
saying that that the when the browser is
fetching all the resources in a manifest
then the browser's cache actually sits
between the application cache and the
server so it would still pull from the
local manifest and there might also be
issues with proxies actually proxies as
part of the reason for no redirects I
think or at least part of the motivation
is because there's all these you go onto
untrusted Wi-Fi network and a lot of
times you get redirected to a sign-in
page and you really don't want that
cache just like your style sheet that
would suck alright question I'm sorry
yes question here on the size and the
management of the cache can a size limit
be be set and in that case what would be
the replacement policy in the cache so
right now there's a browser seem to be
running with the fixed limit for fixed
per cache limit and there's no way to
request more or less space and there's
no way to as an application for you to
explicitly expire this as a user some of
them have UI is that let you view the
the manifest and actually remove it like
I think with Firefox and Chrome have
reasonable integration with their like
clear all sites data functionality and I
know at least in Chrome there's the app
cache internals page that shows your
different manifest to how much space
they're using and you can delete them
but as an application there's nothing
right now unfortunately
I have a question on like the
programming model for like applications
run in the app cache I was confused by
an earlier statement that says when you
say that if the if you're using a
fallback resource then the URL may
change or the referral URL may change so
does any JavaScript have to be modified
to run in this mode or there's the dome
look any difference and so on so
generally the Dom does not look at any
different the exception to this is the
location property of the window which if
you are the resource that has a fallback
prefix associate with it and like
something matching that prefix fails
then the location will be the location
of whatever resource was attempting to
be loaded so it's really not all that
different like if it's like if you had a
404 page and you just served at as part
of the response body to in your 404
response then it would have you know it
would still be displayed at whatever the
normal whatever the URL the user
requested was so you'd have a similar
problem so I don't think it changes
things all that much does this work with
a push State pop state I mean if you
user opens page you know index dot HTML
and the application pushes a state to a
different URL but the the page is the
same and then use a refreshes that's an
interesting question I I don't actually
know how this interacts with push State
pop State I don't think push State and
pop State actually trigger our new
navigation events so I don't think they
they would like trigger the the cache
Association type stuff but I haven't
looked at the spec that carefully
another question is is the page aware of
if the main page is it were if it's
loaded from cache or from the network
the page can interrogate that
application cache object and check the
state and if the state is
one of a number I think there's a
obsolete and uncashed state are the two
states where like is no longer associate
was an application cache but there is a
way for you to check I have a question
on like the recommendation on the
manifest let's say your application is a
jet see and it has and somehow you can
go into like use if I say a hundred
different images but we don't have to
put all of them in the cache in the
cache we can just put the most commonly
used ones there right and let the less
commonly use one be fed from the network
is that like is that like a recommended
paradigm if you expect it to be online
all the time and if you want to support
offline mode then you have to submit all
of them or have a fallback of all of
this for some of them so your options
are basically to list them in the
manifest not list them in the manifest
but have some network whitelist prefix
or use the wild-card so that they are
still fetch from the network or you can
use some alternative technology like the
file API that's new and just getting
implement in Chrome which lets you
actually like X image xmlhttprequest
objects now have like a response bob
associated it with them a property and
you can actually store that and get a
URL back for it and stuff but yeah
okay alright that seems to be it on
questions and we're about out of time
with my whopping minute left I'd like to
thank a few people
this is Justin last name alphabetical
order because I was wimpy didn't feel
like ranking so David Barrett Khan has
been working with me on a project here
and has been very helpful in and asking
questions and sorting this out and
puzzling over things
Ian Hickson is the editor of the
specification and therefore plays a very
large role and what actually gets
written online if you want to change
made then you should bring it up with
the appropriate working group with html5
working group and you know he's the one
who actually puts the appropriate
official wording down Michael Nordmann
is responsible for the WebKit
implementation which is used in you know
like four of the browsers actually
support this Chrome Safari Android and
the iPhone browser and he's been
tremendously helpful with answering
questions and he also fixed the bug that
I mentioned very very quickly you know
like I reported it and it was fixed a
week later which is awesome and Google
has invested heavily in all this so I
have to thank Google and thank you all
for for coming and listening to this
talk and Exce asking such great
questions
