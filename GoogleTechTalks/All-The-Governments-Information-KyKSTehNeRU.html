juice Carl Malamud who have none now for
more years than I suspect either of us
could count and I'm proud to say that
Carl is my kind of trouble maker he's
caused several interesting bits of
trouble over the years and he's here to
tell us about more so with that Carl
Malamud i guess i won't use a standard
line on from Washington and I'm here to
help you um actually the line I use in
Washington is I'm from the internet and
I'm here to help you I thought I would
start and give you 10 minutes kind of a
background just to kind of let you know
where I'm coming from and then talk
about a new project that I've been
putting together for about a year now um
for most of the 80s I did professional
reference books and I consulted with the
government I actually started working
for the federal reserve board and and
did their research network in like about
82 and and all about nineteen ninety I
kind of figured that decnet novell and
all that stuff just wasn't going to
scale and that this tcp i-- thing might
might do the job and I'd been on a kick
of putting standards online I just felt
that if you're gonna have a standard it
ought to be readable by people and so I
spent several years attacking you know I
tu a Nancy and I so and you know doing
the OSI tcp/ip fight and about nineteen
ninety I got an appointment with the
secretary-general of the ITU and I flew
to Geneva and went and saw him and said
you know your standards ought to be
online and his answer was you know we'd
love to put them online but you know
it's technically impossible because you
see our standards that we do are
published in a system that we developed
in the 70s and we lost the source code
it was a text formatting system and I
was like well you know maybe if you gave
me some tapes so I could like do
something with them and I'd give you a
copy back of your stuff in a more modern
format and we'd put it on this little
research network the internet and that's
kind of how he referred to the internet
is this little research network and he
figured out no harm there's only a few
people there and so I went back to the
University of Colorado with my friend
Mike Schwartz who did harvest and stuff
like that
and we printed out octal dumps of all
their tapes and then we took the itu
blue book and we spread it on the floor
and we started looking and we said well
that looks like an e that might be a
paragraph mark morello program and
translated it from the old format that
they had it in which actually was using
three different character sets one of
which they invented themselves and we
took this thing and we turned it into T
Roth which was considered quite modern
at the time and we released it on the
internet two things happened got a call
from the National Science Foundation
saying you're using up all our bandwidth
on the international links because
everybody's making copies of this thing
international links were 56 kilobits at
the time and a few weeks later I got a
letter from the secretary-general saying
well thank you so much for the source
code we have decided to terminate the
experiment please retrieve all copies I
was like ah this is going to be hard
because it's been a whole bunch made
I'll take my copy offline and I did and
the 40 other mirrors were kind of there
I wrote a book about it called exploring
the internet which kind of documented
this this itu thing and you know while I
was doing it I was traveling around the
world meeting folks that were building
the internet at the time people like
Paul Dixie and jr. I and Japan and wrote
a book about it and that kind of brought
me to the next phase of what I wanted to
do which is I decided to start a radio
station on the internet and this is
about 93 figured what the hell this
won't be hard we'll just put audio files
online so we started a program called
geek of the week and geek of the week
ran for about a year there's a point to
this I did this in Washington DC and we
figured out since we're doing geek of
the week we might as well do some more
fun stuff and so I went to the National
Press Club and said you know you got an
extra broadcast booth you got one for
c-span you got one for National Public
Radio could we have that extra one and
went to the governor's and finally
convinced them that we were allowed to
put their stuff out live on the neck and
as part of that ended up looking at
government archives in washington and i
think i spent most of the last decade
kind of working on this issue of putting
government stuff online so the radio
station led to a little demo on the hill
and when i was on the hill of Congress
and came up to me and he said you know
some Nader's radar sent me a letter and
said the SEC Edgar database ought to be
online why isn't it so I don't know I'll
go look at it so I looked at it and I
said well you know it doesn't look that
hard it could probably be done and so I
found myself in a meeting with
congressional staff and the Securities
and Exchange Commission and at which
point I heard the same answer I'd heard
from the ITU it's like why shouldn't we
put this stuff online uh be technically
impossible so well come on it can't be
that hard so we rigged up a little deal
with the National Science Foundation in
which we took money from American
taxpayers from the NSF and we used it to
buy the data from the SCC American data
in order to give it back to people on
the internet and run it for free which
we did for about two years and at the
end of two years put a little sign up on
the internet that said this service will
terminate in 60 days click here to send
mail to Newt Gingrich click here to send
mail to Al Gore click here to send mail
to the chairman of the SEC now he didn't
have email at the time and so we kind of
did a proxy form we took all the email
with about 15,000 protests and we
printed them out walk them down to the
SCC and actually crashed one of their
meetings and said you know we the stuff
ought to be online at which point we
finally got a meeting with kind of SEC
management they're like well how much
would this cost well cost us a couple
hundred grand a year it'll cost you a
million and they're like okay do people
really use this stuff it's like well yes
this is not a bunch of fat cat lawyers
and financial types these were senior
citizens and journalists and students
and you know we're up to seventy eighty
thousand people a day using these a sec
documents and to the Chairman's credit
he said well okay we should be doing
this but unfortunately our internet
connection isn't working and I don't
think we have a computer we had a
mainframe and so we took a 4 processor
Sun and put it in a station wagon and
drove it down to the SEC and configured
their t1 line for him and got him up and
running and that worked out real well
now the Patent Office on the other hand
we had put the patent date online just
to prove that the SEC stuff wasn't just
like so simple it was a no-brainer so we
put the patent data online and
unfortunately the patent Commissioner
decided that the patents were a source
of revenue
not a way of promoting the useful arts
and sciences by letting people know what
these inventions were but a revenue
source and so he refused it's about 98 I
sent a letter to Al Gore which said you
know this stuff really ought to be
online and you know if I didn't come
right out and threaten but basically the
gist of the letter was within 60 days if
you guys don't decide to do this we're
going to do it we're running for two
years and we're going to stop it and so
we started like mirroring a patent
office and I started making lots of
calls to the Patent Office saying well
you know how much exactly was it cost
for you know all of the data and if I
wanted 20 years worth how much would
that be and when could you deliver it
and sure enough on day 59 Commissioner
layman went to the American Bar
Association and explained that you know
as part of the normal planning process
that had been undergoing they were going
to be putting this data online um the
point of this is that you know as an
individual you can actually change the
way government does things that is
possible at times sometimes it's hard
sometimes they really don't want to do
it and they go kicking and screaming but
that's kind of the business I've been in
for the last 10 years so I'm going to
tell you one more war story and then
we'll get to the topic at hand I'm
actually on a red-eye back this evening
at six thirty i land at dulles I get in
my car go find my suit and drive up to
the capital to testify on the issue of
the Smithsonian Showtime contract I
don't know if you guys have been reading
about this but the Smithsonian decided
to cut a contract or Showtime not
release the contract and the the deal as
we understand it is that if you want to
make a film using the Smithsonian
collections or access to staff you have
to give Showtime a right of first
refusal so I read an article on boring
boring which talked about an article in
The New York Times it said Ken Burns was
upset by this and that the contract was
secretly were refusing to divulge it so
I thought you know this is silly so i
sent a FOIA request in and that kind of
got me sucked into the middle of this
little Smithsonian Showtime fight the
story gets worse it turns out this
contract is a 30 year contract signed
this year now now think about this 30
years ago 19
76 if you had signed a 30 year contract
for the future of things 1976 are about
200 computers on the internet WTBS had
just started going up to satellite cable
industry was just starting to happen
c-span didn't exist and the next hot
thing that was just about to happen was
the fax machine faxes were big in Japan
they were just starting to happen in the
u.s. so just imagine a 30 year contract
in 76 we also found out through an
anonymous tip to eff who is representing
me in the FOIA suit that surprise
surprise webmasters at the Smithsonian
are being told to take audio and video
off the public websites because it
conflicts with the non-compete clause of
the Showtime contract so I've been
called up to the hill they were going to
do hearings with the secretary anyway
but they've decided that a public panel
is in order I got a pointer to my
testimony and there's a pointer to some
other things that are out there I just
wanted to give you a little context kind
of where I'm coming from I'm from
Washington but I'm kind of from the
outside part of Washington I worked for
a think tank called the Center for
American Progress and we're kind of a
liberal nonpartisan left wing think-tank
but I have to be careful were 501c3 so
about a year and a half ago when I got
to Washington and and join the center I
got called in my boss by who's John
Podesta used to be Clinton's chief of
staff and he's like you know IPTV is
really big we should do something what
should we do and I thought to myself and
this is last februari I guess and I
thought to myself you know there's
something that's always really bugged me
and what bugs me is when you go to
Washington and you go to a congressional
hearing or you go to you know an
executive agency briefing you really
need to be in Washington to observe the
way our government works now you know
there's some webcasting going on by a
few congressional committees there's
some others you know there there's some
other things that are occasionally
online c-span does a great job on the
stuff they do but you know there are
three channels they can only do so much
and there's probably 10 or 15
events happening every day in Washington
and there is no permanent archive when
I'm doing research and I want to go back
and see a hearing I want to see what
so-and-so had to say about patents or
about this or about that that
information is typically disappeared
it's just not there so I started digging
into you know how do we how do you get
access to hearings there are
stenographers the video and the audio
aren't there even with the stenographers
even with the transcripts not all of
those are available there are
proprietary services that make a lot of
that available some of it shows up many
months later from the Congress but it's
not like gee something interesting
happened yesterday I definitely will be
able to find it by searching for it in
Google it's just it's a hit or miss
thing so the way it works in Washington
if you are a congressional committee or
executive briefings you know the Federal
Communications Commission does hearings
Patent Office dozen all sorts of folks
do these things there's two ways you get
your audio and video out you do it
yourself and the way that typically
works is a congressional committee gets
their IT do to buy a camera and the IT
dude goes to the back of the room and
does the camera thing nothing is
sophisticated as Google video and then
they go to some commercial web casting
company and they stream it out typically
in real audio real video the other way
you do it is you let the media do it for
you and there's some interesting things
that have happened to the media market
in Washington it used to be if you were
going to do a hearing live what you did
is you hired a satellite truck and you
parked it out front and then you ran
your cables in and you hooked up your
camera and that's how you got your video
out of the hearing rooms verizon has put
together a service called the
audiovisual operation center the a vaak
and they have fiber going out to most of
these hearing rooms now and so if your
major media what you do is you go to the
a vaak and this is just a dedicated
video / fiber switch so this is using
the SDI standard 280 megabits per second
standard broadcast quality video on type
of fiber right so it's not tcp/ip or
anything like that
what you do is you you lease one line
you lease a switch at a bach you Lisa
line out to the Capitol or the State
Department of the White House or
whatever you're trying to cover you
lease another line back to where you are
and then you tell the switch connect
those two things together and you get
your video and its infrastructure is
fairly extensive and so if your major
video major media that's what you do
there's a little wrinkle for the
Congress because the Congress has so
many hearing rooms the correspondence
gallery has put together a fiber optic
project and so you don't actually lease
fiber from the a Vox which all the way
to the hearing room you run your fiber
into the basement of the Capitol and
then you use the existing fiber
infrastructure on the hill to get back
out to the various hearing rooms not all
of them are wired now but most of them
are so what I'm trying to put together
is a little system that provides what I
call the Washington Bridge and the
Washington Bridge is a gateway between
the hearing rooms in Washington and
either the real world or the Internet
depending on who you're talking to and
the idea here is to get 16 of these
rooms up and running stream the data out
live to the net and archive it
permanently now there's a couple twists
involved in this that make it
interesting to stream it out live to the
net what I'm looking at is what I call a
wholesale retail model so we get all
this video coming in and it's 280
megabits per second and you probably
don't want to feed 16 280 megabit per
second streams out on the internet on
the public peering infrastructure but
you can convert that stuff into either
mpeg-2 at 50 megabits per second which
is really high quality stuff or mpeg-4
even at eight megabits per second it's
still pretty high quality stuff and
there's no reason why you can't take all
these 16 streams convert them to MPEG
over over tcp/ip run it out to one of
the large colocation facilities such as
Equinix or packs and make it available
to people like Google Video people like
nbc2 any other folks that might want to
take this data and do something with it
in your case there's lots of stuff you'd
probably do with it and so this service
is intended to to provide the highest
quality feeds we possibly can to folks
like Google video and NBC and the others
and also provides somewhat of a retail
operation if you will by retail on I
mean charging money but I mean direct
service to end users and the reason for
doing that instead of just relying on
google video and NBC and everybody else
to kind of provision this and do it
properly is because i'd like to view
this system and somewhat of a research
testbed right as something that that we
can do some interesting work on top of
so i'm working with some folks from
cisco that are very interested in okay
how do we sign all these video streams
to to make sure that there's some
authenticity in there if people change
it some folks at sun are very interested
in automatic generation of metadata you
know anything from speech to text which
as you know is a little iffy these days
to other things um you know video scene
identification there's a whole bunch of
stuff you can do um so how do you put
something like this together a roll it
out the door on what we're doing is I'm
in the process of creating a new 501c3
nonprofit and it's called the public
memory trust and it has a mission of
building public works projects on the
Internet project number one is a
Washington Bridge it's got a pretty
simple business model and it's the one
that I've used all my life which is try
to get companies like Sun and Cisco to
give me a boatload of hardware and so
I'm talking to both companies at pretty
high levels these are you know up at the
executive committee level they're very
interested both companies have some
really good engineers working with me
Cisco's easy because there's a whole
bunch of really good routing people
there and they're very interested in
this Sun is easy as well because you
know this is we're talking a lot of
storage here and in the long run you
know we were asking some for a petabyte
a disk in the long run I would like to
see every library in the country have a
petabyte of disk and a permanent archive
of all congressional proceedings but you
got to get this stuff
arted so the business model is part you
know I won't say free hardware but
hardware donated by by companies that
want to see something like this happened
for a variety of reasons and part cash
and I'm talking to a variety of
potential cash sponsors I've also talked
to the Government Printing Office and
they're very interested in this and I
actually went to see Bruce James who is
the public printer of the United States
which is you know he's a pointy of the
president and he's actually the the
official service provider for all three
branches of government he does Congress
the judiciary and and the executive and
I said you know in the long run you you
need to be doing this right this is your
job we're not going to be doing this
forever but we'd like to run it for
three or four years and prove that it
can happen and I was actually surprised
by the reception I got and the reception
was very positive it was like this is
good we're not going to be able to do
this right away you can run a lot faster
than we can this is a good thing we'd
like to support you and so we kind of
how do you do this because you don't
really want to start a non-profit
immediately take a lot of government
funding because there's a lot of strings
attached you know they're going to want
to full spec ahead of time and and so we
came up with with what I think is a
great way of doing things which is they
have a fellows program in which some of
their young bright staff go out to the
agencies for a year and they've agreed
to give us a gpo fellow which is prepaid
staff for us free training for them and
most importantly a linkage with the
government it's what they call a
public-private partnership these days
and so that means we're going to have
two routes to be able to walk in to an
agency or to the Congress and say hi we
want to like you know get our cameras in
here and and get this video online one
is to go in as media the other is to
simply go in as as you know somebody
helping the agencies get up and running
and so that's the kind of two different
paths that we're going to be able to go
in on this thing so it's a new project
you know I'm here sort of talking about
vaporware but it's vaporware I've been
working on for a year I think it looks
like this thing is going to happen we're
in the process of writing the articles
of incorporation I've had a lot of talks
with a variety of people within Google
Eric Schmidt used to be on the board of
directors of our radio station way back
when and Vint Cerf was with also on my
board of directors and so I've kind of
pitch the project to them and they were
like well you know this is interesting
go talk to the engineers and so I called
Steve up and said you know can I do a
tech talk and that's what brings me here
so that's kind of the prepared part of
what I'm talking about but I really just
wanted to see if you folks had some some
questions there's some you know
interesting tweaks on this interesting
research projects we can do there's some
feasibility questions you know how do
you engineer this turns out doing data
centers in Washington DC these days is
really hard all the kolos are really
either a capacity or doing a bad job one
of the two and so there's some real
challenges in engineering something like
this but I haven't seen any showstoppers
yet this doesn't seem at least
technically like a hard thing to do
certainly for a three or four year kind
of roll this out make it work and then
try to get the government to take the
service over and do it themselves the
way they ought to be doing it so that's
the basic outline if you look at my
links I have a copy of this slide
available at public.resource.org /
google Tech Talk dot HTML and I've got
my email address Carla media org feel
free to send me email you'll find at the
bottom there's a link to the business
plan which is a very large PDF documents
and kind of goes over this in great
detail including the finances questions
the question is are there cameras
already in the room so that's actually
an interesting question some of the
committees have feeds sometimes the
media is already in there it's spotty
and so our strategy is a three-fold
strategy one is to find as many hearing
rooms that already have cameras and put
splitters on them with the permission of
the committee's and the agencies and
take those feeds and run them out so
that's part 1 part 2 is to get
credentials as real media and i actually
had credentials for internet talk radio
as with the congressional galleries and
so to get those credentials and be able
to participate in the pool feed
operation in which you know one cameras
in there but everybody gets a copy of it
and then the third strategy is to buy
ten of these three thousand dollar
cameras that are now coming out and get
our staff of 12 is what we project to be
the staffing level with this operation
and send them in to mop up all the stuff
that that isn't there and we're not
gonna be able to do the whole government
but I think we can do 16 simultaneous
feeds using those three strategies other
questions yes
whose ox is this going to go or is the
question that's an interesting question
um you know it's very hard for a
congressman to be against transparency
at least on the record um you might
think that GPO would not like this
government printing office because we're
kind of in and doing going in and doing
their job you know doing it as a
freelance nonprofit independent
operation but they seem to be pretty
good about this major media might not
like this because right now you know
it's pretty much major media that does
at least the important coverage and
what's going to happen I'm pretty sure
is we're going to be someplace that they
aren't and that means that that they're
going to have to get their video from us
in order to cover the news which they'll
be able to do free all this data by the
way is free we're not charging anybody
for the feeds we're funding the project
on a whole basis so that that was pretty
important to me that we not you know try
to do a cost recovery because then we
ended up negotiating with verizon's IPTV
group and it just seemed way too
difficult um who else's major media
might not like it because they may find
end users going to google video instead
of waiting for NBC for their nightly
news um and I'm expecting a lot of
people to start mashing up this stuff
you know not everybody's going to look
look at the whole hearing and annotate
it and you know intensively work with it
but I think there's enough bloggers out
there and other folks are going to take
it you know find the relevant snippets
slap it out on wherever they're going to
put it and so I think there's great
potential for like large viewership on
at least snippets of these pieces yes
the question is where you going to get
the metadata that's actually a difficult
one for example you really want
transcriptions on these things if you're
doing them properly right we're not
going to have the staff or the budget to
do that and so there's really three
techniques i think for doing metadata on
one is we will do the best we can to you
know get as much in in kind of a
broadcast management framework you know
time location speakers scan in any
paperwork number two is we're going to
do as much automated stuff as we can and
that's the research testbed kind of
aspect of this number three is allowing
the net to do as much annotation as
possible because I believe that there's
people interested in anything you put
online particularly if it's the Congress
or the executive branch various interest
groups one idea is to try to marry XMPP
jabber protocols to the video streams
I've been told that that's hard to do
but that's a possible approach and
there's actually a fourth answer to this
which is we're going to do the best we
can on the other hand we're going to
hand it over to folks like Google Video
assuming you want this data and
presumably you'll do a much better job
than we will because you run a
production operation so I guess that's
answer number four so the real answer is
we'll do the best we can we're hoping
that the net will do intensive
annotation and that a lot of the
metadata will very quickly but over time
accumulate therefore allowing us to
provide various search facilities and
you know locate what we're looking for
and things like that a lot of people are
counting on speech to text but I'm not
sure I'd bet the farm on that one yet
question is do we are going to do
anything to facilitate annotation we're
gonna do everything we can with the
staff of 12 and and the people around us
working on the project the way we've
structured this like I said is a 501c3 a
public trust and we're setting up what I
call the council of public engineers I'm
kind of like that name and basically
each of the sponsors is throwing three
people in so Cisco's got a cisco fellow
a distinguished engineer and a team
leader son's got three really good
people one of the guys that did the
honeycomb you know storage architecture
and the hope is that by drawing on these
advisors and you know the staff and
other volunteers and people interested
will be able to do something but I don't
want to wave my hands too much and say
you know gosh we're going to you know
provide broadcast quality 16 channels a
day I mean this could be 50 hours of
video every day that's likely to happen
once we're up to speed get a question
question is can we get a real-time feed
from the stenographers you bet i'm going
to try typically the stenographers are
there's two different kinds of
sonographer they're the ones that work
for you know one of the commercial
services like fed net that sell this
stuff right to the lobbyists that need
that real-time transcript right away and
then there's a stenographer for the
agency or the committee that's keeping
records typically what happens there is
is they do their stenography and then it
goes off into the committee process and
you know three months or six months
later it comes back out I will certainly
go to them and say gee you know if we
got a copy of what you're doing we could
put it online it'd be great you would
save on your web casting charges because
right now these committees go retail to
the extent they do web casting I mean
they hire some some streaming media
company and if they have a hit on their
hands it breaks their budget and so I
think our proposition is pretty
attractive which is we'll put your stuff
out in high-res as well as lower res
transformations for four people and I
think that's an attractive proposition
my hope is that oh you know if we can
convince one committee chairman that
it's time to upgrade their cameras and
make them decent set of the fifty-dollar
webcams and that maybe they ought to
give us a copy of the stenographers
stuff I think every one of the other
committees would immediately begin doing
the same thing and so it's a question of
can you convince the first couple that G
they would look a lot better if they
bought better cameras they would look a
lot better if if the metadata were
immediately available Steven
is taking an intermediary and
eliminating or minimizing
so in this case it initially seems like
there was no intermediary but now
confession one what's their deal what
other is me there's is what I said you
think this well
viability is their business model and
suspension poppy
well there's a couple questions in there
so how is this going to affect people
like fed net the intermediaries are of
two sorts they're so specialized
Washington insider intermediaries or the
I provide service to the committee on a
commercial basis intermediaries how's
this going to affect their business
model I don't know I don't care it's
probably not going to be good the other
intermediaries are major media because
that's the ones that are really going to
be affected by this because right now
you know it's a lobbyist get that stuff
real time and then if NBC or c-span
decides it's worthy of your attention
and maybe it's available maybe it's
available now but it's gone in 30 days
and so I think this will really have an
effect on the journalists and
particularly the major media operations
I think it's going to have some effect
on the the congressional committees in
the agencies because you know what's
going to start happening is people are
going to watch their stuff live you know
they're going to be commenting in google
talk chat rooms live and that means that
the staff is going to have to monitor
those chat rooms and it's going to be a
different dynamic and one of my hopes is
that we get that feedback cycle going
right back into a lot of these hearings
so that if somebody says something silly
staffer gets email or looks on a chat
room leans over to the Congress person
and says that was wrong and then the
Congress person looks at the witness and
says well as I understand it you know
what you said wasn't right and so
hopefully there'll be more of a feedback
loop they're questioning back hey
well there's a couple things Vince
surface said he'd be happy to join the
board of directors of this new oh I'm
sorry the question is what is my fantasy
scenario about what what Google you know
might do to help this project happen so
Vince surface said he'd be happy to join
the board of directors he's a busy guy
but um he's good and I've worked with
him in the past i really like I'm Steve
wolf would be joining from Cisco he used
to run the NSFNET program and so we're
looking at a pretty good board of
directors here there's this Council of
public engineers so it'd be really nice
if three people from google people you
know like Stephen or others said geodon
I'm happy to be an advisor to this
project um cash would also be nice oh
yes
the question is what what can google do
to help on kind of product related stuff
I think there's a few answers to that
I'm really impressed with with not only
the the Google Talk team with the google
video team and also your your
engineering expertise in building big
Nets and data centers and things like
that and i do think we'd get a lot of
really good advice I also think there
there's a lot of interesting things we
can do on our data that you might not
want to like roll out in production
right away so it might be an interesting
test bed again my kind of fantasy idea
of taking the XMPP stuff and marrying
marrying it with the video streaming or
if not XMPP some other mechanism of
allowing the net to do intensive
annotation of the streams not only as
they occur but also after the fact
because I think one of the things you
can do is stream live but then if you're
able to have that permanent archive for
anybody to use maybe somebody goes in a
little bit later or a little bit later
after that and adds more information and
you know the stuff becomes more useful
over time and so you know really working
with people is really what I'm looking
for in my fantasy scenario is that
people get interested enough in this
that they want to participate on with us
at the public memory trust but also that
you folks are ingesting this video and
that you find it useful for your own
products question
other question the question is do you
have kind of a centralized annotation
facility or you just let Google Video do
one annotation you know we do one
somebody else does one I think that's a
research question because I'm not sure
how I would do it has to be distributed
right I mean you have to you know
certainly with XMPP you you have
distributed servers and so it's got to
be distributed particularly yet
institutional boundaries here is there a
way of setting up a common URL scheme
common stamping of the data so we can
know what we're talking about is there
some stay ghagra fee or watermarking or
something we can do on there and then is
there some mechanism we can use that
allows you to you know create lots of
value on the data participate in a
global hole and still keep your business
interests and I think that's one of the
things that we would want to work on on
the core thing streaming video out I
don't think is hard there's some
difficult engineering you know we got to
configure the routers right we got to
make sure we're peering properly we've
got the proper transit where we've
picked the right formats but but I think
this is all you know straightforward
it's hard work but straightforward the
how do you add value on the data
particularly that much data and
particularly with potentially very large
audiences I think it's something we all
struggle with and and that's one reason
I'm attracted to this because I wouldn't
mind spending the next few years kind of
you know working on that stuff because I
think would be interesting
ok
nearly
spot
and wanting to be verified East Africa
sitting in a before certain factions
here
I yeah so stevens point is that the
engineering on the video distribution is
not necessarily a no-brainer I think I
agree with him so let me clarify my
previous comment I think it's hard work
and one reason I think this is doable is
because there are people like Steven
interested in this people like Randy
Bush who does iij Hank Kilmer and Andrew
Parton actually help me do the initial
engineering on kind of the sample
configs Hank ran sprints backbone and
Andrew did you unit and then went and
did very oh um and and so I understand
the routing issues are difficult in the
bandwidth provisioning issues are
difficult but I think there is great
interest among the routing people on you
know solving this problem in doing it
and so it's an issue I'm less worried
about because I know the caliber of the
people that are interested in the
problem
brings multicast to
point where service parts actually want
question is would this make multi
casting like something that people
actually do arm that would be great
internet too is multicast enabled and so
it's kind of a no-brainer to feed it on
the internet to send it out there that
gets it out to all the universities now
whether they're multicast enabled inside
of their campus network so that's
another story but you know the big ones
pretty much our that's actually pretty
decent infrastructure we've been going
since gosh at least nineteen ninety on
the ISP should do multicast and and so
far at least it hasn't happened and I
agree it's the proper way to distribute
this kind of stuff and you know a lot of
people do multicast but then there's
also kind of the streaming you know
people want to see it when they want
instead of when it's actually there um
there's some interesting protocols that
dynamically build multicast tunnels to
the edges the people like juniper and
cisco have been working on um which is a
possibility and some people think that
might be a carrot-and-stick the way this
works is when you ask for a multicast
address instead of your whatever video
player is simply saying up we don't have
multicast go away you use a little
plugin on your pc it goes to the router
and since I want this multicast address
router uses any cast to go to a central
directory then dynamically builds a
tunnel and so the theory here is that if
enough people are going in and
dynamically building tunnels over the
ISPs backbone at some point they say
okay okay okay will do multicast I'm a
little skeptical that I just I've been
you know I did a lot of em buon
broadcasting multi casting whatever and
long ago and I've been watching the
multicast stuff and it's been terribly
frustrating that it hasn't like moved
into the core infrastructure and you
know there's a lot of reasons for that a
lot of the Ops guys are just like this
is too difficult it's too hard I can't
train people to you know provision the
routers properly um it would be great if
this ended up being a carrot and stick
that helped move that along
I will certainly put the into the
question is have you looked at other
distribution mechanisms like
peer-to-peer certainly BitTorrent
service on the entire archive is a
no-brainer right that that's like just
do it I think there'll be a lot of other
things that we can do as well and yes I
would like to see that particularly for
the more popular things you know when
something hits a blogosphere and
everybody gets all concerned I would
like to figure out a way to get that
stuff out really quickly to folks and
and to get the bigger stuff out there
because you know a lot of people are
getting real frustrated with the you
know 240 x 3 40 stuff and you know the
lines are getting faster and people are
getting able to be able to digest bigger
things and people are getting smart
enough that they're willing to say well
start downloading now I'll come back in
the morning and so it is possible to
begin thinking about you know gigabyte
distribution of video or you know
hopefully at some point in the future we
can even start going up to the the full
res stuff I do a lot of work on hi-def
which is you know 160 gigabytes per per
hour uncompressed and you can compress
it down to eight to 16 gigabytes per
hour when you're doing a variety of
compression techniques but you know
ultimately that's still a little too big
for folks and and so yeah the
peer-to-peer stuff is one way to get
that stuff out there at least in chunks
and and get it out to people any other
questions got one here and then one here
ok
question is how do you do the basic
quality control of making sure the
camera is not pointed out the window
we're looking at 12 staff an executive
director of facilities manager 5 network
engineers 5 video engineers and one of
the job requirements is everybody needs
to be able to run a camera we're going
to do some simple broadcast management
stuff I don't want to spend the big
bucks on the you know cable head in you
know fancy stuff but yeah you're right
we are going to have to sit there and
monitor now the good news is Washington
starts at nine and stops at five and so
I think it is possible to intensive Lee
monitor what you're doing and do a
pretty good job on it but people will be
running fast we're going to look for an
executive director that understands that
part of his or her job is going to be
holding that camera a couple hours a day
in addition to the business planning and
the board briefings and whatever else I
do Peter
the question is is c-span supportive
c-span has I went and talked to them and
said here's what I'm thinking of doing I
don't want you to think this is
competitive and so I I have met with the
founding chairman I've talked
intensively with with one of their
executive vice presidents their their
chief operating officer they're
extremely supportive whether they'll
participate or not I don't know but they
don't view this as competitive one of
the issues that they learned with the
the the washington correspondents dinner
and the colbert speech is that a lot of
people on the net think their stuff is
public domain well it is in public
domain and they have very strong
feelings about things like events being
viewed in their entirety they don't want
people using their stuff for political
ads and so they view it as a very
positive thing that there would be a
large public domain archive of stuff
that they can point people to they also
view this as a potential source of video
because they only have so many bodies
they can only be in so many places and
like I said no matter what you cover
there might be something happening in
another room which ends up being
newsworthy and so I do think in the long
run major media is going to be forced to
deal with the service because they're
just not going to want to miss you know
in case something does happen yes
question is does this include the floor
of the House and Senate the good news is
the floor of the House and Senate is
very easy to do it's done by on
basically by the Congress with c-span
acting as operator that stuff is public
domain if you're a member of the the
gallery you're able to do that and like
I said I've previously had broadcast
credentials with the gallery I actually
put the floor of the House and Senate
audio online in 93 and we had a cool
little search engine working on now we
had a guy from MIT come down and do
speaker ID turned out it wasn't hard to
do for the floor because there's a
limited number of people we brought in a
congressional record coupled to speaker
ID together with a little clever
programming that he did and so we
actually had a way search engine where
you could say I want to hear all
Democrats from Minnesota last week who
spoke about the budget and you would
pull up the audio as well as the
transcript now the thing that I like the
most about this
service was a negative query which was
show me all audio that does not have
corresponding text because congressmen
are allowed to revise and extend their
remarks and often they'll go in and just
like leave this stuff out of the
Congressional Record and with our search
engine you can actually find in one
search all of those speeches showed that
to some senators and they were like oh
that was a Deb Roy who did that
programming he's now professor at the
Media Lab the very very good and kind of
you know audio and video processing
techniques he does some really cool
stuff Steven another can of worms
and there's infrastructure to distribute
video so that every broadband
subscribers in America can watch
whatever meaning
let's say further that this whole net
neutrality thing calls in favor of
people who control those broadband lines
being able to prioritize whatever
Satan Petrie hearing and that's deemed
to conflict with the in fact release of
terminator four
i sue somebody the question is whoa so
what happens we get a success disaster
this is great everybody loves our stuff
somebody comcast whoever decides that
the impeachment hearings are not as
important as the imminent release of
terminator for what do we do there's
some real First Amendment issues right
there and you know the Congress is not
going to be happy if their stuff is not
reaching end users I think that would
certainly illustrate the net neutrality
point pretty well now on the other hand
has you know net neutrality can be two
different things it can be I'm going to
cut off your video or your voice over IP
or whatever because it's not my service
and I'm selling my own or it can simply
be I will provision my service better
than your service and that's kind of the
shades of grey issue there if they cut
off the impeachment hearings I think
there's a huge issue and that's pretty
simple you know you go to Boeing Boeing
you tell them what's happening you write
some letters to the Capitol and let the
machinery go into action if it's
degraded and there's a little better and
your stuff isn't getting through then I
think it's a more difficult issue that's
a real issue with the net neutrality
thing is how do you legislate fairness
you know it's a real tough thing because
as you know Stephen whenever you
engineer a net you're always making
trade-offs and the position you're
getting out of the comcast and the
verizon says oh well you know this is
just reasonable normal engineering we're
doing but what tends to happen is they
go over the edge they say well okay just
because we're doing a product we're
going to cut off all this other stuff
and then then all of a sudden it becomes
a real issue for folks so um there's
another follow up on what if you have a
success disaster I hope that you know at
some point like I said the library of
congress and the libraries of the world
have permanent archives as does google
video and a bunch of other people i hope
all these committees have got you know
beautiful cameras and they're sending
stuff out and the Government Printing
Office has got some kind of a DC fiber
infrastructure for getting this stuff
out to the net and a clue faux fashion
what do we do that well this model of
putting every public briefing online in
a place can be replicated at the state
level at the local level in other
capitals and so I view our mission is
putting ourselves out of business as
quickly as we can and why
shington and selling this bridge back to
the government or getting them to take
it over and then taking whatever money
we have left or other money were able to
raise and going out and basically trying
to teach other people how to do the same
thing at the state level the local level
and in other countries so replication of
this I think is a useful thing
Washington is a great place to start
because there's so much content there
and the intellectual property issues are
really well defined this stuff is public
domain no matter what it's not quite as
clear in in a few other instances in
some states and the infrastructure isn't
quite as developed you know things like
the verizon a lock isn't there and you
know the fiber infrastructure isn't
there but but i do think in the long run
if there is a public proceeding
happening i think the public needs to
have access to it both now and forever
if it's a public proceeding it needs to
be archived other questions my radio
station by the way when I ran it was I
got a call it was actually called
internet talk radio but I call got a
call from the New York Times about 1994
and they said uh I was putting to
Congress online they were writing an
article and I so what's the name of your
radio station again I said uh it's arty
hyphen F F okay and then I got a call
back the next day from the editor go
what did that stand for again I was like
I don't believe this it's radio
technology for mankind and sure enough
they printed it and so I've been doing
business under rtfm for a while I've got
some rtfm stickers up here that are left
over I'm i crack United Nations summit
in Tunisia as a member of the media and
brought a couple cameras and so I I was
actually there under the rtfm rubric I
had an rtfm hat and a little badge and
film that whole thing so there's some
extra stickers a few folks want any more
questions thank you very much
