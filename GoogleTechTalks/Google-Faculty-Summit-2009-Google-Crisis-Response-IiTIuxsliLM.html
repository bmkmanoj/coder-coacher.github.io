here so my name is khan Slammy i'm a
team member of curries i'm a part of the
google.org so my background I'm an
agricultural engineer by training so I
did a PhD in GIS decision making
multiple criteria a decision making at
Oregon State University and I spent I've
been at Google for one year and a half
almost and I've spent almost you know 15
years working at the international level
with the United Nations and different
research centers in Latin America in in
Africa so I'm so let's say fifty percent
of my time part of my time I work with
the Google crisis response team at
Google so and I pro you know I will give
you a short summary of what we do in
terms of you know in the in terms of the
different efforts in the disaster and
during the disaster cycle disaster
cycles first we consider different
phases of prevention preparedness
response rehabilitation and
reconstruction so as of now our efforts
have been mainly in terms of
preparedness and response effort to
crisis crisis for us it's we're still
you know we are refining our criteria in
terms of you know where you know when
should we act and what should be the
action as well that are triggered that
when do we involve our you know our team
at Google to you know to be involved in
how so first the crisis is so it's when
they're you know a vast amount of you
know of let's say human suffering
natural resources are already vast dated
and there is a need for local
communities need external assistant
either at national level or
international level and as you know so
rapid response is key in terms of to be
efficient in terms of your response and
to be you know to provide a timely and
let's say very targeted response you
need to have real-time information so
real-time information of about the
population that might be affected who
they are where where are they what are
their needs and you need to be able to
monitor this information in real-time
over you know certainly the response
effort but over time as well you know
and throughout the throughout the relief
and rehabilitation efforts and there are
many different organizations that are
involved so I'm interested in providing
in a water food others its shelter other
are collecting data so you need to have
you need to have platform and 4g mission
systems we have gather information from
these you know at multi scale and as
well multi-domain multi domain data so
and in real-time and Google is uniquely
positioned to facilitate this that
affluent times of a crisis you know from
data collection to publishing
aggregation and disseminating to the
will in a scalable let's say fashion and
we have demonstrated it you know it
started a good example is the Katrina
hurricane katrina where we communities
use our technology to publish
information about their needs what's
going what was going on on the ground
and as well you know few hours after the
hurricane we publish more than 4,000
imagery that you know make that we made
available to the world and specifically
to the responders so that can inform
their and their actions so four years
later so perhaps you are aware we at
Google we can
at Google we can each Googlers can
provide twenty percent of this time to a
project of his interest so for instance
for the Katrina efforts you know there
are you know many many volunteers that
volunteer to help with this crisis and
four years later now we have a team
dedicated team that we call the google
crisis response that is operational has
been operational for six months now so
are still you're working and defining
our strategy too we do not want to
duplicate efforts and we need to
certainly to coordinate hours to to the
ones of the you know happening at
national and international level we need
to understand the landscape of you know
of effort so first it's really to
develop bill extend technologies to you
know to facilitate the flow of
information so rapid dissemination of
information so it it involves as well as
you know you know processes partnership
development and we have four angle in
terms and the ultimate vision sorry it's
really to improve the global response
you know and commit support community
actions on the ground so support relief
responders and we have four main entry
points so as I mentioned building
extending technology to facilitate to
provide operational pictures to
responders as well coordinate efforts
with international organization building
the capacity because we want to to make
sure that what we technology we develop
is is being sustained and owned by these
organizations and certainly response to
ongoing crisis so for the last year we
have responded to more than 15 different
crises around the world so focus area so
this is just you know just to give you a
short overview so some examples so we
have a virtual team so
our team is by Phil Dixon and Jeff Jeff
Martin who are part of the Geo team but
i'm i'm a member of dot org we have we
have representative from various units
across Google so we are really a virtual
team part of my responsibilities have
been to to build partnership with you an
organization around data sharing that
are sharing yes to make sure that not
just in times of crisis but before in as
well because when a disaster strike it's
not time to you know to look for data
and to use your contact you need to be
to have this information available
before hand as well building the
capacity you know certainly to use our
geo products but there are other
technology like just the one that got
guy Taino guy 10 oh you know
demonstrated so we just tested it for
instance in the in an exercise that we
had in Cambodia a couple of weeks ago so
it's really to to expose different
technologies out there and and see if
it's a good fit for these technologies
let's see these humanitarian
organization and as you know to improve
their efficiency in terms of their
response so we have as well we are
interested something that we are very
much interested indeed it's how can we
you know combine these different
technology and facilitate real-time flow
of information information could be you
know photos could be imagery could be
SMS GIS data spreadsheets blogs how can
we combine in real-time all these
different type of information and make
it accessible across platforms could be
the web radio satellite etc so we are
engaged to help us you know better
understand you know how can we you know
move forward on this war engage with
this communal routing protocol community
which wmo the well material
meteorological organization is very much
involved
so this is a standard that it's emerging
that facilitate the flow of and alerts
information across across system but
there are still many issues you know to
be resolves how can you communicate with
with organization that are not connected
how to combine information from
different formats etc etc so we have a
lot more to learn so it's why we try to
engage with various an organization
within the US and outside as well so
just to give you an idea so this is what
we an example you know we act at as I
mentioned so so we monitor and let's say
a disaster or yeah disaster over time so
when one disaster a crisis occurs so we
we have a chart decision matrix that
help us decide if we should engage or
not and at in what fashion for instance
for the one example for the cyclone
nargis so we partner with you know set
and you know that it's one of the UN
organization that provides a satellite
solution to organization within and
outside the UN so they had the tracks of
the the cyclone and they had as well
imagery about the flooded area so we
publish this information on them you
know on our website so that was made
available to to the world and hopefully
and form some of their response effort
on the ground another example is we were
involved for example in Dakota with the
flooding so we partner with the radio
station and across the network the radio
station networks in Fargo so they
embedded my map on their website so they
could provide in real-time information
about about the shelters evacuated the
areas and other information of key
interest for the responders just lately
you know alas not a long time ago so we
in june of this year so we partner with
UNHCR to create this virtual map that
shit's a Google Earth tour so that Korea
that shows refugee camps across the
across the globe so provide some insight
in the life of these refugee and
hopefully will raise awareness about
human rights issues around the world so
there are different as you see there are
different levels you know that we are
you know the that we're engaged with
with these different organizations so
when we have so as I mentioned early on
so we are still very new so we are still
trying to you know to develop a
comprehensive and proactive strategy to
response to to respond to to a disaster
so what's coming next for us so we will
we will continue in the fall so this is
a default to engage with developers and
users so we will be contributing and
even leading some of Akutan crisis aye
captain activities part for instance
there is one will partner with Microsoft
and Yahoo to see how together you know
we can track to add some of the main
gaps you know that that needs to be
addressed to be more effective to have a
more lity proactive response and we will
be involved as well in different GIS
conference and one of them is very
interesting it's in Uganda in Africa GIS
it's one of the biggest GIS conference
in Africa every two years so we hope to
be there will provide training
activities and will be you know all
these activist activities allow us to
provide us with the opportunity to
engage with you no more partners more
key institution that can inform the way
we do our work so hopefully so I might
meet you you know to some of these you
might be you know attending some of
these so perhaps we can continue the
conversation there if not if you have
any questions I'm happy to answer them
thank you
yeah but in terms of in terms of in
terms of a crisis for instance in
Myanmar you may not have connectivity so
how our technology works without being
connected so this is a key or low
bandwidth so this is a key information
yes certainly yeah the the network of
you know how do you collect information
in real-time and then share it across
you need to be it you need to be even
more efficient because you need to share
information across you know across
organizations as well yes certainly all
the time but are some constraint for
instance a internet connectivity that's
one for instance and as well you need to
have you know to have real-time
information about you know as I was no
imagery for instance you need to we are
also working on them on developing
partnership with space agencies to make
these disinformation you know available
a couple of hours after a disaster you
want for instance for us perhaps some in
the u.s. it's we you know we believe
that you know having access to know
where are the health facilities might be
obvious but if you are in
another part of the world these data
might not be available so it's you know
and even some data in the u.s. might not
be available in times of a crisis you
see what are the you know the Katrina
I'm sure you are aware of all the
problems and it happens here so there
are a lot of things that you can
situation a crisis situation certainly
impose more constraints to our processes
and technology so I everything you said
of course is absolutely right but I
think you were right in your question is
that people are willing to compromise
and just do it to make it happen so
whether it's privacy or lower resolution
or less efficient or less perfect they
just do it and more than hack it
together so there's huge opportunity not
just constraint yeah i agree i think
it's also just that in a crisis mode
people are not going through their
routine channels and i know in a regular
operation you can develop over time how
what your information resources are and
make sure they're right toward that end
have you thought about tools to help
organizations do exercises and advanced
you know hypothetical scenarios where
they say you know will I have the
information resources if this kind of
thing happens well yes yes and we I have
colleagues way that will be testing an
hour you know some of our technology and
in the US but you know without
connectivity and so in you know crisis
or yes crisis mode let's say yes and we
for instance when I mentioned we were in
Cambodia couple of you know weeks ago so
that was the idea as well so how does
our tools work in such settings so and
then we may you know and form their
development yeah one problem that arises
in the crisis setting is the agencies
come together they don't normally work
with each other and one of the problems
that i read about is that they use
different record formats different
wireless frequencies different modes of
operation so they can't actually commit
cated each other yeah so are you doing
something about that you know we we try
to support these communities but it's
really a you know a global effort but
for instance i mentioned the common
alerting protocols so if we can advance
that standard so that will facilitate
the flow of information at least you
know in terms of alerts you know
bringing if there are some are not for
instance within the UN a few
organization use that protocol but if
you can you know we can develop
technology that use and take advantage
of this and support promote this d
standard so hopefully you know Morgan
ization will will use the standard and
then you will improve the response but
certainly and you know if such standards
as well could be could be advanced for
all type of information that would be
that's it's also our goal it's really to
facilitate the flow information starting
with alerts let's say but then there's
yeah thank you thank you thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
