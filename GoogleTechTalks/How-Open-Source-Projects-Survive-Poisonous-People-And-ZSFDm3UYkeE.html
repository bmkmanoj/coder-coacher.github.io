open-source developers at Google speaker
series which is our talks sessions
designed to give the public insights
into what open-source developers who
have been hired by Google are doing in
their daily lives this evening we are
privileged to have with us ben
collins-sussman and brian fitzpatrick
who are two of the engineers behind our
project hosting feature on Google Code
site as well as the version developers
and they are here to talk to you about
how your open-source project can survive
poisonous people
thanks listen thanks Lesley go ahead so
you have the remote No all right great
here we go so start off with who are we
we have not forgotten who we are my name
is Brian Fitzpatrick Ben and I are
currently Google engineers in Chicago
and we both work on the backend of the
Google Code hosting as well as other
bits and pieces of things related to
open source here at Google yeah and we
should talk about the next line which is
the fact that these are opinions that
we've come to on our own after many
years of sort of participating in open
source projects and we found these
issues coming up over and over again so
we decided to put a talk together and
it's it's gone pretty well for us so
obviously this is not the only way to
run a community it's the way that we've
found to be the best way that we think
and so we're trying to share that with
you guys and maybe do a little group
therapy see and get some Q&amp;amp;A after the
session and this book is written by a
friend of ours named karl fogel and we
recommend it highly it talks about a lot
of the things we're talking about as
well as even more details technical
details about running a project and we
recommend it if you don't have it
already and yeah I think that's all we
need to say great should move up Google
so we'll start off with it doing a quick
overview of what we're going to look at
there are four different stages that we
visit in protecting your project the
first stage is comprehension to
understand what what poisonous people
are what we need to protect against in
the first place beyond that is how do
you fortify your project against
poisonous people
you obviously want to attract other
people to your project to work on it
not necessarily the poisonous kind how
do you identify those poisonous people
and lastly if your projects already
infected how do you get them out and
every one of those is a certain level of
trickiness to it I would have to say
yeah so let's talk about understanding
the threat so you got your open source
project what is the most important
resource it's not your hardware it's the
attention and focus of your community
and this is what you are trying to
protect in the first place from the
poisonous people
there's a limited resource here right if
20 people are trying to implement 20
hugely divergent features at once or if
everybody's squabbling all the time
you will get nowhere in your project so
what is wrong with poisonous people
what should so poisonous people will
show up and they'll distract your to
distract your developers from doing
productive work they can cause emotional
drain because they'll start in fighting
or squabbling or that sort of thing and
with what they do is basically the
you're going down a certain Road and
they're going to either stop you slow
you down or try and turn you off a
different Road and some people do do
this on purpose some people will do this
on accident yep so um paralysis this is
the problem if you not always I guess
the best way to say this is these people
who are disrupting your progress are not
always doing it intentionally in fact I
think it's more often that they're doing
it unintentionally they are so into the
project and they want it to be so
perfect that they'll actually end up
hurting you with their perfectionism or
people trying to get the process just
perfect and this is one of one of the
people in our project actually has says
you should not let the perfect be the
enemy the good and that sort of become
at least with the subversion project
that sort of become one of our
watch.watch phrases and I guess there's
an example we had where I guess somebody
proposed a feature and I won't go into
details but there is a certain person in
the subversion project who does
fantastic stuff we love him but we ended
up sort of needling pushing at the
design document it went on for weeks and
then months and it became clear that it
was never going to be no one was ever
going to start coding this process and
because this one person would not let
the design document
not stop picking at it so ultimately in
a situation like that the best thing you
can do is get support from a large
percentage of developers in a project
and if they're happy with it somebody
just needs to sit down and code it and
ignore the noisy minority and that's and
one of the things that we like to talk
about here we have a lot of different
catchphrases that we pull out in
subversion when we need to sort of set
the talk down and get going with the
doing and one of those is we talk about
painting the bike shed up who here knows
what painting the bike shed means any
any bsd folks in the room alright so
painting the bike shed that I'll give
you a quick overview on this back in the
and the bsd and bsd days Paul Henning
camp wrote this wonderful email they
were having this huge fight over whether
sleep should take seconds or
microseconds I believe or seconds and
milliseconds it went on and on and on
and on and on and so the way he
described it was that if you're going to
build a nuclear power plant these guys
go off to all this research bring this
gargantuan binder of information and
they to the board and they say we're
going to build a nuclear power plant the
board of the electric company looks at
it like oh yeah it looks great go ahead
and build the nuclear power plant and
two weeks later they come in they say
you know look we got this nuclear power
plant we're building it the workers want
a little bike shed for them to keep
their bikes in so the rain doesn't get
on the bikes here the blueprint so
here's just pictures of the bike shed
we're going to draw and it will go the
discussion of what color to paint this
bike shed will take forever so let's
distill that down is that the amount of
discussion on a particular feature is
inversely inversely proportional to its
complexity and we definitely seem to
have a question
all parties know the guy this is for
this is the park in Parkinson law never
heard of that okay
no is it he said it's a tribute it to
its original the original author monitor
this idea was a Parkinson never heard of
this known as fourth part the fourth law
of Parkinson yeah it's just the fact
that in a group people are really when
they're working in a committee people
want to put their stamp and sort of
prove like I'm I'm I'm participating see
and it's very easy to put your opinion
in on blueprints for a bike shed than to
put your opinion in on blueprints for a
power plant so we we try we tend to call
people early and often when they're in
your bike shedding something we'll even
call ourselves you know I'd prefer to
have this this way but it's total bike
 and our friend Carl set up actually
WWE bike shed calm and you can pick just
about any normal color and go color bike
shed calm and you'll get that color it's
lovely so don't get bogged down in
perfectionism that's the moral of the
slide so let's talk about fortifying
against the threat how do you keep your
open source community resistant to
infection and this is sort of this
section of our talk we talk just about
things that habits that we think make
very healthy open-source communities
very prescriptive so these are the four
things I'm going to flip up the four
things that we think make a healthy
open-source community and you would be
surprised if you take a poll of open
source projects how many are missing one
or more of these elements or all of it
if they're missing all of them they
don't last very long but most problems
that you find in open source projects
can be traced back to a deficiency in
one of these things so let's let's go
into some detail why don't you talk
about it fits all right so best practice
now this is one of the things that I
preach day to day around here when I'm
talking to people about open source
something is have a mission have a
direction if you go out there and you
want to just write some software well
that's great but if you don't know where
you're going you're never going to know
we are there when you finally get there
so first thing I tell people to do is
pick a direction so where are you going
to go and then limit your section with a
scope so that you don't wind up in
limitless feature creep or people adding
a lot of things on that you or didn't
intend to do so you really have to think
about where you want to go with your
object and I have a couple of examples
of projects that I've personally been
involved with and the first one
obviously is subversion and this is
subversions mission statement it was on
the front page of the subversion project
for six years well at least it was the
first four years was very relevant as we
worked towards 1.0 and that saved us a
lot of grief we'd have somebody come up
and say yeah you guys you're going to
write this new version control system we
have to integrate make with it and a
compiler and it should pretty pictures
and do PNG jpg conversion and should do
clearcase features and everything and so
we could point back to this and say look
we're going to write a version control
system but our limiter is that we're
trying to write CVS without the cruddy
features or they're quite a missed
features or the bug and in fact we
actually enumerated the exact features
we wanted and the exact problems with
CVS that we were trying to address so
from day one if somebody came along with
suggestion to the list we could say it's
on it's on our list or it's not on our
to-do list and if it's not on the do
list we say thanks come back later after
1.0 and we can talk so this is it's a
it's a way of you free to communicate
with new developers coming to your
project this is what we're doing if you
want to take part in this that's great
please join us you're not interested
then save your own time and ours and go
somewhere else basically the second
thing a project is the Google web
toolkit which I had the honor of working
with this team and helping them bring
their project completely open-source
from stem to stern this December and
I've talked with those guys and I gave
them this sort of same talk I said let's
pick a direction and a scope and refine
that makes it as clear as we can because
people are going to want to come on and
work with you guys but we want to make
sure that they're working with you and
not against you so as you can see the
direction that they chose is you know
the no compromise Ajax development
environment in Java in Java the scope
limitation they chose was Java in a
modern browser so that sets the stage
for some of the things they want to do
and some of the things they don't want
to do and like the subversion project
they go on to explain what what this
means and what what it doesn't mean so
what are the goals and non goals for the
project so this is basically it's you're
ensuring that your community has
something to focus on if you're trying
to preserve attention and focus the best
way to do that is to have something to
focus on right I mean it's that's it
um on mailing lists this is a problem I
mean this is your main communication
method right in any open source project
I mean you have IRC or instant message
but majority of official communication
really happens on mailing lists and
these are just some general practices
we've run into when people come along to
me and let's point them to the archives
do not let them reopen old discussions
unless they really know what they're
talking about and they've really seen
the former discussion because if they
come along and they say you know let's
talk about X Y &amp;amp; Z and they and they
haven't read the previous discussions
it's really it's just a matter of
disrespect they're disrespecting
everyone else's time in the project so
don't let that happen
another thing that you'll see happening
is sometimes if there's dissent in the
discussion you'll see one very vehement
dissent er who will sit there the entire
time and respond to every single mail
and the thread to anyone who disagrees
with him even people who do agree with
him he will keep reply to every and so
you'll end up with a thread with you
know 50 messages in it and exactly half
of them are from the same person and
it's ridiculous we call it yes
filibustering and we'll call people out
on that we'll say you know what read the
thread think about your response
carefully write a nice single response
so we can keep going it's it's a way
it's sort of a technique of making it
look like there's more dissension when
there is and you should not what that
happened it's a technique that poisonous
people can use to derail consensus-based
community from actually achieving
consensus because like Ben said you have
this noisy minority now they're making a
lot of noise and people look and say oh
wow there seems to be no agreement on
this and if you look carefully you see
that the no agreement is coming from one
person and while seven or eight other
people likely agree on something all
right go ahead
all right so documentation is really
important if you don't document things
first of all the first part of the
documentation is your sort of direction
your mission the second part is what
else how else can you communicate with
people about what you're doing and what
you want to do so design decisions
that's your design Docs what you're
going to do with with your software
bugfixes documenting what you fix how
you fixed it having an issue tracker and
almost having an issue tracker at all
right documenting your mistakes so this
is something that people frequently
overlooked because who wants to document
your mistakes who wants to say spend
time writing up we went down this path
Bono is a dead end and
backed up and kept going on well the
problem is is if you don't document this
whether it's even just in your mailing
list archives or you write about it
somewhere or blog it or whatever not
someone's going to come back and want to
have this discussion all over again
and that's going to distract from your
focus and needlessly take up your energy
and of course you know not everybody in
the project is going to be there forever
so you might imagine a time when the
people participating now will be
replaced by a completely different set
of people who will want that history to
look at so right yeah and I don't
changes of course we we recommend
picking a standard format for your log
messages that people should follow and
interesting in the past Tom Ben and I
worked at a different company where we
dealt with we dealt with different
clients and we said you know yeah you
should use this use use of methods have
some sort of way of people writing
consistent log messages and this guy
said I can't get my developers to write
consistent log messages and our friend
Karl just about choked on his own tongue
because he's like I have a broken source
project over here with 35 unpaid
volunteers who followed this insanely
detailed log message specification for
every check-in that they do so don't
tell me that you have a problem with
your paid developers and I can get these
people coming off the internet for free
to do this yep absolutely
okay that's cute
yeah okay so we get that so code
collaboration this is something that if
you participate in open source you know
this commit emails are the best way to
have people realize what other people
are working on most open source projects
do not review each other's changes
before checking them in you what happens
is you know somebody builds up trust
they get commit access they start
committing patches into the version
control system and people trust that
they're not screwing things up and what
happens then is an email goes out and it
goes into everyone's mailbox all the
other developers and they can sort of
see oh here's what this person is doing
and depending on their level of interest
they might review the code or not but
the fact that it pushes these code
reviews and people's face is a huge deal
much much more likely to get
participation in code review than
developers going in and reading what
someone else has already done
so that's that is a very important
technique and another thing you should
not do is let people submit power plants
another use of the term power plant here
but same basic idea
don't let developers go off for three
months in the corner and quietly develop
some huge mega feature and then suddenly
appear one day and commit the whole
thing and it's so big nobody can review
it nobody has the time or the energy to
even understand what it's doing and that
that's terrible because you want
everyone in your project to know what's
going on in pretty much every corner of
the code and not just one person who
might get hit by a bus and then how are
you going to support that feature so
this is this is part of just keeping
people in the loop and the way to do
that is you know say hey I'm going to
work on this feature for three months
let me do it on a branch over here and
you guys can watch me do it
incrementally without disrupting the
rest of you so don't be afraid of
branches oh I just said that so that's
it
bus factor you want Elmo to bus pectoris
sure so so I actually wrote an article
about the bus factor the the bus factor
of your project or a part of your
project is the number of developers that
have to get hit by a bus to leave you in
a world of crap so for example
subversions file system code the
Berkeley DB file system code for a while
had a bus factor of 1 and that was Mike
pilato and we were a little bit worried
about him because he crossed the street
frequently so what did we do to prevent
this is we did our best to start working
to lower the barrier to start working on
the the Berkeley DB file system we went
through and made sure that the code was
commented well and as clear as possible
Mike wrote a couple of different design
Docs expressing what we were doing in
there and we started we started
encouraging we actually asked some of
our developers if anybody would was
willing to start to work in the file
system with Mike and take a look at that
and some people took us up on that yeah
that's right encourage people to spread
their expertise around absolutely does I
mean and being hit by a bus I joke about
actually Mike being run over by a bus
but the anyway being hit by a bus can
take any number of forms someone can
have a new job someone can have a baby
someone can get married
lifestyle change life status change any
that sort of thing can take them away
from your project because most of the
time you are dealing with volunteers and
this this leads into the general idea of
the Galit Arianism we're talking about
people not owning certain parts of the
codebase it's okay to be an expert on
certain parts of the codebase but what
you'll often see happening both inside
corporations and in open source projects
certain people sort of marking off their
territories and saying this is mine and
you can't touch it unless you talk to me
and that is a very very bad for
collaboration so one of the ways you can
discourage that is do not let people put
their names at the top of source code
files there are plenty of chances for
attribution there's always a file that
describes who the the main contributors
to the project are there's always the
the changelog the history on the version
control system records who commits what
when you can annotate the code and see
who wrote what when so it's not that
you're not going to get credit for what
you're doing if somebody isn't looking
but if you soon as you see a name in a
file it makes somebody nervous it makes
them think Oh should I really be trying
to fix this bug here without you know am
i stepping on somebody's toes if it's a
if everything's anonymous it really
feels like everybody owns everything
else and that's a great practice and
even even worse than that is the at what
point do I put my name in the file
problem is it a two line changes at a
four line change I reformatted the code
I wrote a comment right it's it and it
winds up to be a lot a lot of I think
more petty stuff that you just don't
have time for you don't want to focus on
that exactly so what's what's the
example the D parser oh the day parser
contributors so we had a guy come up
who's actually a very competent engineer
wrote some good code first version
because the subversion used the CVS date
parser which was you know kind of a mess
but we we were we were we went ahead
with that and he came through he said
okay you know I see you guys want to
rewrite this clean it up a little bit
make it something a little more
maintainable and so he wrote this code
this whole file worth of code and he put
his name at the top and he sent it as a
patch for code review and we went
through and reviewed it and you know
we're like you okay fix this this is a
style issue in our code blah blah blah
blah blah and you know pull your name
out of the top you don't put names and
files he said what do you mean I wrote
the whole file I want my name in the
file we said well no you don't
understand this is how we do it it's
documented pointing a doctor point out
the documentation in our hacking
document of how to hack super
and that's just how we do it you don't
see names in any other files anywhere
and he's like well I don't care I wrote
this whole file I'm going to tribute it
I want my name in it so blackmail
basically and let's say that's great you
take your date parser and take it with
you and I've got another project - we'll
take it with your name in it because we
don't want the code we're not willing to
sacrifice our community tenets for your
ego so it's hard to say no sometimes -
especially with his he writes good code
but the health of the community is more
important than one particular bug fix or
feature at a given moment it's looking
at the long term rather than the short
term and another engineer will come by
and write it for you and show you that
it happened yes took a little longer yep
okay well-defined process sees so this
is sort of goes without saying but not
all open-source projects really are very
professional about how they manage the
software they don't necessarily maintain
release branches they don't necessarily
even have a release process and it
depends on the size and scope and
maturity of the project but as the
project grows you need to start thinking
about these things and figure out well
how are we going to release people how
are we going to manage bugs if they come
out are we going to release bug fixes to
people so it's something to think about
and then you also need think about how
how to get more people in the community
so people always start out coming to the
community say you know I've patched this
little problem here here's my patch and
they post it to the email list and you
want to be welcoming to them right I
mean you want your community grow and be
healthy and you want to help but you
want to not ignore them so in some cases
sometimes the community is so busy they
completely drop patches on the floor
people come in offer them they get
ignored that's bad
one way to fix that is to actually
assign somebody in your community to
notice patches that are being ignored
and put them in the bug tracker or
respond to the person after a certain
amount of time but then in general I
guess you need to come up with a policy
of how are you going to expand your
community in a more official sense what
does it mean for someone to be part of
the community community obviously it
means you know they're going to have
commit access to your source control
that's usually sort of the technical
definition of being a member of the
community but there's a lot of other
definitions right well what would you
talk about this part I'm thinking about
how the culture perpetuates right I mean
the culture of a Pecha waits because the
kind of people you're going to give
commit access to your project or people
that are going to be like yourselves
people have the same values of your
software who are you know going to abide
by your community rules they're the kind
of people show up with patches and
you'll iterate with on each on different
patches with them and after a while
they're going to start submitting
patches that need less attention before
they go in so you switch them from
review then commit commit to commit then
review and the review takes place by the
rest of the committers but so it's the
self selecting community like as Ben and
I sort of do some through periods where
we do less work with the subversion
community we come back and keep an eye
on things and it's it's the same sort of
flavor to the community of the tone of
the mailing list right yeah and and now
the anecdote that we have for this is
that even a founder can be booted so
we've talked about this in the past with
each other about what happens if
somebody kind of goes crazy you know you
can remove someone's commit access if
the group of committers votes on that
I'm familiar with an open-source project
where the founder wrote almost all the
code for the project and then it became
a real larger open source project in
consensus-based and it attracted a
community and people did things and
releases and one day the founder decided
he wanted to do something different with
the software and that he was going to go
this direction and the whole community
went to go this direction but they were
afraid of angering him they felt like
you know he was the founder and they
sort of had kind of do what he did but
they really wanted to go this way and
they told him that and he threatened
them he said I'm going to veto
everything you do and prevent you from
doing a release because I'm going to you
know put my foot down and prevent them
from happening and they a couple of guys
talked to me like you know what do we do
I'm like you vote and you throw him out
I'm like let him if he wants to take his
toys in a certain direction that 10
other people don't want to go in well
you know it's great these as a founder
sure you have a lot of respect for him
but he's not showing respect for your
community he's come in decided that he
wants to take charge and if you have a
benevolent dictatorship of a community
that's one thing but if you're working
in a consensus-based environment where
everyone it's it's it's sort of where
there's no um if there's no one guy that
takes takes
because it just goes to show that a
poisonous person can suddenly appear
from within it doesn't have to be an
outsider coming into your community
somebody can go crazy that's one of the
reasons that we we both like consensus
based development because there's no one
who's working on the actual code that's
disenfranchised if everyone who's
writing the code has a say in direction
of the code as a whole then it you feel
like you have much more control over
your future yeah absolutely so every
consensus based community usually has
some kind of a voting system at least
written into their charter or how they
participate in this is this I think
what's really started was Apache was the
first major set of organ of projects to
do this and a lot of people will look at
this and say oh well we should just vote
on everything right and that is not a
good idea either a really healthy
community if you're having healthy
discussions you are coming to
resolutions relatively easy on easily on
most subjects if you find yourself
voting on everything all the time
something is wrong and you need to be a
little more introspective voting means
there's a winner no loser voting means
is a winner exactly I mean people need
to learn to make compromises and
hopefully you are bringing people in
your community who are the kind of
people who like to make compromises and
are willing to deal with that if you're
voting then you have a very strange
culture I suppose and it's certainly in
the subversion project I think the we
were going for what maybe four or five
years before we had our first actual
vote we actually really all sat down
took tallies and was very very careful
about counting who was on what side and
this really really critical decision we
had to make was how to format our source
code whether to put spaces before
parentheses or not people were very very
passionate about this but if that's the
only vote you ever have then you know
you're in good shape right so I just I
find it humorous that that was our one
big vote weak emitters comes out it
coming out of the woodwork we hadn't
seen been like emailed one guy we hadn't
committed subversion a year or so and
said oh my god come you have to vote for
this they came in and voted against bed
so I was yeah they were partly was
politicking definitely so um all right
let's talk about
how do notice people usually it's
obvious it's not always obvious this
phrase beause of it is what fit says if
he's reading a mailing list and it
becomes obvious that somebody we're
talking with is really just going to
suck and drain our time and we're never
going to get anywhere he just says I
flipped the bows a bit and just stops
responding to the thread now I have to
say this was a bad cop it's a great
explainer I'm the bad cop and Ben's the
good cop I read two males from God my
guard this guy's a bozo and Penn psycho
come on no we have to email him in yeah
he's good and and it's it's a it's
important to be tolerant because this
guy who shows up and seems to be a bozo
on his first or first one or two emails
you might just be engaging you and it
could turn out to be a very valuable
committer and that has happened in the
past
so I think it's good to have a bit of
both bad and good cops in your community
right people screaming when to watch out
for problems but then other people who
are willing to go a little farther and
tolerating and I think skin helps to fix
skin so here's some really obvious ways
to tell that somebody might be not worth
your time and the first the first
telltale signs you'll see in the way
they communicate right you'll see that
their email address is like like crazy
Jo 53 woo or some I mean it's just like
what and then you know they join IRC and
they have a completely different
ridiculous nickname and you don't even
realize it's the same person yes I just
said that capital letters you know all
this you've seen this before so just be
careful of these folks this is a this is
a pretty this gives a spam score that's
pretty high yeah exactly
go ahead Fitz some people again I talked
about engaging the community some of
might show up and not be able to pick up
in the mood for example if we are in the
final crunch to release we were in the
final crunch to release for want to
version 1.0 and people are trying our
best to focus on you know getting our
release I mean subversion did take four
years to get with a 1.0 granted our 1.0
is like you know five point six for some
software it's version control you lose
people's data they're not coming back
be very careful um yes so so we had
people somebody come in we're like in
this last crunch like I think you should
completely rewrite your back-end
from scratch like it's great why don't
you come back tomorrow so if they just
obviously don't understand they don't
see a pickup on the tone you don't Steve
see the what you're doing they ask a lot
of questions that they could be looking
up and that that shows an impedance
mismatch but it also shows an it could
be an indication of a lack of respect
for other people's time mm-hmm so
sometimes you see people who are openly
hostile these happen they're not as
common as you think but it does happen
they'll come in and say this project is
ridiculous it's the worst thing I've
ever seen I can't believe you guys are
doing XYZ you did it all wrong are you
getting it you know as well we did yeah
we did have somebody submit a patch once
and he didn't like the way he used
malloc and free for those of you RC
programmers and we were using memory
pools and we said you'll have to rewrite
this using the memory system we're using
and he this is so stupid I'm not going
to do this and let walked away oh okay
fine I guess
I guess it wasn't a good match for our
community anyway but sometimes you'll
see people who are or have a sense of
entitlement they'll come in and say well
I'm going to write this feature and I
demand that you help me right now and
what is wrong with this thing and what's
wrong why isn't this working for me tell
me now now now now again disrespecting
people's time bad attitude
blackmail sometimes people will come to
the community and say well I like your
project but it doesn't have this feature
so unless you add this feature I'm not
going to have my fortune 500 company use
it or I was going to contribute ten of
my best developers to work on it but you
know it's not the way we like it so you
too you lose I mean there's nothing you
can do about that again once again you
think about the long term and not the
short term what is the direction you
want for your project what is what do
you want your community to be like don't
let people blackmail or hijack those
long term goals from you yeah it's easy
sometimes you can see people are just
trolling just trying to get your your
rile you up and you need to ignore that
and then this is my favorite you'll
actually see if somebody gets identified
as a poisonous person and the community
just starts to sort of ignore the person
hoping they'll go away
one of the first reactions you'll see is
that you know it's a cabal and obviously
the small group of people has hijacked
the project because they're not
interacting with me anymore and they'll
make wonderful conspiracy accusations
and it's amusing it's also very sad but
but yeah be on the lookout for that
go ahead all right so so you do wind up
with a lot of conceited developers who
aren't going to acknowledge the opinions
of other people you know I've been doing
this for so many years and this and that
and I clearly understand more about it
than you do and you know your opinions
are great but you don't matter and
they're going to make sweeping claims
about the products he said this is my
favorite they're like you know if
subversion integrates with ant it would
take over the world you know and we're
like yeah that's great come back
tomorrow that they'll start to pull open
these topics that you've gone over years
ago and whatnot and basically you've got
to put into the archives because they
haven't read through the archives and
that's understandable what someone
hasn't necessarily read your archives
but when you point them in the archives
and they come back me see yeah but no
it's different loud loud and I've got
cold fusion and you know again it's it's
a matter of having the strength to of
your canoe community to to not be so
desperate for people that you could say
my community and art the goal our values
are more important than this other you
know warm or semi warm body in some
cases might be good keep going nice nice
so a lot of people are willing to
complain and not help fix these are the
talkers and not the doers these people
you have to ignore has to leave or make
them made understand that this is a
development list and this is not a group
therapy session some people just want to
some case I sort of want to be heard
especially if there's a real bug in
question in that case that's that's a
role of working people into the issue
tracker and that sort of thing and
letting them know they're heard but um
if they're going to cut you know go
ahead and complain or they want to they
want to go off and write a whole pile of
code by themselves because everybody
likes to code but who wants to sit down
and discuss a design with the people
who've been working the product you
might have to argue at someone and so
yeah you want to argue that god you know
whatever I'm going to go off and write
this code and I'll come back and I'll
I'll let you see it when I'm done you
know and that's great I'll be glad to
like you know press the Delete key when
you're done because you haven't taken
the time to talk to us about Ben and I
we were at the locking feature for
subversion we easily spent twice as much
I'm designing the two parts of the
locking feature than we did coding it
because we there's a lot of discussion
to go went into what exactly it was and
why it was there and what it would do
that's always usually the harder part is
coming up with the design than the code
yeah and it takes a lot of communication
and communication skills are key import
so the people who tend to complain a lot
but not actually do anything are our
usual response to them
it's patches welcome that just which is
a common phrase you might hear in the
open source world it's the open source
way of saying go screw yourself well if
you don't like the person yeah so if
they come back with a patch that's great
but usually they'll just either put up
or shut up and they will go away
it depends okay if you're going to be
kind you would say hey could you write a
patch for that right and then if
you're--if tied with it you'll say
patches welcome in quote so that's
usually go away sign so yeah people are
so they're not thick-skinned you'll run
into these people and these people are
never going to survive an open source in
general I don't know how to help them
other than to say learn to divorce
yourself from the argumentation it's
your opinion is valid but it's you know
not the only opinion out there and it's
not all personal and those people tend
to not function well so tell you what
disinfecting your community what happens
if somebody's already in your community
and you need to deal with this problem
they're disrupting your attention and
focus all right so assess the damage so
the two questions you need to ask
yourself is how are they affecting your
attention and focus at some point you
start questioning and you say look you
know we've spent a lot of time arguing
with this person they might be a member
of the community there might be a new
person to the community but at some
point your hand wonder and say is this
going to terminate doesn't seem like
this process is going determine is it
going to help the project in the long
term and often you'll be sort of
surprised and say you know what this
could go on forever and it's hard to
step back and sometimes we need to kick
each other and say look you know you're
wasting your time talking to this person
you used to throw objects at me if I
spent too long talking to certain people
and the other question is you know are
they actually distracting the project
right now like
are you falling behind in the forward
momentum of your project because of this
one or two people these aren't questions
that you always ask yourself you know
usually you're so caught up in the
discussion you don't step back and
notice but take a look at it it's um
it's important then so don't think so
our first list of things is not to do as
part of your open-source project you
don't want to feed the energy creature
somebody comes up and they're looking
for a fight and all you got to do is
take a swing at them and it's on you
know so the first thing you do is you
just ignore them if someone's obviously
trolling you ignore them if they're
trolling and have something valuable to
say then you know it's great concentrate
on what they're saying that's valuable
ignore the other thing you don't want to
give these jerks a gripping surface
basically because that's what they're
looking for so don't engage them on that
don't get emotional stick to the facts
all right our first exam in the first
example that I ran into we were very far
along in subversion and somebody
appeared on the list and basically gave
us a very long lecture about how our
entire design and goals were completely
wrong
and we should start over and follow his
lead and and it wasn't done in a way
that you were like this is a crackpot I
mean he actually had some real
argumentation going on in there was a
crackpot well it turned out to be a
crackpot later but we didn't know that
but it looked like some very serious
discussion questioning the whole
foundation of the project and this was
you know very far into the project so I
and a couple other people I know got
very emotional and started responding
you know extremely emotionally getting
very into it disrupted I lost two or
three days of work you know just arguing
with this person and it got really
upsetting and ultimately all we could do
is in the end we just had to sort of
walk away from the discussion because we
knew we weren't going to budge no one
you did he was draining he lost the way
as well he walked away as well that's
right so be careful don't don't let the
emotional drain paralyze you good things
you should do good yeah good cop so pay
attention to newcomers sometimes people
come to lists and they look like trolls
and in fact if you look carefully it's
sometimes it's just a language barrier
maybe they're not speaking English as
their native language
times there's just a little bit of
miscommunication that's not going on and
you need to give them a benefit of a
doubt or at least for a few exchanges
before you really say well this person
is a troll because you'll find out that
sometimes well they'll actually have
useful things to tell you if it's a very
emotional email that comes into your
list or your IRC channel try to ignore
the emotion and say what is this person
really getting at you know maybe they
found a bug but they're so upset you
know it's hard to see that their report
really reporting a bug here or some new
use case you haven't thought of already
so what is the example here of our
raving lunatic all right so so we had
everything that I could show up on our
list one day accusing us of not knowing
how to write code of how could we
possibly ship a product that has a bug
like this and we're just a bunch of
complete losers shame on us and shame on
you you know and this person was
actually pretty well known in the
open-source community and some of us had
respect for this person up to this point
some of us didn't but they actually had
a valid bug and I was so proud because I
came into this a day late and I the
first response is from another
subversion developer saying you know I
think you're right on this bug here I
think this is where it's going like this
and you know I think we can address this
by this I've opened an issue and we're
going to track this and the person came
back with more vitriol well you
shouldn't have shipped this in the first
place and how could you possibly have
not seen as you losers all bile in all
commerce in and I did this and this
happened and then the person other
person responded okay so this happened
that what it looks like happening is
it's a mismatch with this version bla
bla bla completely calm and I've written
a patch for it and I'm going to review
it and see if this is it and then the
person came back with more stupidity and
but yeah but what was great here was so
great to watch this in action you know
one half of the conversation just
outlandish insane emotional anger and
then all the responses from our
community just being extremely calm and
quiet and rational and ignoring
everything it was fantastic and the guy
went away it had no effect on us so we
got a motor fix - yeah we got a bug
report we get it fixed and but he ended
up looking like the like the idiot
really
yeah yeah but he had a real bug so yeah
sometimes you do have to ignore I mean
it he won't always be able to extract a
bug report from the person or and what
I'm trying to write which example was
this 31.0 was this the uh rewrite no
yeah I think it was the rewrite yeah
this was the same rewrite it was the
same it wasn't another one of the same
guys the one who said we should start
over from scratch and follow his design
you ignored him and yet was ignoring him
and then sometimes they can be so awful
you you you have to forcibly boot them
from the community there was one person
who came to our mailing list who seemed
sort of like an eager student he was
very excited to participate in the
subversion project and he wanted to help
out and he had all these ideas and he
said I won't tell me which documents to
read he started reading all the
documents and then the strange thing
happened every hour he started posting
questions to the development mailing
list well how do I do this and have you
thought about this symbol and they were
all sort of well-intentioned questions
but and and he obviously had a respect
for us but I don't think he realized
that he was draining our attention
because he wanted essentially someone to
hold his hand and sort of walk him
through it and you know be a tutor and
nobody we were actually fell into it for
awhile we started saying oh look here
look here we were trying to be very very
nice because he was being so nice as
well and I think it was Fitz who noticed
maybe a couple weeks later maybe maybe
just a week later either I was I was I
was on a month a full month what did you
do what happened it was a full month
later I'm like you know god this guy's
just showing up all over the place so I
wrote a little program that went through
my mail spool for the last month and
picked out the top five posters and four
of those posters were committers and one
of those posters was this person and he
was the number two poster to our mailing
list and then I did a little further
investigation and over half of the
committee's posters were follow-ups to
this guy yeah so I I did a little bit of
politicking year and just because I
wanted to be sensitive and and see what
other people thought I said sent this
little these statistics out because
nothing beats hard data I said these
little statistics out to some other
committees I said look you know this
case really took a lot of time I think
that we should actually gently ask in
leave what do you think about this in my
off base and they took look at the
numbers and they're like oh yeah I think
I think it's time to take drastic
measures and karl karl fogel being like
the nicest person in the universe very
diplomatic very diplomatic spent like an
hour with this guy on the phone gently
asking him to you know just not stop
posting our mailing list and the guy
still didn't understand it it was sad I
mean he but he ended up leaving but he
didn't understand no matter how much we
explained he didn't understand he was
draining our attention yeah and keep
that what was the hardest one to do and
that's probably that's I think that's
the only person we've ever actually
asked directly asked well we did revoke
commit access once an early early has
but it was a long time ago say so
repeal trolls with niceness this is
another case sort of similar to the IRC
situation we described where some of the
email situation but this was an IRC
somebody just came into our IRC channel
where the developers hang out and I
think we said well I think this is
ridiculous I started using subversion
because I was forced to use it and I
think it's awful and this is terrible
and what's wrong with this build and be
yeah we could have built was it no
that's right he doesn't go and be a
Caesar I can't build I can't build this
isn't working
what's wrong with you guys and we know
the response of course was very very
helpful quiet oh well have you tried
this have you tried this and he's trying
to get a rise out of us it becomes
obvious after a little while that he's
trying to say things to just get us
angry and we're just completely ignoring
him and finally the last thing he says
was the quote you guys aren't gonna be
like fight I'm out of here I came here
to argue and really bizarre looking down
oh yeah what just happened but it
happened so what's our uh this is
summing it all up so remember to
preserve your attention and focus that's
what you are guarding that is the
long-term health of the project in the
community then you need to fortify your
community by having good community
practices pretty obvious we talked about
all those then you need to be on lookout
for people coming in and then if people
do get in don't be afraid to boot them
out or to stick up for your culture no
matter what the cost
um you need to be confident in that and
that pretty much sums it up however fits
well actually have a little bit of a
secret to tell
after all this we're talking about open
source and next slide my next slide so
this doesn't actually just apply to open
source communities this applies to any
community this applies to communities at
work that supplies to social communities
the church group your church group your
knitting circle whatever the case might
be and you know it's so it's sort of
like we we gave this talk earlier this
year to the Summer of Code mentors
summit where all that some google Summer
of Code mentors came in and it was like
this huge group therapy hoedown because
we're like and then we had this jerk
that did this and like 10 people know
night circle I know that guy you're
talking about we had him show up at our
community and do the same thing but we
had someone like that you know so the
sort of thing that applies to me and you
can look for these these kind of
people's in your everyday work or
anywhere yeah absolutely so I think
that's it for our slides but we do have
time for questions and answers if people
want to talk about you have answers we'd
love to hear them yeah I'll answer any
googles in the audience to keep things
non-google specific since this is an
open-source talk to the public yeah all
right there is that mic on back there No
okay we'll repeat your question
I imagine that the archives are huge so
so the question is is you know how do
you tip how do you tell someone to read
the archives when the archives are
gigantic and yeah well there's well so
how do you read yeah when someone needs
to learn something but you know how do
you tell them to be the archives your
archives are so big the first thing is
is that if you're going to point them to
a specific conversation give them a link
directly to that conversation the second
part of that is is that you have to
continue document in Lluis lead occupant
your project from day one to the present
day and so if there's something
important that happens like I said a
design decision a mistake or some
something has changed in your community
you need to document that the subversion
hacking document as it's called started
off is about I don't know three pages
long but was about how to contribute
some patches like 70 pages long I mean
it's an HTML document that goes from
here to New York and it's pretty it's
pretty big
but it describes a lot of things that
describes a lot of how to participate in
the community how to contribute patches
what we expect the patches to look like
how to participate in email conversation
etiquette right I mean and we also in
talks about a release procedure - yeah
tell me - about all that but we've also
got various design Doc's sprinkled
throughout our codes very is a commented
in great detail and not to take too much
cred but Ben and I are two of the three
authors of the main subversion book
which is free to me it's the main
project documentation you can purchase a
tree we're version of it but it's free
and it's very detailed and Ben started
it actually and that is it one of the
things that helped us a lot not only to
avoid repeating questions but to gaining
market share in the first place because
people would come and say oh there's be
a software if it was just awesome Docs
if you're well documented then 99% of
the time when somebody asks for help
there will be a really relevant link you
can give to them and if that's not the
case then you know what needs to be
written right so
which one's going to be a detriment
but what you mean you mean the you're
saying of the four things will sit on
the slides which one is going to be the
detriment of riser FS I'm not really
give me this or the you know the respect
humility not respect humility no no what
oh oh right no that guy so there's a
poisonous person no that's good
I know he's talking about yeah he had
lack of respect for people
what about project management
so the question was what do you think
about having a project manager who just
sort of manages the community and
doesn't do any code and interestingly I
worked in my last job basically five
years being paid to work on subversion
and it started out almost entirely
coding and by the time I got to the last
couple years I was spending about sixty
percent of my time doing community
management forty percent of my time
coding and that's just what it took to
keep the project healthy and functioning
so you'll find you I've never heard of a
project that actually has explicit
community managers but what you'll find
is in healthy projects maybe open up we
hear Open Office does but it's rather
unusual usually will happen is certain
members of the community who are also
very good coders will sort of fall into
the role of also being police and in
preservers of culture and tone and karl
fogel is especially good at that right
and non coders typically wind up doing
things to sort of serve the needs of the
project as a whole as opposed to setting
direction open-source projects are
notoriously bottoms-up
and direction is set by the people
writing the code and I think that's one
of the things that I find very appealing
about open-source you need to have a lot
of respect and credit already to be
culture police so I don't think it's the
simple case of saying hey you over here
why don't you monitor our our lists that
person needs to be a pretty
well-respected member of the community
already and if they decide to do that on
their own that's great but it's
different than sort of saying hey why
don't you over there manage our patches
and make sure we don't ignore any
patches that come through which is a
very technical job and you don't need a
lot of respect for that sure any other
questions damp tea
look at jobs
this is significant
so the question is how do you see how
open source communities function I guess
versus a closed source within
corporations right don't you I think it
depends vastly on the company you know
Google is a very bottom-up company and I
think I I think it works a lot like
open-source communities do which is
unusual which is extremely unusual so I
think a lot of it depends on on the
company culture and the founders and a
whole lot of other different things
I think I'm from listen what I've seen
on many corporations are very much the
opposite they're very tops down nobody
knows what anyone else is working on all
the not necessarily you have decisions
being made at the highest level and they
trickle down and there isn't really a
sense of community in the same way that
you see in an open-source community and
so as a result a lot of these
dysfunctions will sort of creep in
you'll see people establishing fiefdom
Shover certain areas of code you'll see
people fighting with each other sort of
maybe in a passive aggressive way when
they should be collaborating so it you
know that's something that corporations
need to watch out for culture of trust
is hard to get to yes
so the question is how much do you need
to meet in person to have deep design
discussions and general discussions
about your project you don't really need
to meet at all but it's going to be some
it's going to take a lot more time if
you don't meet at all it's a question of
bandwidth I think right I mean email is
pretty low bandwidth IRC is better
bandwidth telephones even better being
face to face is best yet and I think
what a common pattern you'll see is a
lot of open source projects start out
with maybe just two or three people in
the same room coming up with a design
and a set of goals and a mission and
whatnot then they go off to the internet
and once that ball gets rolling it's
easier to add people in because the
bandwidth it needed isn't as high
anymore a lot of designs issues have
already been made but that's common this
common developers didn't have a
face-to-face meeting until last year
that was the first like some element of
all the developers we had you know the
collabnet employees that with the four
of us shared an office in Chicago and
you know we did discussions offline and
whatnot but we always brought our made
decisions offline decisions were always
made in the mailing list because it's
not fair to developers in different time
zones in in different places that sort
of thing that is that it's a cult that's
one of the things one of the rules or at
least of our of our community is that
you can talk all you want
face to face or an IRC but it's not an
official discussion until it happens on
the mailing list because we want to
include everybody and that's where
decisions were always made so we would
have these meetings at face to face in
our office and then usually Ben or Karl
would do this long right up to the list
of what we discussed and then the
discussion would start in earnest there
and then decisions will be made there
with the rest of our committers present
because and the one thing now I didn't
work for CollabNet until four years in
2004 even though I was a committer since
almost since the beginning of subversion
and one of the things that they did
right was that they submit they've had
four people they paid full times four
plus people they played full time to
work on subversion but these people
never had a magical trump card that said
you know we're going to do this it was
always a consensus based consensus
driven development and that certainly
came up with some they came up with
different things and you guys would have
gone with yeah
where there was the consensus of the
committee was more important than the
fact that the corporation happened to be
paying people to work on it which is
it's a hard tension to balance
I remember we hired somebody to a fifth
person to work on we hired Mike pelota
to work to work for our company hired
him to work on subversion just like the
rest of us and you know his first days I
mean what do you mean I can't submit
code you know well like well you have to
you know the work community has to vote
you in you have to prove that you know
what's going on and he was sort of
stunned since he was being paid to work
on this he had the early dissent packet
and he had to get just like anyone else
he had to earn trust from everyone you
know his employer was irrelevant yeah
with other questions Oh another question
