privacy before Peter starts talking here
I just wanted to take a moment to
introduce you to Peter Peter is it's
very hard to give Peter and introduction
because he's done so many great things
in his life I know him as a friend I met
him at google.org where we had a chance
to work together and we had we were
working on a project called instead to
do some early detection of all sorts of
bad things including diseases and trying
to help with a collaboration with Google
org to go prevent those things but Peter
is particularly positioned well to talk
about privacy because of his background
not just that instead in Google org but
because of his previous life he has
quite a depth of experience with the
pharmaceutical industry and the
challenges that the pharmaceutical
industry went through in communicating
to its customers and and what happened
when they got that wrong and then
eventually what happened when they got
that right and so I asked Peter to come
in and talk with us about the learnings
from the pharmaceutical industry and so
that we can just absorb those and maybe
apply those across our portfolio of
products so with that let me just turn
it over to Peter thank you Peter thank
you very well it's pleasure being here
and I know I'm being recorded and so
that in addition to the people in this
room hopefully other people will have
the chance to look at this talk at their
leisure the issue here is to try to
describe to you first a very difficult
experience that we had within the
pharmaceutical industry and then to try
to generalize from that experience to
what I see is the google challenge and
let me begin by also thanking Matt
Waddell for helping sensitize me to the
fact that you people are already doing a
lot of things some of which I may not be
aware of so as I speak if I make
suggestions which are things that you
implemented two or three weeks ago but
we just haven't seen yet don't hesitate
to let me know I don't mind being
corrected and I don't mind being proven
wrong
see okay this all occurred in the 1980s
at company called alza which was the
world's first drug delivery company and
it's the company that used to be your
neighbor right here on shoreline
shoreline park area at the time we were
based in palo alto and what we were
trying to do is totally change the way
that drugs were delivered into the human
body instead of having drugs given in a
pill two or three times a day what we
wanted to do was to create delivery
systems that delivered that drug at a
constant rate over a long period of time
and the first two products that we
developed were proof-of-concept products
the ocular which was a device which was
put in the eye which delivered
pilocarpine for a week and the second
one was the pro just assert which was an
intruder encontro septic system which
used the female hormone progesterone and
achieved a year's worth of contraception
for the same amount using the same
amount of drug as you would take in one
oral contraceptive pill and it did that
by delivering it to target Oregon and
doing it in very many quantities at a
constant rate many of you have perhaps
been exposed to transdermal patches
those all came from Al so that was all
technology that we developed and we
basically were the beginning of a very
large industry and later on we required
for a lot of money by J&amp;amp;J and now have
disappeared from from the scene but the
work that we did remains today and had a
profound impact on the pharmaceutical
industry however in the early days we
were still trying to prove what we were
doing and actually alsa went for 13
years before it was profitable so this
is an incredibly difficult time both for
fundraising and also to convince the
people in the pharmaceutical industry
that this approach made sense and we had
a lot riding on these 2 proof-of-concept
products the ocular and the pro just
assert well after we have developed a
pro just assert and taking it through
all of its testing and gotten FDA
approval suddenly one of the existing
products in the market
place which was called the doc on shield
ran into incredible difficulties because
it was a poorly designed be poorly
marketed and see the corporation which
was marketing it behaved in an extremely
inappropriate manner and this is
documented in great detail for those of
you who would like to read a horror
story in a book called at any cost
corporate greed women in the dark on
shield by morton mints and morton mints
was one of the premier writers for the
washington post and somebody who was a
constant and very harsh critic of the
pharmaceutical industry and eh Robbins
was a company which was a
multi-generational company owned by
founded by the Robins family and it was
essentially destroyed by the way in
which they manage this product when
bankrupt tens of thousands of women were
severely impacted by this hundreds of
women's were killed by this product and
lo and behold here we had another IUD
well not only do we have another IUD but
the other companies that were in the
marketplace as soon as the doc on shield
disappeared they said hey this is a
marketplace we don't want to be in it's
just too risky and so suddenly we were
not only an IUD but we were the only IUD
that was left and and this was in our
opinion a recipe for disaster the
problem was we couldn't afford to take
one of our proof of one of our 2
proof-of-concept products off the
marketplace because we had to
demonstrate to our investors the
companies we were trying to adopt our
technology that this concept of
controlled drug delivery really worked
so what did we do then suddenly we were
alone in a very high risk very low
profit margin market niche we were not
no matter what happened with sales we
weren't going to make very much money
off of this thing and the risk of a
single lawsuit would dramatically
overwhelm the profit from even tens of
thousands of successful products so the
question that we had as a manager
team was how do we protect the company
how do we protect the product and how do
we protect the consumers the first thing
we did was consult widely and I've
learned a long time ago that I don't
learn very much from the people who
agree with me if I want to get insight
into a problem I have to search out my
critics and I have to sit down with the
people who I don't necessarily want to
talk to and who've not necessarily said
nice things about me or my industry or
my product and so we went to people like
Sid wolf who runs the health consumer
group works for with Ralph Nader we went
to morton mints who wrote the book on
aah robin situation that was a very
interesting interaction because here's
an active journalist and I went to him
and I said were the last iud in the
marketplace what should we do and he
said I don't give advice he said but I
will tell you the questions that I'm
going to ask you once you've made your
decision and it was incredible because I
just SAT there wrote down like for about
20 minutes he just basically said this
is the interview that you're going to
have when you've made your decision and
it was an incredible way to learn about
the problem from the perspective of
someone else and he basically said and
he said you know I've never had this
kind of conversation with someone in the
pharmaceutical industry before and I
don't think I ever will again we
realized that we came to the realization
that the way that we could deal with
this was to prevent harm to the women
and if we prevented harm to the women
then we could prevent harm to the
product into the company most people in
the pharmaceutical industry look at
malpractice as sort of a cost of doing
business and how much do they have to
set aside for malpractice suits etc etc
and until we started dealing with this
issue no one said wait a minute this is
something we can do proactively one of
the real problems in the pharmaceutical
industry is you take it through testing
with a very well defined group of people
they're all
very much the same age shape form and
the minute it's approved you have all
sorts of other people using it and
that's in classes of people who've never
been tested before and the marketing
people have a very different objective
than the medical people once you put it
in hands of marketing you're in deep
trouble because these people's job is to
sell and we tried to and we gradually
realized that one bad cell sale was
wiping out the value of tens of
thousands of good sales the other thing
we had to be willing to do was depart
from the norm of the industry the norm
of the industry was to do the absolute
minimum that was required by the FDA a
company would go to the FDA and say we
have this product we'd like to have it
approved and they wanted to negotiate
what was called the cleanest labeling in
the world no side effects no problems
well the minute you put a drug on the
market place you start getting side
effects and problems in that patient
labeling gets longer and longer and
longer the industry was always resisting
having the label get longer because they
saw that as a negative from a marketing
standpoint and didn't realize that the
better the labeling was in fact the
better the situation was for the company
one of the things that evolved out of
this was changing our priorities i
talked about how do we protect the
company the product and the consumers
and we realized we had it wrong it was
how do we protect the consumers and that
will protect the product and that will
protect the company and changing that
perspective was very crucial to the
decisions we then made we came up with
what's called informed choice labeling
we began down the road of looking at the
issue of informed consent which came out
of the Nuremberg trials and a variety of
other things it was a legal concept that
was imposed upon the medical community
but it was a legal concept which we
didn't think really solved the problem
because consent was something which was
perceived by consumers is something
which was done under duress and we moved
to
concept of informed choice we ended up
producing a document a patient package
insert the FDA required a three page
insert for IUDs ours was 12 pages long
this full disclosure and it stressed the
risk it began on the front page saying
you're about to make a decision which
could be potentially fatal you can
imagine what the marketing people
thought about that it ended on the last
page by saying you've now know
everything that we know about this
product and it's now up to you to make a
decision do you want to use the product
or not and that was an explicit choice
on the last page i have read this
information and i want to use this
product or i've read this information
i've decided not to use this product and
that then was a transaction not between
us and the woman but between the woman
and her physician and we had one very
prominent physician who said i'm not
going to do this takes too much of my
time and I said thank you very much we
will never sell you another product and
he said I'll sue you and I said tell me
when and where cuz I want the cameras
there and the important thing is that we
gave the patient every piece of
information we had about the product and
we constantly updated it and we gave
them the option to use or not use the
product based on their risk preference
and my risk preference in your wrist
preference are almost always different
almost always different and so we have
to really respect the individuals
preferences the progestin cert remained
on the market women were given both a
contraceptive option which they could or
could not use they were protected with
better information the labeling was
praised by the critics Syd wolf stood up
and said that he thought this was the
best labeling he'd ever seen morton
mints wrote an op-ed piece in The
Washington Post about what we had done
the pharmaceutical industry was stunned
to hear either Wolfer mints talk
positively about anything that's ever
happened in the pharmaceutical industry
i received a wonderful copy of Morton
Vince's book signed by Morton mints
thanking us for what we had done the FDA
challenged the labeling said you can't
do that you don't have our permission
and we say we don't need your permission
the law says that we can increase
warnings anytime we want to and one year
later they came back and said your new
labeling is approved except on page six
where you've described the devices small
you have to give its metric dimensions
there was no litigation from that point
forward and an otherwise litigation
filled niche and that was primarily
because the women who should not use
this product because they have they were
contraindicated they had multiple sexual
partners that'd history of pelvic
inflammatory disease they had
compromised immune systems we said to
those women don't use this product and
so the way we go got rid of the
malpractice problem was getting rid of
the harm we got rid of the harm by
making sure that the wrong women did not
use this product and most importantly
that alza then proceeded to establish a
new standard with scores of other
innovative products our 2
proof-of-concept products remained in
the marketplace they proved what control
drug delivery could do and out of that
then hundreds of other products came in
different forms and shapes your
customers trust Google with lots of
their personal information identity
location intellectual interest medical
information and much more as Vic is
commented earlier you know I'm not sure
I want anybody to look through my search
history I set up my firefox though when
I close it it clears the history a
little bit paranoid but the fact of the
matter is that that history is out there
someplace else in I don't have the
option of clearing what are the
implications of informed choice for
google you've been created a
credibly valuable brand and I know that
all of you that are part of this
organization are incredibly proud to be
part of this organization but you also
know and appreciate the fact that there
are lots of people out there who just
think the world of you this is an
organization that is held in very high
respect people believe that you will do
no evil however that brand and that
trust are very fragile and i believe
it's therefore important for you to work
much much harder to trust your customers
now what do i mean by that your current
practice and again i'm very thankful for
Matt for saying hey Peter go look at
what we're doing before you get critical
about it you inform your customers about
how you use and protect our information
yep I have talked to hundreds of Google
customers since I started since Nick
asked me to prepare this presentation
and virtually none of them are at all
familiar with what is in your privacy
policy it's there and it covers a
certain number of things but people
don't look at it it's not something
which people engage with one of the
things we found when we did the pro just
assert patient package labeling on those
12 pages it's very interactive through
about 15 or 20 questions that have to be
answered yes or no their boxes that have
to be checked their places that have to
be initialed we had to engage the women
to make sure that they in fact read the
information and we tested that and we
knew that unless there was a high degree
of interactivity people would simply go
to the last page and just sign a name
and it wouldn't mean anything and while
that may have satisfied the lawyers it
wouldn't have accomplished what we
wanted to accomplish which was to make
sure that women who shouldn't use the
product didn't use the product your
current policy is as I read it one size
fits all all or nothing take or leave it
assume consent policy there's a line in
there that says hey if you don't want us
to give this information then you know
we may not be able to do very much for
you you have fulfilled your
responsibility there is no doubt about
that
but you have not maximized your
opportunity you as the preeminent
organization in the world in this field
have the opportunity to do something
which is truly unique and let's talk a
little bit about what you might think
about doing offer your customers varying
degrees of privacy and protection in
return for varying degrees of quality of
searching and services the more
information I'm willing to share with
you and to leave with you the better job
you can do of helping me make my next
decision if on the other hand I is an
individual have a different sense of
privacy and I don't want to leave you
with information allow me the privilege
of saying okay you'll use this
information during this particular
session but at the end of the session
the information is going to be wiped out
now i know that amazon for example has
got tons of information about my reading
habits and it's fascinating because a
few years ago we have a home in England
and lots of nieces and nephews there and
I and it's out in the country and so
what I wanted to do is to create a
library for the children so they had
some place to go and read and so I spent
about three weeks populating this
library by going to Amazon us and Amazon
UK and other places and buying all these
children's books and for the next six
months all my recommendations throughout
from my Amazon we run children's books
and now that's sort of washed out and
now they're moving on to other things
Amazon's an organization which I think
does a horrible job of protecting my
privacy because they've given they taken
tons of information from me one time
many many years ago when I first began
interacting with the company they asked
my permission they'd never asked my
permission since they continue to
collect this information if someone went
in there with a search warrant the
amount of information would be available
be incredible and one of these days I
think someone's going to get into a
great deal of trouble at amazon by
virtue of this information which they
have
with only the very tacit consent to the
people from whom they've collected it
now once you offer people this variety
of choices then let them say okay it's
really important to me to get good
information from you google and in
exchange for really high quality
information that really meets my needs I
am prepared to authorize you to retain
my search histories for six months 12
months a year I'm authorized you to
retain my locations for those periods of
time create a dialogue between yourself
and each individual customer what are
the payoffs well okay and before I get
the lot let me just say that this
morning I said okay I'm going to just do
a quick scan what are some of the issues
out there well Forbes magazine today has
got an article on getting letting Google
take your pulse talking about your
medical records thing the Center for
Digital democracy comments they give
consumers the appearance of an effective
way to keep their health information but
it's also digital gold mine for health
marketing it's one thing to turn your
search your queries over to Google this
is making them your next of kin today
again in pc world spy on your workers
with google latitude there is a and the
moment you get to the EU the sensitivity
particularly if governments is
dramatically greater than it here is
here in the united states i predict that
there will in fact be an explosion of
concern when abuses occur and those
abuses will occur either because of a
mistake on the part of google or because
you get a court order that requires you
to turn over information Google Latitude
maybe you're absolutely wonderful thing
if somebody wants to go into to
contested divorce situation
how do you protect against that and and
do your consumers know that that
information will in fact be subject to
disclosure in the event there's a court
order so by moving to this informed
choice policy where you could offer
people the alternative you're showing
greater respect for your individual
customers you're creating a bond with
each of those customers because they now
have a relationship with you for example
with Amazon I don't just buy books from
amazon I bought lots of other things
from Amazon because I trust amazon and
because they've already got my credit
card and they have my address and it's
very convenient to do I similarly do
lots of things with Google I would do
many more things with Google if I was
able to fine tune my relationship with
google it will also allow you to defend
ibly acquire a great deal more
information from that subset of people
who are willing to do it and I would
suggest that there's a real generational
issue here those of us who are older
tend to be a little bit more sensitive
about some of these privacy issues when
you get down to the Facebook and the
Twitter generation there doesn't seem to
be any concern about sharing information
with other people until maybe you later
go get a job and somebody starts looking
at your facebook entries or looking at
some of your other records so there's a
generational issue and it's also real
challenge for those of you google where
the average age is relatively low and
recognize that if you want to reach out
to those of us who are more ancient that
we probably have a different privacy
profile preference than you do as you're
able to show people that there's a
payoff from sharing more information
other customers will in fact trade up
and say okay if I can get better quality
searches if I can get better services
i'm prepared to give more information
you will be able to this will also be a
great gold mine for you in terms of
legitimately tracking what your
customers are doing because you'll be
doing it with their consent it
differentiates Google's from other
providers it says you know we are not we
don't treat our customers
one-size-fits-all what we try to do is
accommodate the needs of each individual
I continue to be impressed not a week
goes by that I don't pick up you know
another Google product coming to the
marketplace this organization is
incredibly productive I would just
encourage you to recognize that each one
of those products needs to be tailored
to the customers you're trying to reach
and having a privacy policy for
searching being the same as for latitude
doesn't make a whole lot of sense
because it's too terribly different
kinds of behavior and you ought to allow
people to say okay and latitude I'll do
this when I use search I'll do this when
i do my health records i'll do this you
have enough computers and enough memory
to keep track of my preferences it's not
a big issue and it will dramatically
change the relationship that I have with
you and I think it will also set a very
new and higher hurdle for your
competitors the first company like
Google that does this is going to be in
the catbird seat because first your be
saying to your customers that you really
care about protecting their privacy and
you're prepared to negotiate with them
as to what what is an appropriate level
of privacy and second you're going to
set up the mechanics we're doing this in
a way that only Google can do it I mean
I never cease to be amazed at what
you're able to accomplish technically in
this company and if you put your minds
to work on creating and informed choice
matrix for all of your products for each
of your customers it's really going to
be exciting and also it's going to be
exciting to see how people vote with
their feet which people vote for what
levels of privacy with each product and
that will give you some very interesting
feedback in terms of
people feel about those products and
their comfort level I also think it's
going to protect you from outrage and
regulatory actions and there will be
outraged and there will be regulatory
actions you are in a very young industry
and you look at the EU which is well
ahead of them from the United States on
information control you look at what
happens to the United States with other
kinds of things like pharmaceutical
products good intentions are followed by
abuse which is followed by regulation
and I've been a regulator and I've been
in industry and i'll tell you the best
way to do with regulation is to get out
in front of it the last thing you want
to do is to have the government telling
you how to do your business the best way
to keep the government from telling you
how to do your business is to do no harm
the best way to do no harm do no evil is
to have a better relationship with your
customers and I just I had some copies
of the progesterone in certain cases
were questions about it basically that's
my pitch and I would wonder why we
please to take questions and to be
challenged
folks are afraid of putting more check
boxes and information between the user
have you thought about I see you as a
very popular juicer see you is being
very willing to for example begin
interacting with product being happy to
go through informed choice matrix but I
see a lot of other people potentially
looking at that and seeing i'm not sure
what to make of this is this something
that i should or shouldn't deal with you
know what I'm just not going to think
the it's a great question and I think
the one of the question was how to deal
with the fact that there that one of the
nice things about the google experience
is that it's a very simple experience
and it doesn't have a lot of things to
check it cetera and it happens very
quickly and i think that that's a great
observation and i think that the way one
might deal with that is to come up with
with varying degrees of granularity of
the process that I've described and
somewhat stereotypically you could have
a model for 18 year olds which said yeah
I understand all this stuff and I agree
that you can have anything you want and
I really don't care and so it's one
checkbox for the 18 year old who really
doesn't care but you put in real bold
letters above that you know you are in
fact giving us a lot of information
which is very private very personal and
you should realize that there are risks
associated with this and if you want to
know more about it go to this page if
you want to just proceed just check the
box you know you can't force people to
read stuff that they don't want to read
and then you can say to people who want
to engage in more granularity you can do
it by for example you could have sweets
of Google products once we're basically
people are seeking information and say
on the information products this is the
way I want to behave on the
transactional sweet this is the way I
want to behave on other kinds of
programs this is the way I want to
behave or you could say to people okay
you just tell us ahead of time the first
time you log in to Google Alerts the
first time you log in to latitude you
want to have the opportunity to set your
own individual preferences and you could
even say the first time you logged in
hey I'm really too busy to do it now
remind me to do it later but give them
the opportunity give your customer your
consumer that choice to be more detailed
about their their preferences you will
get good data in terms of you know how
many people go to the fine grain and how
many people just do at the sweet level
and how many people do a global
permission and I'm not and again one of
my criticisms is right now it's one size
fits all I don't want to go in the other
direction and say everybody's got to go
through 55 questions to use a single
product I think that they're intelligent
responses that can cover the whole
spectrum yes sir
that comes from the definition of public
originally derived by newspapers and
something that there is one public but
what we have now is lots of separate
public we want to share with models for
that yet i doing computation or in sort
of many perception people have this idea
it might show this with my friends yeah
the question goes to what's the what's
the boundary condition between what's
public and what's private and you know i
have i've had some fascinating
interactions my my much younger
daughter-in-law got me onto facebook and
so not a whole lot of people my age on
facebook and it's been a fascinating
transaction and and i read this one
comment from somebody that saying you
know well i posted that on facebook but
it was personal you shouldn't be reading
it so there was no recognition on the
part of the person and put it on
facebook that what they put on facebook
is in fact available to everybody rather
than just to their friends and so I
think you and we your customers need to
find ways that we begin to better
differentiate the public in the private
space yes and and so it's a big huge
Venn diagram and it's not just public
and private it is public total public
private totally private and then
gradations in between in terms of here's
my family here's my friends at school
etc etc that is also dimension which I
think would be incredibly powerful right
now a lot of these social networking
kinds of things don't have good boundary
conditions set in them and they don't
have ways of putting in good boundary
conditions and that's the kind of thing
that I think could be an incredible
incredible competitive tool for Google
where you say to people you can set your
boundary conditions for your information
either it's totally public it's totally
private or it's someplace in between
and you know I would just love to have
all the incredible talent in this
organization thinking about the ways to
do that because you would come up with
some beautiful solutions to it and going
back to the previous question people
could take a very simple model and say I
want to use the simple model or people
