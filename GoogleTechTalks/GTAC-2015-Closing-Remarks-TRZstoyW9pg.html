back 2015 except for a little bit more
talking by me I still have a voice so
you're still stuck with me so tonight
just a reminder that we are having a
happy hour right after I'm done talking
so I will try and keep this short but
mom's not always brief and it will be
just outside of Boston Commons so let's
go have a little more fun also I would
like to make a big round of thank-yous
right now thank you to the GTECH
organizing committee who has been
working for months to make this all
happen and bring you all here and get
the speaker's ready to go and deal with
all the logistics of planning a
conference so thank you gtalk organizing
committee if you're in the room please
stand up we'd also like to thank Google
Cambridge facilities who has been
awesome and providing us support for
this event again without them we could
never have made all this happen because
we lowly engineers just do not have that
much power in addition the AV team here
has been magical thank you so much to
the AV team as well as our transit
transcriptionists on the cart team so a
big round of applause for those guys as
well
the food was good so thank you catering
and thank you to YouTube who happened to
sponsor this this year for us we rotate
through which group within google pays
so thanks for paying for our food
youtube thank you to anyone of the
Cambridge Googlers who came and gave
tours yesterday or today to all the
non-google folks it was great seeing the
office and thanks again to Google
recruiting for hosting the casino night
last night with the food the drinks the
poker the decks of cards all of that so
thanks google recruiting and last but
not least thanks mom so mom was still
watching she's been doing a lot of
crafting it's raining where she lives so
she's stuck inside she can't even go
outside and take a walk so here's what
mom had to say about today nest seems
like something you'd have although you
all you'd get would be sorry running
around if you had the camera and I
didn't understand that bit on security
testing it's a security system so okay
yeah mom maybe my dog would take up the
camera but we'd see how it would go kind
of funny to see it from her point of
view because the testing part was a bit
interesting for her to grasp like how do
you test this stuff
my personal favorite from the night well
that talk was over man I know she
probably went and did other things and
was like off enjoying some other part of
her house when she was like yep I'm
peace out sorry for the line wrap I
can't believe how often Netflix changes
I don't notice it so this experimental
ramped up their using must work pretty
well but this canary he talked about
wasn't a bird I just don't know what it
was exactly mom I'll explain to you what
a canary is over Thanksgiving it's not
the bird we're eating then I'll tell you
where the word comes from though is that
Waterloo guy finding bugs and code
without even running it yes mam he is
and with that being said mom's leaving
and we've got to wait until spring 2017
until we can join you again we are
moving RG tax cycle this is big for us
we don't know where it will be we don't
know exactly when it will be we are
being conscious of holidays and academic
schedules etc but the next gtech will be
in spring 2017 so I'm sorry to say will
not see you all in 2016 I may see some
of you but for more information please
stay tuned to our blog google testing
blogspot com that is the way that every
gtech announcement actually is first
posted so for people who didn't see
announcements until later stay tuned to
that and that is your one-stop shop and
with that being said maybe ah one of my
slides didn't get loaded but that's okay
I know what it said it's really easy for
me to repeat you don't have to load a
Davey you're good
with that being said we want to make our
next gtech even better than this one so
we will be sending out a post gee tac
poll and survey to all of you please
take the time to respond we actually do
take that into account when we are
planning gtech things like having an
external person on our speaker selection
things like being able to fit more talks
in 22 days where all things that came
out of Kirkland's gtech last year and
we're implemented as gee tac this year
and those all came from survey feedback
from you guys so let us know anything
and everything that you would like to
suggest I make no promises other than
that we will read all of your feedback
and with that being said have a great
rest of your stay for all of you not
local to the Boston Cambridge area in
this area enjoy the rest of your time in
the Google office with us go out talk
mingle eat drink and say goodbye to all
these awesome testers that you just met
and thank you very much for bearing with
me and my cough and my crappy voice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
