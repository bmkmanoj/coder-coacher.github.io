couple people at eff and they approached
me about bringing eff into Google to
talk and so I worked it out and they
were very gracious to bring down both
Danny O'Brien and Jason Schultz are
going to talk a lot about eff so I'm
going to let turn over to them thank you
this is a classic situation of me me
promising to give away lots of secrets
and then and then Google making those
secrets available to the world if only
I'd put some robots.txt at the beginning
of this it would have been a lot safer I
think and so my name is Danny O'Brien
this is Jason Shoultz Jason's a real
lawyer for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation I basically play one on TV my
background is that I was a journalist
and used to give a lot of talks on these
issues I'm officially the activism
coordinator for the eff i started i
guess in May and one of the things that
I found kind of fascinating was going in
was that I I think like most people I
had a kind of folk subconscious idea of
what the eff did and with no real
specific details because I've never
really kind of inquired into it and
which are in the eff you realize that a
lot of people again have a general idea
that you know this is this is an
organization that works for good not
evil they put them in the right category
there but but we often get a lot of
requests that don't quite fit into what
we're doing and you know people often
ask the electronic frontier foundation
to do you know there's a lot of stuff
where we get email saying well no
somebody will post something to slashdot
and they'll say well why isn't the eff
there with the I know their tanks why
aren't they marching on Washington we
have to explain that we're primarily a
public interest legal group rather than
a paramilitary outfit so so I was kind
of curious given that we're in the press
so much why most people don't know about
the the true situation I think it's this
is actually a parallels you guys in a
lot of ways in that you know there's a
lot of things that generally speaking
we'd love to talk about and you know I'm
happy to share with you now and yeah if
the NSA wants to pop along you know just
just put the little chit through the
door and listen in it's nice that we've
got the the video link there so they can
just record that later and we don't
usually speak about the mechanics of the
electronic frontier foundation for a few
reasons one is is only we don't want to
be the story or indeed the clients where
we're as I'll explain later we're a very
interesting hybrid of a legal firm with
a technology outfit with an advocacy
unit and one of the rules that comes
across and the lawyers is you always
want to concentrate on the client and on
the advocacy side of things we really
want to get across the issues rather
than have our name necessarily attached
to everything again because we're a
legal firm we have we have very serious
legal obligations we have
attorney-client privilege we have to be
very careful about what we say about
current and ongoing cases and also about
cases that we've settled or dealt with
in the past there's one of the things
that that definitely affects us is that
while we are a public interest legal
group when we represent clients we
represent clients and we put aside any
of those considerations because the most
important thing is to is to win the case
of the client if you imagine this is
sort of a sort of a fire-and-forget
policy we talk very carefully about what
we're going to do before we get involved
in the case but the moment that we we
accept that case we're working for one
person and in a lot of cases as talking
about other issues may affect that case
we are big fans of free speech and that
sometimes can be used against us there
there are definitely attempts when we go
into a legal case for people to try on
the idea that the Electronic Frontier
Foundation I don't know will suddenly
take all the legal documents and stop
file sharing them or you know broadcast
them to the moon or something and and
this isn't the case clearly but it's a
legal tactic that's that that we want to
try and avoid so generally speaking we
we don't make a big song announced about
what we do and how we do it you know
classic example of this I don't know
whether many of you know but one of our
fan
was John Perry Barlow and he wrote a
thing called the Declaration of
Independence of cyberspace which you
know among many things says that you
know people in cyberspace aren't bound
by the laws of you puny fleshy
Earthlings which is a hard case to argue
for in a court of law we have to we have
to emphasize we don't see that as a
legally binding document okay so I want
to tell you some secrets so obviously
the best way of doing that is by
reversing our usual rules here we've
just generally taken out a lot of the
lessons we've learned from normal
standard Euler's so by looking glancing
or thinking about this slide good that's
all of you and for the people in Atlanta
even thinking about the idea of this
slide actually agrees that you won't
tell these these things that we're about
to tell you I'm also i think me and
Jason's names are common law trademarks
now so you can't use those in any
conversation or reverse engineer our
brains or put this onto a CD or mp3 or
or even just stick to these existing
conditions because if you try and do
anything that doesn't fit in with these
we reserve the right to change them
that's actually cut and pasted the last
bit there which you probably can't see
is cut and pasted from the iTunes
contract which basically says what we
say now may change and you will still
have to obey Steve Jobs the base Steve
Jobs look into the spinning mirrors okay
so once we got through the secrets this
is how the eff really works this is this
is this is actually the thing that we
have on the table in our conference room
see this is exactly what the NPA thinks
we get up to we just have this little
thing we do make a lot of decisions in
that in that particular room because
that's where all of the different groups
within the eff meet and come up with
policy we determine our cases and we
determine what we say basically by
looking at what we think is going to
affect civil liberties and how we think
we can transform and strengthen level
civil liberties using technology as I
say we're kind of an odd organization
this is due to 15 years of
of hybridized hybridization spell
English late so i can't i can't
pronounce it the original rule was
defending freedom in the digital world
that's 15 years ago the original intent
was to be a foundation john gilmore
Mitch Kapoor John Perry Barlow and
others pulled their money together and
the idea was is they give this money to
organizations that they fell would
understand technology would understand
the issues of civil liberties and would
understand the law and would go out and
bind those together so we wouldn't lose
any our fundamental freedoms it turns
out there wasn't anybody and and that
was the first stage of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation where we went from
being a foundation to trying to work out
exactly what an organization like that
would be like that went through various
different phases initially it was
defending cases because that was the
most pressing and timely thing then we
went through a phase of trying to
influence policy in Washington directly
by lobbying and trying to build
coalitions of of tech companies to
achieve those ends ultimately we found
that that was very unsatisfying from the
point of view of actually defending
civil liberties because you're dealing
with so many vested interests and when
nobody understands what you're talking
about and while you're there you find
you you're you you have to do an
educational process you have to bring
people back up to speed about five years
ago we switch much more strongly back to
doing litigation I think that was
probably because as the technology began
to establish itself it became clear that
those who didn't understand the issues
were not only waking up to them but
beginning to react in very traditional
ways which is using large power groups
mentioned no names here but they end in
double-a moving in to prevent the
freedoms that these technologies were
providing or enhancing and using their
weight in government and in regulation
to to stop of that and what that meant
was is we went back to the court in a
lot of cases we went to the courts we
went back to the standards committees we
are and in 2000
we built up again I primarily legal tea
a legal team large legal team to pursue
litigation and also to try and represent
the people that clearly weren't being
represented in these areas with what
with money just to give you an idea of
the size and and how this thing works
our current budget is and this is kind
of a secret I am revealing this for the
first time because we haven't filed yet
this is around 2.5 million we have that
23 employees that are funded with that
and a third of those return is so that's
a that's a pretty efficient ratio a lot
of our money goes on on people all of
whom work on projects the actual sources
are funding a kind of odd for a
non-profit we are a non-profit but
rather than the usual construction which
is taking money from foundations that
sponsor worthy cause is or are often
companies or corporations almost
seventy-five percent of our budget comes
from individual donations we don't take
government money corporate money tends
to be earmarked for specific events or
projects which which we like because
that gives us the freedom to criticize
the corporations that we work with if we
felt that was necessary we don't feel
like we're developing obligations with
them and they like it because they don't
have to explain why their funding
everything else we do we have 10,000
very very independent members and
because those are the people that we
take our money primarily from we listen
to them a great deal and really when
we're not representing clients those are
the people that we're representing so in
fact almost the most important job I'd
say on a day-to-day basis at the
Electronic Frontier Foundation is is
what's the intake person because there's
one person who answers all the incoming
emails fends off the phone calls and
directs them to the right of the right
people that's how we often find out
about cases that we really should be
defending it's often how we find out
about new technology and new effects and
and look it's me and I'm tempted to do
the mirroring effect where I hold it up
but I want and it's also how we find out
what people are concerned with very
often will get an issue sent in by a
member or even such as someone who just
wants to know our opinion and will form
a policy based on that okay more secrets
this is a secret internal structure are
we back yes much less secret now so the
legal that's a term of art amongst
lawyers apparently this this is the
secret sacred pyramid of the eff we do a
lot of tech research which unusual for a
law firm we to things like work on
anonymizing systems analyze printer dots
we study trusted computing and write
white papers on that we we also support
and work on projects like new radio the
software radio and also mythtv this is
useful because it enables us to keep
ahead of what's going on it's also
useful because it gives us again more
purchase in these things for instance
one of the roles that people probably
don't know about the FF is we actually
represent mythtv and can do radio on
standards bodies because we try to and
it right it was cory doctorow who spent
some of the time doing that we fund the
appearance and the standards bodies and
we argue in those cases where people
would normally not be considering
exactly what the impact of say off the
top of my head the broadcast flag might
do to open source development so so
having a tech side enables us to do that
and you know if anybody wants des
cracked or or rewarded for a prime
number we also do that to the legal side
i think i probably leave to jason to go
through exactly what
is the illegal side is the is the rest
of us and what we do is advocacy and
press and lobbying representatives to
the extent that we can because of the
way the term a 501c3 organization works
we can only lobby them twenty percent of
our time and so I'm kind of that twenty
percent and and also we publicize things
it's very odd having been a journalist
to suddenly be often the in the best way
or what situations the unique source of
information for the press and the public
and in the times where we're probably
doing the most good is when with the
second source it's it's incredible how
important it is when somebody's writing
something based on what the mpaa or the
Raa are saying that they have someone
else to call who'll give them a
confident grounded in technology reason
why those people are on crack so so
that's that's what we do we that's what
the illegal site does and and this sort
of central pyramid this kind of I in the
middle is where we decide what those
policies are and I won't spend too much
time talking about that because I think
that's something that we can go over in
the question-and-answer session but
that's that's basically where those
things emerge the other thing that's
happened over time which is something
that people i don't think know about is
that we're no longer the only people
working in this sphere which means that
we can really concentrate on tech
research and litigation and and
grassroots advocacy over time over the
15 years that we've existed other people
groups have taken up issues that you
know really deserve to have other
resources thrown at them and we work
with all of them free software
foundation public knowledge is great
advocacy group that work in Washington
the compliment is very well because
they're they're fighting that fight and
also will often team up with
universities and indeed google in an
indirect way with projects like chilling
effects which is you probably know is
where
we put up the DMCA takedown notices that
end up being removed from a google
search engine so that people have an
objective third party way of discovering
exactly what's going on so we work with
a lot of people now and and that's great
Natalie's analysis to concentrate on
what we really like doing which is
getting json out in public to explain
what we really do okay Jason okay okay
so my name is Jason Shoultz I'm one of
the staff attorney is that eff on the
legal side just to give you a little bit
of background on kind of how we're
structured there we have nine attorneys
and we focus I mean each of us do a
little bit of each piece of each case
but we focus sort of in these three
different areas one which is sort of
classic First Amendment rights so
websites that people try and take down
or the government tries to shut down or
someone who's trying to publish
something on the internet exercise their
free speech rights First Amendment
rights we have attorneys to specialize
in that we also have a tourney
specialized in sort of classic privacy
government surveillance a lot of the
stuff going on with the NSA wiretapping
and the associated stuff with that which
I'll talk about in one of our lawsuits
that's sort of one area as well so we
sort of put that together the free
speech in the privacy together as sort
of traditional civil liberties the
second area is intellectual property and
as you're all probably aware on some
level or another it's become quite a
contentious issue more so than I think
even five years ago not just in terms of
you know downloading music or movies but
also just in terms of users and
consumers ability to use the media that
they have actually purchased right the
ability to space shift or time-shifter
media from one screen to another from
one device to another to have someone
hosted for you to gather up information
on it to post screenshots or other
things to your website to put up a fan
site to write fan fiction to do all of
these things to create your own
characters in an online gaming world
that might resemble say a comic book
character or a movie character that you
really are into that you identify with
all these issues are starting to
become more and more prevalent in
battles in the in the online world in
the technology world we've also recently
launched a patent busting project which
I'll talk a little bit about to because
patents are becoming more of them more
of an issue outside of even the
corporate technology space so we have a
whole intellectual property kind of fair
use consumer rights side as well and
then we have also a lawyer who's working
on electronic voting so even before the
last election electronic voting was an
issue about whether these machines
actually worked the way that people say
they do can we verify the code who can
see the code how do we know if they're
they're changing the results things like
that so it's another little aspect of
what we do on the legal team one other
thing I want to say is about the intake
we do get a ton of phone calls and
emails and people writing us either
because they've heard of a case or they
have a case or they're in trouble and
that's actually something that we're
really proud that we we do oftentimes we
can't get back to everybody but it is
one of the things that really kind of
keeps us in touch with what people need
and it is often the source of the cases
that we end up defending or bringing is
that will hear a lot of complaints so
it's a good meter especially for members
so for any of you who've joined in and
who are members we really do try and
listen to the things that you're
concerned about and especially if you
know of cases that we should take or
issues that we should take on I will say
this though that we don't have the
resources unfortunately to help out
everybody so what we end up doing in
terms of picking our cases is will often
look for the ones that can maybe have a
broader impact so you'll sort of see a
trend hopefully in the kind of legal
cases we bring where it's not we want to
defend our clients rights and whoever we
are representing but we're hoping that
it makes a bigger impact so everyone
benefits so that everyone gets the same
freedoms that we might win for this one
person so sandy mentioned were 15 years
old and so some of the classic cases in
the past that we've been involved with
uh actually mostly involved the
Department of Justice and we're sort of
constantly battling them on various
fronts as now Google is as well I but
the the earliest one was actually a case
called Steve Jackson games
and that was sort of how eff became sort
of founded was that the Secret Service
had rated Steve Jackson games because
they were hosting Bolton board system
and they claimed the some of the
documents that were posted on the system
were a national security threat and they
just came and grabbed all the computers
without a warrant without anything and
just said well no one has any privacy
interests in this because it's when it's
a bulletin board and plus there are
private mail accounts on there but it's
on someone else's computer it's not in
your house and therefore you have no
Fourth Amendment rights to protect
yourself the traditional line had been
well things in your home or in your
possession you have a Fourth Amendment
privacy right for but if you you know
say you know have emails stored on
someone else's server will then know you
don't and so eff jumped in and fought
the case and and one to say that you do
have privacy interests in things like
your email in your private
communications whether they be
electronic or paper whether it's in your
actual home or somewhere else and that
it's hard to believe now in this day and
age I think that that was actually an
issue but at the time a lot of people
out of the judges and other legal
advocates were like well who cares about
this electronic stuff right it's only
the paper stuff we care about is back in
nineteen ninety other cases we were
involved with were the initial attempts
by Congress to ban obscene or indecent
material on the Internet the
Communications Decency Act and the Child
Online Protection Act which is still
going on which for any of you have been
following the subpoena to Google for the
search results that is actually related
back to the Copa case the Child Online
Protection Act case but eff has been
part of those cases from the beginning
to challenge people's First Amendment
rights for adults to be able to not only
publish but also witness other speech
which some people somewhere might
consider indecent that the First
Amendment has a pretty broad protection
and that it's only the narrowest of
circumstances that the government should
be able to regulate any of that and one
of the most important parts of that is
that we helped with a bunch of with the
ACLU and a bunch of other organizations
put forward this theory that perhaps
technology could be a solution instead
of law rather than having government and
legal regulation of online content
things like filtering things like
customization
would be perhaps another tool those
things aren't perfect and there are lots
of problems with them as well but
looking at technology as an alternative
to government regulation was an
important aspect and then finally uh one
of the other battles we were involved
with was around encryption regulations
that the government had tried to impose
restrictions on the exportation which is
sort of an odd term when you think about
global networks for the exportation of
strong encryption and we came in and
sort of brought this First Amendment
argument saying well you know what
actually encryption when you when you
teach it when you talk about it it's
education it's speech rights how people
learn it's in the human knowledge right
on some level the implementation of the
code might be different but but the code
itself is a form of speech when you're
showing people your source code or when
you're talking about pseudocode or
algorithms or things like that and we
were actually the first people to
convince a court that code is speech and
that in order for the government to be
able to restrict code and restrict the
sharing of information and knowledge
they had to pass the strict scrutiny
First Amendment test which keeps the
government's interest very very narrow
and doesn't allow them to regulate a lot
of this kind of thing this kind of
speech and expression so that's a little
bit about eff in the past and some of
the early cases that helped sort of form
our our legal basis this is kind of
where we are now some of you may have
heard about some of these things I in
fact there was a talk here I guess about
the Sony rootkit litigation so I won't
go into too much detail on that but some
of you may have heard Sony
surreptitiously slipped on to their
normal music CDs things they just sold
in stores a set of software programs
depending on which CD bought that would
install itself on your computer and in
fact cloak itself in ways that are
similar to how root kicks cloak
themselves so that you couldn't find it
remove it it became almost impossible to
get rid of we ended up suing them over
it and actually have now entered into a
preliminary settlement which the details
were getting worked out on but one of
the one of the things that we were
actually pretty proud of was that we'd
actually sent Sony a letter one of the
things we try and do is be really
upfront with people before we see we
sent him a letter and said look this is
wrong you shouldn't be treating your
customer
like criminals you shouldn't be slipping
the software on their creates security
vulnerabilities you should take these
steps I think I can remember how many we
listed but like seven or eight steps to
fix the problem and they didn't and so
then we went and sued them but we tried
to at least give them a chance right we
tried to sort of follow in some ways the
the security vulnerability protocol
which is you alert them get them a
chance to fix it and then you have to go
public and you have to do what you have
to do and the settlement actually if you
go on eff site you'll see more
information about it we think actually
does pretty much achieve most of what we
were asking them to do all the music
that was encoded in drm and stuck inside
of this malware has in fact is going to
be offered to every single customer as a
free unencoded unencrypted mp3 that you
can download and can do whatever you
want to what you would normally get if
you've just ripped a CD there's
compensation for people who have had
their computers affected and most
importantly sony has actually killed
both of their current music drm programs
they are not no longer producing those
cds and they have no plans for the
current future to produce those CDs so
we got them to actually stop those two
programs in their tracks which was also
pretty exciting some of you may have
also seen that we sued 18t and there's
been a lot of kind of press around this
lately this is related to the NSA
wiretapping and one of the things here
and one of the reasons that we brought
this lawsuit is that a lot of the NSA
warrantless wiretapping where they
aren't even going to the secret court
where they can get warrants and they
aren't going for any judge which is what
the Constitution requires they've been
tapping phone calls and emails in
addition to specifically targeted people
they are they've actually also accessed
ATT's database of all of its call logs
they've actually 18t has been working
with and cooperating with the NSA to let
the NSA kind of data mine many many many
like I think it's over 300 terabytes of
data in these databases to sort of sift
through and this is not for suspected
terrorists that they know ahead of time
this is sore looking for keywords
looking for other things where they
might be able to put together a profile
so it's not as if they already have
someone in mind this is a real fishing
expedition and one of the key things
that we think we can bring the table is
a lot of people hear about NSA wiretaps
and go that's wrong but getting into how
does it actually work who's actually
helping them what technologies are they
using
figuring out well maybe one of the choke
points here is that they are legally
accessing someone else's database in
data mining and so if they are violating
our constitutional rights maybe if we
bring a lawsuit to force a judge to
order 18t to stop helping the NSA maybe
it will actually slow down or maybe even
kill the program so one of the things we
do here is is not that we want to
bankrupt 18t or anything like that but
what we want to do is get 18t to stop
through a court order if they won't stop
at you know already assisting in the
constitutional violations of our privacy
rights so that's part of what we brought
in that suit the third thing is the
patent busting project it's actually
something that we started a little year
ago as all you know software patents
have their troubles and one of the big
issues that we've seen come about
actually is not only our companies like
Google and you know even Microsoft and
everyone else getting sued by so-called
patent trolls but actually that there
are some patent owners who are shaking
down universities nonprofits and even
small businesses mom-and-pop businesses
and it's really sort of odd that they
get these patent infringement letters
but they're starting to go out so a
company called test calm claims to have
a patent literally on the method of
testing online someone writes a test
someone puts it up on a website people
take it they pay money for it and then
the fees get split between the person
who wrote it and hosted it they got a
patent from the US Patent Office on that
so they sent a threat letter to over 400
universities saying any of you who are
running distance learning programs where
people might be taking exams online and
you charge tuition or a per class rate
you OS fee and you have to pay a patent
license or we're going to see you for
patent infringement for educating people
so this is again something that you felt
was sort of a violation of our
fundamental rights and misuse of the law
and so it's something we've got involved
with there this is art so what we did
actually for the this is for the patent
posting project is there's so many bad
patents out there we kind of held the
contest and picked our top 10 worst ones
so if you go to the site you can see
them but this is this is sort of some of
the people we're targeting and some of
the technologies there but it's not it's
on the site so I'm just going to finish
up a little bit and then we'll take some
questions these are sort of some of our
ideas for what might be coming down the
pike what are some of the next
generation of
lawsuits which eff might get involved
with what sort of things to think about
obviously you all here have excellent
lawyers and I'm sure they're constantly
berating you about what you're thinking
about and telling you can't do fun
things that you really wish you could do
but okay so one of the things that I saw
recently we'll start on the upper left
with dave winer you know hi dave is a
that he actually has been someone
concerned about people's use of his blog
and about the use of RSS and things like
this not from a not crediting him for
the things that he's done but more from
the sense of what can other people do
with your content when they take it off
your site right and this is obviously
something of interest to Google right
what can you do with people's content
when you've indexed it or copied it for
a purpose of allowing people to learn
about it right and so there was actually
sort of a spat going on with a website
called top 10 sources about whether is
copyright infringement for them to
aggregate people's RSS feeds and say
okay these are the sort of top 10 sites
in this area you know top 10 travel
vacation sites or something and whether
or not that should be a copyright
violation if they republish it on their
own site and so this is not an actual
lawsuit but I think you will see a
lawsuit in the next two years about
feeds in aggregation I think someone's
going to bring one and there's going to
be this real question as to is it a
copyright violation for people to take
information that's already free on the
web somewhere else and aggregator in a
useful place so we'll take questions
after I finish and so yeah like I said
this might have some connection for
those of you here at Google the other
thing is Wikipedia this is actually from
web site Wikipedia class-action org
which as far as I can tell it's just one
person who is really pissed off so but
they you know they of course it's
interesting they took the Wikipedia
graphic which I'm sure is creative
commons for something but you know and
sort of morphed it into this thing but
basically it's a gripe site to complain
about anything that anyone has ever put
on wikipedia that is ever inaccurate
about anyone in the world ever right and
they want to file they're looking for a
lawyer and i don't think they can find
one because i don't think it's a very
good case right now but the looking for
a lawyer to file a massive class action
lawsuit against wikipedia on behalf of
everyone who's ever been this
bears in any article with any wrong
information ever on Wikipedia sonia's to
say we think this would be a big
disaster if it if it ever came and we
don't I mean we think wikipedia has some
good defenses and we'd obviously want to
help defend them but this is something
to think about again the sort of
aggregation of data or you know sort of
user involvement in your data right and
and what problems can cause and I think
there's going to be some cases coming
down the pike the next 2-3 years that
are really going to address what
responsibility the website has or the
host or anyone who even helps administer
versus versus the users when things are
very malleable the more malleable that
online content becomes the quicker can
change the more it can react to any
particular user or stimuli the more
those legal issues are going to arise
and then finally in the lower right-hand
corner I don't know how many of you are
familiar with a game called city of
heroes it's a massive multiplayer online
game where you got to be a superhero or
a supervillain and you're in some place
called Paragon city and you fly around
and you can you know form guilds much
like World of Warcraft kind of thing
Marvel actually had brought a suit
against the makers of city of heroes and
the people who ran the service not the
end users because they kept noticing
that a lot of users were creating Marvel
characters Captain America the Hulk
Wolverine various other people and they
even though the service killed the
accounts once they were notified the
Marvel still claimed that the service
city of heroes I think it was a ncsoft
was the company was responsible in fact
should start paying even if they didn't
weren't aware of it even if they didn't
know people were creating it or they
should change their character engine so
that people were prohibited from
creating these kinds of characters now
that case actually ended up settling so
we didn't get any established law and
what happened but I think again you're
going to see more of this kind of thing
around what our users doing with your
technology and how responsible are you
as a company and it's something that
we're very concerned with because the
environment in the climate for
innovation for really interesting things
to happen as far as the FF is concerned
needs to be pretty open you need to have
a lot of experimentation a lot of
different takes on it and if you start
holding every single company liable for
every single thing their users ever did
that doesn't scale right you know you're
going to unless you're a massive company
with lots of insurance and lots of
lawyers willing to go to the mat on
every single issue you're gonna let a
lot of people who aren't willing to do
much of anything unless I get a million
licenses from a million lawyers um okay
probably just go for questions here but
but we a lot of people do ask how they
can help and of course that the main one
is become a member supporters and
funders we get more most all of our
funding yes yes yeah if you become a
member now we can give you we can give
you the hats and t-shirts that would
usually send you and and so you know
it's instant gratification it's like an
impulse charity gift the the other side
of this is give us feedback is it let us
know what you think about any of the
issues about anything you see coming up
it's it's genuinely revealing to us and
this is true about you know oh I think
that something should be done to stop
this but how often the lead we get on
being able to prepare our issues comes
from somebody who's working on an
interesting technology in their spare
time or as read a paper or on on a
cryptographic approach or something like
that who's just thinking in terms of how
this is going to affect the world and
will email us and say look have you
considered what what this is going to do
and you know trusted computing is an
exiting example of that you know it
really helped us to have people come to
us and say okay this is something that's
clearly going to transform digital
rights management and and even the sort
of ownership and verification of data
and we had enough time to sit down and
work it through and not just come with
some sort of knee-jerk response but
actually come up with some positive
suggestions about how this could be used
for for good or awesome so that's that's
one of them were small enough to listen
this is a genuine open invite that we
give out which is that if any of our
members are in the air San Francisco
area by all means come over and and and
get a tour of the office this is this is
just funny let me see this the
is I hope I won't get thrown out for
using a 9 but you'll see why in a sec so
this is um this is a ninth a thing where
they go around and and have little view
of of different buildings oops this is
this is the eff offices or slightly down
and just go down here a little bit what
you can see is that the I i I'm sure you
know about this that this is they drive
around in a big van monitoring everyone
the the if they're amazon they're much
worse than you honest and i can't get
this picture unfortunately but there's a
lovely picture of the eff offices with
our attorney in charge of privacy
outside having a cigarette and uh you
know he's sitting there going like you
know I'm not paranoid he's on the NSA
case now so I don't know what's going to
have it I am we do need to stay two
years ahead you can also become a major
supporter our definition of major is
probably smaller than most people it's
generally over a thousand dollars you
you suddenly become our best friend ever
and we're not like a lot of
organizations if you are a member you'll
know that we don't beseech you with
emails or sell the mailing list for
obvious reasons it's amazing how many
people approach you as a non charitable
organization say we have this great way
where you can build your membership will
sell you these peoples names in return
for you giving private information and
these little web bugs they're great too
are we going we're going to have to see
you so so we don't do any of that so
we're very quiet but but two things that
we do do we take shares that may be of
interest in this context we do take
share donations we're also working on an
endowment fund which is at the moment we
do kind of live off the crumbs thrown to
us by our members but we really want to
build up a bit of stability for that
because what we can do varies depending
on you know how comfortable
members feel so if for instance the
bottom falls out of the tech mark stock
market we have problems and that's not
the case of the people that we generally
fight so we're working on building in
endowment we have I believe a million
dollars in it already we have a promise
for two million if we raise another
million so if you'd like to I mean not
that I expect you to write a check now
or anything but if you're interested in
working with us on that we're very
interested in building up a fund that
will keep us going for the next 15 years
that I think is the general took so
we'll just do the Q&amp;amp;A now and oh I just
want to add that also Google as a
matching program that some of you might
know about when you give to nonprofits
and it does apply as well the eff so so
if you give it gets I think matched 1 /
10 it is
let's just say what was for a while
we'll check on then he shot to get
double basically to make up for it but
one thing also wanted to say just you
know to give some context to is it
doesn't you'd be surprised at how little
money it actually takes to make a big
difference in a lot of stuff so you know
and not the like a thousand dollars is a
little bit of money but compared to I
mean so the archival a last year spent
16.9 million dollars on litigation alone
like that's that was just for lawsuits
and things like that and you can tell
from the numbers you saw in our budget
that we have obvious a lot smaller
budget that's not all going to
litigation that's not all going to
issues dealing even with copyright and
online stuff so you know if you're at
all interested and concerned about where
your money's going we can talk to you
about that and also you know that we do
really think a lot about how to make the
most effective change yeah
say you can't take my order
what that issue
shared game kept the game sheriff
just provided intelligence
I can take it
so the question for those who cares i
have an altima sack kinda that much of
these issues already been the site
surprisingly no because really what ends
up deciding it is having a published a
court decision there'll be a lot of
settlements cases will be dropped but
you will be surprised how many people
like a case will settle and ten more
will pop up claiming the same thing you
really do need to have a court ruling
and it is surprising on how few court
rulings there are there haven't really
been enough to establish a precedent on
any of these issues yeah yeah but it's a
law that passed by Congress that has to
be interpreted and in the Marvel vs.
ncsoft case you know ncsoft city of
heroes did defend saying that we are
qualifying as a service provider and
Marvel said no we don't believe you were
going to litigate this case and wait for
a judge to make a ruling and they didn't
get that far but they were spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars on the
case thinking they were going to win so
this is something that I was going to
bring up but which is that we don't
actually just pursue cases and represent
people we also often give amicus
postings to other cases and that's
specifically because we often be in the
case where it really doesn't that the
decision that the judge makes is fairly
clear cut that they're going to support
one side or other but the legal theory
on which they judge that is very
important so for instance if they decide
to judge a hacking case on grounds that
it's trespass that I mean this is me
speaking not as a lawyer now so there
are various people in the legal
department just going no but but in as a
hypothetical example there you don't
want that decision made like that
because that will set a precedent that
will go on and other people will use
that in that way it may be that that
case could be one and exactly the same
decision happen but on a different legal
theory and we're entirely happy to do
that for instance we often file amicus
is about anonymity cases online where
some dis subpoenaing an ISP in order to
enter the I find the identities it's
very easy for a judge if he's not or she
is not appraised of the
sizable case law that argues that the
anonymity is an important right to just
make a decision that these peoples you
know should have their names revealed
and that's very dangerous of course
because that's a precedent that can be
used in future cases so a lot of the
time it's it's suggesting legal theories
to judges that they may what might like
to use and that really really helps in
making the law match what we think is a
reasonable way the world should work I
life I'm voting and one of the problems
i fancy worry about is suppose that you
passed models as everyone if you're
using the touchscreen voting machine
that has to be a voter verified with a
group receipts of you know that
according to row what good is that if
the law doesn't say anything about what
the legal record at the election that is
and those all is lovely pink receipts
going to a dumpster because repackages
you go back to the electronic copies he
never touched those are actually
specifically a case in California
recently well that was that was the law
that we have we were trying to fight
which would basically dismount of those
two things and say that that wasn't
going to be really what in fact the law
was that a lot of specific law was
passed that said this is the legal
record and there's a real danger that it
was going to be vetoed by uh by a short
survey and and we and it was if it was
actually really good success because
generally speaking if your secretary of
state says veto a piece of legislation
and you don't have particular input on
it you will okay fair enough you're the
expert and also the voting officials
didn't want this broad class because oh
my god we're going to have to count all
these votes it will take so long so they
were arguing against it for an
efficiency point of view and we managed
to marshal an awful lot of people to
contact the
the governor directly and he didn't be
to it they Pascal's law for it exactly
that was so government so California
does have that that connection so it's a
really good case by case we just map
Zimmerman who is our voting attorney has
just gone ahead and really it's worth
looking on a deep links which are they
are our blog site had an adventure in
North Carolina where diebold went to
court basically a North Carolina has an
excellent voting law that says you
actually have to ask row all your source
code and libraries and diebold went to
court because they run on Windows CA and
so they can't do that and said we don't
like we can't do this and the court said
okay well you don't have to do that it's
okay you you you can you can have your
stuff registered and we sent Mac down
Matt fought the case one so they did
have to do it then they got certified
anyway and then so Matt went back to
North Carolina and bought that case
again and eventually they were excluded
from the certification process so you
really do have to do these things on a
five by five basis but they were good
evo ting laws popping up everywhere I
should say that the end result was that
diebold is pulled out of North Carolina
is not even trying to sell machines
there anymore the other evo ting
companies actually did agree to the
escrow at least one of them did and so
you know it is a state-by-state basis
that's how election law is done we're
also in ohio florida and nevada and a
bunch of other states but it's really
about Illinois as well it's really I
mean part of the thing also about being
trying to do a national project or
worldwide project but being based in one
place which is San Francisco is we
always need allies on the ground in the
place we're working so oftentimes what
will work on is when people come to us
or we can reach out to them and work
together on something so we kind of pick
and choose our battles that way but
ideally yes we would love and we've
supported a federal law to standardize
all this from the beginning
I understand
and lock down
but the party mystery does
I'm glad you asked so what's our
solution to our double a file-sharing
copyright on this we actually have a
white paper on our side if you just
search BFF better wait for or eff ECL
there is a voluntary collective
licensing program that we actually think
would work much better than any lawsuits
than a the kind of Kryptonian
legislation that's been put forward by
trying to run the technological middle
people out of business it works very
similar actually to the way in which
radio stations license it works very
similar to the way in which cable
lifecasting license I mean there are
problems with these systems but as an
alternative to what's happening right
now we think it's a really good solution
so it's a sort of two page white paper
that pretty much lays out exactly what
we think a good alternative would be let
me get clear to from EFS perspective or
the patent copyright trademark whatever
on the IQ cite we are not anti many of
those things per se at all we actually
are just trying to bring a balance to it
we want there to be fair use rights you
want there to be consumer rights and I
guess we feel that most of the battles
end up being where the maximalist
position comes in trying to grab
everything we end up usually being on
the other side people come in and have a
balanced approach we typically don't
oppose them because they're balanced
already so I mean so we end up being on
the other side but as one emphasized
we're not against these kinds of systems
we just think they need to be reasonable
I mean I think a good exotic I'd of ex
cathedra further yeah but I think for
instance you know a lot of times people
will say you know that the euro you're
you're fiercely against drm and the
reason why we we spend a lot of time
criticizing drm is not because the idea
of your DRAM itself since often as the
fact that it's backed by the DMCA which
means that that effectively criminalizes
any circumvention even if it was for a
legitimate use so you end up being in
this situation where the kind of debate
that we want to have which is what is
good drm what would be a system by which
you could build up a system by which
artist could be supported and we could
still have these freedoms to use values
has already been constricted because we
if the RM is present we
have those fair use rights we've
traditionally had so we end up as you
say as the end up finding these things
often in a maximum at score which ends
up making us look as though that's
because ones that are already being
before
Wow criminal charges against a teen
chick suck it is i'm probably going to
have to pass a little on that one
partially in some sense because if we
don't know the full extent right like
this is just the beginning of figuring
out how extensive it's gone and you know
I don't know as a sort of civil rights
lawyer I hate to actually think about
putting anyone in jail in some ways but
but I certainly think that
accountability is there right I mean if
anything it's like yeah it's like I said
we don't want to put 18 Deanna business
we just want to hold them accountable
and make them stop and you know and hope
of the shareholders will see that also
as well and say you know the executives
will see that and I mean our number one
thing is we want the program to stop we
want people's rights desai mean they're
violating today right now as we speak
thus program is still going on so I
think once we achieve that number one
goal of stopping the program then we can
sort out sort of what accountability
means but I think a lot of that's gone
else to depend on what we learn you know
as more hearings happen in Congress and
more evidence comes out well yeah I mean
any anytime serious criminal penalties
can be brought against oh it's going to
be a deterrent but I I have a little
eyes personally just I'm a little
cautious about that but I mean again I
think it depends on how culpable people
are and what the results been but I
would like to see the eighteen t and
their executives tutor definitely so
sorry case
other photo litigation make you speak
alone in Quetta sony pictures can be
inferred litigation if there can be
infinity of time with amateurs places
what we do is premium reparation ok so
the certain case are there going to be
any punitive damages there will be a
pretty sizable fine against Sony that's
mostly going to actually get distributed
to people so you will be get to buy buy
one CD I don't member the exact forma
but if i buy one city i will not only
get free mp3s of all the music for free
that i bought but i will also get i
think on some level some compensation in
addition and if you times that by the
number of people they sold the CD to cdc
what ends up in the millions so there
will be a fine in that sense going
directly back to the customers that will
impose it part of what happened how
about it fun the less you know to
with Julian buildings look it so in real
white why not want to try and bankrupt
Sonia wanna go for a billion dollars
that's it this is actually so this is a
secret of the FF when you're in
litigation right you're always making
these kind of weird judgment calls right
one of the things is that Sony basically
came to the table and was willing to
settle quickly and and basically cave to
almost all the demands in our letter but
probably not four billion dollars right
and I can't disclose some of the details
of the talks necessarily book but so
this is question of yeah we could we
could go for the gusto right try it and
spend three years in court and a lot of
our members money trying to get this
sort of gold brass ring you know golden
egg of that would really really really
stick it to them or right you know ND
lacks head on flattered right or you can
say well you know what we get ninety
percent of what we really wanted for
people which is their music without all
this crap on it plus some money plus
some penalties plus Sony agreeing not to
do this all up front in a very quick and
powerful way it's always a judgment call
and so it's not that that you know on
some level I wouldn't have liked to
maybe had a bigger stick but you caught
me when you're representing clients to
like we represent people now their
interests are more than important than
ours and they had strong feelings about
02 and so it's something that we
struggle with it definitely is and I
wish I always wish we could get more but
we also felt like this really
to the core of it which is the program's
got killed people got their music and
they do get some compensation and quite
honestly from what we've heard I can
tell you the back channels other people
we know in the music industry is this
has sent shockwaves you know that that a
lot of the companies that were like
tempted to go in these waters have now
backed off seriously because of the bad
press and of the potential downside in
terms of penalties and litigation yeah
she mentioned that in the at least four
state trees generals have also started
an investigation based on this case and
those may still end up leading to even
more penalties for Sony I mean we won't
be directly involved in that but we
certainly are cases we've you know
turned over the information from our
case to them and and you know to the
extent that they're going to push for
more I think you'll see some more coming
out of it
damages open lawsuits yeah so weak um
when the FF files a lawsuit like this as
an opportunity to get attorneys fees
which is basically if we were when we do
all of our cases we don't charge any of
our clients anything it's all pro bono
for free and so but when we win we
sometimes can get our fees paid back by
the other side and so there is a portion
of the settlement that will pay us back
for compensating us for our time and
that's basically what we take so we're
getting a timeout so I mean I missed the
effective video I don't know you should
get going to take years how long will
you TT case take that is a really good
question it's going to depend on a
couple things obviously we'd like you to
go back but one is we don't know what
18th East responses it's the balls in
the report to come back and are they
going to deny that there's any kind of
program are they going to kind of
justify it that it's legal are they
going to clean that they can't talk
about it for national security reasons
that's going to dictate how big a case
this is and how tough it is for them to
defend or us to win the second thing is
the government we don't know what
position if if the NSA and the DOJ are
going to intervene and try and say
something about the case or try and push
the court in one direction the other the
more they get involved the more complex
the case gets so I wish I could tell you
more but at this point it's actually
kind of out of our hands as to how
complex it gets if it stays cabined in
there's an option for us to move quickly
to have the court rule ahead of time
even before a trial that this is a legal
nation stop and that's something we're
considering but it'll depend kind of on
how they respond so it could be I mean
or they could be like Sony and they
could quickly settle but I doubt it
right that's that would be a dream so
I'd say realistically you're looking at
six months to six years somewhere in
there depends
now we are getting the time out so it
will be around so if you have any
questions come on up but thanks so much
for coming out and you have t-shirts and
hats and stuff if you want to buy a
t-shirt hat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
