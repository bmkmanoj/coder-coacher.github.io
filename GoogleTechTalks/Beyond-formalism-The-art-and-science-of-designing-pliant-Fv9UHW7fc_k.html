today is Austin Henderson who is
currently at pitney bowes now forgotten
concept and Innovation Lab something
close to that advanced concepts and
technology lab Austin has a long history
here in the valley he was at park when
it was then called Xerox PARC I guess he
was at Apple he was at what else were
you were here yeah and Europe Europe arc
and made some discouraging into the
Midwest to work at richardson fitch and
so he's had a long time interest in
making systems that he calls more pliant
and he's going to talk to us today about
that thanks very much Robin the this is
the putt this is the pitch that
computers as they're used in many
circumstances are quite rigid and life
is very fluid and there's a mismatch so
what I want to do is talk today about
that problem an analysis of it and some
thoughts about what the solutions might
be I'm particularly pleased to be
talking to this audience because I think
in many ways the the way you're using
computers doesn't necessarily fit this
mold and so I'm particularly interested
in your response to it so we'll just
dive in in 1965 in Montreal I was
working automating a align a
manufacturing line and my job was to
figure out how many bottles came in and
reduce take take it off the the number
that were outstanding on the contracts
and I kept asking the systems department
is the other what happens when the stuff
that they shipped me is more than what's
out standing on the contract what
happens when the balance on the contract
goes negative and they said that will
never
happen so a few more times I kept asking
eventually I got annoyed enough that I
walked down to the the shipping dock and
I said what happens they said don't ask
us as contracts so I went to the guys in
contracts and John said to me it happens
all the time the the there is breakage
there is quality control there is delay
there is the fact that where
everything's working just fine only we
haven't figured out the what the price
on the next contract is going to be for
heaven's sakes don't stop shipping keep
it coming haven't go negative and when
we figure it out we'll just pour it over
to the other contract and and I said oh
my goodness I'm going to have to go back
to the systems department and explain to
them all of this about the world and and
were builded into the program and key
learning moment for me John said don't
don't build that all into the program
and I said why not he said because
tomorrow there's going to be a sixth
reason and there's going to be a seventh
reason what you need to build into the
program is the tools that will allow me
to build a model of the world and do the
contracts as I need to do it at that so
that particular question for me is how
do you how do you begin to address all
these questions and the answer is the
users are the people in the end who are
going to have to deal with these things
and need to be able to address them and
that's what this is all about so what
role do the users play in in doing
design well sort of the the classic one
is we drink we technical folks dream up
something and they have to just follow
along if we get better than that and go
out and study and observe users may
become models for for what we want what
the users need to be and and and we can
then build programs where the users are
act really if you will are models for
what for the behavior
we're trying to support if we get better
than that we might involve the users in
in the design it's a self by
participation participatory design is
all about how you engage users in
helping you design what needs to be
designed what I'm looking at is pushing
it farther than that as Mike story might
have just suggested namely that you want
to get the users into a position where
they can do the design themselves they
can in fact begin to push what is it
that I need there of course are all the
technical ways of doing that where i can
write scripts or do end users program
user programming the tailoring and and
setting preferences are of course things
that are sort of small steps down this
route but if you're trying to break out
and get to something really rather
different you may need to get into the
areas of construction sets and so on but
that's all way too technical for my
friend John probably in contrasts so
what do we do another example in 1968
and and so that experience for me was
when I was a in undergraduate school and
I went back to I said oh this has got to
be there's got to be a science to this
so I went back to school and discovered
ahead and read the small print the the
fine print said that what computer
science was about was about how you
build the things not how you use them
and so for years I spent trying to find
where was the place that you learned to
actually how to use them and eventually
when I was a park I tripped over the
anthropologists and discovered that you
in fact there's a whole science of how
it in fact how in fact you engaged users
and understand what's going on in the
world what the needs and values might be
and then beyond that there is a whole
collection of disciplines in the area of
design for figuring out not only where
you are but where you want to be this is
a story that happened early on in my
days of the encounters with the
anthropologists Eleanor when an
anthropologist was looking at Xerox
order entry clerks the people who are on
the
bones taking orders for paper whatever
and the exchange was going back and
forth the the clerk said where should we
ship it the customer said when are you
going to ship it clerk says why the heck
do you care answer copiers on an
ocean-going barge you tell me where I'll
tell you you tell me when I'll tell you
where okay so in that moment the clerk
is confronted with something where
they've taken the address and and
cranked it they've got ontological drift
big time and so the clerk in that
particular case and this was 1968 and
the clerk was working on paper the clerk
said took numbers took a number wrote
down call Bob now we don't know what
happened when the shipping label got to
the shipping dock and here's something
called but whether they actually got on
the phone call Bob we know even less
what happened when that address hit the
hip the billing equipment and they tried
in the building equipment tried to
figure out which state to charge sales
tax in so it's not like the users
deciding i'm going to go off in that
direction can be done with impunity
there is there are consequences but this
is what happened on paper the the ship
that i'm suggesting is a shift from
designing design as planning what's
going to happen looking about what I Dai
Li likely to happen and as much and it's
really additive rather than or looking
at design as evolving looking at
responding to a changing we're looking
at the world you're in and it's
delivering you new things all the time
noticing how things are looking
backwards to see what has already
happened rather than forward or in
addition to forward as to what I'd like
to happen so there's there there's the
the shift that I'm saying that if we get
our computation really useful to us if
we can get out there farther the world
my dream world will
have the capacity for people to be
engaged with the machines in a much more
creative way where the design has
happened in response to what's going on
a final example at pitney bowes we have
like many companies a lock box company
where when you pay us money it gets
shipped there in in in pitney bowes the
the lock box is in Louisville Kentucky
and so we refer to all this this male of
coming in is going to Louisville the
interesting thing though is that the
mail in addition to including checks
also includes a an unbelievable
collection of other things changes of
addresses come pick up the meter I've
been sitting I've been asking you to
pick it up for months I really would
like to buy something else can I do it
on and on and on a huge open-ended
collection of comments from the from our
from our customers now the mail people
or at least the lockbox people tend to
think of that as dirty mail that is to
say it isn't nice and clean and doesn't
fit the business of give me a check I'm
giving you money what they what they do
is they say we've got all this other
stuff and they throw it in a box and
eventually they are they send it to us
and what we what we have to do is deal
with it we being the call centers of the
people who are dealing with customers
what in looking at this as you can
imagine some of us said this isn't bad
stuff this is good stuff this is the
world telling you how it's changing this
is our customers doing the work of
marketing everybody else to tell you
what it is that they what they need and
so they reach out and say so we need to
reconsider it in response to a changing
world of course if every customer just
every user decides that they're going in
a different direction you get chaos as
I've suggested so the question of how do
we coordinate changes becomes a real
issue if we succeed in getting the the
ability to design as something that can
happen more quickly are in the hands of
the users so what I want to do now is
talk quickly through some work that Jenn
Harris and I had been doing in the late
90s and and and and more recently around
what we call pliant computing looking at
how do we address this problem because
we all thought we wanted this but what
does it actually take the influences
came from lots of places as this slide
suggests the the work was initially
started at Apple and then has gone on
and affected infected other places and
it was given as a paper at Chi Nani Kai
99 focusing on this particular line of
argument here's the way it goes there is
attention between computing and society
and I've given you some examples to talk
about that I want to talk about the
roots of that tension a better way of
thinking about it and then a couple of
if you buy that a couple of research
agendas that suggest we might we might
have to engage on the the examples which
I've given are very very small the
larger ways in which computation is
forming a constituent part of our world
are extensive and you all know about
them they're built into the way our
financial systems are telecommunication
systems all of these systems work what
those systems can do is often limited by
what the computers can do that are built
into them the capacity for the
organization's to deal with the world is
limited by the computing and
consequently our ability to change them
put simply i think what we have is for a
social group doing something you need to
have three three sets of criteria met
you'd like to be able
responde locally as I've suggested as
the world is the world the particular
circumstances that you're in are ones
that you want to be able to respond to
on the other hand if everybody rides off
at high speeds in all directions you've
got chaos so you need to have some
non-local coherence some way of having
those things encounter each other such
the changes that I proposed either get
rejected get bounced back somehow the
consequences get get get handled and
then finally which is sort of central to
what we think about is the real so much
the advantages of computers are scale
namely things get big so getting two out
of three of these things is hard getting
all three is still pretty much of a
challenge and that's what we're really
interested in thinking about there's
really obviously sort of it feels like
and I think it is a trade-off between
the the the responsiveness your ability
to change to respond locally and the
capacity for being coherent technology
can sometimes help you do a better
handling that trade-off and scale makes
it hard interesting computers have
tended to come down almost entirely on
the side of the coherence that is we're
going to maximize coherence very often
the the usual way is is to sort of build
in the answer that you're going to want
a single a single thing and that this
puts a burden on all the users who have
to deal with that of the the need to
respond where where did this this
tension you know where did this come
from why are we there why did computers
come down on the side of coherence
rather than on the side of
responsiveness the the current mythology
about design is sort of the total
consistency picture all are the standard
it's kind of standard to compute
sciences you think hard about a
situation and then you decide what the
model is and then you build that into
the computing in other words there's
this this trying to get some model of
the users and then all the users look
the same what we're going to do is then
get a we're going to have a single
consistent thing we we build that in why
did we get there I think because of
something that goes like this it's a
little sketch you have a bunch of people
doing a bunch of things acting in the
world and there's an interplay between
those two as the world changes the way
what they do changes and there is this
natural feedback that's going on between
them after a while as scale begins to
play its its role the you you get people
who are sort of saying well let's see if
we can't organize things a little bit
let's bring some people in who are going
to coordinate things who are going to
begin to say how things should be done
such that we can get so that we can
don't have to reinvent it all the time
and so that we can we can manage of the
the thing as it gets bigger and bigger
they tend to write down something in the
way of some form of a codification of
the thing a set of rules something that
says here's the way you're supposed to
behave and then those are handed to the
users who are supposed to now behave
that way of course the the interaction
loops are still there and so the users
listening to the to the rules I know
what I'm supposed to do or can still
trade it off against what I'd like to do
what the pressures in the circumstances
are they can argue back with a
coordinator said in this particular
situation what ought I to do and and so
that there is still that feedback but
you're using the rules as as a normative
behavior around which of the behavior
the activity is happening then the beer
at the bureaucratic myth comes along and
what it does is it forgets that there
are those feedback loops
it basically says they're coordinators
your building rules and people are
executing them and that's activity okay
csap the the what you do is you forget
the incredible importance of the
feedback loops and what you have in this
picture and then of course along come
computer seems like the perfect device
for doing rule-following right so we
build a something which helps users
follow the rules we build the rules into
the machinery okay and then they have to
act in that way what happens of course
is that things break because there isn't
any way for the user to argue with the
machine about what's supposed to happen
what then happens is that users step
outside the Machine and the system moves
out into the social space around or into
the paper space around or into calling
your friend and what happens is the real
system the full socio-technical system
isn't inside the thing that you're
looking at so you don't so you from a
point of view of an enterprise you're
really losing control of what's happened
the very device would look like it was
going to help is the thing which has
prevented you from getting real control
of the situation and then of course
scaling makes it worse and because any
particular activity is as many of these
things impinging on it if you solved it
in one it's not messing going to solve
and the other and the answer is in one
aren't going to work in the other so it
just don't just gets very hard what
could you do that would be better well
there are some non solutions the classic
AI solution on solution is if you make a
big enough and sophisticated enough
model you can get it all alright we can
in fact build something which will be
smart enough that it will get it all
right the problem there is of course how
do you argue with it we can also build
adaptive systems neural nets those how
to think all very useful but we not we
haven't yet built any really big
skyscrapers out of marshmallows yet the
question of how you build big things out
of stuff which isn't exactly fixed and
rigid is something that we don't know
how to do very well so the these are
these are apparent look look like
solutions but in the end don't turn out
to be what we're what we're suggesting
is and this is as I said which is mostly
Jed Harrison me but we're suggesting is
much more of a form of a dynamic
relationship a dynamic engagement
scaling without total consistency and
having to work with it will drive us to
work with much richer ontology than we
deal with now specifically if you have
different users doing different things
you're going to have multiple ontologies
working in the same space they'll be
there concurrently and you have to deal
with none of them necessarily being the
privileged right answer but all of them
being ones which have a way of working
with each other I'm pushing on each
other these Incan ontology zai think if
we're going to get systems which in the
end will behave this way are going to
have to deal with the inconsistent the
vague and the equivocal we're going to
have to have things which we don't
understand fully yet the different ways
that people look at things are often
going to be mutually in Khmer it where
the way you think about taxes and France
and the way you think about them in in
in the US or between california and new
york state are just plain different over
time in connecticut is by the week and
in california is by the day and
consequently the way you struggle with
these things you can't say one is right
one is wrong you kid tempt be attempted
to say let's go and get something which
covers it all that's kind of in the same
direction as going with the AI model
let's get a great big ontology which
covers at all
in reality we build systems which live
in the real world and you'll always be
crashing into something next you will
not have the roulette the luxury of
being able to stop this system and and
and and do something else I expect this
is carrying coals to Newcastle here
because your system can your key systems
continue to run that's the that's kind
of the model that this suggests an
ongoing changing system which has got
lots of different ways of looking at the
world which are then Co informing each
other about where they are the final
thing of course is they're all drifting
with respect to each other but that is
the way the world is and I think if
we're going to build computer systems
which which are in the end going to be
helpful in our will we need to take this
on this has to be where we're going to
go so if you bought by this this this
goal of where we'd like to get to where
could we go how can we get there I want
to suggest to to research agendas one is
by using the existing rigid computing
systems not client in a very in a but
use them in a pliant way take the pliant
agenda and use them in a way which
allows us to explore that this is not
particularly rocket science from a
computer scientists point of view but it
will be an upheaval and a half from
management from a management and IT
point of view so that's going to be a
social exercise as more as much as
anything else the second agenda which
I'll come to at the very end and I would
like to offer that there's going to be a
solution but I don't think we've got it
yet so in the end I'm going to be
offering a question rather than an
answer is we ought to do something with
computers there's a research science
agenda that we need to deal with a big
time and I'll come to that towards the
end so how about using rigid computers
in a
civil way I'm going to talk through a
number of examples the first one was the
copier on the barge I've already talked
about it although the order entry clerk
was using paper if we are using computer
systems what could we do well just being
able to have a checkbox which says the
information in this field is something
which I human being understand you
computer do not ok the issue of being
able to put information unexpected
values in the field and then have the
computing systems work out that the the
the consequences of it not that they get
smart but rather they hand it to a human
being when they run into it need to do
something with it which radically
changes the way we think about the
computer system not so much if the
humans are sitting there all the time
and working with it but it certainly
changes it when you think about the big
batch systems that are doing things
behind the scenes in these large systems
like telephone companies and and and and
power grids and so on the question of
how do you how do you build the humans
who have to respond to the stuff that is
out of band how do you build that into
the computer systems is as much a social
problem and a user interface problem as
it is a technical problem you need to
but you need to identify the places I'm
leaving it to the users she just to say
this is something you don't understand
and but have the computers have the
capacity to say ok I know I'm carrying
stuff I don't understand and carry it
carry it along if you like this is the
this is the the business of recognizing
that there are limits to whatever the
rigid of the rigid is the second one
that is putting margins on the form
joanne yates in a book called control
through communication chronicled the
invention of office procedures from
eighteen eighty five to nineteen fifteen
it's a wonderful book if you haven't
read it i suggested i always assumed
that Julius Caesar's army ran on memos
and had a uniform filing system it
didn't that got invented that got
invented when corporations headquarters
and controlling organizations became
larger than four floors in one building
when they became distributed as
railroads did and chemical companies
suddenly you had to bring some agreement
on how things were going to be done such
that there was a coherent manner of
reporting and and adding things up so
that the reports look the same so among
other things forms were invented and the
interesting thing about forms was that
the initial forms were printed all the
way to the edge of the page because they
save on paper and who needs it and what
they discovered was that not everything
fixed their rigid structure and over
time they invented the margin okay you
hardly think of it as of an invention
but it's crucially important to exactly
the subject matter we're talking about
that if you lay a rigid structure down
over the world then you better have a
rigid place an institutionalized place
for all the stuff that doesn't fit okay
and so what what was invented was the
margins on the farm choice as a as a
bumper sticker mine is margins on reform
ok this is this is think about when you
build any system where's the stuff
what's the user going to do when it
doesn't fit no matter how well you do
what's the user going to do when it
doesn't fit and what are you going to do
to respond to that if you're going to
say we're not open for business on that
fine but you're dealing then you're
admitting to the fact that it's going to
be rigid and the users are going to go
outside to the extent that you want to
play and manage it you better take it on
so it's a very simple thing you can
always ask you with respect to the
systems i use pitney bowes has a
terrible one around the around our a use
of support for some of our HR processes
and there's no place for putting Marge
on the forum there's no way of getting
beyond the system we third one oh and a
thing to note is when you have these
things which are out of the the rigid
structure that you've been working on if
you've captured them they stay inside
the system that allows the people to act
but it also traps where you can get at
it the people who are building the rigid
system it traps for them the place where
they can look to see what's outside what
they're not dealing with what are the
things that we ought to do in the next
Rev and so you have access to all of
this information if you can get people
to stay inside your system and so you
enable the people who are using it but
you also enable the the ongoing design
you can use Ecology's ecological growth
of forms of of objects there are various
different things this example here was
something where we allowed various
different scripts bits of script to be
put behind a button and then send around
to other people so people so one person
would build the script which and another
person could use it this was a gyro Park
in the late 80s and what we noticed was
a huge ecology of these buttons people
building all sorts of things adding to
the extending their systems because they
were working in a scriptable environment
but we noticed is that the the admins
were not we're not making use of we
thought they would so we sort of worked
with them and gave them training
sessions they weren't using it until the
head of the lab made the made the
comment to one of the admins I don't
understand why you're not doing it and
the answer was oh is it okay for me to
spend my time doing that sort of thing
so the ecology of building these things
was critically required permission for
management
required them to be able to have an
environment in which they could could
grow grow these buttons again that's at
the heart of that is the idea of a grown
environment but the business of handing
it the the power to grow it between the
experts and those who are not quite so
expert obviously the the web content is
growing the fact that you can pull up
the source on things and make use of it
and then put it back in has been a
powerful way of the the behavior on the
way web growing feedback on design this
is this is a whole other area of the
system not just its functionality but
the the information about how it's being
used how a particular system is being
applied to particular circumstances
often we use documentation or thing like
it the man pages in UNIX were the
earliest form where people could write
your own documentation and extend it
that business of being able to talk
about the usage patterns and grow that
is nice because the the language for
making the change tends to be English or
something like I mean a natural language
something that that most users have
access to so that sort of gets breaks
beyond the the limitations of the
require the necessity to be technical to
make the changes and then finally the of
the social coherence control the large
development projects open source where
again for those who can talk the
language the social structures which
allow for the discussion and the
management of the of the of the handle
the coherence is provided by the
mechanisms that surrounds us things as
open source so those are the kinds of
things that one can do just with our
existing systems to begin to move
towards the space where you get a living
growing evolving obvious a pliant system
what you get is the capacity for the the
putting back into into play as part of
the computer systems the support for
those feedback loops now I was arguing
that the that is is not as high as I'd
like to raise the bar because what this
leaves is the the the information that
the changes that you're making the shift
in ontology it's entirely in human space
you're getting no help from the
computers that you're using for handling
the ontological drift the the changes in
what an address means in the from the
from those rigid systems because they're
not playing in that in that area so the
computers are still dealing with rigid
ontology what we really like to do is is
get the get the computer somehow or
other to help this is the this is sort
of a hint about how one one way one
might go about that this is based on
Alexandrian patterns and the for those
of you know Christopher Alexander's work
on architecture the way the interplay
between the regular patterns that he
would argue under rights much of what
constitutes good architecture how that
is played out in the production of
actual houses I want to talk very
briefly about these the thing that is
that under rights that is sort of at the
heart of this as I suggested earlier was
instead of having a digital crisp values
sort of moving to values which are
probably more continuous it'll probably
be more like like field interactions
rather than crisp edges fitting into
each other it may very well be that the
mechanisms will be probabilistic rather
than logical and the inference that that
that one would use might very well be
like that and it will be dependent upon
much as as gears would say thicker
descriptions of the of the system that
the world that the of the ontology of
the world that the system is playing in
then we have now which are really quite
thin in the sense that the computers
don't know much about the world in which
they are playing again I don't ever
expect the computer is to be in the
world the way we are but there are ways
in which I believe we can move somewhat
in and get some help Christopher
proposed a whole system of of patterns
he referred to he called them a swirling
intuition about form a fluid-filled of
relationships he's talking about
something that is if you like a
normative behavior of a particular area
they're inherently metaphorical we use
the idea of of seeing ads that the the
attempt instead of instantiating classes
what one does is see the world as an
instance of of a particular pattern so
it's the same way a patent is read by
lawyers it reads on a particular
situation you're looking for that match
between the pattern and a rich world
that's out there when you've got that
match you can then you can then use that
as a way of saying
that the that the the changes in those
worlds are are going to read better or
worse against the pattern but more
strongly than that the attempt to read
against the pattern may very well change
your view of what the pattern is as in
for example that the the the idea of an
address being changed by count
encountering the copier on the varge the
the way any given situation instead of
being an instance of a particular a
particular pattern will be seen as many
of many patterns and so that they will
they will be pushing against each other
pushing to understand due to to support
that activity and the idea behind it is
that then that you see it more as a
collection of fields pushing things
around and the viet the attempt to see
something new will push other things and
cause ripples through the system I've
talked now already about enacting
patterns the the what you're trying to
do is is is is address the the how you
how you get the the management in order
to you need to be able to observe and
and and and redirect what's happening as
a way of controlling what's going on the
business of calling for help that i
talked about becomes part of this
because of the next initiative where you
have multiple people working on it you
can have in the midst of this you can
have conflicts you can have a resolution
that the work of the work is often the
resolution of these pressures against
each other one of the things that that
is true of our existing computer systems
is that they tend to
have a view a single view of how the
world is having multiple views means
that it's a sandbox in which the clash
of those of those ideas and those views
and what you see it as can be worked out
if you look over time at what computer
systems have been used for what they
have been prosthesis for you can see
them move through arithmetic to memory
to get through to to gathering to search
one of the things that interest me and
what this would suggest is computers as
a prosthesis for negotiation how do we
get the machines helping us in doing the
real work of work which is smashing
different viewpoints against each other
if we can get them helping that we can
get the leverage that comes with that
maybe some of the very big problems
which are really the clash of different
perspectives might be something that we
could get the machinery actually helping
and leveraging us to do something about
the history of how you got where you are
computationally is very much a part of
of enacting that things have done that
that that something has done something
before becomes a a piece of the force
which is driving what's happening now
the fact that I every time I enact
something that becomes a case where I
yes and the pattern still works even if
there's no change at all so history is
it is is is important and quite clearly
from the feeling of this the feeling
would be that it's probably highly non
deterministic that that it's going to be
much more much more fluid than that with
what we've got at the moment the mission
the the business of having collaborating
activities is multiple multiple patterns
working on the same situation massively
parallel
diversity to maintain the right amount
of coherence what I've talked about here
is is the the way of seeing things as a
way of a wrecking of having the when you
see something what you're doing is
you're bringing coherence out of the
situation because you're seeing it as
that and all the things that are of that
pattern are then have been brought in to
some degree of coherence how much effort
you spend in doing that is a man is a
management choice what we did with with
computers where we where we lock it down
and say here's the ontology and we're
going to just live with it is we've
decided right in the very beginning that
we're going to put all of our effort on
managing coherence into getting it right
to start this one says no no we're
making it a different choice we are
going to have to actually spend
resources in in managing those
activities and finally it's an evolving
system its large-scale ongoing as I
talked about again these are just that's
just a hint of one way that one might go
about getting to a situation which I
think more like this namely that you
have the people doing the work and the
coordinators who are in fact building
patterns if you will maybe all of us are
but that the coordinators are producing
and you notice that the computer has now
blurred out into the space in which work
is happening and that the that the the
choice of how you manage that your space
and the coherence becomes real work
necessary to then form the environment
in which the ongoing activity takes
place so that the computer system
becomes much more blurred out and the
question of how you spend your resources
on management becomes an active choice
which everybody is making all the time
if you think about the way life is
this has very much this feeling the
question of camp is for me can we get
computers to play to the bottom line is
I want the designer the user to be the
designer by being able to shape those
those those patterns and the world and
have them reflect in the the world that
they live in that they can design it for
themselves that the system can help
designers design it for themselves the
users the font designed it for
themselves and that they can coordinate
with each other and so if there's a
another bumper sticker it's really that
the best of user-centered design has
users designing that is at the center
building these systems which allow you
to manage these multiple perspectives in
it in a much more fluid world thank you
so you talked about this
collision work it out have you left that
kind of day let me please consult your
exam Pacific at will so technique the
shipping the supplies with copper
especially the people who are Western
forum assume that if you you know if you
be this integration I do my job yep and
the other person off I can't be like in
the information you'll I know something
else yeah if you tell me this I into the
information she is a negotiation back in
word of what wish we could keep quiet
yes is that a running theme what
fraction of quiet is handled by that and
who you in some sense help automate that
negotiation processing well all right
here's what we're I need feel to satisfy
you love you yes to the extent that were
that that at the point where the the the
user says okay i'm going to put in call
Bob the to the extent that the system
knows who else is going to use that
information it could engage them saying
you've got any problems with us again
I'm going at the level of the really
really not smart system very very simple
systems just acting as as a platform for
for getting the information back you
can't I mean Richard fights and I a long
time ago wrote around this particular
example an argument that says if you
really characterize your system and you
know where every piece of information
goes then you'll be able to answer those
questions the problem is that some of
the changes that some of the changes are
shifty ontology enough that you can't
tell you can't tell when things will
matter not so you really have to hand it
to a person the fact that you can use
the system to do that is exactly what I
think we would talk about you know you
know and then becomes a negotiation only
at the level of if that person is
available right now they may they may be
able to say no no no no don't don't get
make sure you get the full telephone
them okay but they may not be there real
so the the the difficulty as I see it is
people are going to make a change and
they're going to start acting on the
basis of that and then the impact the
impact of that is going to hit somebody
else and it's going to come rippling
back through and you have to deal with a
partially completed activity in the face
of a changing response which is the way
the world is it's you might have the
luxury of getting the negotiation done
before you settle on what the solution
is it's usually the case you get started
and have to back out of it or struggle
from when you talk about short term take
care I'm often reminded of some modern
aviation and the men that here got these
systems that can do a lot of things but
the pilot is there to deal with the
problems that the system can't mean and
that yeah so there's this interesting
negotiation between the automated system
the pilot it who's in charge in any
particular boat but the thing that
frightens me about it is you know the
line about aviation that it's our is
important to punctuated by moments of
terror and I'm trying to figure out you
know is that what what our eventual
computer systems are is is you're there
you know kind of because you have to be
in the loop and then there's a moment
where out of nowhere you have to
actually do something and you don't feel
like you have the context
to do it nothing no that's that's a
really that's a really good question i
think he'd done if you make certain
management decisions in certain ways
that's exactly what you'll get and I but
I don't think that you be driven to that
because i think that the solution that's
taken in air traffic you know with
pilots flying is you keep them in the
loop you don't have them just sitting
out there looking over the shoulder but
rather they're actively involved and and
so the question of how you how you let a
person who is going to have to answer
the question of what about this a new
address how you how you let them see
those things that are coming what's
going on can I look can I see what's
happening can I take the world's
information and and and notice what's
happening possibly i can anticipate
possibly action i can lead but but but i
need just if I don't stay involved
you're absolutely right I won't be able
to I won't be able to make that decision
yes the talk you know not only do I need
disability cooperate and negotiate but I
need to count the contest that I would
have had that but I did it all manually
so that i can understand what I'm
cooperating in to go to thinking about
exactly and so the question of how how
as a necessary part of doing this we
have to have the machines providing that
I mean back to John's question of how do
you provide that negotiation if you're
negotiating I have to know where they
are how do I see that it may be again
the same sort of answer that we can in
fact take a parcel solution air traffic
control is a is one which says no you
can't you have to decide but very often
just solutions can be made which can
then be rethought and and and and rework
exactly what this kind of system looks
like in the face of sarbanes-oxley I
don't know and I think because that's
you know those that legislation is built
around a perception that the world is
regular and you can plant and activity
is based on the rules
right so there's a there's a this is a
fundamental sort of head-on clash with
with that perspective on on on activity
yes yes please yes you have third I was
intrigued by the connection between what
software characters people
that the preconditions was
as you were describing this problem of
trying to define everything too rigidly
and then things breaking because you
either were specified things or and
because you were specified takes things
went outside
and so how do you sort of see them for
that what they think about this is to
say no specified as if I
and all those things it meant even if
they have an outdoor man then provide
the right connection points really come
back into the system so that what is
that have on the software side is
something for him you know us a message
they acknowledge that there is more than
computers yea yea though i think i think
the center its descent that I I
understand your your solution the extent
to which you say we start by
acknowledging there's more than
computers leave it outside the you know
it steps outside as long as they bring
it back inside in the within manned as
you say then then then then it will fit
the question the harder question is when
you step outside and and get a solution
outside if the solution requires the
change of what's inside so you can't
bring it back in band without changing
the system that is simple medical to
factory conditions of temperature
if you are not in our interest
so you're saying that when you bring it
back into the system we've suddenly
realized wait things do change ok so the
preconditions I need to know how many
people are there and then I'm done the
post conditioners I know how many people
of it how it is that event around and
ask if you ready to put these people in
blocks of paper right for the hand icon
that is outside the system but you know
and have a consistent view of God but
the difficulty will be the one that's
fine when that works the one that I was
pointing at is when the answer that
comes back in is oh I see this
circumstance is is saying that that I
have to re understand what the notion of
of counting people is or because because
you've changed the ontology and that's
that's a deeper and so thank you
everyone thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
