from gorbett design who are here today
gorbett design is made up of artists and
designers who enhance people's
experiences of public spaces through the
creative applications of technology
they've got installations in retail
stores and museums and hotels got three
people here matt has a degree in
architecture and masters from the MIT
Media Lab before starting gorbett design
he's worked in silicon valley at xerox
parc among other places and he has had
exhibited art technology artwork at a
variety of places including burning man
I'm susan's degrees are in computer
science and psychology she also lived in
the valley for years working at places
like SGI where she did interactive TV
user interface design worked with vermel
for a while and was the director of user
experience at excited home in snapfish
Susan and Matt are both on the faculty
at the Canadian film centers interactive
art and entertainment program rob is a
professor of mechatronic engineering at
the University of Waterloo where he
holds his PhD in electrical engineering
and they're going to talk about well
I'll let them decide what they're going
to talk about um this one more note this
talk is going to go up on google video
so the request is save questions for the
end because it just makes it much easier
in the video later so here we are thank
you very much and thanks for having us
here it's really good to be back here
and we're going to talk today about some
of the design principles and practices
that we bring to our design practice and
we we you can see on this slide the
title of our talk as people as medium
and when we're working creating
installations weather for commercial
clients or for public artworks we
approach the work that we do thinking of
the people who are going to experience
our work really as part of our medium so
going beyond just a simple participant
or a user or a viewer we like to think
about who's the people who are going to
be using it as integral so the piece
doesn't really exist if the person is
not using it in that sense so what we're
gonna do is we're to talk a little bit
about the the principles that we bring
to build on this and we're going to wrap
that around some of the projects that
we've done to illustrate
so starting off this is a project that
some of you will find will be familiar
with it's a piece that I was involved
with when I was working with Xerox PARC
called till tea tables and it was part
of a larger project called experiments
in the future of reading that was shown
in san jose at the San Jose tech museum
and what we're doing is playing with
different ways to experience information
different ways to experience the user
interface and the ability to browse and
search through very large well maybe not
very large but large document so in this
case we're looking at a table that's
three feet by three feet projected down
on to it is information and the
interface to this to this document that
these kids are looking at right now is
just by tilting the table so as you tilt
the table we take advantage of people's
familiarity with with gravity and with
the way the world works to do something
that just makes sense which is you tilt
the table in one direction the
information flows in that direction you
tilt the table in another direction the
information flows in that direction so
experiments like this where we're
starting to play with people's
preconceived notions of how the world
works and bringing that to bear on the
information world so we can break out of
our sort of traditional keyboard mouse
monitor monitor paradigms and another
piece that we did for that show is this
one called the reading wall just show a
quick video of as well the reading wall
is a it's three sixteen foot walls safe
again get that to play a little better
and on the walls are plasma monitors
backup checks I nvidia
that doesn't look like it's going to
play for some reason so on these walls
are these plasma screens and there is
information printed on the walls but
also information on the screens and the
information on the screens is dynamic
changing in the context of a museum when
you put dynamic changing information on
a screen often it gets lost because of
the way people visit a museum in the way
the sort of the context in which people
will experience it if you walk up to a
screen and you see things changing you
don't necessarily know where you are in
the stream of the video right but in
this case what we did was we
synchronized the movement on the screen
to the movement the physical position of
the screen on the wall so as people move
the screen from the left hand side
across to the right hand side you move
through the story and we like to think
of that interface a lot like the
interface that you have when you're
reading a book so you pick up the book
and you can flip through the pages you
can move forward you can move backward
you can move it whatever pace you like
you can go quickly you can go slowly and
again and again playing on what people
know and what people know of the world
that they inhabit and what they're used
to and tying it directly to a physical
to a physical sense of the world are
there now it's playing of course so you
can see just very quickly I want to the
whole video now that I've already talked
about it they can see as you move and if
you stop if you go forward if you go
backward if you go quickly if you go
slowly the dynamic text that's printed
on these screens and that's synchronized
with the wall behind it moves at the
same pace as the viewer so again connect
it right back to the to the person's
body an embodiment so this principle
when we think about this we call it talk
to the hindbrain when we make designs we
like to think about dealing with
people's brains and not necessarily
presenting them with a lot of
information that they have to cogitate
about right you don't want to have
instructions you don't want to have
mappings of click here and slide this
and first do this and then do that but
really can you talk to people on a level
that that is the subconscious brain and
the brain that we're sort of used to
dealing with in the real world in the
embodied world not sort of this first
principle that we bring to our work well
yeah sure
it just it's just that we we all spend
many many many years learning about the
physical world and understanding how the
physical world works and and how moving
things and how gravity works and and and
getting there and when you are in a
purely digital world sometimes you're
very disconnected from all of that
learning and knowledge so taking things
back into a tangible interface that
people can sort of approach and and use
their their physical bodies to interact
with and and understand sort of gets
back into this sort of visceral way in
which we really experience the world
around us and uses the digital
information as an enhancement to that
experience rather than then as rather
than taking away from that experience so
another example of this that of using
this sort of our bodily senses is a
concept called ambient media which is
explored at the MIT Media Lab and also
at Xerox PARC and a lot of sort of
attention has been paid to this idea of
taking information and putting it into
our environments this piece is a piece
that we did exploring that concept for
Herman Miller they launched a a line of
furniture in in two thousand called
Herman Miller read and it was a line of
sort of very design furniture but aimed
at fast-moving fast-growing companies it
was sold online it was they created a an
e-commerce site where they were selling
this furniture they got a lot of really
good reviews it was very successful and
then they opened up a store a showroom a
physical showroom in Manhattan and they
commissioned this piece which is sort of
a an information artwork that serves
both as decor in their space but also as
a way of monitoring in this very ambient
way the activity that's occurring on
their website so I'm going to just
launch a quick demo of what we created
them so what we did for the installation
was a custom screen that took the shape
of their logo which was this sort of
screen based screen shape that you see
here and it just make sure it's running
here once again
and then we connected that to their back
end of their server to take the the
real-time data of the traffic hitting
their website and we could represent
that graphically in the store and very
large owns 10 foot screen so what you'll
see on here is a little bit it's a
little bit like an ecosystem of what was
happening as people would arrive on
their site and surf around the various
pages of their site these little black
dots that you see are the number of dots
is sort of tied to the number of
visitors that they have the frequency
with which the dots slide around is tied
to the frequency of page requests and
then the system is constantly sort of
adjusting to how much information or how
much data it has by zooming in zooming
out and just giving trying to give a
visceral sense for is there are there a
lot of people here or not that many
people here and when you see a slideshow
like this of product that represented a
purchase so when somebody made a
purchase you would see the purchase
items that they had just bought and you
would see it just dynamically in real
time there's like an eight minute delay
because we were processing the data and
bringing it down in chunks and the
system did a few other things just to
just to reinforce this idea that the
data is there but it's not you know
literal data on a spreadsheet what we
would do is we would every once in a
while throughout the course of the day
we would change the color and cycle
through the colors that that they had in
their sort of branding we would move
through the five different colors that
they had to try to put like little
landmarks in the course of the day so
that the people who are working in the
store who are actually the same people
who are running the website they would
be able to say oh you know what it's
really funny that that thing is always
kind of very quiet when it's yellow
which is mapped to you know in the mid
afternoon after lunch nobody's ever on
our site but we got a lot of traffic
when it's green in the morning and maybe
we should change the way we do things in
that sense so trying to take these
notions from the physical world and move
them into into something that's really
displaying techno technology chol
data-driven information so part of this
came from the idea that when you have a
physical store you're very aware of the
traffic in and out of the store you can
see Oh people like these products over
here they don't like those products over
here and that's very different than
seeing a spreadsheet at the end of the
week you get a more visceral sense for
what's happening
this again the idea of ambient media is
not to replace that spreadsheet because
that's interesting and important too but
but again to sort of add to it to
provide that that visceral human sense
for knowing what's happening what's good
what's going on at sort of some level
that's not about the numbers thinking
about it as sort of a window onto your
data so you can always check the weather
oh we know what time of day is outside
no I by necessarily
humans are pretty good for a girl
so this piece brings up a second point
that we like to that we tend to bring to
our work which is this idea of focusing
on the intent or focusing on the goals
and in this case the intent was all
about this bridge between their their
business which was a successful business
running in the virtual world and this
new thing they were doing about the
physical world so we started with the
premise that there is a problem to be
solved here so though we create
something that we call artwork it all
starts in a sort of a design with a
design goal and trying to solve that
design goal or at least address the
goals of the space or the goals of our
clients sure ok so the next piece pieces
I'll talk about our and a space that's
the Drake Hotel in Toronto the the Drake
is a very interesting space it's in an
area of town that is sort of on the rise
and was very rundown and is and is
getting there just to give you an idea
they they bought the building for eight
hundred thousand dollars and then spent
six million renovating it so the the but
it was a it was an old sort of flophouse
but before the renovation was done and
the owner of the hotel really wanted to
keep that sort of sense of history sense
of neighborhood there were murals
painted on the walls that were over 50
years old and and trying to kind of
unlike a usual hotel where where you
wipe everything clean every night and
pretend that nobody else has ever stayed
here he wanted to have a sense of the
community in there because the the space
is actually there are only 20 hotel
rooms and the rest of it is it's more
about the public spaces than it is about
the hotel rooms so the materials that
were chosen by the architects are also
all about showing the community impact
over time like the the bar is painted
with black over red so it will get
scuffs as people kick it and they'll be
visible and things materials that would
Russ stuff like that so so we took a
look at this building and his goals in
terms of the community and created two
pieces that are an exploration of what
would happen if the building was aware
of its inhabitants and could poke a
little bit of that awareness out of the
walls so we could see it so
um this first piece I'll talk about is
is threshold memory um it's it's in the
doorway it's sort of inset into the fire
door that is between the main lobby and
this remain lounge restaurant and many
many people who go into the hotel pass
through that doorway to get where
they're going and it's a series of Nixie
tubes which are very old technology but
we and and we thought that the sort of
gentle tech feeling was very appropriate
to this space that sort of old-tech they
all started at zero the day the Drake
opened and every time someone comes
through the door from the lobby into the
lounge not the other direction the the
lower digit counts up by one so it's
been going up ever since the Drake
opened now it's it's at just about a
million now and it it will it'll count
for 300 years before it turns over so it
never goes down it never changes even if
the power goes out it saves it's it's
count and so the idea is that people are
leaving a little bit of themselves in
the Drake it's creating a little bit of
a monument to the community of the drake
and and something that you can look at
and say oh wow that was only down it
600,000 last time i was here in it and
it's sort of it really interesting to
see it go up over time right so if
that's the memory then this is the
heartbeat of the Drake and it's on a
wall that's in the back lobby of the
draeken and physically in the direct
center of the floor plan of the building
and these six gauges are tied to the six
public areas in the hotel so there's a
sky yard and a in a basement room in a
restaurant and allowed in a cafe and
they are showing the activity levels by
showing the sound levels in each of
those spaces so you can sort of come up
to this and say where's the party or
where can we have a quiet conversation
what's going on here in it and it really
does give you a sense of the pulse of
the Drake right now and time and and we
see people use it that way sort of go
come up and say is anything going on the
underground right now and and you can
really tell by looking at what's
happening
so one of the things about about these
two pieces is that they're very very
subtle they're designed to be a part of
the architecture and sort of a part of
the is done with the materials that the
building is made out of so rather than
being like art that's hung on the wall
they don't even have plaques that
explain what they are and part of the
intent there is that you can go to this
building many many times without even
necessarily noticing them but once you
do notice them and once you find out
what they are and how they work then you
know something you have something that
that a little bit of knowledge that has
come to you about something special in
this space and people's a tendency once
they have some experience like that is
to want to share it so what we get is we
get this third concept that we play with
called social currency where when
somebody has had an experience that's
unique and surprising and fun then they
call their friend over in the same look
at this thing come on over here look at
these ok walk through this door and then
their friend walks through the door and
by doing that and having that
interaction with their friend they've
now kind of shared a little bit of their
own sort of pride of the space and for a
client who's got a space that they want
to make kind of hip and they want to
make people feel good about offering
something where people can kind of
internalize a little bit of that kind of
pride or that extra knowledge of that oh
I'm special because I know something
about this and now I can share it with
my friends is something that we've
actually played with to a great degree
with a lot of our work and we see people
doing that and taking these little bits
and nuggets of interaction and bringing
them sharing them with their friends and
it's something that we're that we use
when we're talking to clients about the
advantages to this sort of work in there
in there in there spaces and I think
another one well so so here's another
example of that principle a little bit
this this is created for a store also in
Toronto that's in the distillery
district in Toronto which is a sort of
revitalized old cobblestone brick
building area that has been turned into
a space of art galleries and retail
shops and this store is litleo comes
from Galileo and their their their world
as their branding is all about
light and discovery it's sort of a
high-end fashion sporting goods store
$300 Pumas I've never bought anything
there so it's but they were looking for
something that would sort of sort of
fill the same function that a fountain
fills in a space they had had a fountain
in another store they were looking at
but they also wanted something with an
extra sense of uniqueness and wow that
would sort of be contemplative and would
also pull people into to see it so we
created the lily a light fountain it's a
large dark steel table slightly curved
seven feet across with three on a wood
base and the wood is created from the
recycled wood that the rest of the store
is also created from that comes from the
old distillery and then three stones on
the surface of the table and these
patterns of light play in and around the
stones and circle them and if you reach
in and move a stone then the light flows
and changes based on the movement it's
it's finding the stones so there's an
example
so it will also respond to people's
hands or if they you know toss a large
shining wallet or something in there and
what we find happens is that people see
it from a distance and they say oh
that's nice and then they see the
patterns of lightness ooh that's
interesting and then they they are
invited to or they move a stone and they
go wow you know there's this sort of
Frisian that's magic it responded to me
you know and and then the next thing
they do is move a stone you know there's
that little bit of and that's the social
currency and it's also like this feeling
of initiating someone else into the
magic you know you've felt it and now
you want to share it with everybody else
and so that that feeling at that Frisian
you know gets people pasta and even even
the people who the sales people in the
store they don't have the sort of normal
interaction with the customers how can I
help you you know they say would you
like to play with the fountain you know
in there there's sort of so beyond that
and and and into an interaction that's
that's that a much more real level one
of the the things to notice about this
piece I mean one of the things people
always sort of say how'd you do that you
know well we trained the light very
carefully it's all that um but but one
of the important things that to us about
this piece is also that the technology
the delicate stuff is all up in the
ceiling what's down here that that
people are touching is stone steel and
wood you know you can climb on the thing
in fact people have you can bang on you
know till the cows come home and you're
not going to hurt it because because it
you know everything that's delicate is
way away and and that when you're
putting something in a retail space
that's going to be banging on the
thinking through those issues is really
really important just sort of the next I
think that sort of brings us to the next
of our principles here which is that we
treat all of our work uses technology
but we really treat technology as a
means to an end so we're a lot of
interactive artwork or artwork that uses
technology is about the technology
itself if you take the other principles
we've been talking about like focusing
on intent and really speaking to the
user at a low level then
you can build an end that you're trying
to achieve and then pick appropriate
technology whether it's 1960s Nixie
tubes or saw a state-of-the-art you know
vision tracking software or whatever but
it's really not about the technology and
in fact most of the people who use the
litleo light fountain never even realize
that it's just a standard dlp projector
stuck in the ceiling they think it's
something really magical because of the
context in which they experience it so
this this is sort of the the fourth of
our of our points and I guess it leads
into the next piece that we're talking
about this is this is our the most
recent piece that gorbett design is
currently working on it's still a
project in the works it's a commission
for a large-scale outdoor permanent
dynamic sculpture for the region of
Cambridge in Ontario west of Toronto and
the reason for the commission of this
piece was in response to the
construction of a new by the region of a
new emergency medical services facility
in this building is one of the first
leads rated gold leads rated buildings
in North America so this is an
environmental standard and they're using
this novel solar technology that is made
by a local company called Sphero solar
the aspect of the technology that's
interesting is that it's flexible so
it's a laminate that you can put onto
building materials or cut in shapes etc
and they wanted to commission a piece
that responded to this intensive invite
the environment and that use this this
new solar technology and so in
approaching the design of this piece
again thinking about the intent thinking
about the location we spent a lot of
time brainstorming over what is an
emergency medical services facility what
is what does it mean to have solar
energy etc and we worked with this form
that is the these twelve shafts and they
go from the longest shaft which is 30
feet long six inch square structural
steel and coming out at a 67 degree
angle and sweeping around in a very
graceful arc
follows a sine curve down to a shaft
that's 18 feet long at an angle of
something like 21 degrees and the reason
for these angles and for these these
lengths is related to the whole solar
aspect so in the summertime if you're
installing a solar panel what you'd
really like is for the solar panel to be
angled perpendicular to the Sun and so
in the summertime that means very low
and it means you've got more hours of
sunlight so you need less area in order
to capture the same amount of energy in
the wintertime the Sun is low in the sky
so the angle is very high and you need
correspondingly longer and it turns out
that because of the path the Sun falls
through the sky just mathematically
these turn into very beautiful forms and
so this have you gonna play that sure so
Matt's going to show you a fly through
that was done in Sketchup if it plays
you just keep trying so the idea of the
sculpture is that each shaft is an
independent piece of electronics that
collects energy during this during the
day from these novel solar cells that
are on the south-facing sides of the
shafts collects energy into its own
battery there's an individual
microcontrollers in each of the shafts
and at dusk the sculpture comes alive
with a light show that plays across the
surface of the twelve shafts we'll see
in a minute that on each shaft there are
three groups of three lamps these are
LED lamps that are distributed and
you'll see them as we zoom in here one
of the interesting things about this
site is that there there are there is no
pedestrian traffic it's all cars trucks
it's a very industrial space so they've
commissioned a piece of public art for a
space that's not really seen by a whole
heck of a lot of public and so that was
one of the things that we really looked
at when we were trying to decide what
was important about this piece and one
of our guiding principles became public
art should be public
so we really thought hard about how to
do that and wound up thinking about
interactivity at a distance and
interactivity over the web for this kind
of peace and Rob will talk in a second
about how that works but so you're
seeing it as as you would from a car
sort of driving by well then we take off
into an airplane but but and then fly
but but but but driving by we wanted the
the forms though although the shafts
don't move the form is very dynamic if
you're moving by it in a car they
because they they blend against each
other and that was something that was
important to us ooh that even the
daytime aspect of the piece hints at its
dynamism and and activity so and so you
can see from this mock-up that each of
the shaft has lights inset along the
length and there are actually three
groups of three lamps in each shaft and
the number three essentially because
that's the minimum required to give a
sense of movement of direction and users
will log on to a website and interact
with the peace in this using this
interface where again we're essentially
going back to sine waves there's
basically a sine wave the plays across
the x and y directions of this this set
of shafts and the user can control the
frequency and the relative phase between
the sine waves as well as a randomness
which we call scatter and the flare
control which controls the the relative
phase inside each of the groups smaller
groups of three so you can get this sort
of flaring movement as well and the way
we think about this is that people will
log in and and put a little bit of
themselves into the piece it's a it's a
bit like composing you know it's a kind
of a light composition tool when they
submit their designs it goes into a
queue that gets played that evening and
over the course of time we will
aggregate the data so that the and at
the end of the show in a given evening
once individual designs have been played
the piece will revert to a kind of
aggregate that represents all of the
different contributions of the community
so it really becomes a community piece
the next so so this ties back into this
idea that that we talked about with Lily
oh and again with this one this it's
kind of oh wow I can do this I can
control this this piece of sculpture I
can have my impact on the landscape and
so the last of the of the of the print
of the principles is one of the most
important ones that we talked about is
this idea of surprise and delight and if
we can bring surprise and delight to
people in an experience that there that
they're going to have them then we've
that we've succeeded and I think the
last piece we're going to talk about is
maybe the best illustration of that so
the last piece is the one that is
currently on display or unexist at 01
festival down in san jose on the south
wall of the isn't mchenry mcenery
convention center this was a piece that
was developed in 2002 in response to a
public call for a contemporary art form
where the theme was power to the people
and so Matt and Susan and I sat down and
we sort of brainstormed what is it what
is power what is giving power to people
mean and the theme was chosen in the
festival takes place in the city called
Kitchener in what in southwestern
Ontario and the theme was chosen because
that year 2002 was the hundredth
anniversary of the introduction of
public power into that area and so we
came up with this idea of taking the
kind of iconic tool of corporate
communication the marquee and combining
it with the ubiquitous symbol of the the
light switch and the light bulb
everybody knows that interface and so
this is again talking to the hindbrain
and creating this marquee that we would
put on the face of City Hall for 10 days
24 7 that anybody could come up and flip
switches and put their their message up
on to City Hall this is another piece
where surprise and delight is great kids
come up and they're Oh daddy daddy can I
put my name on City Hall can I please
put my name on City Hall and you get
an incredible cross-section of responses
from different cross sections of people
so we have the kids playing with it we
have adolescents playing with it putting
up messages of love or you know Jake
loves sarah &amp;amp; and I love you and you get
the street kids playing with it putting
up other kinds of messages I'm do it
once we get the the nightlife playing
with it and all of these different sort
of classes and cross sections of the
population come and they contribute
their own little piece to the experience
of the work and the other aspect of this
is that we've redone it in 2004 in
toronto on the front of the drake hotel
in fact so again this is a different
context now we're in an urban center on
a hip street it's no longer a public
building it's a private building and the
population is different and so instead
of seeing the same kinds of messages
that we saw with in Kitchener we see
much more thought-out much more profound
kinds of messages people yeah we have
you got eco yeah there it is so this is
a friday night in the Drake Hotel and
there are lines of people waiting to get
in and somebody you know put ego with a
big arrow pointing down to the line so
there's sort of much more profound
messaging going on again this piece is
one where the technology is invisible in
through two showings both in Toronto and
in Kitchener we had very very few people
wonder how it worked which which I find
amazing I mean that that's our intent
but I still find it pretty amazing
because we're obviously not switching
120 volts with with regular lights which
is out on the on the street side you
know this it rains on this thing so that
wouldn't be good but it doesn't matter
but it didn't matter to the people in
fact there's a really good story can I
tell us yeah there's a really good story
about when we showed it in Toronto
because when we showed it in Kitchener
it was a wired piece so there was a
serial cable that essentially ran from
the switch panel 500 feet up to the
display when we showed it in Toronto we
were having a lot of trouble getting
permits
to run that cable / Queen Street which
we're street cars run we were also quite
concerned about electrical noise from
the street car passing underneath and so
we decided to do it Wireless Matt was
negotiating with the people from the
city to get this permit and you know
they had put us through you know you
need to talk to this person in that
person then he was still sort of working
on it when we made the decision to go
wireless and I guess we never know we
never told him that we were going to go
wireless and what we did with the with
the piece was we took the conduit that
we had used in Kitchener to run the
cable and we stuck it to the side of the
of the switch panel and we put it in a
hole that happened to be in the parking
lot so you have this this image you know
so that it satisfies people's kind of
need to understand that there's
something there and Matt got this
frantic phone call one day during the
show from the guy from the city and he
said he said well congratulations it
looks like you have your piece up and
well I notice you've done something
underground and I'm I'm really not sure
that we issued a permit for that is what
he said and yeah so this just this just
speaks again to people's perceptions and
kind of in this in this case we went to
did a little bit too good in trying to
satisfy what they were expecting to see
from the piece just to say something
else about it sort of being being up and
around for that long one one of the
things that we've been really interested
to find is that when we first put the
piece up in kitchen we were really kind
of nervous about it getting vandalized
because here it is this big gray thing
looks like a perfect place to tag and
and it's just plywood and switches and
is it going to be too delicate and and
we we was up and it was up and
everything was fine and we started
talking to some of the folks that were
hanging out down there 24 hours a day
and and we said you know is this
something which no man this is the
greatest thing that ever happened are
you kidding someone hurts it all break
their kneecaps you know they they got
feeling really protective and possessive
of it and and the same thing had then
happened in Toronto it was up for a
month 24 hours a day out on this city
street in the middle of you know
downtown and and the Tigers would tag
the bus stop that was right next to it
but
we would go by two in the morning so
there's this one guy is filth right up
on the Animus up and we'd see filth up
in lights and and and to us you know
that that's what it means it's doing
what what we sort of intended from the
beginning which is which is that you
know we normally get bombarded by images
in an urban environment McDonald's and
whatever all the advertising and we
don't have that kind of power to change
the urban environment in any way and so
this sort of gives people the power that
they're not that that the vandalism is
an expression of not having and so so it
sort of allows people to do that and I
mean one thing that's important to us
about this piece is that it's not a
statement it's not so much a statement
about free speech as it's a question
because we feel like it's really
important to ask the questions about
what is appropriate public free speech
it's very important to us to that it's
not anonymous if you can see it you can
change it you're standing there flipping
switches I mean you can run away but but
if you're you're not sort of sending
something in over the web or or any of
that you're you're actually physically
there and so you have to take some
amount of ownership over what you're
putting up and what you're doing and and
that that creates an interesting dynamic
sometimes we talk about social grease it
takes the dynamics it doesn't really
change what people are doing but it
takes the dynamics that people already
have puts them up big and technology is
off like that we've had a number of
people at different venues kitchen or in
Toronto when they when you describe the
piece to them they say oh and there's a
keyboard and you can sort of type in so
no no it's it switches and they kind of
go why wouldn't you just use a keyboard
and then then they go and use it and
they come back and go I get it you know
it's it's this ubiquitous simple
everybody knows how to use it kind of
playing field leveling thing in in
Kitchener I had an experience where just
to follow up on what Susan was saying I
had an experience where I was standing
beside the piece and there was a four
letter word starting with f up on the up
on the display and a general
men came up to me and he I was wearing
my little artist tag and he said is this
what you intended and I said well no you
know we didn't go out to create a swear
board or whatever you want to call it
but if if it offends you one of the
things about it is that the switches are
right there there was nobody standing in
front of it you can feel free to to
change it and he just kind of huffed and
walked away and it was this the weirdest
thing because here was this guy who was
so comfortable and used to people
censoring things for him that he wasn't
even willing to go up and just kind of
go like this and and so that to me was
kind of like an incredible moment so I
think that's sort of pretty much
summarizes the the five of the of the
major principles we play with in our
work I'm going to play a little bit a
little video that we have here of that
piece actually from Tuesday night you
can see people playing with it and it's
it's very different and we wanted to put
out up there because of that so somebody
put Google up there in the middle of the
night 934 know there you go and thank
you very much for your attention we be
welcome we welcome any questions on any
design principles or on the technology
that we use these for design it's that
the shortest polar get our shortest pole
get the same amount of energy
talls pole would backwards right think
it's one identity ID you guys do all of
them like does the Sun produce the same
amount although we have at that distance
from the sound I mean there are very
different angles so they're a different
angles so and here you see it in google
earth they're a different angle so in
the wintertime the tall shaft may
collect more energy than the short shaft
and you're also going to get variation
from clouds going over etc and so one of
the things about the piece is that shots
will die out at different times during
the evening so they're not as the show
goes on it basically plays the show
until the batteries run out and so you
will lose different shafts at different
times and again how long the show lasts
is there for another kind of reflection
of the health of the community in the
sense that that's how it's reflective of
how much sunlight the community got that
that day and it was something else I
want to say about this piece which I
forgot but this this google earth i was
thinking and when we were talking about
social currency google earth is another
area where that i think that probably
happens a lot people discover things and
then kind of say hey you know come and
see this and tagged things and send
their tags up plays with the same
process same idea of insider knowledge
or social currency their questions how
do you feel the monetization
youtube video where you we rely on
drawing people in and well in a sense we
I mean that's our business model in a
way I mean because we do that's how we
sell our that's how that's one of the
things that we use to sell our work
right when we talk to clients and they
say well why what's in it for me why do
I want artwork in my space and what kind
of artwork and and the fact that they
even call it our work is sort of you
know sometimes we don't sometimes it's
just design and it's it's getting
increasingly so which which would like
um but but to be able to say that that
you know for someone like this retail
store and their fountain to be able to
see a year later people dragging their
friends in off the street into the store
so that they can show them this thing
and share that experience with them and
oh yes by the way now they're in your
store and yes they're looking around at
your merchandise and yes they may buy
something is is kind of proof you know
in the pudding so can't argue with
monetization yeah especially as artists
um I mean that's one of the things that
that we I guess struggle with I don't
know if that's the right word but but
this line between art and design and
this question of of what is our and what
is designed and where your principles
and all that sort of thing I mean for us
you know we're about enhancing
experience of public spaces through the
creative application of technology and
one of the things that we really like to
have is a strong context and we talked
about intent here we talked about sort
of speaking to the context and a strong
brand is just as interesting and strong
to us as a site you know that that has
its own limitations and and and
possibilities so so yeah art design I
don't know you know I mean it's all
about experience and and and to tell you
the truth when you're doing something
for a client generally the resources are
a little different than when you're
doing something that's that's sort of a
public art project so sometimes you can
do more interesting things and and and
in fact enhanced people's experience in
ways that you might not have the
opportunity to in in a non commercial
environment so so I you know yeah
because I'm on film here and I'm and
we're at Google that keyhole and
sketchup were my two very favorite
things in the whole world and thank you
for buying them both and making them
free thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
