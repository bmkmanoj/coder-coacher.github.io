to us at Google first met DK told me how
he learned yoga from the monks up on the
mountain where he grew up sadly where I
grew up there working among so many
mountains or even any mountains but he
learned a lot since then he got a degree
in computer science at pal and he's
spent a lot of his time teaching yoga
and working with a number of different
communities to show how yoga and help
change their lives he's a founder of
yoga he's going to come talk to us about
the rent asunder
thank you in it's a pleasure and a
privilege to be with you here this
afternoon what I thought I could try to
do in this hour that we have together
essentially establish two connections
one is a connection between global
sustainability and personal
transformation the second the connection
between yoga and integral mindfulness
practice and its effect on personal
transformation and so hopefully if these
two connections become clear then we can
make a strong case for yoga affecting
global sustainability so the general
flow of this talk is going to look at
real quickly at what yoga is and perhaps
what it isn't and then look at some
factors in global sustainability look at
the social return on investment of the
social impact of social transformation
and then see if there is a science of
self-transformation that we can
systematically apply develop and
disseminate in some of the applications
of self-transformation and the power of
a personal transformative practices and
then perhaps opening up into a bit of a
taste for the practice and QA so as we
go on maybe we'll take a quick show of
hands in this group here how many of you
do yoga okay okay about somewhere about
thirty forty percent how many of you
meditate regularly okay a little smaller
number all right so as I was thinking
about how to define yoga I figured that
there are about 16 million Americans
that are doing yoga and clearly that's
enough room for plenty of confusion and
so why not do what makes the most sense
in this kind of an environment
essentially go and check google alerts
the google news and Google blogs over
the last four days and this is what came
up
the Big O in own yoga for hotter sex
yoga's pursuit of serenity breathing
deeply and looking good does yoga
contribute to weight loss a monk who
goes to the British lawmakers with yoga
is yoga good for children a competition
a yoga competition and the Balkans
exquisite yoga accessories and yoga
lessons in Kenyan prisons so if you look
at this plethora of applications of yoga
across the world it's hard enough to try
and figure out how it could possibly do
anything about personal transformation
what to speak of global sustainability
and so that will perhaps be a search
throughout this presentation is what
exactly is yoga and we'll continue to
explore that as we proceed some of the
things that are outlined in this crazy
mix might actually give us some insights
for example just bear in mind this idea
of yoga contributing to proper weight
control or management or whether it
could be effective for children perhaps
as they're struggling with a DD and ADHD
and with the exponential increase in the
prescription of antipsychotics lately
whether it has anything to do with crime
and violence at peace and conflict so
just keeping that in mind sort of hidden
within all of this chaos around yoga so
let's just take a moment to look at some
of the factors affecting global
sustainability
the National Academy of Sciences and
recent proceedings noted that
consistently year-over-year since the
early 80s we've actually been consuming
more than the Earth's sustainable
resources 1999 the last year of detailed
measurement were up at about 120 percent
clearly if this trend continues given
that the world's resources are finite
we're going to run out the UN world
summit on sustainable development
talking about some areas to look at as
we're looking at sustainable global
sustainability interagency collaboration
in key areas fresh water water and
sanitation energy oceans coastal areas
and then one that's a little more
introspective consumption and production
production patterns so we'll look at a
little bit of both some other insights
on people who are spending quite a bit
of time looking at global sustainability
and its challenges to ideas come up
ecological integrity and social
integrity one that relates to resource
scarcity and early can hold reyns
equation a soft equation that's been
accepted by the UN Charter the UNESCO
adopted it in 2003 the idea that if you
multiply consumerism or affluence with
the effect of technology and use
population is a scaling factor you get a
sense for the impact the human impact on
ecological integrity this relationship
is also relatively clear that if you
have in mind environmental degradation
that leads to resource scarcity and in
turn is often responsible for violent
conflict the other piece to this the
social integrity and its effect on peace
tihomir Dixon the University of Toronto
outlining the idea that injustice leads
to a loss of social peace and often is a
primary cause for terrorism
to ideas come through in a recent
position paper and proposals by UNESCO
discussing enhancing global
sustainability let's look at both for a
moment the quest for sustainability of
the planet transcends Environmental
Protection this often gets a lot of
bandwidth with global warming and so on
the idea that it requires an integrated
and holistic approach let's bear that in
mind as we continue forward the second
piece that an integrated vision centered
on the human being and based on the
respect for human rights and democratic
principles solidarity dignity sharing
and equity so once again looking at some
of the external factors and internal as
we start to look at global
sustainability so if you try to separate
out some of the key factors that are
involved and kind of group them as
external versus internal what you find
is yes the environment development
Harper's and national responsibility
human rights and social justice peace
and Conflict population density all
become big factors that determine the
sustainment sustainability of our planet
and yet they are generally outward bound
and then there's a whole set of
variables that are more inward bound
what are we going to do about education
crime and violence physical and
behavioral health and then economic
development as it relates to our own
fears and desires our memories and
imaginations our needs and our wants and
how that might relate to voluntary
simplicity as I look at the seven-point
pledge has been developed by Al Gore in
relation to global warming it's
interesting for me to note that only one
out of the seven thank you thank you
only one out of the seven relates to
some personal action that could make a
difference how to leave a smaller carbon
footprint on the planet
as I look at sustainability solutions
solutions initiatives from ecological
internet one out of ten deals with
consumerism and recommends voluntary
simplicity so as you look at these
efforts you start to see that there's
probably a distinct imbalance in the
focus between the external and the
internal and that is probably true of
many of our efforts traditionally for
example economics looked out words only
recently we've been looking at ethics
and economics and humanistic economics
is developing as a science the computer
science and psychology coming together
physics taking a look at the observer
and what that does to experiments so
this mix of the internal in the external
and in some ways that becomes the crux
of what we're talking about if we go to
the next slide perhaps it's good to
remember a couple things that Gandhi
points out one that this clear
differentiation between need and greed
needs to happen if we're going to make
sure that the earth is able to take care
of all of our requirements and then
becoming the change an oft-quoted line
that you want to see so something
dynamic that we have to do individually
and perhaps collectively and so what
this points out perhaps is that we need
to be able to to change human behavior
we need to change dominant paradigms of
progress that we need a fundamental
shift in our values perhaps that we need
to go beyond simply behavior
modification which is hard enough and
perhaps look at our evolution of our
consciousness from sub human to human to
divine and so as we look at that it's
not enough perhaps just to try and be
truthful that's challenging of course
but yet to get to a state
even the thought of lying and of
deception doesn't arise on the surface
of our mind to not only try not to harm
another to practice non-violence but to
get to a point in our evolution where
even the thought of harming another is
inconceivable where that deep sense of
interconnectedness and interdependence
become so predominantly clear that it
creates a shift in our own behavior and
perhaps collectively as well and that in
its in essence is the heart of the
practice of yoga let's move on thank you
so why don't we take a moment and look
at three of the factors that we outline
on the internal side for social
transformation looking at education we
often discuss what to teach what to
learn there there three hours the
reading the writing their athletic but
there is also then a look at non-formal
education as we try to look at mass
urban migration throughout the third
world you look at fundamentalist Islamic
schools for boys and Pakistan and just
within the last decade the increase has
been a thousandfold and so I think we
need to spend some time looking at what
to teach what we should be learning and
then of course another part of this is
how to learn the focus the attention the
concentration that are essential skills
to sustain to enhance academic potential
Stanford University psychology
department is actually looking at the
effects of mindfulness practices on
learning Philippe golden researcher
notes that we tell our kids a hundred
times a day pay attention pay attention
pay attention and we don't teach them
how Angela hake a principal at a school
in Oakland experimenting with a bit of
mindfulness practice notes that if we
help our children slow down and think
perhaps they will be able to find the
answers within themselves the idea that
they're an empty vessel that need to be
pummeled with facts is long gone if we
can catalyze a sense of who they are
through focus and concentration and
attention they will be able to teach
themselves and so we're the cutting edge
of some of the measurements around the
effects of mindfulness practices in
education the Association for
mindfulness in education Palo Alto a new
center research center in UCLA called
the mindfulness awareness Research
Center mark in LA they're starting to
look at the effects of mindfulness in
learning in education as you start to
look at the social impact of crime and
violence a few little statistics locally
the chief at Highland general notes that
fifty thousand dollars is spent on the
immediate triage of a gunshot wound Don
Blevins the chief of probation at
Alameda County notes that it takes about
a hundred fifty thousand dollars to keep
one kid in juvenile hall there are about
400 kids in detention in Alameda County
and there are thousands across the
country the bureau of justice statistics
notes that it costs about half a million
dollars for juvenile delinquency and
about three times as much about a
million and a half for route criminality
and this is in light of the fact that
we're continuing to fill our prisons to
capacity and spending billions of
dollars building more
looking at health first looking at the
public side the public health department
in Alameda County spends about a hundred
million dollars and the Health Care
Services Agency which includes indigent
health and behavioral health and so on
is about six times as much and that's
just one County and there are more than
3,000 in this country looking at the
private side Kaiser Permanente with the
$31 billion dollar budget serving eight
and a half million customers think what
it would need to be extrapolated to
coverage for all and as they have
evolved their work starting from early
days of Kaiser looking at prevention
shifting through their thrive campaign
to wellness and now starting to look at
self empowerment as a key ingredient to
reach marginalized populations
what are some of the common chronic
conditions that we dealing with if you
just go down the list looking at major
physical systems the musculoskeletal
we're looking at chronic back pain
repetitive strain osteoporosis
osteoarthritis looking at respiratory
issues asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disorder looking at the
cardiovascular hypertension cadpac
diabetes insomnia and Parkinson's for
the nervous system the immune system
with rheumatoid arthritis and ms and
then the mind-body ones distress the
anxiety and depression with their
pervasive effect on many of our health
systems and on body and mind as far as
numbers chronic back pain alone cost
this country in one year a hundred
billion dollars hypertension is that
about and related heart diseases not
including the opportunity costs of
missed work and productivity and so on
is that up at about you know 300 billion
diabetes is at about 130 billion very
quickly you start to see that the
opportunity cost dealing with chronic
conditions is in the hundreds of
millions of dollars if not in the
trillions and of course these are
chronic because the best of Western
science and medicine doesn't have a
solution and so we need to look at
integrative approaches and then there's
the other part of the equation looking
at special populations people who are
battling and coping with
life-threatening illnesses addiction
dealing with aging and then at rest
children and youth who are abused or
neglected or homeless delinquent or
incarcerated so let's just take a quick
break here and actually look at a
two-minute clip of video that will bring
up some of the issues we'll explore in a
moment
thank you for talking
and the lights
yoga helps you trying to find your
breath try to help you concentrate just
think twice about some things fighting
too big into argument with somebody else
just try to find your breath I think
just that sense that you're more than
your cancer and that that you're this
whole person and that there's still this
source of peace and divinity within you
even though we feel very broken and
scarred and sad and terrified and but
but you come here and you get these
reminders of really who you are and the
meditation and the talk and it it's just
incredibly invaluable because otherwise
you get a very skewed picture of who you
r during this process of cancer I've
undoubtedly the oldest member of the
class I'm 88 and I've been coming to
class ever since I married Joel which is
about six years ago she dragged me in
and I discovered how wonderful it is and
I just wished that I had begun this
class about 40 years ago it it makes an
enormous difference in how i feel and i
can't say too much in favor of it
214
perfect
what time perfect
and so you start to see how a self
transformative practice can start to
affect multiple at-risk populations yoga
is a comprehensive multi-component
discipline we use mindful yoga we use
breathing techniques and we use
meditation to be able to to connect with
people wherever they are in whatever
level of evolution of consciousness to
create gentle yet lasting change let me
give you one example of our work with
the Alameda County Juvenile Justice
Center it'll probably highlight the
effective of regular practice we've been
doing a program there for the last year
essentially taking yoga and breathing
techniques and meditation to
incarcerated youth in one unit of
juvenile hall in a fairly intensive
intervention five days a week and so the
idea was to see if with an average
length of stay about three weeks it
could create a bit of shift and
interestingly as we're analyzing the
psychometric data that we've accumulated
over the last year we find that there is
statistically significant decline in
stress and increase in self-control and
self-awareness and so you can imagine
the profound implications of this work
we are just about to expand the program
two more units inside of juvenile hall
into a second facility and the reasons
for program expansion were interesting
the deputy chief of probation bill
fenton came to us and said your programs
are amazing our probation officers in
the field are reporting that the kids
are taking yoga outside of juvenile hall
with them and as we've looked at the
statistics the interesting thing perhaps
one of the interesting things was that
as we compared interventions with youth
that were exposed to the program for
perhaps ten classes or less ten times
versus the ones that were exposed to it
11 times or more that's where we started
to see that little bit
a shift where that statistical
difference came up in stress and in
self-awareness and self-control it's
almost giving you a sense for what
critical mass of self transformative
practice we need to be able to create in
a change that actually seeps underneath
our skin and creates lasting change
as I said before this whole idea of the
impact the awareness of the power and
the potential of mindfulness practices
is all quite new it's only just
beginning to be measured just like Mark
and UCLA and other centers looking at
the effects of mindfulness practices in
education we are about to engage in four
different areas of research within Neoga
one is with the orthopedic
bioengineering lab at UC Berkeley where
we're going to look at specific yoga
poses that will help reduce fracture and
build bone strength and bone density
with people diagnosed with osteoporosis
and osteopenia with our early results
with incarcerated youth UC Berkeley
School of Public Health and UCSF
department of biostatistics wants to
start looking at this a little bit more
that this is quite interesting there are
significant ramifications to this work
at the caroline read breast health
center at summit hospital we're about to
start an independent and a
multidisciplinary study that involves
looking at the effects of yoga and
breath work and meditation to see if it
have it has an effect on reducing stress
anxiety and depression on the
psychological side and then on the
physical side to actually look at
endocrine and immune system function so
those are the kinds of research that are
coming up just the other day I got a
call from a professor at UCSF and who is
in the division of geriatrics department
of medicine basically asking to work
with us on a pilot study where her
primary area of interest is pre
Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment
looking at the aging population and
basically saying it it seems that an
integrative practice of yoga and
meditation could have a profound effect
on the population that she's focused on
and so as we've been trying to build a
model for self-transformation we've been
looking at three elements how do we get
to scalability because the problem is
immense as you've seen its millions of
people trillions of dollars how do you
make the work sustainable and perhaps
how do you make it replicable and so as
we've been looking at this we've done a
few things as a start of a small
nonprofit that's been around for about
two and a half years we built something
called the yogic or a whole bunch of
yoga teachers certified yoga teachers
who are now trained in working with
at-risk populations who are going out
into the community to serve whether it's
homeless shelters whether it's schools
juvenile halls hospitals rehab centers
and so on we're also extracting the very
essence of a mindfulness practice and
training mindfulness coaches who can go
out into schools and other venues who
could be school teachers who could be
institutional staff who could be
volunteers in in companies and so on and
so forth sustainability is being looked
at with a classical social
entrepreneurship model with a
fee-for-service model with the partners
we're looking at building strong
interagency collaboration whether it's
probation whether it's health care
whether it's education and so on and
then starting to build strong
public-private partnerships as well the
replicability piece we've just started
to look at I'll just bring this up to
give you a sense for some of the power
and potential of the work this Oakland
arise project is still very much in the
conceptual stages but the idea was this
that if we could take one generation of
at-risk youth in one problem city like
Oakland with you know the homicide rates
in Oakland you know that half of Alameda
County Juvenile Hall is filled with
Oakland youth some of the most
challenged youth in the country are in
Oakland we said how about this let us
take mindfulness to one generation of at
scoot in Oakland all the way from K
through 12 essentially a 12 13 year
program and we'll take yoga and
meditation and breathing techniques to
wherever these kids are whether they're
in juvenile hall whether they're in
homeless shelters whether they're in
schools or whether they're in parks and
recreation sites so essentially seeding
the community and then starting to see
the effect over the long term and the
sense is that if we do our work right
there is potential to not only transform
that one generation that will be exposed
to the practice but it will actually
affect the generation that came before
and the generation that will come after
for lasting change and that's what we're
dreaming about at this point the idea
that if you can systematically develop
and disseminate self transformative
techniques you can perhaps create a
critical mass to be able to then create
that shift in consciousness that is
collective and perhaps global that
hundredth monkey effect that's what
we're looking for
the benefits of the practice vient
clearly the physical benefits of
strength and endurance and flexibility
and balance and so on the psychological
benefits anger management stress
resilience focus attention concentration
and then the spiritual benefits building
self-awareness and self esteem and self
control self confidence and the beauty
of it is that if we develop these
techniques carefully we can actually
complement enhance integrate and enable
just about all of the other efforts that
are going on the impact clearly goes to
education to health to you development
to community crime and violence into
social justice can start to look at this
list and the list that we were coming up
in terms of the internal factors with
global sustainability we all have to
work eating and breathing and walking is
work we cannot live without working and
yet how do you take work and turn it
into a way of evolving our own
consciousness and that's where the
spirit of service comes in an integrated
approach of head heart and in mind and
letting go of expectations letting go of
a sense of doer ship of ownership in
some ways as Gandhi summarized it
summarizes it when work becomes service
in a in a way work becoming worship
creates a way for us to grow not only
affecting the others that we're helping
or serving but for us to evolve our own
consciousness and of course it comes
from a deep awareness that we are all
indeed interconnected interdependent and
so in closing four points perhaps to
take away one that if you're trying to
make the globe a bit more sustainable
you need to go beyond purely
environmental concerns you need to look
at an integrated and a holistic approach
the external and the internal
that self-transformation is a necessary
condition for global sustainability if
each of us does not consciously leave
the smallest footprint possible on this
planet treads lightly on this planet
global sustainability will not happen if
each of us does not find peace within
ourselves world peace is a mirage that
self-transformation can indeed be
achieved through regular and
dispassionate practice there is a
science a method to this process that
can be learned and can be disseminated
and finally that it can also be
systematically transmitted and
disseminated to perhaps create that
critical mass of self-awareness and self
transformation that can lead into a
bigger shift either collectively
extending out globally thank you thank
you any questions
yes
have done
oh yes we've got these no recidivism is
a longer term study you see Alameda
County doesn't even quite have the
statistics yet to track kids that are
coming in and out of juvenile hall it's
not quite there yet but at least we know
the percentage decrease in stress that
we're looking at over this last year
we've noticed in that one unit about a
twelve percent decline in stress about a
thirteen to fifteen percent increase in
self-control and self-awareness so those
are the kinds of numbers we're seeing
and hopefully this will lead into a more
detailed study longer term of actually
tracking recidivism not only that that's
one part of it the other piece of it
will be to see the impact on actual
community crime and violence as well and
those are what we expect to have perhaps
over the next few years yes yes at this
point I think you know some of these
results would be summarized on our site
and as we continue this collaboration
with alameda county's department of
probation will start to hopefully build
the tools that will give us this
information yes
any other thoughts comments questions
yes
ah if I got your question right you're
basically saying it's a necessary
condition that I have convinced you of
now you're saying could it be a
sufficient condition as well and in my
perspective yes there are external
factors that we need to deal with and
yet the origination of the external
factors comes from the internal and in
that sense I imagine that it could
potentially be sufficient from that
perspective that without that internal
transformation the external
transformation will not happen and in
some ways it may be just enough yes
great
