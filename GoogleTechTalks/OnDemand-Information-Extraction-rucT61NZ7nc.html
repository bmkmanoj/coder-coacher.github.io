the University he's been doing quite a
bit of work in traditional structure
actively present on
on the main scene of big countries
initials process including ACL hi
particular i am a fan of at least some
of his work at his tiny provision
expecially disappears and i'm happy that
you get to see live oh ok ok Thank you
Thank You Mario's I'm very happy to be
here and I don't know how so many people
knows my work but I have been working on
knowledge discovery and recently I
published a paper about that but these
different kinds of work has one
particular topic one particular object
objectives which is on demand
information extraction so I'm going to
talk about on demanded information
session in general and this is not talk
technical talk of individual technique
but it's overview of what I'm trying to
solve the under the name of on-demand
information extraction okay so it's
going to be one hour and please ask me
question if you have in the during the
fog okay so this is me this is me this
is home page but so I this year I was
busy organizing conferences like texture
interment and power press conference and
cheer for the editor for the named
entity and people with such so this is
diarrhea I'm working on and this is the
topics I have been working these days so
main topic is on the money function next
session and I'm going to talk about ie
pattern discovery paralyzed discover
realization discovery and this global
thing and also I'm have been working on
summarization ir and QA and several
basic technologies like English analyzer
named entities career all this is what i
have done at microsoft
and with people such and Japanese stuff
okay I'm not going to talk everything I
just focus on the information next
session okay but is the information
accession maybe many of you may know
that that is a technology to
automatically extract information on
specific scenario from unstructured
thickest like newspaper to make a
structured information like this example
from newspaper the given the topic is
management cessation then we have to
make this kind of table this is
interesting task because this is kind of
understanding text which is our ultimate
goal of NLP so we have been working on
this topic but there is a program a
preparation for knowledge of knowledge
for given scenario is very expensive so
for example we have to find out the
pattern like company announced persons
promotion to position this is a pattern
to understand the event of promotion but
preparing this kind of pattern is very
expensive if you ask people to do this
maybe it takes 11 month or months to do
this and we cannot do for do this for
every different tasks okay and some
people have been doing the supervised
learning to create this kind of pattern
but annotating data is also expensive so
there is a restriction on information
exception in general preparation time
for example in Mac this is a contest
abrasion contestant allow us to do this
for one month so that's that's bad and
because of this the information
accession is limited for specific
scenario or domain that is problem okay
and I'm trying to solve this program
so my goal is tried to make this one
month of preparation time to one minute
okay just one minute so in other word
it's important exception on the fly so
how can I do this one there's two
technologies one is use unsupervised
learning method and this is this is
going to be applied on pattern discovery
and power is discovery also another idea
is a prepare as much knowledge or tools
as possible for as many scenario as
possible okay this is the this is down
for the area of new entity and semantic
knowledge or relations okay so and so
this is the system overview overflow so
how I'm going to solve my body works how
so on the money you information
extraction receive the request from
using the user by the description of
task like I'm interested in bra I'm
interested in management succession I'm
interested in outbreak of disease I'm
interested in explosion of bombs etc you
can ask anything just like a information
retrieval and this box is inside the
system the past information retrieval
system works and accept related relevant
documents then from the relevant
document pattern are discovered and this
the system is going to find 1000
patterns which is not related no
structure in it so we have to find out
this pattern and this pattern are
talking about the same thing we have to
understand the semantics of the pattern
that is Parker is discovering it
automatically find the power place then
we have a set of patterns and we can
apply the saddle pattern to the document
and table will be constructed so in
order to do so we have language analyzer
just like part of the speech agha syntax
analysis so on and extended name an
entity that's I'm going to talk about
and Corey parents so all of this rush as
a unit to do the on the money question
excited and these three components are
very important so I'm going to talk a
little bit for each and then i'm going
to show you the demo the internet is
available right okay automatically
discover automatic discovery of IE
patterns so this is the real bottleneck
and this was done by my student pseudo
so we have to try to find the company
announced persons promotion to position
this is important pattern for this tab
for the promotion event the key idea is
that retrieve document on the given
topic then correct relatively frequent
pattern in the retrieved document
compared to the background document that
may be that may be the important pattern
for this task and the problem is to be
solved is what is pattern pattern format
so my student try to do tried that
predicate argument so predicate and its
subject object or other thing maybe that
maybe maybe the pattern or chain of this
past three or sub tree can be a pattern
and the computation time is very
important we the documents is so big the
piece or pattern possible pattern is
enormous so updates on time is very
important problem to be solved in order
to do it in one minute but the
performance itself the human near human
populace watcher achieved this is a
result and we have three different
models using subtree model chain model
predicate argument model and
okay there's a castle it's a list of
keywords yeah because we are using that
I our component at the beginning so it
has to be the input similar to the IR
engine yeah that's a limitation i'm
going to talk at the end yeah and i
believe in this case we use the keyword
from a scopus ace has a task is how the
description will task and which include
keywords so i use their keyword okay and
yeah so so human human performance is
somewhere here 85 precision 70 Rico or
some somewhere here so that's close to
the that point okay and the next thing
is ok we accept lots of patterns 1000
pattern in the order of preference but
we don't know which we don't know that
for example this pattern and this
pattern may mean the same thing in order
to solve this we done the power of race
between the patterns the relationship
between patterns ok i have three ideas
and this is one of them gianna who is
also my student has been working on this
and the key idea for this parvez
discovery is that the events big events
are usually deported in different
newspaper on the same day you know some
some big guy were killed in I don't know
in San Francisco then another paper made
talk about the same thing but the
expression may be slightly different ok
and this these expressions are
paraphrase know but the point is named
entity maybe the person name location
name date are the same so we can use
these crews as an cards personal name
are the same ok
so I don't know subtle sakina killed and
Mario's past car in San Francisco
yesterday they started shaking it may be
the same much has to be the same and
Maurice the names are saying okay but
the expression may be slightly different
but we can recognize these different
expressions as a paraphrase ok so it's
to look like this so we have a pair of
newspapers and find comparable articles
talking about the same events and we tap
the named entity and use Cory parents to
identify own cars then find a comparable
sentences then exact these as a power
phrase okay and their variation so this
is not really complete creation but the
liquor precision is something like this
sixty-two percent and we cannot really
calculate the legal but it's about six
percent sixty percent fifty percent ok
ok so I'm going to talk about another
issue that's relation discovery by
hasegawa he was a pit stop here visa to
New NYU two years ago two years ago ok
motivation is discovering particular
relationship between lemon entity is a
motivation are so we don't have a
particular relation at the beginning we
want to know all possible relation
between for example people on people or
people on company or whatever the name
Linda t types and for example between
country and presidents there are many
different kinds of relations there or
between companies there are much
radiation parents relation or competing
duration etc we don't know how many are
there so we want to find out what type
of the legend are there and what's an
instance of the division ok this is
completely unsupervised except named
entity
and the idea is idea to do this is
context-based crusting so we try to find
okay next maybe next slide we try to
find a lot of instance of pair of named
entity in the document for example
Disney and ABC we try to find Disney and
ABC company ABC appear in newspaper as
much as possible then we exact a context
between Disney and ABC and we're going
to find expression like dizzy is opening
2 by ABC or Disney is interested in the
ABC desi is negotiating to apply ABC
disease prong touches of ABC etc then we
can find oh there's some relation here
but one particular pair of nirmal entity
is not enough so we have we have an
embedded autauga so we can have a IBM
and lotus or something else and
something else lots of pair of nirmal
entities and we can crusher them crust
at the context cross out the pair based
on the context then we're going to find
all the answer gradation ship which
similar to this or the reservations for
similar to other other relations same so
crass ring will keep will produce a set
of relations ok this is results using
the half year of New York Times and
between people on location we find a
relationship like president senator
Prime Minister governor secretary
Republican and coach and between company
a company we found a lead agency black
merchant acquisition and parent company
the agency and this number is a
variation results we found our 23
relationship and in the crust of
president / 17 of them are correct and
centralization 21 19 out of 20 10 crack
so we just find this and because i have
200 categoryname identity there are
fourteen thousand possible pair of named
Linda teas and for each of them we can
find elevation actually they are not so
many are only particular duration a
particular pair which find several
relations but that's how it works okay
those are the number listed contexts
it's for that relation number failed to
eliminate the fixture these are number
of two particular instance of nominally
repairs so those who have to be correct
or not yeah push on there is this about
comedy like business we just the same
way against appeal from relations yeah
there are several more donations yes but
it's not that much maybe we have a lot
of threshold so on up to the instance
has to be more than five then this is a
result
yeah if the special go down and also we
have to have a threshold here too it has
to have enough evidence so there must be
at least 30 * appear in the newspaper we
know that to have a nice context and
this experiment only used happy open
york times so his experiment ends here
it's this is it
these relations one-way or two-way or
just depression it's one way so we care
about the opposite direction as well so
each each expression visit ok this is
IBM this is rotas not the other way
thank you ok so a variation results so a
lot cross the level it's hundred percent
that means okay this that hope for
example top krasa has lots of
presentations so that's crosta is
correct and okay I have to say this is a
visit words in the context may be in the
top crust ax present appears in the
hundred percent of the instance fears
and second one senator appears hundred
times in the second crust so we named it
based on the top he was and cross a
level is under process any near pier
level is eighty-nine percent accuracy
recall it's not easy to calculate but
people look at all that retrieve the
document retreat pair or named entities
I'm sorry then it's fifty-eight percent
ok and the era maybe come from something
like this Virginia warm a exhaust
present both yet in between the location
Chechnya and both years in there's an
expression like President so the system
think that boss really needs a present
of Chechnya but it is not and we have
missed here like budgeting on the end up
fighting in Chechnya but we cannot
accept this because there is not so
significant context word in this in this
expression I think didn't appear so much
so we cannot exact this mutation maybe
we can expand our corpus or something
maybe
helps but based on help you have news
new york times it didn't work that much
okay and once we achieve this goal we
can expect paraphrase from the that
result because we have a lots of example
like this you know these are shape our
praises but but when I look at the data
it's include a lot of noise of course
between IBM and low-dose anything can
happen so we want to accept only the
expression which talking about these
things so we have two filters used in
more than one pair of interns it's
simple to Peter's it's very simple use
the expression has to be used in more
than one POV instance not only IBM and
lotus for this has to be excused another
pair of news they open new animal
entities and expression has to contain
freaking Tom it's not just an it has to
have some meaningful word then we found
like a bowed be a has agreed by be a
which is buying beef is proposed
acquisition will be these are found us
as a prop raise so that's that's very
nice okay
and there's another idea but that's our
skip you can read my paper okay and then
I moved to the top copy cop named entity
so named entity you jury has seven or
eight categories like location
organization put on the location
organization person etc but that's not
enough if we have a topic or I don't
know disease outbreak we have to have a
name of disease name of medicine etc so
I I try to extract I try to make up the
list of named entities which may be
interesting for the IE task and this
ends up with two hundred categories like
this and this is all man your work so me
and my student just look at the
newspaper look at all possible question
answering questions in question
answering systems or ie path etc and
this is the results and easy still
improving ok I have a division 150 pages
and I have targa which is seventy
percent accuracy which is not good that
our example product name is there is
very very hard to identify so that's
there's a result at the moment ok and
also I'm extending this work or to
finding attribute so when I look at each
instance of these entities like food or
train or I don't know Airport etc we
found that just specific attribute for
each each entity types
then we are making attribute for each as
much as possible it's not for all of
them I cannot make all of them but as
much as possible for example when you
poor person there is an attribute like
vocation nationality carrier masterpiece
graduate from University and hometown
etc and this was done by reading
encyclopedia I let people read 50
example for each category and ask them
to exact possible attribute as much as
possible then actually this is the
number so I believe or pass on there
were 46 six example in the past on
category and 46 of them has vocation
caddy are too good and 39 of them has a
nationality attitude and 26 of them has
carrier etc so this is the order of
importance of frequency and I believe
this is very good resource for the
future okay
when those people that engage with media
to kick to manually tweak these
attributes what they call the Dragons
did they preserve the label that we
found in Texas athelia level of Calexico
level was location in a single media
recipes no no no it's not appearing
there the SAPD encyclopedia usually say
that subtle second a professor at New
York University so there is no labor
like vocation on nationality this is the
conversion and between something that
was found to be little present you can
attribute index ophidian then you have
to like see the label that was before
that location oh ok so we ask the people
those with student to label them by
their in stick by the intuition and then
we we get together and talk about okay
let's name this as a vocation so there
are this yes people named it differently
it was better be the discussion that I
always just curious how much human there
was but I see so there was ready to
disturb disturb this up there are some
people who decided this
okay yes yes exactly yeah we we actually
did internal data agreement of the label
and what kind of a tribute but I
actually haven't published this yet so I
you may find this maybe next year
somewhere okay but this is interesting
thing and I'm working on this so it
works like this ok we get the
description of pass and I our system
works and get the documents and pattern
was discovered and power plays connect
the patterns and table will be
constructed ok let's see so I present
oops okay maybe it's not connected
I can use this
no I presented this demo at a sale this
year and I was scared people may ask
some very strange questions actually yes
they did and had a okay west and and
that it worked or some of them at least
I know there are people who understand
the contact understand the technique and
they give me very difficult questions
but and that time he doesn't he didn't
work but most of the many of the times
maybe seventy percent of the time is
work so okay so you can type in any
keyword and I know this works so this is
this is kind of keywords acquire
position much more job i purchased this
is the limitation of I our system no I
our system needs some keyword which
appear in the document just like Google
maybe so this is a keyword I want to
change this but I don't know how this is
work by I our people know maybe not
maybe me but you can you type in a choir
question much mulch drop by conscience
and it will take one minute so we have
to bear a minute and actually this is a
test the topic in case a variation it
has a 25 or 30 different type of events
and they include the keywords like that
and I just lift up the keywords as a as
an input
now also store it's two other corpus
it's already created index as much as
possible but still it except one
thousand are I think one southern
document and try to find the patterns
which is most likely both pissed out
this topic and etc so calculation is
there but but I don't really look at the
documents in its all indexed documents
pattern and etc okay so based on
acquisition acquire much module
purchased etcetera we have this kind of
table maybe pick one of them
and on the range in 1998 boat or some
group we couldn't identify this mercury
asset management group as our
organization so that's named entity
mistakes 45 point 23 million or
something like this so this is all table
just just what we input is the key word
okay and this is the list of patterns to
create this table so this include to
acquire acquire acquisition etc so this
is good evidence that popeyes was okay
and now we go to document an exacta at
AOL this week the bus the module with
time warner okay so actually two events
appear in one sentence so we could I
couldn't distinguish them yeah there are
many problems are like okay at the
moment this level of that table is name
of named entity level company pay the
money so I want to change this so that
we can see that this is buyer this is ye
etc at the moment I don't know how to we
are working on this tree and so now time
for the demo scary part you can you can
say anything and I'll try to find it so
this has to be a question for
information retrieval system something
I back of the soy
is it right with the past and stuff I
guess sorry agencies I think it's it's
on there already well I believe I ok
another one minute yeah the demo is at
the ACL just people typing anything else
people from Australia typing Australia
what's the event about osteria that's
not scary but one minutes later I found
that the old sports results between
Australia and something australia and
japan Sokka two and three that table was
created so that was very exciting i
didn't expect that but i have never
tried that but it's oh yeah ok attack
and destroy what is this
okay yeah this is a tack event yeah
because we don't have a role Lego we
cannot really see what is right but you
know sounds like
occupant here too
5e 30 soldiers sorry the femur cause
they are all I are yes yes oh no no no
this is not attribute this is named
entities yeah two other name in one of
the 200m identities yes that's right and
for this again is also a nice day yeah
this is 11 years old newspaper this is a
quaint corpus so 1098 to 2001 New York
Times shihan news and a py okay so you
worked like this
get it that is fine I don't want more
difficult question and okay so yeah in
case there's no internet connections
this is this is the table about one
minute to work so this is my NSF project
ending next year so I have done this so
I our one year all you guys know there
are many problems here so I have to
solve it ok and a variation are so
they're 25 or 30 topics in a scopus but
some of them are very rare in the
newspaper like peoples or something so
major I resected only 20 topics in a
scopus and table and ask subjective
aberration I ask people if the created
table is very I'm sorry judge is very
useful for two of them 12 are useful and
six are not useful I asked like this are
is this table are useful to such real
such more document to satisfy your
information need ok this is not a
solution this is just a key crew are the
trigger to such your real data so if you
look at this table and you want to click
this to seem your document etc I think
that that's what this can be done no
this is no solution this is our this
cannot be perfect because the pattern is
not enough the purpose is not clean up
etc so this may be only the help or the
such that's my objective ok anyway and
correctness of the table feeders
eighty-four percent of them are correct
i pick up hundred london rolls and 84 84
of them are correct for is partially
correct and 12 incorrect and many of
them
namenda tiaras so I have to walk on
named entities okay so I talked one two
three four five topics and needs major
major part of this my research so and I
can focus several the others but at the
moment are I can get some questions okay
keep going going home so my students
gianna didn't satisfy what I did and he
tried to expand the idea of on demand
information exception which he called
pre-emptive information extraction and
his ideas we can even delete queries
okay in all of them my demo we have to
type in queries but he tried to delete
that part as well how to do this okay
this is a this real technical program
technical detail but his idea is you can
cross that the document in advance so
you can get the crustal about no
succession event get some other the
event and so on then you can accept the
table or create a table for each cluster
then we don't have to have a query we
can make a all possible table or the
coppice that's the idea okay and
basically what he did is similar to what
i did except the crashing part but the
crusting is not just crossing of the
document its crust are based on the
Athens find a pair of the entities that
have a similar organization in optical a
Catalina and New Orleans hearts and long
long one and Taiwan as alidade as a same
similar relation that can be found from
newspaper then we crust are these
articles
and then we can get the table okay
that's his thesis in very short okay
that's what he did and you can see our
nacl paper order detail ok also lasya I
this is Microsoft Research 41 months and
I i was invited and I gave hit them the
condition that if I can handle I can use
query log I will call then he said they
say yes so i went there and i found a
query log is contains a lots of
knowledge that's very very valuable
resource just like a scandal Mario's did
and what I did is because i have named
entities so I work something related to
named entities okay this side query logs
I don't know six months 1.5 billion
quaildog he gave us they gave us I don't
know how what is this number means but
this is what I had and I also has other
limited addiction airy which contains 10
245,000 I conduct greatest variant of
Britain's as award me etc okay combine
these two what I can do that's what I
did so we extract try to extract try to
extract a name and the context for
example academic award winner there was
a query like this then these are getting
cold in this side so other link old
appears with press winner context so
there are i guess i can create a matrix
between the name of namely entity and
the context to the picture okay this is
a con this is a map matrix so this is
the name of award so make up middle
owner Oscars grammy occurring goals
Eagle Scout etc and the other contexts
trust winners cross pictures
photos histories and this is going this
is a this is a matrix it's big it's
actually I don't know once other or I
don't know maybe 1000 of old names and
millions of context on this side and we
have discount this matrix then what i
did is ok for example look at this plus
picture context this is very common very
common for other name 90d titles well I
want to find the context which is
particular on this category okay like I
don't want to have a X picture as a
world context okay also this dictionary
was created by my student who may be
sloppy like make makeup is one of the
road name so I want to get rid of this
kind of noise actually make up is not
that bad because this is one of the
subcategory of academia or so this is
this is ok but usually people use makeup
as makeup not hardening so I want to get
rid of this thing okay and why is poised
personally it's late and problems three
the list once i have 1000 names of
according name of old award but this is
not enough maybe students are not enough
for some new award appears so i want to
accept I want to find copyright more the
dictionary and this table obviously we
can do the crossing we can cross out a
name we can cross that a context but I
can do okay so i did for them one month
stay
and oh I didn't I don't have a formula
but the key idea is tf-idf kind of thing
okay for example I'll pull the context I
use a tf-idf kind of idea very popular
in this category but not popular on
other categories must be a important cut
important context for this category
that's basic idea and I tried mutual
information chi-square EMI tf-idf etc
but those are not working so well i have
a new formula i created which is not
here but you can see from my paper at
www 07 and does result like this so
academic category epidemic I found that
context like slava degree x BHD x
masters inactive remaining x.x lecture
notes etc upon as important context for
this category doesn't be nice and then
second one I want to delete makeup or
something else so the idea is that the
names in this category has to co-occur
with the important context I thought I
just found a lot of time for example
makeup didn't cocoa with winners at all
it Coco is pictures are not so much miss
are not at all with winners and award
for x so this is less makeup is less
frequently a coca with the important
context so this may be noise that's the
idea and then we found that for example
in book category IT porno space night we
walking Andy these are founders noise ok
actually when you look at amazon.com etc
you will find the book name with this
title but this is not use as a book
named in the crock that's that's this
idea and also I try to populate the list
this is a gander using the context so if
I find the names which koepka with many
of the context many of the important
context but not in the dictionary yet
that may be the name for that category
then I found that golden robes as a
golden globe awards was in the
dictionary etc but putting rose is not
was not al-qaeda Grammys Golden Globe
conduct li w daytime enemy and the
american idol is here so that is nice
make me happy okay and I don't have a
slide for the crust link but crusting
works as well I use what the e/m based
coke restarting between both categories
and both names had names of the
community and the context are clustered
at the same time that's the technology
called coke wrestling and I found that
the name of us are crusted into movie oz
TVO's noble owls etc so that works well
ok that's doesn't talk about this work
at the microsoft ok and last one I
believe the last one is going to be the
web people such so this is a simple task
I organized I'm not participating this I
organized the task witchy witch try to
solve the problem of the same name
disambiguation of the names so for
example John Smith look at the past
hundred result of the difference means
there are so many different John's to
miss there
so the task is how you can accurately
Craster them like this okay oh okay so
this is one of the same boat ask symbol
is home record since well has a coho
proposal of the tasks and there are 27
tasks were proposed and 8018 passport
conducted and they're 100 teams etc and
uh we are one of the past and there were
16 participants and okay and this is the
data we have we have names from
Wikipedia and some components and whip
or sensors and we exactly about 100
pages 100 names for each one under
instance of pages for each names and
there are for example 23 different names
in case of Wikipedia people names etc
okay and this is a result it's not so
interesting the first one is crow karate
University which has a 0.79 F major and
there are many participants here okay
and basically the mini system use this
kind of technology they are just
basically crossing a crustal based on
the different kinds of things named
entities or words or etc as they use
part of speech toggle or some people use
dependency analysis etc okay I know this
was very successful many people
interested in next one so we try to
organize this next event the fall next
year or maybe spring the following year
and we want to include the attribute
extraction as our sub task like for
example in case John Smith you just
don't just cross the John Smith's in
different cut different cutting classes
but we want to know that this Johnston
is is I don't know sailor or this jones
mrs. labor leader and when he was born
and where he was born etc now that's
what we are discussing these days what
kind of attribute we may want to excite
values yes I for each people we have to
extract more value maybe we will give
what kind of attribute we want to
extract and we try to design what kind
of attribute we are interested in at the
moment we found that attribute or depend
different depending on people okay
artist has a masterpiece for the etc and
sarah has different kinds of attributes
so we have to find out agreeable
attribute sec
okay and I have a visitor from NHK the
Japanese company and he's tried to
create a graph or relation of people so
this is broadcast company so he has a
lot of data about movies or stories etc
and he tried to create okay this is a
person who is doing this and this is
brother and he married him are etc so he
wants to draw the picture of Kabbalah
Dacian and this is okay the technology
is that the name NT targa and relation
extraction so that's what we have but
this is nice interface ok that's
basically it so this is my English
analyzer I created called oak system
that's available on the web etc ok so i
think that's good three minutes 42 to
noon so that's what we have done thank
you
personal relationship are you only
looking at TV or summaries or other but
at the moment we are looking at only the
movie summaries yeah do you have any
other ideas even social networks social
network is interesting wonder we try to
analyze takis not just ho current set
size from us so maybe email sounds
feasible vacation
