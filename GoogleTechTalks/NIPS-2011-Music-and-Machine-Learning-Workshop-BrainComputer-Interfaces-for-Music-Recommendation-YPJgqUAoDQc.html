isn't a little video of the actual
experiments were doing and how the
musical relation is working with ray
machine and eventually I'm going to walk
through holes in detail so
o Musa um they keep that battle tourism
selects the music could we take you to
your desired mental state where this
about to pandora is a genome project
that captures the essence of music
replies it to a person's new faces
greater amazing maximize the hope that
as we get an activity and automatically
finds me as a winner in the motorcycle
engines to surrender this goes to 32
comments the movie based jukebox room
analyzer and a music remove murder
july's the listeners crime movie these
Emotiv EPOC your head center this is a
revolutionary personal interface for
human-computer interaction the Emotiv
EPOC is a hypo solution neuro signal
acquisition and processing wireless
neural head center uses a set of sensors
to tune into electronic signals produced
by brain the tens person's thoughts
rulings and expressions connect
wirelessly most pcs
music murder mrs. amy enforcement
learning algorithm to identify which
combination of songs gets the listener
to a desired mood and sends this
information to the jukebox the merchant
box ties it all together the listener
loses the control to something desired
moving an L below you can see the
current mood as reflected by measure the
brainwave activity using the mood
analyzer two thoughts play songs based
on the information received for the
music learner let's go together
and something right she said
fundamentally wrong someone who actually
made my genius entrepreneurship a
mistake
so now that choose a different go
straight and saying I get some money you
under jelly
mission what we were leaves this song
vigorously jack
the gross
alright so this is the joint war and she
she got a Robin care master from minus
appreciate Israel in redmond and I'm
from detective so we saw they do and
what are going to talk about it's
basically how can you learn from a brain
machine data not exactly when explaining
every kind of detail but a minute so you
know what exactly we did with that then
I'm going to talk about their
enforcement learning like in general
just to leave sometime background for
your people will know exactly for me
other than this and eventually I'm going
to talk about taking all this rain
machine data a reinforcement learning
data and actually combined to her
invasion system specific from the music
and I'm going to show up empirical
results we were actually trying to
prepare our algorithm to something which
is quite common for your ensure that
users kinda like so hope you actually
measure brain signals so we used a
imitative ET helmet is something that
you can bar like five hundred dollars
this is a half size of even cats that
usually people play complete list
difficult actually census some of your
nations let's say
very energetic and ideas basically give
some her tools for getting offers to
develop better games so let's say many
games in my time getting angry together
no more but so but the more bad stuff
for parents which cost much more how
does it look like this and most of them
are my productivity and you have to play
some different parts of the brain and 0
on the Edmonton very naturally sensors
some electrical pulses which is from the
court eh its ongoing most of this
handset County well actual to it it's
you befriend a lot of people being
examined that has that we had Australian
1500 people what they actually do is
based on the 19 other tools you have it
gives us soon and based on those
different signals that creates features
ok so for example this back through how
much time it's different windows using
others different features they playin
some time machine learning classifier
and they classify it to let's say what
we have is for Aleutians a meditative
reflective but basically what they did
is take a lot of people bring them where
the sound get all of let's say Ron data
from the National Roads create different
features for those pins and traditional
classifier off whatever you want and so
we use those classifiers and they
actually provide us with a king
and quick word about Chris attorney so
we're interested in learning has
amenities like what sets of slides
actually about learning how to eat
successfully achieve a goal all eternity
with an external environment Sofia round
of Allah and your leads anytime I'm
going to go as get the cheese this isn't
that he doesn't know what's going to
happen in the middle domains can
actually gets in the rewards a or
negatively what's it say too much into a
wall so this type of learning actually I
learned giving an initial state of being
and amis and holistic some interactions
door policy for awkward summary reports
again so what's interesting in this type
of learning levels basically think about
like to listen to music so I listen to
music I get let me get feedback right so
the person becomes happy person becomes
energetic and tell you like the song
okay so think about like how you can
actually use those signals everything
from the silver screen green it is
facial expression and haul it off
promise for yourself it's what Saints
doing this it's expedient so we don't
have to do this headset folder stuff and
there's our form of country music
different facial expressions all those
handset supposed to be our focus
articles okay so other more about the
refreshed learning so basically you have
an agent so let's say robot in our case
this is the new listen to music and you
have this environment can perform
actions probably for backward can have
states so the different states is they
say the states in the maze game at say
you have this for each year in squares a
square can be
stained and whether in what ways for
some squares you can get by say a small
prize so we can collect any present in
the way and the last thing is this is
what you actually need to learn is the
policy so somebody actually gave you the
role state cheese exhumed this square
and you have to find the policy which
gets you the most reward at I'm and what
we do is actually trying to use this
framework or so and some people get here
much faster than others and or some
people have meditated much faster so the
thing is if you can get this data winded
wars in some other way without using
just being a my stuff so that would be
but asking the person every time you
know let's take the speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
