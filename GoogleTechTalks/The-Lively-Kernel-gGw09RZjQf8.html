introduce Dan Ingalls I'd like to say
that Dan Ingalls I think of as one of
the architects of the modern world he
was one of the original architects of
small talk the object-oriented
programming system that's essentially
the ancestor of all modern
object-oriented languages he designed
the small talk 76 virtual machine which
was the first practical implementation
of these ideas and he's done very
fundamental work and bringing
object-oriented concepts out through the
user interface the bit blit graphics
primitive but also the febri programming
environment a lot of contributions to to
squeak and others and now he's brought
many of these things to the world of
javascript in the browser so dan thanks
mark this worked ok if I'm not hovering
knew that yeah it sounds that way so I'm
going to be talking to you about the
lively kernel which is a project we're
doing at sun labs and it's not just me
there a number of us doing it I'm one of
the principal investigators along with
an throat eyeball sorry who's in Finland
and then we also have a visiting
professor in Finland Tommy Makonnen and
Christophe Polacks who's here in the
audience he's in Menlo Park with me and
you know anything here that looks like
it might be hard to do most of its easy
but some of its not Christophe is done
he's been great and then we also have a
couple of other collaborators Steve
Euler who's here with us
he said son labs and Steve knows all
about all sorts of things but among
other things sound and he's been around
a lot with user interface design of
layouts so he's sort of been been doing
this in that and we look forward to him
doing more Richard Ortiz has helped us
with the website some and and then we
had a couple of interns from Finland
also
who helped with some of the applications
that I'll show and now my way of giving
a talk is just to give a demo typically
so let me just jump into that but I will
start with a little sort of bit of
history about how this project going it
started with a dinner conversation I was
having dinner with Antero and we were
sort of on Terry just given us sort of a
summary course on web programming and
and I had been thinking about web
programming and we were just sort of you
know this pause came when we sort of
both were saying there must be a simpler
way you know how can this be so
complicated the machines are so much
better we knew how to do things fairly
simply 30 years ago why is it getting
harder so we started scratching our
heads about that and we went off on
several tangents about how to make
JavaScript faster or this or that and
eventually things kind of converged down
on this basic idea that there is a
dynamic language that's out there in
every browser it's JavaScript and we
both it was in both of our hearts that
what you needed was a dynamic language
and the basic graphics library and that
that ought to cover most everything XS -
so so the kind of approach we adopted is
to say this is kind of the conventional
stack of web programming it starts out
with an operating system because you
network in graphics a browser that sort
of makes that available through the
document object model and here we get
into the history of how the web started
and with the document object model in
HTML a text markup language what a great
place to start and then on top of that
worlds of widgets that got built and
then JavaScript came along kind of
later in the game to add some dynamic
behaviors the ability to you know test
for things and what we're trying to do
is a little bit different which is to
take the same the same substrate and
because what we you know what we're
starting with is the operating system
and the browser part of this what we
wanted to do in this project we both had
some experience with systems that we did
all ourselves in a proprietary way and
they were wonderful but they had trouble
going anywhere so we thought we'd start
with what everybody's working with and
then maybe things could go somewhere and
then instead of copying all this sort of
complicated world we just wanted to take
JavaScript on the browser and then build
the widgets that would be needed for
doing most of the sort of you know mom
and pop software on top of this and that
is the stack as we look at it and some
of the other frills that we might want
to put such as the effects of cascading
style sheets and stuff we figured we
could do in that environment so that's
the approach and as you might guess I'm
running the system now what you're
looking at is a web page and I think if
you know if there's one thing I'd like
you to get through all of this is it's
not complicated it's really easy you
know so so this entire system is ten
thousand lines of code which seems like
a lot but it's something you know you
can give to a grad student and you can
play around with it and do a useful
thing in a day or a week you know so but
I'll just kind of take you through a
little bit of how it's built you see
here some simple graphical objects on
the screen a rectangle and ellipse and
so on and so one of the first if you
think of the page that comes off into
your computer and starts running and
then one of the neat things about this
system is it never needs to be installed
it just runs when you
one of the first things you might like
to do is to be able to take the shapes
and pick them up and move them around
and another thing I have to sort of a
disclaimer I have to make is that a lot
of this is in a primitive state and some
of the features we're using in the
browsers are in a primitive state in the
if I go to the beta version one of the
special beta versions of Safari then
this would have had a nice drop shadow
on it but but if it it this all runs in
standard Safari 3.0 so as I say you have
the one of the first things you have is
the ability to pick objects up move them
around so you can think of that as
you've got your basic graphics library
and then how much does it take to do
that not much you know half a page
something like that then the next thing
you might want to do is to be able to
copy objects so you can do that and this
is this is pretty simple to do you know
how hard could it be and I'll make a
couple of these and then the next thing
you might want to do is to be able to
edit the objects so what you what you're
seeing here so here if I get near this
part of the ellipse it it Springs open a
little handle that I can edit things
with so what you're seeing here is along
with the code to to move objects around
to copy them there is a little bit of
graphics editing in there too but it's
done in a very uniform way so that
basically that little handle that came
up is just another one of these objects
let me play around here a little bit
more like that and so once you once you
can do that you can edit objects move
them around the next thing you might
want to do is to be able to compose them
and we have a very simple rule here
which is that if you drop one object on
another
and when you let go the cursor is over
the the the target then they stick
together so this is now a compound
object again each of these is just you
know little half page code probably less
when you put them all together and there
are other things that come with the
system so here's a polygon I make a copy
of that and it's got mmm the same kind
of graphics editing in it you can pick
up the vertices and the one it's got one
nice thing about it is that you can you
can go in the middle of a line and you
get a different kind of a handle and
that just makes more vertices and so you
can do that and and if you move one over
a nearby vertex you can see the handle
turns red maybe you can't but it does
and that gets rid of that vertex so
that's just a really bare bones little
polygon editor and we could pick this
guy up and drop him there make this guy
happy
so and this is all done I'll take you
back to a little bit of history the
first version that we did with this used
the canvas graphics model and we worked
with that for a while but we wanted it
one of the things we wanted to do was to
be able to make a kernel that would work
nicely in mobile environments so it was
important to us the things be able to
arbitrarily scale and rotate and the
canvas environment did not have that a
good answer for that in the space of
text so so last summer we sort of
latched on to SVG in this current
version I'm showing you is using SVG and
and what's what's nice about that is
that then with SVG you can do so this
whole whole object is nicely scalable
you know and and you can rotate it like
that and so this in and copy so you've
got a
basically it's not like what we want to
do is have people building frogs but
this is a stand-in for the basic
operation of building up complex
graphical objects from simple ones and
making that simple and the one other
ingredient that I'll show you is at this
simple level is you can have objects
that have scripts on them that tick so
that's how you get a dynamic object like
this star and make a copy of it like
that and as you might guess if you take
something and compose it on that it
inherits so and you can you can have
lots of fun with this so that's the I
guess the other message of this talk is
that all the systems I've worked on if
part of the goal was not only to make
them simple in general but to make them
fun and and this is sort of fun to play
with so if I take a copy of this star
and draw it if I can drop it on right
there on that one you see it's picking
up the rotation relative to the other
guy okay so and that's not magic I mean
you've got a very simple programming
language here it's just set up in an
architecture that preserves the
generality right so now let me talk to
you a little bit about the structure of
this world so this came as a web page
and and we have ways of linking web
pages in this system but we also have a
way to have linked worlds within a given
scope of objects and that's what I've
got here and this is actually a sub
world of another world that I'm going to
go out into and this has some stuff I'll
talk to you about later and I'm going to
go in here to another world called
development tools and just sort of
continue the process of building up this
graphical world I guess the first thing
I'll show you is that little piece of
code up in the upper right which may be
hard to read so make it a little bigger
and one of the nice thing things is that
the text editor is all written in
JavaScript so it inherits all these
properties and in fact one of the one of
the things we often like to play with is
is let's see we get this okay so here's
a little piece of code and I'll read it
to you in case you can't read that it
says let P be a new pin said it's pin
color to red and then go through a loop
from from 1 to 40 telling the pin to go
that distance times 2 and then turn 90
degrees and then draw the resulting
lines so let me move this guy out of the
way and come up here and if I execute
that then I get this figure here and
what's nice is it isn't just scribbles
on the screen it actually created an
object that captures those graphics and
you know you can get in here and mess
around with it too you know and and you
can you know you can make little changes
to this if we turn not quite in 90
degrees but only 89 degrees then it has
this nice sort of processing quality and
you can have lots of fun playing around
for that but again this isn't about fun
geometric well it is it's partly about
how easy and fun it is to do little
geometric games but but more importantly
here's a swatch of JavaScript that I've
tried out two versions of now you know
in a few seconds so this could have been
a little piece of code that was there
doing some piece of screen scraping
where I was looking for stock prices and
I'd you know I tried have to changed a
bit try it out so that's in the other
the other aspect of this is that from
that graphic vocabulary that we started
out with that came with the operating
system that came with the browser we've
now extended it
so we can make up objects that hadn't
been thought of in the operating system
and use them in the system just have a
sip here so now what I'd like to do is
to continue that process of building up
and out of the very simple graphics so
here I have it's sort of a widget test
panel if you will so there are two
things going on here which is we've
built using very simple little swatches
of JavaScript some conventional widgets
and this test panel also has the
property to sort of try out an MVC style
model so that a lot of them have common
models underneath them so here's a
button and the one below it is hooked to
the same boolean but it's the one on top
is one of these things where it goes
when I push and this one down below just
changes when I push but they're hooked
up to the same boolean and here we have
a piece of text says hello world if I
select that and say hi and accept that
then you'll see that the other three
panels we're looking at the same model
this one however down here has a
continuous update property so so that so
this is just trying out various little
text things that have a common model and
you may have noticed the one below is
testing the fact of that these guys have
an output that is their current
selection so if I select there then it
gives the selection down below or it
actually will do it dynamically while
I'm going along there
okay and over here we have a little bit
more text but this text is made into is
in the form of a list and in fact it
does have some scripts on it that gives
it lists like behavior and its neighbor
is viewing that same model of what the
selection is and down here we have
some rectangles that are like those
rectangles I showed you in the first
screen but they've been put together
with a little bit more scripting so to
work as a kind of a slider and you can
see they've been hooked to this text
panel up above and it's been done by
directionally so if I changed that to
0.8 then it jumps over that way and you
might guess that what this one here is
doing is giving me the extent of the
slider so if I change that to 0.3 then
it changes that way and what else
well this one's got a little piece of
generality in its code nothing
earth-shaking but you can see that it
works horizontally and vertically as
well okay so so now we're at the point
that we could actually start to do some
useful software remember there's nothing
native here all this is is the graphics
that came with the browser and
JavaScript but I think you can see that
if you take those things we built and
put them together
here's that slider doing service as a
scroll bar here's that list showing a
list of items that you can select and
what we have here is actually a class
browser looking at the classes in the
system that's running so for instance
let me let me go get us a little
application that we can be looking at
while we're looking at the code I'm
going to go back to that outer world I'm
going to pick this clock up and so here
we've got drag and drop of a live
ticking object and we'll now drag it
through this wormhole so now we're
looking at the clock and here in the
list is the code for the clock and like
everything else it's pretty simple it's
got it's got a little constructor thing
an initial
most of the work here is is in this make
face routine but it doesn't mean make a
bad face it means draw the the numerals
and you can see it's sort of most of it
is here in this loop that goes from 1 to
12 putting out the numerals and it will
leave either duro minor or irregular
Latin numerals so that's all that code
there this creates three hands called
hours minutes and seconds not
surprisingly so that's all that code and
then if you look at this thing called
start stepping scripts every object in
this system when it's dropped in the
into the world gets sent this message
start stepping scripts so that if it
wants to do stepping behavior it gets up
it gets given a kick start and this one
you can see it says send the send the
start steppin message with a parameter
of a thousand milliseconds and the
procedure set hands the method set hands
so if I look at that code you'll see
that this is what it does on every
second pick it gets the current date and
it computes the second a minute and so
on and then down here remember these
hours minutes and seconds those are the
names of the hands so if you take a look
at the seconds it says set the second
excuse me
tell the seconds to set its rotation to
the current second value divided by 60
times two pi looks right right and we
could actually we could go in here and
change that to be minus two pi just to
be devilish and accept it and now we've
got a clock that runs backwards okay so
that's just indicate that everything
that's here is here in a live way and
that applies to the clock or to the
actual parts of the system if you wish
and and again since this object itself
is all
you know it's all made in using these
same components it can be scaled and
rotated arbitrarily and it just keeps on
working so in fact and I can go back and
unfix that so we're back running that
way so so that's the basic way that we
start out with a simple web page that
just allows you to you know move
graphics around add a few scripts build
up some widgets and pretty soon you're
into the space of integrated development
environments and now what I'll do is to
show you just a few things that we've
that we built in the in this system
here's here's a window one of the things
I neglected to show you we have a sort
of a I'll go back to where we were just
so you get a sense of it you notice
things look pretty primitive in this
world all the shapes are very
rectangular you can you can you can come
up to any object and ask to view its
style so I can come up to this widget
test panel and view its style and I
could go and move this slider over and
round its corners like that and I might
set its border width to be a little bit
more and I might give it a border color
that's sort of more consonant with this
background and just to make it look sort
of modern you know we could make it look
translucent so that now when you pick it
up and drag it around it you know one of
those nice controls so here again it's
the system working on itself and
allowing you to make changes like that
and and I guess you could even take
let's see here look at the style of the
style panel and said it's okay say you
have that kind of control over
everything and then and we sort of built
into this a very primitive sort of
facility for I'm gonna get rid of that
it's kind of well leave it there for a
minute because just to make a point but
we put it got a sort of a simple
facility that's along the lines of
cascading style sheets which allows you
to to specify style in an inherited way
so if I go down here and say choose
display theme the theme that was in this
window was primitive and that's why
everything's very rectangular I'll
choose the lively one which is our
default and you see all of a sudden all
of the windows you know got their title
bars rounded and and the scroll bars got
a slightly different fill and title bars
got a gradient fill so there's that kind
of control there it's all pretty simple
to do so now I'll go back to where I was
and you can see that this is in that
style
these windows are and and these are just
simple little applets that you might
want to make hues one that shows the
current graph of the stock market in it
and then it's got RSS feeds for Dow
Jones and for Nasdaq and you know the
price of your favorite stocks and stuff
like that and got a very simple little
sort of 3d ish little demo here we've
got no software system is complete if it
can't do asteroids
and I won't take time with that but
that's how that works here's a little
weather widget for San Francisco
it's got San Francisco temporary finland
you can guess why that's there and we
can see what the weather's like there
I'm glad we're where we are and let me
I'll show you a couple a couple of other
applications done here's a Google map
sort of application there and you can
scroll around and here's another RSS
feed guy where now you can look at the
contents below each of these but you can
see that these are all made up of those
simple primitive widgets that were built
so simply others get a little a here's a
little movie player' yeah this is
something about some guy who strapped
leaf blowers to a bicycle to make them
and let's see what else we got here
this is I don't know if if you know the
the canvas scape demo but this is a here
we've got that running in this system
and you can see these things all sort of
run together there's a lot of we have
work to do on the performance still but
as near as we can tell a lot of the
performances going into the API I'll
come back and talk more about this
between the underlying system and the
graphics so here in this one I think I
can oh yeah that's right this is a funny
little aspect to this don't be alarmed
so here you can move around in this
little 3d space
and coming back here so those are a
bunch of the sort of simple applications
and then I did one application that's
more complicated than the others in
terms of its sort of actual you know
programming model if you will so this is
a model of abba gasoline engine and you
can see it sort of changes color
depending on whether it's taking in or
compressing the gas and it turns yellow
and it explodes and stuff like that and
this is set up to be any number of
cylinders also so you can do this and
part of the this this was a piece of
tutorial software that I wanted to do
for a long time because there's a funny
thing about building a radial engine
which is that first of all it doesn't it
doesn't run smoothly if you do this sort
of simplest thing I'll stop this and
step it through so we've got at the top
is where it's compressing it's about to
fire and then the next one is to the
right of it that was 90 degrees the next
one below you know and then here and
then because it's a four cycle engine
the whole thing just idles for a whole
revolution so you wouldn't want to build
one like that unless you like vibrations
in your airplane but even there so we'll
change to an to an alternate firing
order and and step it now so now you'll
see the one on the right is about to go
and then the one on the left 180 degrees
later but now it's going to fire the one
at the top just 90 degrees later and so
we've got we've got an irregularity
there and it turns out that if you build
a radial engine using a four cycle
engine the only way you can make it run
smoothly
is to have an odd number of cylinders
okay so if you now step this through
you'll see the familiar five pointed
star
it's going to go off on the upper right
and then the lower left and then the top
and then the lower right so this is a
demonstration of that and if you look at
any radial engine in an airplane you'll
find that it has an odd number of
cylinders and it's set up for you know
you can choose seven and/or nine any of
those so that's that's where I wanted to
take with the demo I think what I'll do
is to just come out and talk a little
bit about the system and then open it up
for questions so let me yeah and move on
there so some statistics about it as I
said it's about 10,000 lines of code
about 300k of that is in the kernel
which is the graphics architecture and
the widgets that I've showed you and
this is 300k uncompressed and with
comments ok so it's something like you
know a third of that if you compress it
and and so on there's another another
hundred and K another hundred K there of
kind of adaptation and workarounds and
so an example of workarounds well let me
digress for a minute here is very
interesting doing this project because
you can sort of tell that people haven't
done this before because the programming
language is set up to be a scripting
language so it's got lots of features
that make it better for scripting like
sort of forgiving many errors but it
makes it much worse for programming
because you've got the errors and the
problem is you find out about them about
three you know three cycles later when
it's harder to debug and with the
graphics we found that you know lots
lots of the graphics
are fairly solid except that if you want
to for instance lay out text typically
that's done elsewhere on some server
before squirting out HTML and a lot of
these systems both in both in the canvas
model and the SVG model if you ask them
for the geometries of the text it's hard
to get that and it's often wrong so so
along with this adaptation which is sort
of the API that gets us through the Dom
to the graphics calls are some
workarounds so for instance Christophe
had to do lots of work to get in and
find out from from through the Dom the
real measurement of these characters
because SVG wasn't giving it to us
accurately in this system or that now
those are things that will all get
worked out it's you know there are parts
of the browser graphics and language
systems that are solid because they've
been used for 10 years and these are
parts of them that haven't really been
used until now
and they'll get solid and then there's
another 120 Kay of sort of JavaScript
extras this includes
Crockford prototype stuff and a little
bit of other kind of structuring
mechanism so where we're going you can
see things are still in a fairly
primitive state but they're going
forward it's it's it's gratifying to see
how much you can already do in a system
that's so simple we want to complete the
IDE that we've got so we have in there
the ability to do you saw well you
didn't see it all but there's an
inspector that lets you inspect objects
and and we've got some measurement
facilities I'll show that to you later
on and we've actually got one of the
nice things about JavaScript is it is
pretty general and so for instance you
can you can just tell the system to wrap
everything
well let's see as it normally comes to
you you can't inspect the stack but what
you can do is wrap every procedure that
puts the stack on a stack and then when
you when you get an error you can look
at what you created so so it takes a lot
to keep us down I guess is once a way of
saying that we want to hook that browser
that I showed you was decompiling code
so that that was simple to do what we
want to do is to hook it up to our real
code repository using web dev and we
have there is web dev code in here for
doing that and at that point when we
make changes then you know it'll
actually be in our repository and we'll
be advancing the system with every
little change that's where we want it to
be we had an earlier version of the
system that was collaborative in the
sense I don't know if you noticed during
the demo and when we go back there
you'll you'll probably always be looking
at it now this little sort of fly
following my cursor that was the actual
hand object that's a part of the morphic
graphics model and there can be several
of those and in an earlier version of
this system that we did on top of Java
2d Christophe actually got a whole
synchronization mechanism going so that
you could have multiple people working
in the same world using a comment style
update and so we're you know now that
we've got this all working with SVG
we're going to go back and revive that
so that you can have you so that you
could really do a sort of a
collaborative whiteboard this way and
other things like that and then the the
last sort of point I want to make about
this environment and it's it's got to do
with how small it is also which is that
whenever you build a self-supporting
system the neat thing is that in you
know in its little universe that's all
there is so if you want to do some
experiments like if you want to try to
put this in 3d you
nothing more that you have to work on
then then the code that's there and so
we want it we want to play around with
that we're also interested in looking at
smaller faster JavaScript smaller faster
SVG libraries and especially the
interface between them so if any of this
looked a little logy to you it does to
me a lot of the problem has to do with
the fact that the SVG that you get given
in a browser is given to you through the
Dom interface and for an example every
time you you make any call that has a
color in it we've got a perfectly good
RGB color object sitting out in our
system to go through the Dom interface
the the red green and blue all have to
get converted to a text string which
then gets parsed and taken apart on the
other side of the interface this is not
the way you do fast graphics but it
shouldn't be hard to do some experiments
to get around that and and then again
the opportunity with a system like this
is to you know along with experimenting
with you know other other languages or
whatever there's and this relates
specifically to the caja project here
it's fairly easy to take a system like
this and try it all out in some variant
say some variant of JavaScript and the
nice thing is that if you can just make
it work then you know that sort of all
of this stuff will come along with it as
soon as you get it working so so that's
something that we're looking forward to
exploring and both mark and I have been
talking around this except we've both
been busy with other things for the last
month I wanted to show one thing just
actually I think I'll open it open it up
for questions and if people want to go
into some of the ID issues I can show
you a bit of that so that's the end of
the formal presentation yeah this looks
terrific with with power comes
responsibility and in particular with
a mobility there's a class of things
that malicious people can do with mobile
code and I wonder if you have any
thoughts about what's different in this
system from all other mobile mobile code
systems so it's it's no different in in
sort of all of the downsides and the
upsides and that's so there are various
answers to that mark is working on an
important one which is how to really
organize your universe in terms of
capabilities so that so that you can't
do damage unless you're supposed to be
able to do damage the the other thing
you can do is you can divide it up and
and allow somebody to work in this
lively world but only share things that
are not lively in dangerous ways but
there's there's no magic here in that
regard yeah hey
be kind of your work with small talk and
didn't this so it's great to get to be
here um I'm with the Google gears team
uh-huh
and one of our goals is to augment
current web browsers with new
capabilities so very interested to know
what kinds of facilities would make your
software more easier to build faster
along those lines - yeah so we I can see
lots of overlaps there the I guess the
first one that occurs to me is that I
had a lot of fun in a former life time
doing the system called fabric which is
it's a visual programming language in
which you have objects on the screen and
you hook them up just like in Google
gears except that it had a different
model okay I should just make sure I
mean are you aware of of what gears is
just it's it's a it just plugs new
features into web browsers and like
offline access and yeah so it's not
visual okay okay yeah so I guess I was
thinking of the interface on top of it
yeah
so yeah so
that would be a nice opportunity so if
we wanted to play with a better a sort
of more appropriate graphics model to be
a great way to do that and also
alternative JavaScript engines one of
the things I didn't talk about is from
our experience working with JavaScript
it would appear that you could have a
considerably simpler language that
probably could be executed quite a bit
faster and still have very much the same
feel so yeah I think that would be a lot
of fun and I don't know if that's the
kind of thing that you're getting at in
that way
thank you yeah thanks cool I've only
dabbled with squeak and I guess that's
how I've kind of seen how you know all
these different ideas it looks looks
very much like that and also I know that
small talk was kind of the originator of
unit testing the unit test talk
whereas unit I was curious is there a
lively kernel unit or how do you test it
it's basically my question do you have
automated testing hmm there probably
should be and we sort of rushed into it
without having done a lot of that so
that's an opportunity that sits there
for some of the people who want to come
along and work on the project was it is
there like a technical like oh shoot we
have to solve this other problem before
we tech letterers just limited time and
just haven't gotten to yet I think it's
sort of the the background of the
participants and the in the headlong
rush but and that's not to say that you
can't go fast the other way but anyway
that's that's the way it currently is we
I think I see that as being you know
another component when we when we get
the the repository online is to get some
of those facilities in there soon cool
thanks yeah currently just to add one
one little PostScript to that you asked
how do you know that things are working
one thing about systems like this end
like squeak and and which is to the
extent that they are still a small
kernel you find out immediately if
something doesn't work because
everything's using everything all the
time yeah
another question so small talk squeak
and this have really similar sort of
user models and user interface and
they've had difficulty gaining adoption
are there any sir let's learned about
usability and and how to get these kinds
of systems in the hands of more
mainstream users yeah I think well there
there's the perennial push and pull
between what native widgets and and and
self supporting systems so in this
system it's all written in the lively
kernel itself the upside is if you put
it on any machine it's going to behave
the same and that's the this is also
true of Smalltalk systems and so on
the downside is that one of your
customers may really like his windows
that he's got running on his system and
he wants it all to look that way and
moreover when he upgrades to his new
operating system he wants to inherit all
those new properties so the way this has
been handled typically in the past is
that somebody takes a good bit of care
to establish a layer over the user
interface that that has implementations
that are self supported and small on the
one hand like this and and there's
another implementation that you can use
alternatively that goes to native
Windows and then you know some work is
done at the boundary to make sure it's
all compatible so that that lesson has
been learned a while ago what you see
here is just the self supporting system
all written in itself just because that
was you know we're on a proof-of-concept
roll here and we wanted to get that
working but that is a piece of work that
needs to follow here if we want to see
general adoption I'm sure yeah
an earlier Sun project with something
called News Network extensible windowing
system and one of its facilities was the
ability to partition an application
across multiple machines so you could
have something running doing some
graphics work on your desktop but doing
some compute work on a remote machine
and to some extent how you partitioned
it was negotiable according to your
network connection speed and so on and
so forth
and I wonder if you thought at all you
mentioned having collaborative desktops
I wonder if you thought at all about
taking things and partitioning them
across multiple systems in that way the
answer is that the topic of news has
come up and Christophe was particularly
interested in that do you want to say
any words about that
and something that both both ends when
we say
saying when programming language it's
already going to be better than ooh
so yes it says nothing to notice it
seems like people want to run
application server
alerting
yeah so this sort of system where DUI
you can drag and drop stuff and they do
visual things it's very fun for demo
sort of thing in my opinion but there is
the perennial problem with the you know
with the difference between more for
declarative system like hTML is from a
programmatic and even more to the
extreme from a visually driven
programmatic language where you know the
system has very little information about
what things actually are rather than
other than what the programmer decided
to put as very specific things in there
do you have thoughts on that yeah so
you're right about that
and the the ways I've dealt with that in
the past is that you complete a system
like this by allowing the object to
essentially print the kind of
declarative specification that has that
they've been built to be for people who
want to work in that textual space or
get programmatic control over it and you
should also be able to build things in
the system that same way so I look at it
as kind of another piece of you know
this is a drag-and-drop GUI builder
there should be another piece there that
lets you specify a window textually if
you want to but even that wouldn't give
you like sort of declare like for
example if you wanted to go back to your
demo and use it without touching the
mouse you wouldn't be able possibly to
do that because the system has no real
concept between the difference of what
is a window from what is a bar slider or
something else
it doesn't really know what things are
other than them being lines and being
drawn on the screen and being SVG
objects there may be tighter code you
can't you key in a webpage you would be
able to say yes this is a heading this
is a footer this is a text field which
is the
and from combobox and none of these
things is built in any system that is
non-declarative that I have really seen
and I well yeah so this is true about
the parts that you just put together
with drag-and-drop you're right about
that
if you look at the objects that are in
the widget set that I showed you'll find
that there is semantics there so you
know a scroll you know a scroll pane
knows that it has a scroll bar and and a
clipping frame and and all that other
stuff I don't know how to answer you you
know sort of briefly except I think you
need both aspects and and if somebody
tries to build something doing nothing
but drag and drop you're right they
won't have that other semantic base it's
just like programming by example if
somebody deletes a file they don't
there isn't anything anywhere that
recorded why they deleted that file you
know that if that if the reason they did
it was that it's name began with this
and they want to get rid of all of those
so you've got the same kind of
comparison there before the dragon
between the drag-and-drop construction
and the declarative model as you do
between you know one-off actions in on
the screen and the sort of programming
by example field yeah thanks so it
sounded earlier when you're asked about
adoption that you suggested that the
reason why we hadn't seen more small
talk
squeek adoption was that the windows
didn't look like the operating system
and I'm really just not buying that
right like we've had small talk we've
had speak for a really long time and
these are frequently shown up as a low
look it's a great prototype of what like
what's what's the business model or
what's the development model like you've
got some buttons you push them they go
beep that's great but in a deployed
application I certainly don't want
people to be able to arbitrarily
interact with or browse the code and
like I would really like to see some
kind of like
what is it you hope people built other
than like saying I hope people build
it's perfectly legitimate in educational
environments or in white boarding
environments do you see this as being
useful beyond that because I really just
don't see the model that you're
replicating as with the earlier question
about adoption having ever really made
it okay so can you see any analogy
between this sort of environment and
mashups I think that this sort of
environment is perhaps a bit too locally
fluid right you don't have a strong
definition of what these api's are you
can you're strongly encouraged to just
change in whatever you want our code
browser that you showed us it doesn't
have versioning right like I don't know
like the local person could knock
something together but then to build
something on top of that like am I going
to have persistence am I going to have
that old version continue to work I
don't know the basic
I think you're getting jammed I mean the
versioning and the ability to publish
static api's and other things that I I
really need to do mashups yeah
seem to be missing from the system and
they seem to be missing from squeak and
the systems that this system strongly
resembles well let's see so I don't want
to get into a long thing about that but
you're absolutely right that you want
all of those good things in an
environment like this and this is a
proof of concept one that is still
sparse in those facilities but what's
the proof of concept of like what's the
final model what would that look like
that you that you can accept that you
can build simple objects simply you know
using using code right off a web page
with no installation and then save those
for other people to use you know it's a
you know imagine yourself sitting at a
bus stop and having this idea and
reaching down to your cell phone and
doing this kind of stuff and one of the
things I didn't show is we can write web
pages straight out of this and and then
you you know you text your friend the
link to it or send it live that way so
basically making simple things simple
and then there's and then there's the
whole area of being able to you know on
the fly in a very small system develop
stuff change it basically experiment
it's a prototyping environment with all
of those strengths and weaknesses so
you're saying that this is a prototype
of a prototyping environment and that
it's not designed to ever go beyond that
I'm not gonna limit it okay you can
limit it but yeah
yeah two questions how is the state
serialized and then what would something
like a social application like myspace
look like inside of his environment okay
good question I'm gonna turn that over
to Christophe and it'd be nice if we is
there a microphone he could take um the
basic answer is XML but why don't you
come up here yes that'd be good
plus then their TV audience can see our
current form we are based on SVG which
happens tor they have a serialization
format and we essentially extend it with
the bits of information we need and we
use the platform as much as we can to do
the hard work for us and it's true not
every object that you can create
dynamically from the from the IDE will
be automatically serializable yes I just
understand so you see you serialize into
an SVG document with inline script
blocks that are the actors are defined a
script so there is actions are defined
as blobs of code you can you can define
a lot of sort of when events are
triggered and what what which which
function or which already predefined
piece of code is a is triggered in
response to what event without actually
serialize I suppose you realize in code
as such right in do world's become
serialize in two separate documents with
a linked relationship you can do both
you can have nested worlds that happen
to be just branches of the XML tree or I
can just write them out and and the
system will add the enough metadata so
that it acts as a as a real web page
oh and then what would myspace look like
inside of this well prettier I hope well
yeah not not the particular visual look
but social oriented applications
multiple users right well they're busy
stuff well there's there's so many ways
of doing it it's only a platform you can
certainly imagine if we get it forget
the the
live collaboration working we could
definitely take it a step further if
anyone wants to have live collaboration
oh where several people are are you know
co-creating a page we can potentially
did do it we actually showed how to do
it in the previous version you can
imagine a system where every every world
is is is someone's private page people
can create them delete them at will and
and link link to each other
mmm we can we have both the possibility
of having several several worlds living
inside a common runtime but we can also
have separate worlds existing out in
different runtimes with different
JavaScript scoping mechanism
yeah this is related to the earlier
question so can you perhaps one thing I
see when I see a system like this is a
proliferation of very rich affordances
that an average end-user might be
confused by but at the same time which
are very useful for someone who is more
of a programmer so can you imagine a
principled manner in which the system
might choose to attenuate or display the
affordances depending on let's say the
world that an object was living in if
you drag an object into a developer
world you see a lot of affordances that
when you go in to serve a consumer world
are more attenuated and then it becomes
more easy to use in the manner provided
and not programmable as much certainly
and this you know this isn't our
particular strength I mean we could work
on this but for instance there are
controls on every object as to whether
it can be dragged and dropped on whether
it will show its handles and you can
have those kind of controls in the world
as well but we haven't taken time this
you know this is not ready for random
users to play with and that's why you
see all that happening and yes it needs
principles applied ok well I think this
is a good place to end the formal
presentation and folks are welcome to
come up and chat more
