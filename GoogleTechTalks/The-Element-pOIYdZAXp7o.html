source program office here this is
Hawkin Lee I first met him through the
CSS working group where we're still
working he then hired me to opera
software where he is currently the CTO
and we're still working together on the
working group on the html5 spec and he's
going to talk to you about one of the
proposals we have for that very smack
Thank You Ian um it's good to be here I
understand i created some problems for
the gmail system by calling my naming my
talk the video element with the with
these funny brackets between they were
collapsed into something so I'm happy to
help you debug gmail along the way here
I'm gonna be talking about the the video
element I'm going to give it a little
bit of context the video element is
really a very simple proposal if I just
talked about that it would be like a 30
second thing with this small demo
afterwards I gotta give it give it a
little bit of context and also talk a
little bit about the issues that are
facing us as we're moving to have this
be deployed on the web if any of you
would like to play with this yourself I
see some of you have laptops we have
just today released in honor of this
talk a version of opera experimental
version of opera that has support for
video that is it can play videos
natively in Opera you can find the
instructions on how to download and
install it from here it only takes a few
minutes so if any of you want to do it
while while I'm talking you're probably
going to see video before I show it on
the screens here a little bit of context
I've been a web guy for a long time I
stumble across HTML source code in 1992
this was before mosaic and I still
remember you know the feeling in the lab
when I discovered this and so these
simple simple tags and wow you know can
it be that simple so I immediately
wanted to work on this technology and I
went to CERN which is the birthplace of
the web and and started working with
that with with tim berners-lee there at
the time we were we were four in the in
the project and I remember coming there
and
when I got machine it was it was named
WWF or very proud of that cernus is in
Geneva just outside of Geneva and the
picture I'm showing here is taken on the
French side of the border Geneva is very
close to the two to France and the
accelerator the physics accelerator that
that really is CERN is underground in a
circle that crosses crosses the border
it's actually a circle that crosses the
border six times so you can think of how
complex the board race between those two
countries and this picture is taken on
the on the on the outside on the on the
ground level so to say and it's very
beautiful it's a really beautiful area
the city of Geneva is in the middle
there and you have more blah in the back
and one of the most beautiful places you
can go to if you turn the camera you
have the the cows and the the Jura
mountains behind so it's sort of like
mountain mountain you and that sir in
itself was built after the war and it's
not the most exciting place architects
really but this is this is where the web
was born and the hallways underneath
most of the most of cernus below ground
and the whole list underneath are very
dark they're very structural though
compared to the natural beauty of the
nature on the above the the scientists
are working in the dungeons underneath
and they have carefully you know set up
their offices there there there there
lighting system everyone is very
organized the web was invented on the
second door to the left here and I have
this this is yeah this is another
picture from the same area and you know
this being serannon physics I'm not a
physicist I think I can only dream of
what passes through these these pipes
here but I do imagine you know Tim
berners-lee coming to office every day
walking back and forth and thinking
about HTML and what kind of
tags you should put in there that mmmm I
need h1 h2 h3 like one should be bigger
than the other and then I need a few
more tax over here so maybe this is the
inspiration for the HTML specification
in any case HTML took the world by storm
it was released in the early 90s then
must say came along and we could all
demo these things they added the the
image and IMG element which made it
possible to actually show very
compelling demos we could have text and
an image on the same page not next to
each other very simply but underneath
each other in the first version of
mosaic and since then it has developed
and the web has become increasingly more
more visual while at the same time we
have a semantic foundation that HTML
still provides and that Ian now being
the editor of one of the specifications
for HTML is is important is working on
preserving so we combined both the
structural world of the scientists with
the beautiful world of nature or the you
know gif animated gif artists out there
and I think in that context the video
the video element this is interesting
before I go into the video element
itself I just like to say a few words
about opera I assume many of you know us
if you don't use us as your browser you
can you see opera in many many sorts of
machines we started out on the desktop
in 1995 I wasn't with the company then
well the desktop is still where we have
a lot of of you our users but in
addition we've added two more areas of
areas of business opera for mobile where
we put opera into into phones so you can
surf on the web and opera for devices
another exciting area we have just there
we just the before Christmas we released
opera for the Nintendo Wii so actually
if you if you want to surf on the way
you can you can install opera for it we
may you know quickly have more users on
the wii then then another device is
given the success of
of the week another device that I've
been working on myself over the last few
months is the hundred-dollar laptop
which is a wonderful machine for
developing countries it's made to be you
know in inexpensive and therefore it it
can't have much memory it can't have
much processing power both for reasons
of cost and also because they they use a
lot of battery so this is a low-power
device in in many ways and therefore
it's perfect for running operating so if
any way you want to want to see that
later I can show that too now on the way
one of the most compelling reasons for
having a wee is that you can you can
actually use it to go to youtube and it
works quite well you can sit back and
you're on yourself on your couch and and
hook it up to your TV and you can surf
the web and a lot of the user to go to
youtube or other video sharing sites and
we show video clips inside opera because
we ship up platform with the flash
player same as we do on the desktop and
other devices as well flash has
established itself as the common
denominator for video on the web and
that's probably the reason why flash was
chosen is probably because the Flash
plugin is present in most of the brass
relations unlike a Windows Media Player
another strong contender it's not on the
max it's not on linux but you can
actually get flash for all these these
platforms at least the desktop flash is
combined with some obscure code if we
look at the code needed if you go to
youtube and look at the source code you
will find some quite obscure JavaScript
code there which isn't very friendly to
author it still kind of works and it
works for most people a lot of people
have discovered sort of rediscovered the
web due to to the video content
therefore I think it's time to make
video a first class citizen on the web
a first class citizen on the web
deserves its own element its own tag and
I propose to call this tag video I think
that's quite self-evident that if we are
gonna do videos seriously and I think we
should then we need a video element some
other people are arguing that we should
use object instead that's a different
discussion I'm not going to take that
here just note that there is a healthy
discussion going on for this Ian Hickson
is the editor of what working groups
specification on this that commonly
referred to as Sam as html5 formally
recognized as web applications 1.0 this
draft encodes many of the new additions
that browser vendors and others would
like to see go into HTML it also
documents actually how HTML works which
is something we haven't had for a while
and one of the additions that we propose
in web applications 1.0 or or html5 as
we call it most at a time is the video
element let's see here there's an audio
element to to go along with it but today
my focus is on the video element and if
you're interested in seeing you know
what kind of capabilities and and and
the video element should have and how to
express those capabilities you should
probably go to to the specification what
WG in one word org that's where you'll
find that i'm not going to go into all
the intrinsic sphere of how to loop and
how to fast forward and how to stop just
saying that from the outset this is very
simple we'd like for people to just
write video and then give a source file
just like you do in an image you know
the image tag and you have a source
attribute and you just point to URL and
there the browser will then
automatically retrieve the image and
display it we want the same to be the
case for for video it's a little more
complex with video because we the
browser will need to provide some kind
of user interface
to play and stop and pause maybe if the
browse if the if the page doesn't
specify that but we should also allow
the markup and the JavaScript to
interact with the video element so that
it can write a really advanced than
really good-looking video player to
basically provide your own user
interface to this I think this is
possible using the same the same element
the second question first question is
marked up the second question is which
video format should we should we use I
believe very strongly that we need to
agree on some kind of baseline video
format if this is going to be if this is
gonna succeed flash is today the
baseline format on the web the problem
with flash is that it's not an open
standard it's a proprietary format and
it hasn't been documented anywhere and
it probably requires the payment of
license this if you are going to use it
if you got a right to software for it if
you're gonna display it and maybe even
if you're gonna use I don't know I know
I don't really want to know um what I
know is that the web community has
always been based on open standards this
has been what the web is founded on what
we're HTML started that's why we
developed a PNG image format we wanted
to have a freely implementable open
standard to to hold the the content that
we're putting out there our content is
way too valuable to put into some locked
format I believe this this goes back all
the way to sgml which had sort of the
mantra was own your own data that's why
you wanted to use a an open standard to
contain it and if you like it open
standards for video today and there
aren't too many to pick from there are
some initiatives there is one which I
believe is the right one at the moment
and that's called OGG the aura it's the
cousin of OGG Vorbis that some of you
may know about I'm gonna say a little
bit more about the hog theory as well
but first just take the argument that
some people put forward that we
shouldn't really name
what formats that that should be
supported HTML for example the HTML
three and four specification they don't
list what formats browsers have to
support but everyone knows that unless
you support gif and PNG and JPG you're
not going to be able to render web pages
but it's not written down anywhere
people have been saying oh no we should
keep these things separate HTML is here
and image formats are there and you're
free to support any any format you want
and the market is going to decide which
one is successful or not I think that
has worked for HTML because when the
HTML specification was written mistake
had already be in there there was no way
you could you could write to web browser
after mosaic that didn't support those
to PNG was added later through the very
hard task of you know writing and
OpenStack putting it out when you come
late to the party therefore I think it's
important that we from the beginning
think about this and I think that thira
is right format okay aura is developed
by an foundation I'm not really sure how
to pronounce than it well I think I'll
leave it there for you to read yourself
it is a constant of the cousin of the
the audio format OGG Vorbis which has
been quite successful i'd say you find
actually mp3 players and hardware out
there that will that will play OGG
Vorbis okay theory isn't isn't the quite
there yet but you can easily find
software to display OGG files the VLC
player is available on the several
platform it's very popular and
personally I used to create some of the
demos i'm going to be showing i used and
command-line tool on linux called the
ffmpeg to thehre which was easily
available on my ubuntu system just by
saying searching for something with
laura in its name and then downloading
and installing it and there from there I
could create the OGG files straight from
DVD files so it was quite painless
quite painless to to create there's also
a discussion on compression quality you
know whether whether ox theories is good
enough that people will say oh no but
mpeg-4 h.264 have much better
compression ratio than any of the you
know puny free formats and maybe that is
the case I think a lot of good work has
gone into those those formats the
problem with them is to first they're
not freely available and second they
also require a lot of computing power
the more advanced the video format is
the more computing power it it demands
and for example on a machine like this I
don't think we're going to see you know
advanced impact for decoders first for
the cost reason for a machine that costs
hundred dollars you simply cannot pay
anything for software at all nothing for
the operating system nothing for the
browser and nothing for the video
decoders and and second it cannot decode
mpeg-4 in real time I believe I haven't
tried but that's my assumption after
talking to some of the experts in the
field I thought maybe there are um if so
i think the vendor should forward with
apple have support that can be used
freely available on all platforms and
portable to all sorts and then step
forward and and and and we'll we'll
discuss maybe even google has some i
don't know okay enough talking now i'm
gonna be demoing to this element then i
have to switch to i said if you got it
working by the way anyway anyone tried
to download it yet no okay oh sure i'll
go um let's see
and then the audio they're perfect great
so this is opera this is a browser as
you know it it's a big black feel here I
haven't put much designed into the pages
i created using this let's just look at
a very basic example first this is a
very simple OGG file that I found one on
that I don't know if it has audio even
it has three buttons here play pass and
stops those are the methods they map
onto in JavaScript methods so that when
i when i press them they will they will
trigger events and and now I can say I
can pause the video for example and I
can stop it and I can start to play it
again so that's something I found that
for this this one is something i decoded
myself and this is i know here in to you
have any sound here
I am outputting I think
test and I'm playing this in honor of
the in honor of the Swedish programmers
who who actually coded this we're based
in Oslo Norway we been working in Sweden
as well and they're the ones who put
this who put this in i'm going to show
you these things play beemo alishan dbg
relay
now you're as killers it'll be a special
services and you can lure snakes colors
all Jake seen nothing yet crash bang
crack them up put them back again crash
bang smash them up its mashup time my
friend Kenner's SSP special purposes
comes with everything you see right here
lots of issues that the spec will need
to address that I when I give a demo
don't have to talk too much about here's
another demo using the same the same
clip just with a slightly more advanced
JavaScript interface so that you when
you hover over it this half transparent
field at the bottom will pop up as a
control that takes a few lines of
JavaScript here to write but it's not
too complex
so those are the demos I pretty much
only have you know self-made demos
because we haven't really pushed this
out yet this is the first day that they
operate available with the with the for
download for playing with and I should
also say I'm not making any product
announcements here this is only for
experimental purposes we expect respect
to change and we expect to to improve
our our support as well and what are we
going to launch opera with this and when
that's going to happen I can't say
anything about that I do think though
that we the web community should start
to play with this because we want to
take video more seriously and I'd love
for people to create pages using video
for example if there are youtube or
google video people here i'd love to
have sort of a lab section where you and
we the web community could you know play
with these things and see what can be
done see what makes sense and feed that
back into the specification as well so
that Ian can can do the can make the
necessary edits for it and I think given
the speed we're traveling at now I think
we can have this working by the end of
the air I think we can have several
shipping browsers with with support for
this the Mesilla people we are talking
to through the what working group and
also other other browser vendors the the
support for the video tag is quite
strong I feel there is the issue of
baseline format which is more
controversial I do hope for the best of
the web I do hope that we can find that
baseline format and if any of you have
ideas and how to to help us with that
I'd love to talk to you again here's the
URL for where to find the Opera with
with the video and thanks for inviting
me
it's question marks over Google
I just want to ask other than supporting
on Windows Mac or Linux through the
video element like would you support
quicktime on mac and would you support
whatever it is directshow the frame
works on on windows right if I had
codecs installed yeah like a divx codec
or something it's a good question this
experimental version that is available
now only supports our theory even if
there are other codecs available on
Windows and this is only available for
Windows now no we don't look for them we
don't try to do it we're only looking at
our theory at the moment the
specification itself the water ed
specification says user agent should
support or do but you're free to to use
anything basically i would say
personally my opinion is that browser
shouldn't support other codecs at least
not in the beginning until we have
established a baseline format we should
not support other codecs with with with
the video element if you want to use
other codecs like like flash then you
know p please continue to use the object
element for that we don't want to
contaminate video with other formats now
that's quite an extreme position and a
lot of people disagree with me so you
know maybe we'll be more open and say
hey you know if you have other codecs we
will look for them and we will support
them the danger is that that that stops
the the community from finding that
baseline format which i think is
essential for making video work in the
long term yes question
hi this is sort of a two-piece question
first most you gave for having a video
element sounded like they were on the
content author creator side of things
I'm wondering if the video element is
compelling in some way for consumers
users of the web versus the existing
flash based video content what sorts of
things can I do as a user or will i see
that I wouldn't otherwise be able to
it's a good question typing my answer
right now
okay so i'm mixing mark up here this is
an element first and then there's a CSS
underneath right if I know that the
video is in the video element I can
remove them as a user in my personal
style sheet i can say display none and
thereby remove all video elements from
my from my screen if i don't have the
bandwidth to download it or don't really
want to see it so that's that's one
under on the on the user side one
argument for for using the video element
okay and the second part of the question
is from the content author perspective
given the ubiquity that you mentioned of
flash and how many of the video sites
like YouTube for example are allowing
people to embed their players on two
sites I guess I'm sort of looking for
what you think are going to be the most
compelling reasons for authors who are
not very idealistic alee motivated by
open standards to say wow this is
actually easier than what I can do right
now or it's it's somehow more compelling
for me in some way all right well the I
that's another good question i think for
those who don't really care about web
standards or proprietary markup or
anything and we've seen that most of the
web don't care about it they just put in
whatever works we had to we had to come
up with something I think I mean we all
run run around with video cameras in our
pockets right and these don't create
flash format they have to be converted
and the today it's it's being done at a
server-side I do think to truly have
user-generated sites like like people
have home pages if you're going to put a
video there you're not going to have the
Flash tools available your home page
generator I don't think we'll have it
whereas the tools to create all are
easier at least they don't have any any
legal problems that we know of so I
think the ubiquitous nests of these free
formats it's easier to make software for
them therefore there will be more
software for it maybe that isn't going
to be the case in the short term i don't
know i do think therefore it's important
that those of us who have lived on the
web for a long time who want the web to
succeed and not only
you know your page to work today and
tomorrow we who see the need for open
formats that hey we created an industry
based on open standards here we don't
want to contaminate our own industry we
want open standards to continue to be
the foundation so we need some of us
have to be responsible I'm looking at
the in here now I think Google is a very
responsible you have the don't do you
know do no evil thing right that that
suggests to me you are responsible and
this is something therefore i'm very
happy to talk about here and i'm happy
that you asked that question there's one
question in the back as well
so I'm done hurting i work on google
video in youtube and so one of the
things that i'm curious about and I've
kind of been exchanged some emails with
ian about is the level of the
interactivity that's going to be exposed
to the Dom like one of the event is a
flash not just the fact that you have
that video there but you can do a great
deal of manipulation on its script
ability of it and making sure that in my
mind the video tag if it's going to be
successful needs to offer a superset of
what flash currently does or you're not
going to get that momentum to switch
people away from it so I don't know that
was one thing that you know you had play
pause stop but right in my mind as
somebody who has written a player
there's a whole lot more that I want to
do absolutely absolutely and so this is
a first this is our first you know just
one week hack in Opera the specification
is actually much more advanced by now
maybe you want to say something about
that yeah there's this there's two
issues right there's making sure that
the implementers actually implement the
thing and then there's making sure it's
useful for the for the authors the spec
right now is a big superset of what hole
can presented but it's a subset of what
you know quicktime or flash will provide
I think over time will increase the the
API until it gets to a sweet spot where
people are you know able to use it the
concern is making sure we don't jump
straight to the complete API because
then the browser vendors will each
implement their own little part of it
nothing will work in every browser and
you know we'll end up in a kind of a
mess we have with many many other specs
they've done the same thing jumping to a
complete solution
mark did you have a question is y a
question about accessibility is there
fallback content like the alt attribute
in the image yeah yeah unlike image the
video element is it's not empty so it
can contain textual content so that
older browsers will display the text
textual content so if you open some of
the pages that that you see when you if
you download this this demo and write
some you know go to some of these pages
you will see that it says you know you
don't have all 0 a player installed or
something so it's it it's not going to
be just a black hole there will be some
explanatory text but of course we can't
easily replicate the video experience
with that fallback content I say so you
just to get this straight the the child
content of the video element is the
fallback content yes like like canvas
yes and object even right right okay
thank you
is that there's actually I mean there's
a logical place to put fallback content
which is inside the video itself so for
example if there's caption information
embedded within the video it may make
more sense to at least have the ability
to just use that as fallback content not
not in the case of the browser not
supporting it but from an accessibility
point of view of the user can't actually
watch video they just want you know the
captions displayed as text or whatever
so it's just something to think about
yeah there's some accessibility people
here at Google that would be excellent
people to provide feedback and I already
pointed unit them that that's that's
very good heat back
anyone else if not I suggest we say
thank you for inviting me again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
