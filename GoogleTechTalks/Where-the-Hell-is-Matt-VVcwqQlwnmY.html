most of you are here here today because
you know Matt from the internet uh this
is matt from the internet matt harding
our honored guest today who will teach
us a bit about um how one finds oneself
going all over the world dancing and
becoming effectively in international
celebrity for what he self styles as bad
dancing but enjoying it um if you have
questions we've got a bunch of remote
offices so if you have questions please
make your way to the mic for the
question so other people don't hear
nothingness thank you Matt this on hello
hello Leon hello great hi folks thank
you so much for coming and thank you for
taking time out in the middle of your
work day I'm sure you're all very busy
and I won't be offended if you need to
duck out or if you need to have your
laptop's open just no cell phone calls
that would be the only that's the line
right there but thank you for coming i
really appreciate it first off has
anybody who hears seeing the video guy
just get a show of hands who's seen the
video okay that's a lot of people who
here has not seen the new video okay we
got like five or six people would you
mind for the benefit of those five or
six if i play the new video that the
incentive is it's the high-definition
version that you can't see on the
internet this is the the really nice
quality one alright so this is a video i
made this is sort of the culmination of
something I've been doing for about five
years and and you know I'm just gonna go
ahead and play it and then I will tell
you the story of how it ended up
happening here we go
cheap
you
ladies and gentlemen my lovely assistant
Melissa she's a Googler that's her name
well that's not her name her name is in
the beginning of the credits she and i
made this together largely during her
break from working at Google she took a
few months off and traveled with me so
she's holding the camera for a lot of
the video and she works up in the
Seattle office I like showing that video
before I talk because it takes the
pressure off I don't actually have to be
interesting or engaging but I wanted to
show it to you and I hope that while
you're watching it some questions might
have popped into your head because
that's mostly what I do is is just
answer question my talk is pretty
minimal I used to work in video games I
was a terrible student in high school
wasn't really interested didn't have
many options when I finished for college
so instead of going to college actually
on my father's suggestion he didn't
think I should bother because I'd done
so badly in school he said why don't you
go do something else figure out what you
do want to do so at the time at 18 I
just wanted to play video games and make
them and I started doing that for a
while worked in Los Angeles they opened
up in an office in australia where i
worked at pandemic and so I begged and
pleaded to go there because i was done
living in Los Angeles no offense Santa
Monica office and and so I worked in
Australia for years a few years and
that's where I got turned on to
international travel I didn't know it
was even something you could do I didn't
know you could just buy a plane to get
to someplace you'd hardly ever heard of
show up there and figure things out
which isn't I don't recommend that too
much as a strategy it's good to do some
research but but you really learn a lot
about a place while you're there if you
go with an open mind there to learn it
is a fantastic way to travel and
Australians do that they just take off
and they have their either gap year or
sometimes gap decade where they'll just
go wandering partly in Australia it's
because they're so kind of far off from
the rest of the planet they need to go
and see Europe and
see Asia and things like that but people
do it in Europe to they do it in England
they do it in New Zealand a lot of the
westernized world it's it's it's a rite
of passage it's something that everybody
does and growing up in the u.s. it
wasn't something that any my friends did
I didn't really know about it so I got
excited working working there in
Australia about the idea of doing that I
worked there for a few years saved up
some money didn't really know what I was
saving it for and then I got to the
point of my job where I'd hit sort of my
mid-20s you stick your head up out of
the cubicle and you go wait a minute is
this really what I want to be doing I've
set myself up on app half but I wasn't
feeling very satisfied I wasn't feeling
satisfied by the work I wasn't feeling
satisfied by the amount of time i was
spending sitting in my office staring at
a computer screen so i decided to go
wander the planet and stare at a
computer screen instead because i
brought my laptop but but yeah so i quit
and i took this money that had been
saving up and spent it on a six-month
trip around the world and while i was
doing that i was in vietnam with a
friend and former coworker and i do this
dance at work when it was time to go to
lunch I would get antsy and I would
wander around to people's desks and I
would just kind of annoy them by doing
this when it's time to go to lunch and
they're working on things they're busy
they're doing important things but
eventually they get so annoyed by me
that they would get up and come to lunch
and so one of these guys who I used to
know I was traveling with in Vietnam and
he said why don't you stand over there
do that stupid dance used to do this was
in 2003 which was right as digital
cameras were coming into their own as
something everybody and probably a lot
of this audience has in their pockets at
least in your cell phones everybody
suddenly had digital cameras and these
digital cameras had video function so it
wasn't a matter of carrying around some
big camcorder anymore it was a matter of
switching your camera to the video
function so he just did that we shot a
little 10 second clip oh that's cute
that's a nice little memento of a place
that I've been that I really enjoyed so
I started in the process of that
six-month trip collecting these clips
not for any higher purpose not with any
great message in mind just a memento you
know people bring t-shirts they bring
stuffed animals as a way of taking
snapshots in front of themselves in the
Taj Mahal I just did this and when i
finished the end of that year all I
wanted to do is keep
traveling so I worked in Seattle for a
lil while saved up more money did more
traveling in Africa and then got home
and I was just broken unemployed I had
absolutely no job prospects Melissa was
keeping me alive and and and I didn't
know what I was going to do but I
collected all these clips and I put them
together and put them into a video and
put them on my website I didn't put it
out there like hey everybody watch my
video but I sent it to a couple friends
and they put it on their blogs and it
wounded up on other blogs and this was
in early two thousand five actually
before YouTube was even founded but as
you all know and as I'm sure you were
all watching internet video at the time
it was it was not yet mainstream but
everybody was passing these things
around on email it was about to get a
whole lot bigger so I put this video up
it got passed around it got millions of
views over the course of two thousand
five but it was slow it was like when
they used to release movies in the 60s
and 70s they wouldn't release it jun 9th
in theaters worldwide they would release
it and the reels would travel around the
country i sort of like that comparison
internet video didn't explode on opening
day the way it does now so over the
course of two thousand five it
accumulated millions and millions of
views and later that year stride gum
came along and they weren't out to
market yet they were they were working
on this new products try which was
coming out in the middle of 2006 and
they said we want people to know about
our gum would you be interested in
making another video for us and I said
well no I can't I'm broke and they said
well that will will sponsor you will
give you a job making this video for us
and I said that sounds perfect that
sounds that's exactly what i want to do
so january of 2006 i took off on a 39
country tour to all seven continents in
six months and i made the second video
which how many of you guys have seen the
2006 video Wow a lot less people that's
amazing okay well I can show you that
video too but I'm not going to yet
because i only have a limited amount of
time and there's a lot of stuff i want
to show you so i made a 2006 video that
was like that one you just saw but there
weren't other people in it was still
just me and when I was in Rwanda about
halfway through the trip I had this sort
of epiphany moment I met up a friend
with a friend who worked for an NGO
there and he took me out to a village i
said i want to just find a village
in Rwanda where there's a bunch of kids
playing and I'll see if they'll dance
with me because I had a feeling I'd been
to Africa before and I knew how just
sort of open and accessible everybody is
and I was hoping that they would just
dance with me so i did that i shop i
went into a village called Malindi and
we'll see where speaking right here I'll
show you the raw footage from there
here
this is why day this was the first time
that i can today i just had to do the
occasion I didn't speak Kinyarwanda and
you didn't speak English but they
started dancing right away because they
got it there isn't that much to get and
pretty soon other kids were jealous so
they started running in and dancing to
and within a minute or two we had
everybody in the village sort of circled
around watching this strange large white
man dancing with a bunch of kids and it
was a really great moment is really
special moment for me and sort of made
me realize wow this is what I should
have been doing all along I should have
been going in front of the Parthenon and
Great Wall of China and pyramids in
Egypt and doing this that's not very
interesting compared to watching people
all doing the same thing so after I made
that second video I got home and it took
a couple of months for me to really
realize that for that to kind of gel in
my head but then in 2007 i went up to
stride again it to have an idea for
another video this time instead of doing
recognizable places i want to do it
about people and i want to take all the
emails that I've gotten I get thousands
and thousands of emails from that second
video and and email them back and say
I'm going to be in this place at this
time come out and meet me so for say
Brazil we had six hundred emails from
brazil israel we had hundreds of
israelis saying why do you hate israel
why didn't you come to Israel Sweden
South Korea everywhere you name it so we
just did that we with Melissa's help
Melissa produced this last video with me
and she there are certain things that
are not within my skill set in fact
there's a whole lot of things that are
not within my skill set and melissa is
very good at a lot of those things she
handled the organization of contacting
people in all these cities figuring out
where the best place to be was where we
could dance without getting arrested and
she'd worked with locals in each place
we said of about forty five events all
around the world every single place we
went people showed up to dance which was
incredible we got about 2,000 people in
that last video that you just saw
dancing and it was all just with the
power of the internet but he got paid
there was
no stride wasn't involved in it we just
organized it over email we used google
maps to pinpoint the exact location of
where we're going to be we had people in
each city go out and take pictures for
us of where the shoot was going to be it
was an enormous amount of work that we
managed to pull off with 99 percent
thanks to melissa's help and and that's
basically it so that's how we made the
three videos and and I really want to
open up the rest of my time to questions
including in any of these cities thank
you guys for showing up not even looking
there are all right yeah cool if you
guys have any questions to I don't know
if we have any way to facilitate that if
they if they have questions they want to
ask but does anybody here have questions
yeah can you come on up to the mic
that's better yeah maybe pastor booth
hello what next what dance what next Oh
what next what next well I've been
saying I don't know for a while I'm sort
of evolving past I don't know the next
thing I'm going to do is a project in
Rwanda sort of to return the favor i
told you the rwanda story and what i
want to do is get involved in the laptop
programs going on right now and I've
gotten stride to agree to purchase 100
laptops and I want to get trained in how
to use them probably the XO laptops go
down to Rwanda and bring them to a
school they're probably the Millennium
village it's all very sketchy right now
I'm talking about it like it's going to
happen so that I'll do it but but my
hazy plan is just to sort of repay the
karmic debt for that the inspiration to
make that last video by going there and
I'm also thinking about making another
video someday it would be a ways off
because I'm really tired but I think the
the guiding principle would be to take
the trajectory of all these videos which
is each one has been something that I
couldn't do before the second video I
wouldn't have been able to do because I
didn't have the funding to go to
Antarctica and to go to Easter Island so
I was able to do a video that I couldn't
have made the first time the third time
I made a video that I couldn't make the
second time because I couldn't
on those crowds in places all over the
world so if i do another video i would
want to be it would want it to be
something that i couldn't have possibly
done before and that says something
worth saying that it hasn't said before
mean this last video is about people and
connectivity in that and that you know
the things we all have in common and and
that's a hard thing to top that's a
tough act to follow but i think it would
be to say something about the places
that we think of as being our enemies
the places that are closed off to us and
and to try to get into those places that
we think of as being forbidden or you
know all these things that are other
than us and to show that in a lot of
ways they're really not and I think we
all in this room know that but it's nice
to see it it's nice to have a visual
reminder that you know North Koreans for
all the problems that that we have with
North Korea the people are not our
enemies and they're a lot more like us
than we think I've never been there so I
can't shoot maybe they all have third
arms and you know walk upside down I
don't know but I think they're they're
going to be a lot more like us than than
we think so that's that's one idea of
something that I could do with this that
would be worth doing any other questions
yeah sort of travel to all these places
how many shots &amp;amp; immunizations that you
have to get immunizations I feel like um
I didn't get any for this new video
because I got so many for the second one
I think once you've been to India you're
all set it's like a full house in terms
of shots every disease you could
possibly get you need in order to go to
India so I have a card with all the
things listed a tetanus hep a happy
yellow fever I don't know I think I have
everything I hope I haven't caught
anything I've never gotten malaria so
but it's you know you just go for a
doctor visit you get a bunch of shots
and then you're done you're good for
like 18 months or two years or something
like that if you're doing a lot of
travel it's good to just get them all
out of the way yeah do you have any
outtakes you can show us out takes yeah
actually there's a video that I just
finished this morning and I was
rendering it on the way over here I've
never showed it to anybody I haven't
even launched it
but I'd really like to show it it's it's
from the Madrid clip you guys saw it
very briefly in that video 180 people
running out and dancing in Madrid that
was a really fun clip that was about the
largest crowd we ever got and the funny
thing that happened there and it
happened everywhere but to a larger
extent in Madrid was everybody brought
their cameras they all brought their
cellphones or the digital cameras there
were so many people shooting that event
and they all uploaded it onto YouTube so
I've gone on to YouTube and it's
surprisingly easy to just rip the
footage off of youtube I believe it's
illegal but so I stole the footage off
of youtube that people had uploaded
there's some nervous giggles in the
audience yeah sorry guys I stole the
footage off of youtube and i took some
news footage that was shot in madrid and
i took the footage that melissa shot and
i put it all together and this sort of
mini documentary about what shooting one
of these massive group event clips was
like so i'm gonna show it to you now
it's pretty rough it's not finished any
any part of this where you go ooh that's
a little off it's because it's not
finished but you are the the first folks
to see it also stole this music mad
sorry es uno de estos que c'est Mon
phenomena stay internet y que haces mi
hijito esta Hondo Puerto universe harder
than Yordano me
i miss video on youtube the first one
and i immediately fell in love with love
us to simply como que haga haga algo el
mundo sabe la voy a hablar an English
desde para esto this is luke artistry
amigo campus contains ustedes son de
palma ya medio para esta receta
everybody in the shop
here
you
me
room
Oh
watch the man in the back
sure
it
so that's not technically an outtakes
video but that's something that I just
threw together it was a really really
fun day are the more questions it's a
really heartwarming video and I was just
wondering how this has affected you you
know your view of yourself or your view
of other people around the world how is
it affecting my well you know there's
something very simple that it does and
very non non emotional I mean it's just
just going to all these places turns
them you know into from blobs and on a
map into places that when you hear them
in the news you know you think about the
people that you met there you think
about conversations you think about
experiences in it and that's made a big
change to how I you know just how I walk
through the world you know I know so
much more about these places than I used
to just a couple years ago before I
started traveling and then and then you
know internally it makes a big change it
changes the kind of travel where you
really leave outside your comfort zone
and go to a place that you know nothing
about it and have to figure out what
you're going to do when you get there is
it changes you as a person and what
you're capable of what you're what
you're aware of in terms of your
capabilities so I really am a big
advocate for that kind of travel where
you don't even necessarily have your
hotel booked on the other end you're
just figuring things out I think it's
it's it's a great way to to grow and
learn first thank you hopefully this
applies to other people here as well but
I'm hoping to go on your type of trip
for a couple weeks in the winter Oh
could you throw out some ideas for cool
places places I think a lot of folks
here would dig boot an retains the place
I really love talking about it was in my
favorite places I visited on this last
trip does anybody here know
ugg boots hanim you heard of it it's it
has anybody been to boot an here okay
Melissa she came with me earlier this
year it's a it's very closed off its up
in the Himalayas between borders China
and India it's near the Tibet region and
it's a similar place ethnically to Tibet
it's it's very Buddhist Mahayana
Buddhist I think they don't worship the
Dalai Lama but there's sort of a sibling
sect and it's it's a really interesting
place because rather than rather than
basing their prosperity in economic
terms the way that pretty much the
entire rest of the planet does now they
gauge their prosperity in terms of
happiness they actually have a ministry
of happiness that is devoted to making
lie the lives of its citizens good so
there are things like that no
advertising policy you won't see
billboards as you drive around in
boonton because they decided doesn't
make anybody's life better and you won't
see what's another example like the
concessions we were at a festival
there's festivals going on all the time
and there were no soda stands there were
no food stands and when we asked why
can't we get food here and and our
guides that oh they got rid of that they
decided it was sort of ruining the
festival's to have this you know
commercial element so you bring your own
food and things like that that are just
really surprising and counterintuitive
and then there's just a lot of really
charming things about the history and
the mythology the culture like la medupe
Aquila I found fascinating he's he's a
mixture between a religious deity and a
comic book character he he travels the
countryside practicing his Buddhist
religion with sex and alcohol I suppose
that's not much of a comic book
character but he he he wears these tiger
print shorts and this is like 600 700
years ago and slays demons with his
phallus and just a lot of details to
this story that are really really
fascinating and when you talk to
Bhutanese about it it's not like it's
sacred it's not like you're going to
upset them by giggling they think it's
hilarious too so the idea that their
spirituality can be something that's
just kind of fun and joyful there were a
lot of things that I just found really
really unique
special and interesting in boonton it
was it was it was constantly in awe
during the short time that we were there
so that's a that's a trip that I
recommend to anyone yeah two quick
questions one what's the story behind
the music like did you already have it
composed when you film that scene in
India and two could you talk a little
more about the places that would have
been hard to get to like filming in a
zero g plane the DMZ outpost in Korea
the the language that that the 2008
video is sung in the the lyrics are in
Bangla does anybody here speak bangla
yeah nobody it's actually the seventh
most commonly spoken language on the
planet there more bangla speakers than
german and russian which I found
fascinating but we we that song was not
composed when we when I shot the video
wasn't composed until really the last
couple weeks as I was finishing it up I
have a composer friend in los angeles
named gary Shimon and he'd written the
score the musical part of it we didn't
know what to do for the vocals we were
really stuck and we spent about a year
struggling with what to do and we we
realized that we were better off
probably finding something in a
different language because I really
worried about cliche I didn't want
lyrics that were trite and that would
sort of make you cringe it's hard to
write lyrics to a video like that and I
figured well if it's in a language i
don't speak that at least for me it's
not going to be trite because i won't
understand it so we my friend Gary
recommended a poet in India name
rabindranath tagore and he's a Nobel
prize-winning poet and I read through
the English translations of some of his
poems picked one that was about dancing
in life and it was a really beautiful
poem and we fat we had to find someone
to sing it unfortunately the pool of
vocalists in Los Angeles there aren't a
lot of it wasn't easy to find a Bengal a
singer we were kind of stuck there so I
asked Melissa who works in recruiting
and is very good at finding people with
specific skills I said do you want to go
wandering around the internet and see if
you could find someone who could sing in
Bangla and so she went on to YouTube
actually and she found this young girl
palwasha Sadiq who lives in Minneapolis
17 years old still in high school and it
was an interview with her radio station
and she
this really beautiful song so I was
really taken with it and I tracked her
down and emailed her i say how would you
like to come out to Los Angeles and sing
for this video sure once once we'd found
that video it was just a matter of days
it was serendipity it all came together
very easily I'd never heard the poem
spoken aloud I'd certainly never heard
it sung before so there's a big risk
taken as to whether or not it would
actually fit with the score but it's
just like I said serendipity it all fit
together perfectly and when you see that
happening when I see that happening I've
learned in making these videos just to
step back and let it happen and it
really just came together great you
asked about the zero-g clip that one was
really of course very fun to get that
was the one where I was flipping around
in space it was it's called parabolic
flight I think you probably most you
guys know how this is done you don't
actually go into space you go up to
cruising altitude 35,000 feet then the
plane plummets at the same rate at which
you would fall if you were say skydiving
so within the cabin of this plane you're
effectively weightless for the 25
seconds that it's free falling and then
it goes back up and you suddenly weigh
500 pounds for 25 seconds and then
you're weightless again so we did about
16 of these parabolas I imagine that it
so during its not that pad actually
really called the vomit comet but there
was a little bit of that I didn't bomb
unfortunately and if you do vomit in
zero gravity that's not fun but I had
this image of what it was going to be
like to do weightless weightless flight
that it was going to be like that scene
in 2001 that I'd be you know sort of
floating effortlessly and and there'd be
what is the Beethoven music playing as
soon as you go weightless you're in a
727 mosh pit it's just 40 people banging
heads and legs and feet everybody's
bruised everybody when the when the zero
gravity ends you hear this like three
seconds and then all of a sudden bang
you weigh 500 pounds on the ground it
hurt a lot so I did my best to put a
smile on and
and I hope that I wasn't getting kicked
in the head and I managed to get one
shot that worked that was actually the
second time I did I had to do 20 g
flights because the first one I learned
a very interesting quality about hard
disk drives that i took this camera with
me do you know this you already get it
you know the punchline I took this
camera that had just come to market sony
put an HD camera out that had a 30
gigabyte hard drive so it was great for
me I could I could hold five hours of
footage on this camera I took it on the
zero g flight I did not realize that
there's a fail-safe mechanism built into
all hard disk drives not just camcorder
ones that when they're falling they will
not write to the platters because if
it's following it's probably about to
hit the ground so best thing to do is
not to write the the needle goes off the
platter so when you're in weightless
environment you're effectively falling
all the time the camera kept thinking it
was falling and it would shut down so I
spent thirty five hundred dollars on a
waitlist flight and didn't get any
footage from it because the camera
wouldn't record so then I went I bought
this camera which had just come out to
market by that point because for the
last year they've been they put out like
a dozen of these cameras over the last
year HD home home video quality HD has
just happened while I was making this
video so this is the camera I went out
and bought and this records onto a
solid-state memory stick no moving parts
no problem with weightless environment
so i got this camera 0g was nice enough
to give me a real real cheap rate on a
second flight up and that's how i got
the shot that was in the video so it was
a learning experience are there other
questions yeah yeah so it seems that my
international travel experiences have
been kind of a plagued by logistical
nightmares so i'm wondering what kind of
your biggest setback might have been if
you had any if not you're really lucky
and then my second quick question is
what's the shortest amount of time you
spent in one of the countries or cities
country early minutes yeah i found with
international travel I'm really well
suited to international travel it was
the first thing I'd found that I was
really good at and I spent a number of
years from trying things that I really
wanted to be able to do and then finding
out I'm actually not very good at this
international travel is great because
the more you plan the more you screw it
up and this goes so I'd say for places
like Africa South America Asia
if you have things booked in advance and
you have a schedule that you're trying
to keep you're going to be in trouble
and I'm talking about everywhere but a
lot of a lot of places you're better off
just kind of rolling up and then
figuring out what you want to do and if
it doesn't work out whatever no big deal
have a very laid-back attitude to travel
and I have a laid-back attitude to
things in general so so yeah the less
planning the better things go I've found
and then and then sometimes it bites you
in the ass like with visas I wound up
stuck in India for a week on my way to
tie line because I hadn't gotten around
to getting no other way around i wound
up stuck in thailand i'm going to india
because i hadn't gotten around to
getting an indian visa so I had my
cousin Thomas waiting for me in India
and so he wandered off into catenin to
Kashmir and I had to go to the embassy
to try to extract him so sometimes it is
good to plan it's sort of a mixtures
rate that's why it's great traveling
with Melissa because she can do the
advance planning stuff that I'm not so
good at but ya veces can be a pain in
the ass as well as can visa credit cards
visa and mastercard I've wandered into
country square it's always good to carry
I found both a visa and a mastercard
credit card because there are countries
that do not accept mastercard and that
means not only can you not buy things
with your MasterCard you can't go to the
ATM you can't get money out yeah I ended
it ended up having to go to western
union and have my sister you know
express me a thousand dollars so that I
can eat while I'm in the country and get
around it was like Burma's like that
they will not most credit card companies
don't I in fact I don't think any credit
card operate companies operate in Burma
but that's not so true in the rest of
the world surprisingly you can I don't
do traveler's checks or anything like
that I really just go out with an ATM
card and today you can get by pretty
well with that but as far as anecdotes
about getting really really really stuck
most of Africa got waylaid Timbuktu oh
yes thank you thank you Timbuktu is a
place that's hard to get into it's a
place that is much harder to get out of
we got into Timbuktu mostly and I think
the reason most tourists go to Timbuktu
and this is like five tours today that
go to Timbuktu go there because of the
name and a fascination of the history it
used to be a learning it used to be one
of
the great learning centers of the Muslim
world now it has been swallowed up by
the desert and it's just a barely
inhabitable town so we got there and and
we spent about three or four hours there
and then we were like okay how do we get
out the heat is unbearable I mean it's
really really really hot it's just rough
and once we got in we realized that the
entire tourist industry in Timbuktu is
centered around keeping people from
getting out and you know getting as much
out of them as they can so we spent five
days stuck there mostly just hiding in
our hotel room because we'd go out in
the few hours a day that you could you
could wander around outside and breathe
so yeah getting stuck in Timbuktu was
was rough we ended up I mean we did have
some good experiences there it wasn't
absolutely awful but it's ecologically
it's in it's in a difficult place that's
all right we're fascinating I mean man
the Tuareg are they come they live in
the Sahara Desert but they come right up
to the edge of Timbuktu Timbuktu is sort
of like a coastal town if it was the
coast of the desert because beyond that
is just the Sahara and the toire egg
spend their their their lives going on
camel from Timbuktu into Morocco to
Algeria but they're not really citizens
of any country that all these countries
just kind of tolerate them but they are
desert nomads people have been for
centuries and to look at their faces to
look in their eyes it's really like
looking back into history because they
have they just they're weathered in a
way that a few people are today you know
they really are out there living that
lifestyle that it surprised me to find
that anyone is still living anywhere in
the world because so much of so much of
international travel is discovering that
this place you imagined was going to be
very exotic is actually a series of
chilies and tgif's and things like that
but the world has been genera fide to a
very large extent but there are still
pockets that are really fascinating and
unique and where people still are living
the life styles that they've lived for a
long time and I enjoy seeing that and
then playing my part in ruining it that
was irony I don't really like ruining
those places but you can't help it when
you
they're you everybody you know we you
change things by visiting places are
there any other questions yeah yeah so
I'm sure a lot of us want to end would
like to do things that you do which is
travel a lot maybe not necessarily make
a video but at least do a lot of
traveling the problem of course is time
especially if you have a job now you
said you quit your job and therefore you
did this what about Melissa what deal
does she have with google that she can
she works on contract or she used to
actually yeah yeah it's gonna take my
car I was working for a company called
aquantive and I was a contract for a
long time because I like the freedom of
it and and other reasons and this came
up and i said to them this is something
i absolutely have to do and they said we
understand by maybe you'll have a job
when you get back and I was like oh crap
okay you know and you just you jump and
then you land and you're fine and you've
had an amazing experience and companies
think you're much more interesting
afterwards to be honest so well I was
traveling on that trip that was when um
the gal named Elsbeth here at Google
contacted me and said hey would you be
interested in looking at Google and I
was like well I've been Argentina right
now and and I was like but I'll talk to
you when I get back and so I got back
and I and I talked with Google they
hired me as a contractor and I did my
year and then the year was over and I
was sad but I had to go because we had
another chance to go again and so I took
my three months off and then I came back
and then I went full time after that but
my team and my my managers have been
awesome and you know it when you when
you're doing something one thing that
I've been really amazed with it google
is when you're doing something that's
really interesting that you're
passionate about it's like you're twenty
percent time right for the engineers and
folks out there who do that you know
people understand that there are bigger
things than your job and I'm certainly
not advocating and running off I I bring
people too
Google I'm not trying to get you to
leave but um it is important to go and
do the things that you're passionate
about and luckily I've been able to do
that and my team takes care of me and I
try to not take advantage of it yeah I
think I mean I certainly can't speak for
Google or Google's hiring practices but
it seems to be a company living with
Melissa I've seen that it's a company
that recognizes what I was talking about
a minute ago what what travel does to
you in terms of realizing your
capabilities and I think that's a great
trait to learn and international travel
is a great way to learn it Melissa came
with me for two months in the 2006 video
we went to South America and Australia
and she came right back and got the job
at Google shortly after that and and I
do think that they they recognized and
appreciated that she just spent two
months traveling abroad yeah question I
don't take this question wrong whatever
the answer is absolutely worth it but
I'm curious how much travel time and
travel miles does it take to make a five
minute video yeah how that video the
last video you saw was made over the
course of 14 months seven of those
months were spent traveling the other
seven were spent at home recuperating
but it's it's 42 countries and in terms
of miles probably about 150,000 miles i
think i calculated once before even
starting on this video the travel that
i'd done for the first two videos with
something like 35 tons of co2 into the
atmosphere so sorry about that somebody
in Francis emailed me and said why do
you travel so much on planes why don't
you use your bicycle
I can't hold my breath that long but but
yeah it's it's uh I've gotten used to
spending a week or two weeks or more
working to get a five-second clip to put
in the video and I don't mind that at
all actually it's really fun and
satisfying especially when I mean the
way I think of it as nine million people
have seen this video in the last two
months it's worth you know two weeks of
my work to get something that nine
million people are gonna see I mean it's
worth it for a lot of other reasons but
but it's it's it's very satisfying to
get that really good clip oh yeah thanks
sure I have two quick questions the
first one is a little bit of a Footloose
question have you ever had any like
legal problems in terms of getting like
permission to set up and do the dance
and then also do you have like some sort
of internal rhythm that goes on in your
mind to keep time or anything like that
something I've learned about myself I'm
like a human metronome the one thing
about my dance that is useful is that is
the exact same pace no matter where I go
I know it there's never any music
playing but it's always just this so
when I'm editing the video it turns out
very handy that I have this sort of like
you know metronome clock that I can that
I can edit all the clips to and it's
good for the group dances because
there's that you know that tick-tock
that's me then what was the other
question like it like if you've had like
legal difficulty like with governments
or like municipalities to set it up a
great thing that streamlines the making
of this video profoundly was traveling
with off-the-shelf equipment this is the
gear that we take into countries this is
not very threatening looking those you
know I find is really threatening
looking as those rectangular boxes on
the Front's of cameras when people see
that when security guards see that oh
geez you know what's going when you have
a big camera that's over the shoulder
guards come in and they shut you down
this is what we shoot with we we look
like any other tourists and we are
essentially any other tourists making a
video so that got us away from a lot of
problems we did get shut down here and
there in Trafalgar Square in London they
ask just to leave when we were in the
u.s. stride insisted on getting
permission for all of our dancing clips
so we didn't have problems in the US
once we were shooting we
had problems getting that permission
because amazingly in this in this free
country it's very hard to have a free
and peaceable assembly shocking we
couldn't we actually ironically we tried
to shoot a dancing clip I really wanted
to shoot in front of the Jefferson
Memorial in DC and they would not allow
us to have a gathering of people at the
Jefferson Memorial huh okay that was
like a soap opera clapping well hey yeah
we could I wanted to shoot a dancing
clip at the Jefferson Memorial and they
said no you can't have people gather and
I was like you know to the parks and
recreation obvious do you guys know
about the First Amendment I'm not like
threatening I'm just pointing out the
irony do you know the First Amendment
that Jefferson participated in writing
was about free and peaceable assembly
they're like we don't care so so yeah it
was hard getting permission in the
States because we had to follow play by
the rules but in Europe we just kind of
run around it doesn't take long to shoot
the clip 5 10 minutes you know if the
security guards are starting to stare
and come over we just finish up and move
on so you know it's nice that we're not
shooting a movie we don't have dialogue
we don't have scenes to perform we just
go there dance get out of there it's
nice and easy thanks that was the
Parthenon I got arrested while I didn't
get arrested i got yeah i had one
incident in the parthenon this was
earlier on in the previous video i shot
a dancing clip there and they don't
think it's funny when you dance in front
of the Python they actually find it to
be very disrespectful and I got stopped
by a security guard he demanded that I
delete the footage for my camera I
refused to leave the footage my camera
so I know getting hauled off to the
police station for questioning for doing
this in front of the Parthenon and so
there's that i did i did get not quite
arrested but I could say sort of
arrested once for dancing which was
exciting I sort of checked that off mic
tick box of things to do and and try not
to have it happen again yeah you've
probably been asked this question
already but since you made another video
is there any is there any place you
haven't been yet I've never been outer
space okay
how to be that's a it's a long term goal
and I like to say it and it sounds like
a joke but but someday it might be
possible I mean we're just talking to
Tiffany this year with the the lunar
xprize and and I'm really excited about
the commercial endeavours I've been in
touch with the Virgin Galactic people
about getting people up into space I
think it's about time that that we get
back on that because i think the space
program is sort of stagnated and and the
notion of exploration which i think is a
fundamental thing to humanity it's it's
what we do and and we've we've covered
the planet i mean if the one of the
things that sort of these videos are
about or the fact that we we can get
anywhere there's nowhere on earth you
can't get to in 48 hours there's
literally nowhere on earth you can't get
to so we need to keep exploring in outer
space and i would love some day to find
a way to get out either in orbit maybe
before i die to the moon who knows yeah
um i'm curious when you're going
somewhere to say night if nine million
people in the recent months have seen
your video there's a big chance that
people watching it have never seen any
of those places before and they'll never
see those places in their life so how
much sensitivity goes into choosing the
location for the backdrop that you'll be
filming because a lot of places so I've
got life goals for travelling up in a
ton of places but some of these places I
may never go and so or may never have
seen or heard of or anything like that
and so the impression I get from you
know the backdrop or the people dancing
with you may be long lasting for me and
my impression of what those people you
know what that environment looks like or
you know and if you're taking a video in
San Francisco there are beautiful places
and you can get the oppression Wow San
Francisco is amazing or maybe not so
nice I mean do you have influence from
the people you're visiting to I learned
a big lesson Oh mr. mom we were in Guam
Melissa and I in 2006 and and we had a
hard time finding a good place to shoot
in Guam because it's an island it's
actually part of the United States and
we just everywhere we went we kept
seeing garbage turn around yeah this is
real garbage problem when you're on a
small island and I cut him a break with
this when you're on a small so on and
it's tough to know what to do with your
garbage so there were just a lot of
junked cars and stuff like that in the
second video i put a clip in where I'm
dancing in front of a bunch of junk cars
there's a little bit sarcastic it was a
little bit of a nod to the fact that
every place isn't astonishing
beautiful yeah and boy I got it bad from
the gum aeneans they were pissed so I
I'm had heightened awareness now that
what I am sort of doing is summing a
country up or a region yeah i think it
is you can't do you really can having
the people in there helps because i
think that is a great way to if you are
gonna represent a place don't just stand
in front of a rock get the people there
to dance with you and that's a nice
change that that I made that I learned
but it's a big obligation to try and to
try and do that I just find find
beautiful clips you know so you would
you shoot for a very night like I saw in
San Francisco you're behind the yeah
we're in the Seven Sisters yeah
everything like that oh yeah but when
you calling me obviously it's an exotic
place are you really shooting for the
nicest scene behind you or is it just
kind of we really like trying to
represent the scope of the earth both in
terms of humanity and and backdrops to
just get as much diversity as I can
beauty is great and sometimes there are
really beautiful shots like I think of
the tulips in the Netherlands those
those red tulips in the desert in
Australia and stuff like that but it's
more about showing I really want to jog
people into realizing how incredibly
different this planet is and you know
with our day-to-day experiences inside
of our life bubbles where we see the
same thing every days it's very easy to
forget that you know and you're driving
by the costcos and the chilies and the
TGI Fridays it's great to remember that
there's so much more in terms of the
scope of what the planet has okay cool
um a question about the company that
paid for those trips what's that ah the
company that paid that's try the gum
they had some interest in paying for the
dirt so I was just wondering the day you
apply to you and say wow now we sell
twice as many gums because people always
want to know chew gum when they're
dancing good so what is try to get out
of it yeah yeah did you get any reply
from them did I get any replies no I
don't
ask its I think it's a very difficult
thing to measure like how a video like
this has impacted the sales of a chewing
gum I don't know I don't know that they
know they they were willing to let me go
on a second one so i think i think
they've gotten emails from people
they've gotten positive feedback but you
know I I don't want to look a gift horse
in the mouth they they let me make the
video that i want to make and they're
really amazingly hands off our
relationship has just been you know here
here here's what I think it'll cost for
me to make this video and okay here you
go and then I go and I make it and I say
thanks to stride at the end when I go on
TV when I get invited to do interviews
and stuff I let people know that stride
sent me on the trip and and that's
that's sort of it that's the
relationship it's been really really
surprisingly open and I think a lot of
other companies I hear a lot of people
and companies say it's amazing what's
try did we'd like to do that too and
then I'll talk to them some more and
they're like but could you just wear
this t-shirt you know that I think
companies find it is very very rare that
a company is willing to take such a
chance to be so low profile in something
that they're investing a fair amount of
money in so I'm just I'm really
fortunate that they were the first folks
who came along we've got a question on
the VC here where where are you kirkland
purple oh okay hi um hi question is hi
how did you overcome the language
barrier how do I overcome the language
barrier where are you from if you know
I'm asking I'm from Kirkland why are you
from Russia are you from Russia okay the
the language barrier I i I'm not great
with languages I feel very lucky that
english is the language that I speak
should should i look at you that way
does this make sense if i'm looking at
you up on the screen whatever i would
have to
in English is you're over there okay hey
where are you pointing now oh hi okay
the English is very widely spoken as I'm
sure you know all over the world now
more and more each passing year and
certainly when you're within the tourist
infrastructure of a country when you're
when you're going to hotels and airports
you can get by pretty well with English
I always try and learn a few basic words
in each country that I go to but
honestly it's mostly out of courtesy
courtesy to learn the thank yous and the
hellos and the pleases but really I went
it when there's actual communication
being done I just I just use English
hand gestures pointing for the most part
i mean if if we don't have a language in
common someone who I'm talking to the
the communication is pretty simple i'm
either asking them how to get somewhere
or how to get something and and i can
usually communicate that just with with
basic simple language so you know it's
just it speaking english these days is a
great is a great asset to have for
anybody and and that's another reason
why i think americans really should get
out and travel more because we are so
lucky that we can get around virtually
anywhere just knowing English he thinks
we're pretty much out of pretty much out
of time here first I want to thank make
that again for coming out here and the
then I happen to notice that we have a
camera here and we have Matt and we have
a bunch of Googlers and there's a wall
here so it's wondering if we could get
everyone up here to for just a few
seconds of dancing with mash ya know if
you guys want to dance too well we'll be
dancing right here so if you guys want
to dance on camera while we are that
would be really funny yeah i'm gonna do
a three two one so just do whatever your
body feels like doing alright we're
ready go metronome three two one dance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
