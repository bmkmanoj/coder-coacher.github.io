speaker is Professor Derek Keith's the
executive director of information and
communication services at the University
of Western Cape in South Africa Derek
started as a marine biologist with very
strong interest in using technology to
improve teaching and learning and to
establish higher education in the
developing world to respond to the
challenges of globalization and promote
sustainable development while may Nathan
while maintaining the quality of the
environment so subjects very close to
our hearts here at Google he established
the internet bio ed project and the
internet for environmental education
projects in the 1990s which were a bit
ahead of their time for South Africa and
he also established the International
ocean institute southern africa was
director of it for four years Derek
Keyes has published over 75 research
papers in biology and in the application
of Technology the talk this afternoon is
going to focus on his current research
interest including a collaboration and
lessons for international collaboration
of free and open source software will
this relates to both free and open
content and education 3.0 so the focus
will be the African virtual open
initiatives and research project derek
has a passion about the potential of
ict-based collaboration to unify
expertise within Africa and stimulate
development so with that I'll hand over
to Professor Derek Keats and I just like
to mention that this is going to be
recorded and will go externally as well
so so you know in terms of ants asking
questions thanks
thank you very much as Aida this talk is
is about a network that we are in the
process of building and growing or we
have already built in are in the process
of growing in Africa to build capacity
in software engineering by doing free
and open source software development and
the project is called the African
virtual open initiatives and resources
or a voir few if you know the French
verb to have what I'm going to do is to
tell a little bit of a potpourri of
stories so you're not going to get
anything in a lot of detail but if you
want the details I'd be more than happy
to answer questions at the end of the
talk we just came from building 43 and
we saw this wonderful animation of
Google's search queries from around the
world and and a line flashed up on the
screen Africa is mostly dark because it
has not got as many people using
computers as the developed world and
this is an old picture that dates back i
think too about 1994 which people were
using as desktop backgrounds quite
popularly in those days and it shows
lights of the world kind of composite
from space and if you take a sample a
random sample anywhere in the developed
world you will find very high
concentrations of these lights and if
you take a random sample in the
developing world you won't find such
high concentrations and this is actually
a good proxy for other things such as
technology research and development
capacity including things like software
engineering and when you look at this
it's kind of a little bit of a
depressing scenario if you live in
African are as passionate about the
potential of the continent as I am and
you look at this and you think well
there's nothing there but actually
that's not true it's the dots are there
it's just the space between them is
greater than what it is in the developed
world and so if we can change the scale
of our thinking we can actually do
things perhaps
that can that we might think otherwise
could only be done in the developed
world and this is the great thing about
the internet is if we can use it as a
glue to glue together our activities we
can build kind of virtual concentrations
of expertise and skills and do things
that we would otherwise not be able to
do because the skills are simply not
concentrated enough there isn't a
critical mass at any one particular site
I spent most of the day yesterday at
Stanford and there's probably more
skills and expertise in that one
University than there is in the entire
continent but nevertheless if we can
create these virtual concentrations we
can do some really interesting things so
that's what the African virtual open
initiatives and resources project is all
about it's about casting a wider net and
creating synergy among people doing
things often in isolation or isolated in
institutions with relatively weak
bandwidth and poor internet connectivity
and then to use the talent that we have
to build more talent as opposed to what
a lot of development aid type activities
do is pilot in consultants who basically
just come in and leave behind the pile
of garbage and what ends up happening is
actually develop development of the
developed world rather than development
of the developing world so we're trying
to turn that paradigm on its head as it
were but of course we're not doing that
in isolation we do have connections
outside of Africa with all sorts of
things and thanks to the Google guest
network I was sitting at a picnic table
outside because I arrived a little bit
early not knowing how long it took to
get here from my hotel and I was having
a chat with two colleagues who are in
Afghanistan at the moment implementing
software that was made a hundred percent
made in Africa and I think that's pretty
pretty cool having having United this
team and effort across across multiple
institutions so why software engineering
well I'm passionate about the potential
of collaboration in all sorts of fields
but I am also a closet geek who recently
came out of the closet so when you when
you find me with an idol more
you will often find me writing code if I
don't have to write some report or some
other kind of document that's what I
tend to do with my spare time but it's
interesting that the barriers to entry
for software engineering are quite low I
mean you basically just need some kind
of a computer and it doesn't have to be
the highest in and with free and open
source software you don't need to get
anybody's permission to do the work you
can just begin if you have a computer of
some kind so really the barriers to
entry are as low as they can be there is
potential to create opportunities for
economic growth and we've seen that
we've created software and and we've
gone after business opportunities and
we've done things with that software
that generates revenue for the project
and so this project in Afghanistan for
example is a contract that we got as a
consequence of working together to
create software so there are business
opportunities there that can create
development opportunities and economic
growth but very little collaborative
software development is happening in
Africa a lot of what is actually being
done at the moment and if I look around
it at and I know many of the people that
are active in free and open source
software most of what is actually being
done is implementation so it's a
consumption exercise rather than a
production exercise so what we wanted to
do with the app war project is to make
it a production exercise that we
learning how to develop things not just
learning how to implement things so what
is the project entail we trying to build
human capacity and software engineering
through collaborating to build software
all of our software is licensed under
the gnu general public license it's all
free software to develop and support
free software innovation in African
higher education institutions in a way
we try to get the camels nose in the
tint and in my university account the
whole camel is now in the tent we have a
policy on free and open source software
in the university and we have a policy
on free and open content within the
university and we're doing this by
uniting these disks Carson disperse
skills of course it doesn't do us any
good to do anything that is less than
world-class so we are trying to do
world-class innovative software and
services in the process
and then of course create an ecosystem
that promotes and strengthens kind of
innovation within Africa through the
translation transactions taking place in
the ecosystem so as an example of
something that is taking place within
the ecosystem in my own University we
are at the end of life of legacy student
administration system so we decided that
we would work with this project and
build an entirely free and open-source
student information management system
using the tools building on the tools
that were developed in this project we
now have 20 odd software engineers and
and business analysts and and other
people working on this project and by
next year we will have a complete
integrated student information
management system that uses the services
oriented architecture and so we growing
the ecosystem through our own
institutional processes and that's
beginning to happen also in some of the
other partner institutions this was the
team when we started off at the
beginning of 2005 with the South African
minister of science and technology in
the middle there who is a very
passionate about free and open source
software and just gave a really nice
talk at our digital freedom exposition
that we had the week before last in Cape
Town as it stands at the moment now most
of the people in this team have
replicated themselves at least two or
three times and so we are about 70
people now involved in the project from
where we started about two years ago
where we're distributed the there's two
projects that work together one is
called a voir the other is called net
South Africa which in essence is a
master's program in ICT policy and
regulation and then there are some sites
with which which have implemented our
software and that we are collaborating
with and so this is this is gives you a
sense of what areas we cover at the
moment unfortunately the dot in Egypt
didn't happen so I had to draw a line
through it because I didn't have the
original image to edit this morning but
everything else there is is part of our
network so we do reach reach quite quite
widely within the continent there are
four cornerstones of this initiative
collaborating implementing coding and
connecting and and collaborating
basically is is participating in the
mailing list and and keeping up to date
with what people are doing answering
questions asking questions responding to
user queries all of those kinds of
things and we work almost entirely by
mailing list we we just simply don't
have the bandwidth to do much real-time
collaboration and so we work almost
entirely by mailing list and with code
repositories in CVS and then of course
it doesn't do us any good if we don't
implement the the products that we make
and so implementing is also a part of
being part of the network as is
connecting and creating other
opportunities for the network to grow
and for the network to implement the its
its products in other places so I
mentioned Afghanistan as an example we
recently also just got a contract to do
a social networking site for a Nordic
Southern African collaboration
initiative that's run by all the the
Nordic universities the Scandinavian
universities in collaboration with the
Southern African with their southern
African counterparts and so that's a
that's going to be quite an interesting
project as well so there are
opportunities to connect with other
initiatives for our participation in
this project we initiated the unit that
we call the free software innovation
unit it's not it doesn't get any
University money it's funded entirely by
the work that it does so if it doesn't
connect and implement it it dies and
it's going quite strong at the moment we
have about 30 people in it two of whom
as I as I just mentioned are currently
in Afghanistan one has just come back
from Ghana and another is is I think
heading off to click click click we're
somewhere in west africa forgotten where
now this week as well
the first project was an application
framework which we called kinky not a
good choice of words kind of funny but
not a good choice of words as it as it
turns out and an e-learning platform
that we call cool knowledge environment
for web learning and kinky stands for
kinky is not cool yet you know it's kind
of this keke keke play on words but it
as it as it turns out it wasn't good for
business and so we've changed the name
but I'll talk about that a little bit
later the idea is to look at what's
happening in education and what's
happening in the world of computer
science and on the periphery of computer
science and and to see whether we can
actually build something that's at the
intersection of those two kind of on the
cutting edge of both but something that
will work within our environment so I
just listened in on the on the last talk
a little bit about three 3d video I mean
we could not do that in Africa because
we simply don't have the bandwidth so we
have to focus on things that we can do
in our environment and it should be
driven by users and practitioners not by
our our enthusiasm for technology and we
should harness what I call the awesome
potential student projects a lot of
student projects get done they get filed
into shelves and the only thing they do
is they create a market for bookshelf
sellers and and so you know you get 100
theses in a shelf and then you need to
buy another book shelf so you buy
another bookshelf and then when you get
another hundred what we try to do with
this project is to give students an
opportunity to contribute to something
which will live beyond their their
thesis and we've had some success with
that so far every student that is
participated in this project has
contributed to contributed something
that is still being used I think the
average is about five percent so from
five percent to one hundred percent
a lot of the work that we do involves
collaborative design so there are
teachers lecturers professors whatever
you want to call them in the network we
work with the e-learning teams at the
various universities and various
e-learning projects we work with the
e-learning support people we work with
students we get information from
students we have people doing elearning
research as part of our project we work
with software developers and computer
scientists obviously and we have a
social network researcher in our project
as well studying our own processes so
that we can learn how to improve them
and we can use our project as a basis as
a kind of case study for others may be
wanting to do this build this same kinds
of collaborative networks picture being
worth a thousand words I just thought
I'd throw in a few pictures this is
University of Jos in Nigeria where
they're doing the training in the
e-learning use of the application in
e-learning educators and developers got
together last year in Ghana to discuss
how the e-learning system might be
beneficial to students in school level
what you call k to 12 here and Megan
shortly after that went back to Ghana
and got together with with another group
of developers and ran some training
workshops this is all part of an effort
to get as many people involved in
development as we can because the bigger
the community the more sustainable it's
likely to be this is an interesting one
I mentioned Afghanistan a couple of
times in Afghanistan they rebranded cool
angel which sends for Afghans next
generation elearning and they're
implementing it they've implemented it
Kabul University and are also
implementing it at in the public service
training public services alliance or
commission or whatever it's called for
their training as well and just to prove
I'm not lying that's a lecturer at Kabul
University who is running angel training
we've also done some training in the
Philippines and we'll be going back to
the Philippines this year in November to
run some more I think we've trained
people at 16 universities in the
Philippines so we're reaching out to
other places this is again the martyrs
University
small University in the middle of
nowhere in Uganda and what's interesting
there is almost everybody who's involved
in the project is is a woman and it's
one of the few places that I've been
around Africa which has a significant
number of women who are actively
participating in ICT projects it tends
to be very male-dominated so that's just
to give you an overview of some of the
people involved in some of the things
they're doing there's lots of other
products besides the e-learning
application I don't think I'm going to
bother mentioning those this is a just
I'll just show you one or two things
that have been implemented with the with
the tools created this is a repository
of research on higher education in
Africa which is now up and running
called a hero i'm sure you can google a
hero and find it this is a universities
are have big problems with committees
you know everything has got to be done
by a committee and so we have hundreds
if not thousands of these committees so
we use the system to build a committee
administration system for the university
of the western cape and it's now also
being implemented at a couple of other
universities in our network I think most
recently in Rwanda this is a site we set
up for hiv/aids program which includes
material for learning about living with
AIDS as well as how to prevent getting
AIDS and it's also linked to an
e-learning site where teachers teacher
trainers from around Africa come to
learn how to teach teachers how to deal
with hiv/aids in schools this is one
that we just started last week which is
going to turn into what we hope will be
the the YouTube for for academic
presentations and
the idea is to create a site where
people can share PowerPoint and open
office and other type presentations
automatically have them be decomposable
into into their elements so people can
use them also to build new things out of
them and to enable communities to grow
around them and we will have this
completed by the fifteenth of September
nattel Africa I've mentioned it's a
master's program in ICT policy and
regulation 27 universities around Africa
use these tools to run this program
collaboratively we've spent a lot of
time on on architecture one of the
things we did when we first started this
project we said well you know can are
there other free and open source
software projects that we could join
rather than creating a new one there
were a number of reasons why we created
a new project rather than joining others
one of them was that we want this
project to teach good software
engineering principles and in order to
do that you need a good architecture and
there were not that many frameworks and
applications that had a good solid
architecture that could be used to teach
good software engineering principles so
we we spend quite a bit of time on that
and we also spent we also wanted
something that was was it was you know
we started this at the time when web two
point O was just emerging and we wanted
we knew that things were going to be
changing over time so we wanted an
architecture that was easily extended so
for example when the prototype library
for doing Ajax stuff came out it took us
half a day to incorporate it that's it
that's how we made it extensible and so
we spent quite a lot of time on
designing particularly with a focus on
the idea of software engineering so in
2006 we went back to the drawing board
and we rebuilt those aspects of the
application framework that didn't meet
with our our vision in terms of the
front of the architecture and we created
the the second version of the framework
we called it Chi simba
and she Simba is to jail word my wife's
first languages to Chihuahua and she
grew up in Malawi and it's a word for
the framework used to build an African
traditional African house around the
house and so it seems like a good name
for for us to use for a framework for
building software applications it comes
out of Africa so it's an object-oriented
framework for rapid application
development for learning good software
engineering practices for and one of the
things one of the difficulties we find
when bringing new newbie developers on
board this project is that there is a
kind of cultural kind of cultural this
fear of participating in collaboration
of opening yourself up for potential
criticism and and all of that and there
are different reasons for it in
different places but it's it's pretty
common and so part of our reason for
having our own project is that we can
create conditions that help build
confidence and help enable people to
build confidence in collaborating in in
in international teams just a little bit
about architecture it is a model view
controller application framework that
we're dealing with here everything is
modular and this is this if any I'm sure
this is all well-known stuff so I'll
just skip over it what we've put into
this framework is we've designed this
new architecture we've got a service
capacity for doing services oriented
architecture so you can use this
application framework for enterprise
development and that's why we're able to
use it within the university to build
our in our student information
management system we try to be standards
compliance we improve the object
orientation in the framework we improve
the code generation we working on
we're working currently on enterprise
services bus model driven development so
we can generate code from metadata and
the whole application is of course web
two point O enabled and ready for what I
call education three point Oh since I
said I'd mentioned that I guess I better
head what is education three point Oh a
lot of what is done in education using
the internet using Internet technologies
today is still very much along the lines
of what I've what I put in this slide
which is we've got 21st century
technology we've got 21st century minds
and we've got 19th century pedagogy now
you guys are all here on this wonderful
campus which is at the cutting edge of
just about everything and this may not
seem real to you yesterday I put up a
slide that said everywhere is not like
Stanford you know when I was at Stanford
and i think i could say also everywhere
is not like Google and and so I'm sorry
so a lot of what what is done is is is
really not using technology effectively
so what we Phillip Smith and I wrote
this paper genesis and emergence of
education 3.0 in higher education its
potential for Africa you can google it
and basically we think a new landscape
for education is emerging and this is
because of the arrival of digital
natives into education systems and
concepts of sharing and licenses and and
licensing that is is happening with
Creative Commons licenses attribution
attribution share-alike licenses for
content and that kind of thing new
social computing technologies which you
all know about I often have to explain
what i mean when i give this this kind
of talk because not everybody knows
about that emerging educational pedagogy
is and interestingly educational
institutional arrangements that are
really only beginning to form and part
of those institutional arrangements is
that we have to develop in Africa if
we're going to succeed in in developing
the continent to the to the level that
that has happened elsewhere is we've got
to collaborate and those institutional
arrangements have got to foster
collaboration we have to be able to take
a good course from this university a
good course from that University a good
course from this one and combine them
together and pool the results and other
because nothing else is going to work we
will not we're not going to have a
Stanford University in every African
country and unless we can do that we're
not going to see it ok there's my miss
the rest of the world is not like
Stanford actually that slide has got
some interesting I've got an interesting
tag cloud to go with it you know this
this is this is the reality for many of
us and even at my university in South
Africa which is relatively well-off
these are the things that we have to
deal with poor schools underprivileged
communities people living in shacks on
your investment in education week
students because they come out of this
poor education system extremely
constantly bandwidth I depending on how
you slice how you slice it probably
anywhere from 30 to a thousand times as
expensive our bandwidth is compared to
yours most people come out of most of
our students come out of Alice's where
they don't have computers and security
is an issue sometimes we have just done
a project with social work students
where we've given them all laptops in a
pilot study and one of the difficulties
that they have is that some of them
travel by train and carrying a laptop on
a train can put their life in danger so
they can take a laptop home with them
they've leave it on the campus because
they might get stabbed for the laptop
you know and and and and food can even
be an issue so those are those are some
of the realities that we have to deal
with what I did is I took a look at some
things that might be chained we might be
able to change and we might be able to
put pressure on in order to change
education from the traditional one point
O version to the 3.0 version which i
think is the only version that's going
to get us out of trouble and I'm not
going to go into the details but those
are some of the
the the terms that aren't that are in
that text on ax me you can read if
you're interested you can read the paper
but there are three characteristics that
I think we can define one is that the
students have more of a role in making
choices and then make choices of a
different kind than are available today
as I said they may choose to take a
course from one University of course
from another University self-study
something and combine all of that that
doesn't happen at the moment that's what
we're saying we need to get to students
are able to be much more socially
networked and once they have access to
technology that can be socially
networked across disciplines in across
countries not just within their
classroom they can be producers of
reusable learning content because if we
if we allow that and we develop rubrics
for assessing students doing reusable
work and making them available for free
sharing and the creation of derivative
works then the students themselves can
be pretty comprehensive in which you
have a teacher who has all the knowledge
and students who are who are empty Minds
waiting for the knowledge is not
necessary anymore we don't need it we
can change and then we're going to need
those institutional arrangements that
permit this and it's my opinion that if
we don't do this in Africa then we're
going to lose the plot and so one of the
reasons by one of the the drivers behind
this a voyage echt is to is to create
the technology and collaborative
processes and to speak to each other
about how we can change the way in which
we structure education and how we can
create new opportunities and how we can
link those dots that I showed in the
first slide the lights together
virtually to create educational
opportunities that we simply don't have
at the moment so how can we engineer the
tipping point we need to do some things
we need to embrace and contribute to
free software that's fit for purpose
that's what we're trying to do in the ad
war project
and free and open standards for sharing
and co-creating information that's also
what we're trying to do a good base of
free and open resources for education
and I'm extremely critical of
initiatives like OpenCourseWare because
that follows a model of that really
divides the world into what I call the
high quality world in the low quality
world that's not my words that's what
the the foundation that actually funds
the the OpenCourseWare projects say in
in their reports so you know we
returning the world from from a
developed world into a development and a
developing world into a high quality
world in a low quality world without
testing the assumption that the only way
to get high-quality learning resources
is to do it at MIT and and and places of
that of that status it's a completely
untested assumption so what we need is
we really need collaborative sharing not
cooperative sharing and learning
processes and structures to take into
account lessons from this collaborative
development communities and that's one
of the reasons why we have a social
network researcher as part of our
community studying how we can build
these kinds of communities in other
areas and other disciplines and and and
start working together across as many
boundaries as we can and we need
evidence based research there's not much
evidence based research at the moment
okay back to a voir to finish up and
leave some time for questions where are
we now where are we next and what are
some of the potentials one of the things
that we've just started doing is
building low bandwidth integrated
real-time collaboration communication
tools that are able to use voice and
video we've got some student students
and developers working on this project
at the moment but I think from the
perspective of my visit here today I
just want to just build up a picture
quickly that we have a network and we
have principles and we have people
actively collaborating that is in place
we have products such as coolin and the
CH assemble occation framework that can
be used
and that can be used to create business
opportunities right now those things
exist we have a nav wat board that is a
governing board that has only meant
physically once in its existence
otherwise we work by email mailing lists
and and and that way we are currently
working on turning some of the work that
we're doing into a collaborative
master's degree we have a meeting in
Nairobi coming up at the end of May
where we will hopefully finalize this
and we should be in a position to offer
a collaborative master's degree in
collaborative development of free and
open source software in Africa and it
will be online and largely virtual and
it will it will lead the way in terms of
connecting universities in enabling
people to do a piece here and a piece
there and a piece there what we are
talking about what I'm talking about
with zaida and Yvonne today hopefully is
the idea of having a code athan now
Google has a summer of code as you know
and but the good the summer of code
doesn't really reach the kind of people
that we want to reach it doesn't reach
the really newbie developers who are
afraid to participate in a collaborative
community who are scared to ask
questions and therefore don't don't
benefit from it we also are looking at
putting together an advisory board
because the the an advisory board who
who which is made up of people that have
done interesting things with free and
open source software or free and open
content so that we can learn from their
experiences and then we have the
ecosystem and within that ecosystem we
have various examples of how we can grow
that ecosystem through creating business
opportunities and so on and so we need
to do things to grow that ecosystem in
order to make this thing to take it
beyond the 15 universities that are at
the core of this at the moment so that
we are able to cover pretty much every
University in Africa that as a
genet connection and somebody doing
anything with technology and basically
so what I'm doing and one of the reasons
I travel around the world and speak as
at every opportunity I can is I think
that we can only do this if we form an
alliance of which is basically a network
of networks so we have the I voir
network we have an alliance with the
natal Africa network we have a lone
alliance with things that are happening
in Afghanistan we have an alliance with
various projects now that are happening
at Stanford and Berkeley and and
university of maryland and various other
places we are we are doing things for
example some software development for
projects that are being done at Stanford
we need to strengthen these alliances
and grow the Alliance's to cover other
areas and an alliance of course is a
network of networks as I said and if we
can increase the number of networks in
the Alliance in the Alliance we can
strengthen not only our own a voir
network but also the other network with
other members of of the Alliance my
thing just vibrated to tell me that I
need to finish up one of the things we
also need to do is reduce our dependency
on donor funds by taking on projects and
creating business opportunities and
engaging with our own internal processes
and so we have moved when we started we
were totally dependent on donor funds
and we have now moved at least a little
bit along that axis but we still have a
ways to go this was your google summer
of code for 2005 and I'm not entirely
sure that the dots are in Africa are in
fact accurate but nevertheless it does
show the scarcity of dots in Africa and
I think part of the reason for that is
we just simply don't have a critical
mass of developers and those that are
now beginning to learn to do software
development are still in that category
of being afraid to participate in
international collaborative projects so
one of the things that we can do with
this f1 its work and
and and the Alliance is that it's part
of is to bring in these young developers
create opportunities for them to
participate in a newbie friendly
development project where they can take
on something which is which is suitable
to their skill level and suitable to
their confidence level and start to
build confidence and get them up to the
point where actually it becomes second
nature to them to participate in mailing
lists and participating in international
collaborative development once we've
done that I think you will start to see
more of these orange pins in Africa and
then to finish up the real potential of
this network is that we have an
application framework that is ready for
today's web environment we have a team
that can expand it and build on it in
elearning and pretty much any other
application area we have its web two
point enable and it's a distributed
application so we can do stuff on mobile
phones as we're doing now and other
devices as well we have a process to
design develop deploy and support what
we think is great software and a way to
harness the potential of student
projects to build capacity their
potential business opportunities in
abundance I think if people just learn
to see them as they are beginning to do
and so how can we build synergy with
things that are happening here perhaps a
Google or other initiatives that perhaps
you are aware of that that that could
help to strengthen the Alliance's
so I've tried to summarize this network
this F waar African virtual open
initiatives and resources by saying we
are trying to connect up the dots we're
trying to create this kind of virtual
concentration and doing so by working
with universities we are not by any
stretch of the imagination limited to
universities it's just it just happens
to be the environment that those of us
who started this project know but we are
of course open to anyone who wants to
work hard and make a contribution or
learn from doing from doing it including
businesses technical institutes private
enterprises and so on so thank you very
much and I'd be happy to answer any
questions that you have about the
details given that I didn't really go
into detail about anything
I understanding from your darkness that
the software decocking court is
developed by people that have a big
judgment but
what we've done is we have a grant from
the International Development Research
Center the eye dr c which is canadian
organization that funds the salary of
one developer and in different
institutions have used it differently so
in in some they have paid the salary of
one developer and then that developer x
kind of to supervise student projects in
others they've said that they've got a
person already on their staff who can do
that so they put the money into making
bursaries available to students so it
works differently in different countries
and it's going to be interesting to see
what happens now because the idrc grant
is coming to an end and everybody is
undertaken that they won't let the
project die just because there's days in
donor funding but it varies depending on
which university or in our case at the
University of the Western Cape we get
about we have thirty percent of a
developer salary and plus we have a
salary for the researcher and and
everything else that we do is on the
basis of projects that we we undertake
so if we don't get projects then we
don't we don't exist follow question man
so you mentioned some student
involvement
do you find that students are more and
liable when they were
how does students job prospect change
the question is how do students job
prospects change our students more
employable as a consequence of working
on this project and i would say
extremely yes you know it a lot of
people when they looking to hire
somebody they want someone who can
conceptualize problems don't care what
language they've learned you can learn a
language over a few days you know
they're not interested in whether you
know this syntax or that syntax but that
you can conceptualize problems and
that's one of the things that they learn
is they learn how to conceptualize
problems that before they write any code
they must write a white paper they must
be able to conceptualize the problem
discuss it with other people take
criticism and and so on and certainly at
the University of the Western Cape we
have great deal of difficulty keeping
our interns around till they finish
because they get offered jobs yeah it
varies of course depending on which
country people are in i think in
tanzania they also have that problem
they the students just get they get
soaked up very quickly by industry
so long as I mentioned
but across the places in design ability
we the question was are there commercial
aspects to this concept of design
deployed avella developed design you
know what I mean design developed deploy
the software are their commercial
prospects we this project has been in
existence only for two years we haven't
spun out any commercial businesses and
but we would be very happy if someone
wanted to and and wanted to create
business opportunities using this
software just the same way that people
have created businesses implementing
other tools like joomla and and those
kinds of things you know there are lots
of businesses small small to medium
enterprise kind of businesses that if
that's all they do they just implement
those things so we would love that to
see that happen but it hasn't happened
yet
not a question
so the question is given that we are
bandwidth limited how do we collaborate
and communicate across teams since we're
distributed around 12 or so countries
and well the answer to that is we we
just used what has always worked for for
collaborative software development since
the early days of the internet we use
mailing lists and we use code repository
that is mainly text based so we use CBS
we do have other repository types
running in our network but people still
choose CVS over everything else simply
because they have the skills and it's
easy and and and and it's relatively
simple for them to do so and since it's
mostly just moving text around it's it
works even at the low bandwidth and then
we do have discussion forums and we do
occasionally try to have voice over IP
type conversations but it just never it
doesn't work out because even in in in
in some of the universities that are
participating even a simple IRC chat
doesn't work just it they just leave
isn't even enough bandwidth for that
as you see the mobile platform
becoming more important for learning
tool for research
that increasing
still give me the notebook
mentions of problems the notebook
the global platform and
off of that
so the question is how do we see mobile
devices playing a role and are we just
looking at students having access to
notebooks and that kind of thing I think
as mobile devices are improving they
will become increasingly important but
they're still very expensive so in the
project with our social work students
for example we were we were intending to
use a mobile device out of India called
a mobilis which is developed by the
night expanded a guy who did the sim
puter this company called encore
software and they were simply unable to
deliver them on time for us to use and
so we ended up having to buy second-hand
notebooks as a replacement for these
mobile devices we are doing some work
also with mobile phones and we but that
is just just at the beginning station
that is still fairly informal but it
involves some collaboration Stanford
University and a couple of other
universities that are interested in
mobile devices I think National
University of Rwanda is also beginning
to develop a lab for for for doing
mobile work as well so I think that's
something that we will see expand over
the next year or two but it's something
we're just getting into at this stage we
have done some development using the
Gecko engine using zool to be able to in
a to enable students to synchronize with
the learning environment so that they
can have their work with them when they
go away from the campus because unlike
here you don't find wireless hotspots
all over the place so when they go out
in the community and many of the
students are out working in communities
especially social work in nursing and
people like that they're out in Township
communities where they simply don't have
access so we've done these applications
that run on the on the desktop that will
pick up the Wi-Fi and will synchronize
their their content with them so they
can work offline and there
out in the community
