MITCH GOLDSTROM: Hello,
everyone.
For those of you who don't
know me, my name is Mitch
Goldstrom out of the
Venice office.
And I came out of the visible
effects industry and film
post-production industry, and
have made a lot of contacts,
maintained a lot of contacts,
and continue to hear some very
interesting technologies
that come up.
And one of those is something
that Tim here has been working
on, 360-degree video.
Time and I have worked together
at Digital Domain,
which is actually right across
the street from us now,
actually, in the building
we're sitting in.
Tim's going to go into that
a little more later.
So I posted at [INAUDIBLE] page,
you'll see it on the
front page of the presentation
when it comes up.
But it's goto/360vid--
that's goto/360vid, if anyone
wants to post any questions.
And without any further ado,
I'm going to pop the
presentation on the projector
and introduce Tim.
Tim Conway, everyone.
TIM CONWAY: Thank you, Mitch.
I'm loaded here.
How are you guys doing?
Thank you for coming.
So as Mitch said, I am here to
kind of explain my side of
360-degree video.
It's funny, I'll kind
of read along.
So first, I want to say thank
you for inviting me today.
I'm aware that Google
has a lot of history
with 360-degree video.
So forgive me if what
I'm saying is
old news to you guys.
And honestly, I don't know
if any of you guys
actually get into.
But I know in other parts of
Google, it's a heavily used
piece of media.
I am an independent 360-degree
video creator.
And I wanted to share my
personal history with the
process and explain how I
came to be shooting it.
And recently I shot a 360-degree
music video for a
band called Matchbox Twenty,
which is out now
on their new album.
And this is how I did it.
First off, about me, as Mitch
said, I've got 20-plus years
in the visual effects
industry.
I am the founder of a company
called The Integration Company
as well, which we specialize
in three dimensional camera
tracking as a service to feed
post-houses, CG artists,
things like that.
You can see our website there,
theintegrationcompany.com.

I'm not related to Tim Conway
from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show.&quot;
I get that quite a bit.
I am not the voice of Mermaid
Man on &quot;SpongeBob,&quot; but I wish
I were, because that would
be freaking cool--
I have kids.
Six-plus years of 360 video
production time, which means I
really kind of bought my first
lens and started playing with
this about 6 and
1/2 years ago.
But I really realized I
have over 30 years of
fascination with it.
And I'll explain that
in a minute.
And fun fact-- yes, I worked at
Digital Domain in the '90s,
in this exact building,
probably in
this spot I'm standing.
This was the model
shop, I believe.
We did &quot;Titanic,&quot; and
&quot;Armageddon,&quot; and &quot;Fifth
Element,&quot; a lot of crazy
chemical building of ships and
models that happened here.
It took a good few years off
of everyone's lives.
And there is a good chance I
slept in this building at one
time or another in an office
somewhere around here, due to
what we called rendering in
those days, which you know
took days to do.
So for me, what 360-degree video
is, it's an evolution of
movies, of 2D movies and coming
all the way back from
the main things that happened
with the first footage of the
horse moving, which I found out
actually was derived from
a bet that the California
governor had made.
I don't know if any
of you guys have
ever heard that story.
But he hired a photographer to
help him prove a bet that
horses' hooves actually came
completely off the ground when
they were running.
And it turned out to be the
first movie footage.
Then Technicolor came along, and
then 3D kind of came and
went, and then VHSes and
DVDs and Blu-rays.
And now we're back to 3D.
But it's all a push
on the same thing.
It's all taking a 2D,
effectively, shot from one
direction and trying to enhance
it and make it better
and make people want to see it
again, and more, and all that.
For me, whatever you want to
call it, it's not 360 video,
because 360 video is giving
the user the ability to
actually get in there
and look around.
And to me right now, there's
sort of an evolution and a
revolution that's happened.
So the revolution's on now.
The evolution I'll talk
about a bit here.
But first, what is
360-degree video?
It's 360-degree recorded
video--

and I may have some typos
in here, forgive me--
that allows the viewer to look
in another direction other
than the point of view that
is directly playing
back in front of them.
Here we see Rob Thomas of
Matchbox 20 centered in the
top window.
The actual 360 footage shown
below reveals that the entire
band was there, and captured all
at once in the same shot.
I shot this footage, and will
explain how in a moment.
But first, let's get back
to the evolution.

It's funny, the history, as I
found it, is starting with a
thing called Circle-Vision,
which I first saw when I was a
kid, about 10 years old
in Disneyland in their
Tomorrowland Circlerama
theater.
And I found that Mr. Walt
Disney actually
patented the idea.
And it looks like he had a
Rambler station wagon, which
was one of my favorite cars.
And came up with this idea,
or somebody came
up with it, in 1956.
They applied for this patent
on the technology.
And past years after, they built
these crazy rigs that
you see on the right here.
And they built the big dome and
shot all kinds of movies.
And I remember standing in
there, thinking it was some
fly over America or something
that I saw when I was a kid.
And I couldn't believe that I
could turn around and look
backwards and see what
was going on over
there and look forward.
And it was just mind-boggling
to me.

It kind of disappeared
for a while.
And I got into this other world
and grew up a bit and
started making movies
and all that kind of
stuff, and visual effects.
And it all wasn't around for a
bit, for me at least, until 20
years or so later.
And I saw it resurface as
something on the internet that
every realtor was buzzing about
called the Virtual Tour.
And I started getting into it.
I was going, man, that's like
that old movie I saw back in
Disneyland.
How is this being done?
How is it on my desktop now?
This is really, really
amazing.
And it turned out that there
were mainly-- and in my
opinion still are-- two main
ways that I found to do it.
And they're both
very different.

This is an example of a system
that I currently use.
Up here on the table I
have some as well.
And you guys are welcome
to take a look at it.
The lens on the left is a
GoPano plus single lens.
Retails for about $600.00,
I think, $600, $700.
And then there's some software
that comes with it that's
another $200, I believe.
So you're at a $900 investment,
approximately, to
get into building them.
And you still don't
have the camera.
You have to get your
capture source.
And what the real estate
people were doing were
mounting them to nice
high end DSLRs.
And they didn't care.
They were shooting megapixel
frames, and all this stuff.
But you can see here, when we
got to put it on a video
camera, at the time-- like the
graph that they have here is
pretty good.
It's a 720p HD camera.
And because we're only exposing,
effectively, a piece
of the negative, only the
center of it's useful.
Only the vertical pixels
are useful.
The width is trash.
I really want a square.
If I had a square camera,
that's what I would be
shooting with to capture with.
But when you put it through
the software, like this
particular image, you put it
through the software and it
crops out the usable stuff
and it unwraps it.
And the system it is very bent
mirror, which created a
distorted image which I like
to call the doughnut.
It's not the official term.
There's all kinds of different
terminologies for the ways to
stitch and unwrap and
make these things.
And it all exists.
But for my purposes,
I keep it simple.

So this is the doughnut
version of the system.
It requires software
to unwrap.
And it required a downloadable
app that you would make your
own footage.
And you'd download it.
And you'd pull it
into this thing.
And you'd be able to play it on
your own laptop and show it
to your friends and go, oh,
look, how cool is this?
And then eventually they
released a web player that you
could embed into your own
personal website.
And then you were kind
of on to something.
You were going out and
you were shooting
your own 360 videos.
But still pixels
were a problem.
I wasn't getting many of them.
And it was not enough
to keep it clean.
So the second system that people
were using a lot also
used a distorted lens.
But in this case, it was
commonly referred to as a
fisheye lens, which required
a camera to shoot multiple
pictures, usually turned around
at the center of the
lens and overlapping areas of
the picture to allow it to be
stitched together.
And here you see a whole
sequence of somebody out in
the woods doing these tiles,
effectively, with probably 20
degrees of overlapping image.
And on the left, you can see a
still camera with probably an
8 millimeter fisheye lens on
there and a nodal head, which
keeps it rotating right around
the center of the lens axis.
On the left, they have
their final image.
On the right, there's
effectively two spaces in this
system that don't get exposed.
Straight down you're looking
at the camera base.

You need to clean that up.
So they do a lot of paint-out,
which is fine, because these
were still frames.
It wasn't really too
much of a problem.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Tim, is that
why a lot of the QuickTime
virtual reality tours had that
disk, like if you were to zoom
down or up, it would have a disk
with the QuickTime logo,
because they couldn't expose
that particular piece?
TIM CONWAY: Yeah, and oddly
enough, the doughnut system is
effectively that too.
Because it see 360
degree around.
But it only sees 50 degrees
north and south of level.
But that space is still there.
The player just gets turned off,
and you don't go there.
But you can give the viewer
the ability to go there.
You can open it up,
and you can put an
advertisement in there.
I've always thought about
putting things about the bands
that I'm shooting, maybe lyrics
that are running in
sync with the video and
stuff like that.
So it's there.
People tend to not like it.
They say that there's
something--
it's two schools of thought--
but some people are more like,
I don't get to look up.
Well, I don't usually walk
down the street and look
straight up either.
It's not something I commonly
stare at my feet
or at the sky about.
But regardless, that's me.
And during this time
and on into now--
and Google is actually very
big into this, too--
a third system emerged which
is worth mentioning because
it's ridiculously cool.
It uses normal lenses and takes
large volumes of high
resolution pictures that can be
stitched together, commonly
known as gigapixel imagery.
And there's different
gigapixel.org and gigapixel
companies and guys that built
these motorized mounts that,
maybe you guys have seen it.
It's really, really cool.
But it just takes little tiny
pictures on really long lenses
and pans around and allows you
to go deep into the 360.
So you're looking at a wide
shot, but you can zoom way in
and see a dog that happened to
be standing on the street
corner that you would have never
seen from the massive
distance that you're
looking at.
I suggest checking that
out if you want to
burn a lot of time.
So these two styles of
360-degree image capture for
stills soon got adapted
to video.
The doughnut style was pretty
straightforward, I thought.
You unscrew the bent mirror off
of your still camera and
you screw it in to your
video camera.
The manufacturer tweaks
the software a bit.
And you're off to the races.
But it also revealed a painful
trait that was not going to be
easily overcome.
And that's what I was mentioning
before, that on the
left you can see, in that six
years ago when I was doing
this it was 720p video.
And then some HD proper 1080
cameras rolled out.
So I was able to get from my 304
pixel tall image to about
a 556 pixel tall image.
You can see on the left
I've cropped out.
That's the only usable part of
any exposed image when you're
using one of these doughnut
style systems.
So when it's unwrapped,
it's 304 pixels tall.
It's blurry.
Dang it, I needed more pixels.
My inexpensive doughnut system
just hit a brick wall.
It's 2007 when I hear true
1920x1080 cameras are happening.
And they come out, and
I'm trying them.
And it helps but it's
not much better.
And then people started talking
about the RED camera.
And I'm a filmmaker.
I'm shooting all day
long motion control
cameras with 2K scans.
And it's extremely expensive.
I'm like, I'm not going to be
able to put this thing on an
area or a Panavision camera, if
I can even get my hands on
one, and then go process
and scan and color
correct and all the stuff.
I'm trying to do this out of my
house with a video camera
and a $1,000 lens
that I bought.
So when I hear about this
possibility of video at 4K,
it's amazing.
But the RED camera and its 4K
promise and my answer with
that, I show up at [? NAB ?]
with my friend, a man you
know named Andy Lesniak.
And I see it in person.
It's not actually there.
They're talking about it.
They've got this big booth
and this release.
And they've got prototypes
in boxes and images.
And they say we're
taking orders.
Anybody that wants to put down
$1,000 and get on the list to
buy the $10,000 or $20,000
camera when it finally gets
made, if we decide to make it.
It's not happening for my
wallet to plunk it down.
But my friend Andy
goes for it.
So I'm still hitting
that brick wall.
Then out of seemingly nowhere
to me it happens.
Stitching videos alive and
popping up all over the place.
I go to a security expo in
San Diego and see it
for the first time.
And there it is on the left.
I'm sure a lot of people here
are familiar with it, the
immersive media system
at the time.
But it's everywhere.
It's strapped to bikes
and cars and
helicopters and surfers.
And all I can think
to do is look like
stitching is a monster.
When Google gets involved and we
get Street View, wow, this
is great, I think.
Except you need to have deep
pockets to get in this arena.
One cool thing I find is you an
look around at more stuff.
And they are more durable and
less vulnerable than a
doughnut system, because you see
those things are really a
piece of glass with a metal rod
screwed through a piece of
glass holding this mirror
at the end of a camera.
And it's top heavy.
And it doesn't like
to move very well.
And it vibrates when you start
running around with it.
It has its own inherent
focus problems.
So this thing looks
really cool.
All this stitching stuff
looks great.
And all this new stuff
is happening.
But it's a whole other world.
You got one camera up here on
the left that's doing 11
different takes at
the same time.
So you have 11 streams of video
that you're trying to
process and color correct.
And forgive me, I'm sure people
who have done it here
know it's painful.
Other guys start
following suit.
And more and more start
coming out.
Littler ones come out.
Somebody puts one in a Nerf
ball for some reason.
Google apparently has one with
an ice cream man riding it
around in a stadium.
It's awesome.
It's totally amazing.
So they seem to run the video.
Oh, the one thing I do realize,
though, is what I'm
doing with these cameras is I'm
popping a tape in it, or
I'm popping a hard
drive in it.
And I'm just picking it
up and I'm going.
I'm not dragging a leash.
I don't have cables coming
off to drives
and different things.
So I'm still in the
pros and the cons.
And I'm still in the less
expensive world, which I can
afford to do at this time.
So over time, stitching
cameras pop up.
And they start getting
smaller and cheaper.
And I start to wonder,
is this the time?

Time of the format
wars, and all
these things are happening.
And I'm looking at doughnut
and stitching and
who's going to win.

So in an affordable attempt for
me, the independent 360
video creator, I pick up a can
of 5D Mark II and take another
try at the best possible
image I can get with
the doughnut lens.
But it still falls short, even
though it's a really nice
still camera and it shoots
really good video.
And it gets cleaner.
And it gets a little sharper.
And I'm getting better lenses.
But I'm still stuck in the
low pixel count world.
And then I get the call
that brings hope.
My friend Andy gets his
RED ONE camera.
And he wants to shoot
a 360 test.
So we head to the roof of our
office building, which was
right over here in Santa
Monica at the time.
And it's awesome.
We're shooting RED 4K HD.
And I'm getting 38 by
40 by 2160 pixels.
My unwrapped images are more
than double what my HD footage
was from before.
But I don't own it.
And over time, I realize it's
also a very expensive arena to
try and get into.
I rent a RED EPIC as well
for a job or two.
And it's going good.
But I'm having some problems
with the focus and depth of
field issues, because I'm
finding that the REDs and
their lenses and stuff are built
like moving cameras.
And they think like
moving cameras.
So they have very similar
depth of field issues.
They need a lot of light to
hold something in focus.
You know, I've got a mirror,
and I'm trying to bring
somebody one foot away from
this mirror and hold the
infinity background
in focus as well.
So from a photography
standpoint, it's a nightmare.
The best thing is a bright,
sunny day and all the stops
you can get and all that.
And it's still a
little sketchy.

Then comes the beginning of what
I consider now to be the
revolution.
And it's quite unexpected.
I'm messing around with these
bigger cameras and all this.
And the guys that make my lens
come along and they make the
GoPano iPhone 360 attachment.
That's the one.
And it's this tiny
little lens.
And they were showing it
to me at the CES expo.
And it's all the buzz.
And CNN is talking about it.
And everybody's like, yeah,
there's this cool little 360
lens that you pop
on your phone.
And it puts it into
people's hands.
And it's $80, and away you go.
And effectively, it's
shooting HD.
It's shooting what I was getting
off of the big 5D and
all that kind of stuff.
It's going to have
similar results.
But it's in the people's
hands.
And a lot of people
have iPhones.
And anybody can go spend $80.
And you get the PC software or
the app downloads for free
that they made an iTunes.
It's all running on
Mac based stuff.
But won't fault them for that.
Hopefully they'll cross out into
some other genres soon.

So GoPano releases a 360 lens
attachment for the iPhone 4,
which is OK.
Still not 4K territory.
But they add something else.
And this is what
was big for me.
It's a user friendly website for
all the people who bought
the lenses to upload their
360 home movies.
And it gives guys like me a
place to post higher quality
videos as well.
So you don't just post your
life on videos there.
If I'm shooting big resolution
videos, I can put them up
there, too.
As long as I'm using the
software to transfer it over,
I'm in this new sort of, dare I
say it, YouTube style world
that's in 360.
It's all in 360.
Every image in there, you can
go in and look around.
And there's guys in Germany--
I don't know who these guys
are-- but they're mounting
them to the hood of McLarens and
Ferraris and jamming down
the autobahn at, like,
200 miles an hour and
getting tons of hits.
And it's rough and its grainy.
But people are having
fun with it.
And they're strapping it to
snowboards, and doing all
kinds of stuff.
And that starts happening, which
is really, really cool.
And then the company, GoPano,
that I've been doing work with
and using their products,
referred me to someone in Los
Angeles who needs a 360-degree
video shot.
And it's around this time that
JVC announces that they're
releasing a 4K video camera
that's more prosumer, and it's
going to be under $5,000.
So I'm from $50,000
REDs at 4K.
And now I'm looking at a $5,000
camera that supposedly
has the same pixel count.
And we make arrangements for one
to get sent out to me to
shoot this music video.
And you can see the
configuration here on the
left, the way it gets mounted.
And the music video is
for Matchbox Twenty.

So the music video is for the
song &quot;She's So Meane,&quot; by
Matchbox Twenty.
It's done in a single take of
the course in about five
minutes at 2:00 in the morning,
while they're in the
middle of shooting the official
music video for the
single to be released
on YouTube.
And the way this kind of happens
is I'm there, I'm sort
of the fly on the wall.
It's don't get in the way.
The film crew is everywhere.
They're spending
a ton of money.
But they have this set that's
just perfect for it, because
the way that the video is
constructed, as well, as the
band is all standing
in a circle in the
middle of this room.
And this girls comes in and just
destroys-- and you can
see her over here--
just destroys all of
their stuff while
they play in the circle.
And I'm talking with
the singer, Rob.
And he's like isn't this the
perfect opportunity to put 360
right in the middle, and
we all just sing
right into the lens?
And I'm like, ah.
Holy grail, brother.
You're talking to
the right guy.
Let's do it.
Can we make it happen?
He goes, yeah, yeah, I'll
make it happen.
So hours go by.
I'm there really sort
of shooting
this EPK kind of stuff.
You can see on the left end
image up here, I'm getting
behind them and walking around
and interviewing people, and
really building this data to be
used more or less as filler
and things that they're going to
put into websites and maybe
on DVD releases later, and
things of that nature.
But lo and behold, they sit
down, and actually we did it
in two takes because the
very first take--
so this will be funny if you
ever go watch it-- the very
first take the drummer, Paul,
loses his drumstick in the
middle of the song.
And he just kind of stops.
And he's like, oh, no, wait,
stop, stop, stop, stop.
So there's a conference.
And Paul, he has a very big part
of the video later on,
where they are going to
light him on fire.
And they're putting stuff
all over the drum kit.
And he's in a flame suit.
And he's got to play the song
another 15 more times.
And it's 2:00 in the
morning already.
And he's really not
that into it.
And they start asking me, can we
use the part that we have?
We got about a minute
and a half of it.
And I'm like, yeah, sure.
We can use it.
We can play it.
It will be a minute and a half
of your song that you could
post somewhere, or whatever.
I go, you know what?
But to be honest, it doesn't
really matter.
If you drop the drumstick,
drop the drumstick.
If you knock something
over, knock it over.
There's crew all over the place
walking around in the
background setting
up the next shot.
I'm in here.
There's me on the left in the
green shirt, far back corner.
I'm just like, go for it.
And t kind of re-sparks them.
And they're like, OK.
They do one take.
All the way through, he drops
the drumstick again.
He gets this look on his face.
And Rob just keeps singing and
walks around and goes over and
picks it up and comes over and
hands it back to him and walks
back over to the microphone
and keeps going.
And everybody's happy.
And you'll never see it if you
don't turn around and watch
that moment when you're
watching the video.
But that's the point
of the 360 video.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Would
now be a good time
to watch the video?
TIM CONWAY: We could
watch the video.

[MUSIC PLAYING]
TIM CONWAY: See what I did,
I showed you something
else that it does.
[MUSIC - MATCHBOX TWENTY,
&quot;SHE'S SO MEAN&quot;]

TIM CONWAY: So thing's a little
slower when it's big
and wireless.

So I found when it got posted
people were commenting on it.
I posted it up at GoPano.
And fortunately it was timed
with the record label.
And they did some press.
And we did some press about
JVC and their camera.
And here I am [INAUDIBLE].
It's good to watch these guys.
You have the ability
to sort of come in.

I'm probably running
around there.
There's our film crew
back there.
Yeah, there's me,
holding my 5D.

What's kind of interesting about
this stuff as well is it
makes this video.
But it also makes this video,
which can be used in just a
regular, posted on any old
website, YouTube, whatever,
black border around it or not.
I posted one on Vimeo that just
kept his aspect ratio,
like a crazy 3.4 to 1, or
whatever it comes out to.
I did one where I just added
a slow pan the whole time.
So over the course of the song,
they just drift across
the frame, and drift
across the frame.
So there's a lot of different
possibilities and things you
can do in post.
Other than that, I really did
hardly anything to it.

There's a little bit of color
correction, which was done in
Final Cut Pro.
So for me, I go off and
I shoot this thing.
Technically it takes the lenght
of the song to shoot.
I go home, I pull the
JVC footage in.
It gets processed through some
JVC software, and spits out
this 3840 by 2160 pixel
count image.
It takes maybe 15 minutes.
I pull it into Final Cut Pro.
I do some color correction,
add a head
title and some credits.
And the thing is rendered and
done and ready to post in
about three hours.
So you can see, it's
not really a big
time consuming process.
The iPhone ones are
even quicker.
I think you can actually upload
it from your phone to
the site, right them and there,
which is kind of cool.
There goes the drumstick.

Rob comes over and
helps them out.

Back on the mic, like
a true professional,
nothing ever happened.
Then he goes over and messes
with him some more.

And that's what I found people
started watching and
commenting and going, oh,
yeah, the guy drops a
drumstick at so-and-so.
And you got to go
check this out.

So you can imagine, there's
a lot you can do, because
there's a lot of discoveries
that get made.

The fun thing, too, is when you
put this in your iPad or
iPhone app, it'll use
the driver scope.
And you can do it that way as
well, and pan around and look
around and all that
good stuff.
So I'm on the doughnut.
I'm like, great, doughnut's
here, pixels are there,
money's cheap.
I don't have to do all
this crazy stuff.
And I can be a player.
I'm back in the game.
And just when I think that the
doughnut style has taken the
lead for me, the independent
360 video creator, I learn
that there is a new stitching
system making its way
out into the world.
And it's got the potential
to change the game again.
People are now putting very
powerful GoPro cameras into
action in these systems.
And this is happening now.
Just got an email a month
ago from this company.
And then a guy who I've been
working with who's a code
writer in Tokyo completely
randomly sent me a picture of
a rig he's built.
And it's six of these things
strapped together.
And he's writing a
player for it.
Everybody's starting to do it.
And the thing is, especially as
you can see here with the
new GoPro HERO3 Black, it's
capable of shooting 4K at 15
FPS, and burst mode.
So I'm not going to getting a
lot of time out of it at that
pixel count.
But it means that there's
hope that they're
going to get better.
And they're going to have longer
time and bigger cards.
And the HERO4 or the HERO5 could
be the one that shoots
for 45 minutes at 4K or whatever
when they get there.
And it's $400.
So you need six of
these, you still
haven't spent much money.
And you get a mount.
And there's companies that are
in the process right now, if
they're not already out giving
it away or selling it,
producing the players that
you'll need to embed your
websites, producing the
stitching software.
The stitching thing has always
been sort of an evil beast.
It's like when the guy crosses
from this camera to the camera
and a piece of the hand gets
cut off or something goes
missing, and the software
really has to
spend a lot of time.
I just know from my visual
effects stuff and stitching
HGR images and stuff like
that that it's got
its own pack of problems.
And it also has limitations that
you can't get too close
to the camera.
Because if you get 9 inches from
this one, these cameras
can't see you anymore.
And they don't have those pieces
to stitch back on.
So there's a certain range as
well of operational space.
But it's cool.
It's waterproof.
It's cheap.
We break them all the time.
I visual effects supervise
commercials as well.
I did a Nike thing a couple
months back where we were
bolting the cameras to
cleats of actual
football players' shoes.
And they were running down the
field and just absolutely
destroying the cameras.
And two, three takes, and
they were going send
the PAs to Best Buy.
We need six more.
And the trucks were
showing up.
And they just keep shooting.
So it's coming into the public
domain much more.
And people are making
iPhone apps.
And I saw a place that's got a
Droid app now, which is great.

And where is it going?
What's the revolution
going to become?
In my mind, there's a
couple of places.
I think it will always be
the multiple styles.
There's going to be the
doughnuts, and there's going
to be the stitching.
It's a matter of cost quality
and the right tool for the
job, et cetera.
The other questions for the
future or the medium are how
will it be used?
I think Smart TV is a logical
choice to support multiple
streams for 360 video.
I have one.
There's apps on it.
It's doing 3D right now.
I wear glasses, and I can watch
cheesy fly-overs that
people have made.
And the content isn't really
getting there yet that's
streamable.
But neither is the 360
content so much,
because it's fairly new.
It's going to take people like
me and people like Google and
people like these other
companies that are out there,
production companies that are
producing it and directors
that are getting their heads
around it and people to see it
as what it is.
You can always watch it from
one POV and just call it a
video all day long.
You don't ever have to turn
the camera around.
But you have the option
with this stuff.
So I think NFL, ESPN, some of
those guys are looking at it.
And it's a great place for
it to be in sports.
There's a system that GoPano
is developing, and maybe
others as well, that just uses
a camera and a fisheye lens,
so it's only 180 degrees.
But they have a software that
allows you to look at the
whole vista, or actually zoom
in and move around inside of
the stream and sort of
navigate yourself.
And then you got things like
head-tracking software, which
would make it really cool to be
able to just use your own
head to look around and forget
about controlling it.
You just look this way,
and it goes that way.
The YouTube 360 video, I just
had to put that in there
because I was like, for me, when
I heard that YouTube was
doing this 360 tour and 360,
360, I was blown away when I
found out there was
no actual 360.
But they built a really
cool round arena.
And then Swiffer came out
with a 360 broom.
And everybody else
had a 360 thing.
So it really kind of just
became a buzzword.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: It's
the new 3D.
TIM CONWAY: It's the new 3D.
So there you go.
It would be nice to be able to
post a few 360 videos on
YouTube, if I can wink at
somebody into the camera
somewhere or something.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: And I would
assume that the GoPano player
is specifically designed
to scroll left and
right and up and down.

TIM CONWAY: The website, the
one that you upload to?
It is, because they know that
their lenses are doughnut
style lenses.
And they're only shooting
that style of video.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: But the only
thing specific about the file
is the resolution?
TIM CONWAY: Correct.
You need to either be
using their app--
there's some sort of little bit
of code that gets tacked
in that says this is a GoPano
product, or something.
Either it's coming through
their app or it's coming
through the editorial software,
which I have that I
got with the big lens.
And that's another thing.
They do have a piece of software
that's similar to an
iMovie styled thing, where you
can load multiple 360 clips,
and then bring it down into
a timeline and trim them.
You can add an audio track
and things like that.
It's pretty basic.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: But it sounds
like it's all proprietary.
Right now there's no standard
for 360 video file format or
metadata or anything
like that.
TIM CONWAY: Not necessarily,
no.
People are just doing
it as best they can.
People are coming out with
different ways of doing it.
I've listed here that these
companies on the right,
production companies, virtual
surfers, immersive media.
Mativision is an interesting
one.

They seem to have come
up with a formula for
music videos only.
And they're using the little
cameras that you saw in the
earlier pictures,
the ladybugs, I
think they're called.
So it's five little
video cameras.
But they're putting 10
of them in an arena.
They've just done
Muse's concert.
And if you go to their website,
check it out.
But what they appear to be
doing is only doing live
concerts that then you can go to
iTunes and buy the concert.
You can download it to
your phone in 360.
You can watch it 360,
jump around to
the multiple cameras.
So if you're watching it again,
the next time you watch
it you're going to hang out by
the drummer for the whole
show, or whatever.
And I think that that's always
been one of my dreams of a
good use for it.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Virtual
groupie.
TIM CONWAY: Virtual
groupie, man.
Especially if you were at
the show, and you get to
voyeuristically watch yourself
10 years later and remember
what happened and see it from
behind the stage, and over
here and over there.
So there you go.
Thank you to Mitch and Google
and GoPano and 360HEROES,
Ryubin, my friend in Tokyo,
Tracy, Shelby, Alex, Allison,
all the people that helped me
with this and TIC360, my
family, and everyone that's
out there pushing
360 video right now.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Let's open
it up to questions,
if anyone has them.
I will be taking this
presentation and making a copy
of it and making available
to anyone who wants it.
There you go.
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
you were talking a little bit
about the playback
in the homes.
And with price of HD TVs coming
down, do you think
people will start putting
multiple screens around their
family room for watching 360?
TIM CONWAY: So you'd be able to
look at one screen and then
look at the other POV
in another screen?
AUDIENCE: Yeah, something like
that original Disney thing.
TIM CONWAY: Disney CircleVision,
yeah.
I think so.
It's not a bad way to do it.
Actually I've seen kind of
that it is happening.
More over in Sweden and
Amsterdam, they're really
pushing this stuff a
little bit faster.
And there's these little mini
domes that they're building
now that are maybe 20 feet
across or 30 feet across.
And inside it's a screen.
It's got a projector in it.
So yeah, I would think somebody
that's into it could
definitely build their own
little mini in-home system.
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the presentation.
That was really fun.
My question is less a technical
question, more an
artistic one.
I remember CircleVision as well
from Disneyland, from
Tomorrowland.
And one of the things I saw that
they were discovering was
kind of how to control the
point of interest.
I mean, there would be something
big happening over
here, but then something
else would happen.
And they would use music.
And the whole audience
kind of knew where
they could find stuff.
And someone would discover it.
Then we'd all turn.
And I think your drumstick point
is a little bit of that.
It's like suddenly we--
TIM CONWAY: There's something
over there you should be
looking at.
AUDIENCE: Something happens,
and you know to look.
Anymore lessons, I guess, from
your experience in this for
how that works?
TIM CONWAY: Yeah.
There's two things that
you can do, actually.
Right now with the way this
system works, there's another
sort of track called a
[? tween ?] track.
And in the software package, you
can make an edit that if
you know I want to watch the
drummer for a while, and then
I want to go back to him, and
then I want to come over here.
And it actually plays
back your edit.
So the whole time you're
watching it like a normal
music video.
But you still have the option to
get in there and click and
drag around.
When you let go and it comes to
the next point where that
tick mark is, it just pops back
in to the video as the
edited video and keeps going.
That's one way that it's sort of
focusing people on what you
want them to see.
But sound is actually another
one as well that is being
talked about right now.
I've been approached about a
project that I can't talk
about really.
But it is one of the things
about it, it's a music thing.
And there will be heightened
music in certain areas that
should draw the user
to that spot.
And you're going, what's
over there?
Obviously you need to be
listening in some sort of a
surround sound kind of way.
But they are starting to bring
that into the fold as well.
AUDIENCE: So are these players
evolving with surround sound,
so the sounds have a geographic
position as the
direction changes?
TIM CONWAY: I'm not sure.
I haven't gotten that
far into it yet.
It's just been presented
to me recently that
they want to do it.
And I'm sure other people in
other places have done it.
Why wouldn't you do it?
AUDIENCE: Sure.
Especially for video games.
TIM CONWAY: Yeah, it's
totally doable.
It's definitely coming.
And I think that from what I've
seen, what I've noticed
up to this time, the big
projects that have happened,
like a music video, concert
thing that they spent a lot of
money on, they kind of really
seem to be these one-off
things that happen
every year or so.
Spend a bunch of money on it.
It goes up onto a big
site and runs.
It's all sponsored by Doritos
or Ford or somebody.
And then it just kind
of goes away.
It runs its course, and
they take it off.
I don't know why it goes away.
But they shut them down
and turn them off.

The thing I would like to see
happening more, and especially
with the GoPano thing, is why
shut it down anymore?
Why not just keep building
these worlds and these
databases of 360 video and
having it available?
A lot like Google is doing
with the Street
View stuff, and that.
I think it's just now getting to
the point where more people
are going to have access to it
and will start creating more
cool stuff because of it.

Anybody else?

So yeah, there you go.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: That's probably
done with an iPhone.
TIM CONWAY: That
might be, yeah.
Are you on GoPano still?
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Yeah.
I just searched for Venice Beach
so that I could find the
one that you had done walking
around Venice Beach for the
drum circle.
TIM CONWAY: Oh, yeah.
What you could do here-- my
company that's sort of the
production and entity TIC360.
If you do a little search in
the window up there, all of
videos I've been involved
with will appear.
This is your Venice
drum circle.

MITCH GOLDSTROM: I
have the volume
turned all the way down.
[DRUMS PLAYING]
TIM CONWAY: This I
shot time lapse.
And I'm carrying
it, obviously.
So that becomes the other sort
of notable thing about
shooting a 360 is you're pretty
much always in your own
shot, unless you're under
it or above it.
And it's not too easy
to get above it.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: I think
a hat rig is in order.
TIM CONWAY: A what?
MITCH GOLDSTROM: A hat rig.
TIM CONWAY: Yes.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Or helmet.
TIM CONWAY: Let's
see what else.

MITCH GOLDSTROM: There are no
questions on the [INAUDIBLE].
And there's no more questions
in the room.
So thank you very much,
Tim, for coming
and giving this talk.
If anyone wants to come up and
put your fingerprints on the
expense lenses that Tim
has brought with us.
TIM CONWAY: We got the JVC
here you can dabble with.
Also, this one's kind of
interesting, just to show you
that companies with money do you
have interest, Sony, for
their [? blog e-released ?]
the 360 lens attachment.
So this little guy actually is a
doughnut system as well in a
very tiny format.
Unfortunately it's shooting
720p and not 1920x1080.
But it was another impulse
buy I had to have.

MITCH GOLDSTROM: The question
was does Sony have a site you
can log into?
TIM CONWAY: They had a way of
allowing you to convert it to
be able to post it
into your sites.
I think they do maybe
have a site as well.
But it never seemed to take off
like the GoPano one did.
I think this was a
different thing.
Once it got an attachment in
iPhone, it just got into so
many more people's hands.
But I would have to look back
into it and see if they still
have a functional site or now.
I'm not sure.
I kind of blew right by it.
There are companies with
standalone guys that are--
I don't know if you have my
demo, if it gets up there with
the websites that are listed
on the back, which you are
more than welcome to have.
But you can look in
some of those.
The guy in Tokyo, Ryubin,
gives away the players.
It's just a thing he does.
I supplied him with his
first actual RED
shot doughnut video.
And he went and built me a
player just because I gave him
the footage and posted it
for free for everybody.
So it's out there.
You make your own sites and
embed it in, if you're not
using GoPano's site,
obviously.
Because you do have to make an
investment in one of their
products in order to get your
videos into their site.
So that's why I would love to
see YouTube or somebody be
able to open up an area.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: So if anyone
out there is from YouTube
engineering and wants
to reach out--
TIM CONWAY: You might
know those guys.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: --to Tim,
definitely let me know.
Or I'll put you in
touch with him.
TIM CONWAY: Yeah, please do.
MITCH GOLDSTROM: Thanks
again, Tim.
Thanks again, everybody.
TIM CONWAY: Thank you.
