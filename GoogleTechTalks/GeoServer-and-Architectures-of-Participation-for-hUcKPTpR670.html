chris's talk today on the geoserver
project i'm gonna let him talk mostly
about geoserver and go into this so you
know really without further ado I'm not
going to actually know crystal awesome
off all that much to say but he's a
great guy I met him he was in Africa
Fulbright Scholar we met when I was in
graduate school over the internet and i
was using geoserver awesome product we
funded we funded the kml 21 streaming
portion of it and i think chris is going
to talk about sorry funded the 20 he's
going to talk about the 21 streaming so
without further ado chris holmes hi
everyone my name is chris holmes thanks
all for coming out it's great to see so
many people I wasn't expecting this so I
work for the open planning project once
we get to I'm also the chair of the
project steering committee for geoserver
and I'm also serving on the board of the
new open source geospatial foundation
which is an exciting new project a bunch
of open-source groups are collaborating
on so the overview of the talk we're
going to have an introduction to
geoserver we're going to talk about
geospatial open standards a bit and in
my first run-through I kind of stuck
them on once but what I'm doing this
time is sort of integrating with
geoserver and Google Earth and sort of
how we leverage standards to
interoperate with Google Earth and then
talk about bit of the future sort of
towards a collaborative geodata this is
a topic near to my heart and we're you
know we're looking to put a lot of
efforts but still very kind of
speculative so the open planning project
the URLs up there were a high-tech
nonprofit based in New York it was
originally founded by Mark Gorton it's
part of the lime group which is a bunch
of different companies limewire is the
one you might have heard of but he does
sort of brokerage firm and hedge funds
and whatnot and this is kind of his
philanthropy of giving something back
and it's cool he's definitely sort of
involved funder and comes up with ideas
and as I mean a core part of it so our
mission is top builds technology to
enhance the world of the season and
Democrat
Society we have three projects going
right now open plans is basically we
call it sort of sourceforge for open
democracy it's a tech talk in and of
itself so we'll stop there for now new
york city streets renaissance campaign
which is kind of more traditional
advocacy getting people to imagine what
new york could be and sort of get people
to advocate for nicer streetscapes and
less traffic and the like and geoserver
which is the topic of the talk today so
tops approach we kind of think ourselves
as a hybrid between a non-profit in a
business on the nonprofit side we have a
socially conscious mission and nonprofit
tax status but we run it sort of more
like a start-up there's a big initial
investment to incubate these you know
ambitious projects that we're looking to
make a difference and you know just like
how a venture cap will go after projects
you know we're starting a bunch of
projects and seeing what what you know
has a big role to play so if these
projects are popular you know and really
kind of explode the way you know Mozilla
sort of has then we want to find
socially conscious business models you
know so that we're not just you know
existing in some donor you're after
you're giving us money but you know
these should prove their own value and
then if there is sort of additional
profit we want to reinvest that from
successful projects into starting even
more cool innovative stuff and and
similar to Google the philosophy is
really you know find and recruit these
really taught people and just kind of
treat them super well and let them go so
our goals we want to make tools to
enhance government transparency and
provide opportunity for citizen
participation in shaping society and a
lot of this we sort of see as bringing
this route open-source philosophy to
other domains geospatial which were hit
on just this idea of you know
collaborating on maps of work on the
sort of source code of map and bring
people together you know collaborate
instead of just you know one person
providing it all politics is the sort of
open plans project and you know get
people to you know communicate all those
sorts of tools you saw in the Dean
campaign we want to make those even more
accessible
and get people to sort of see that you
know the way the world is is not given
that it's permeable and that you can
motivate for change which I really think
is the sort of core of open source as
well you know the software package is
not given to you you can change it and
suit it to your needs and you know make
a world that you want to live in and
urban planning with the New York State's
Renaissance containment one of the
things we did was had these you know
photoshopped streetscapes of what the
street could look like and it's this
idea of oh you know like this city isn't
a given you know we can motivate for a
change and you know change our world
just like you can change open source
software and then we really kind of want
to do open source for government anyone
who sort of thought about open source at
all you know it makes a lot of sense for
governments you don't have Brazil
competing with the US for the sort of
best license plate software you know
these things they can share across each
other but government sort of lack the
wherewithal to really start their own
open source projects and I don't think
really want you know a government being
the ones who are you know running the
open source project and we want to sort
of be a group that can start new
projects and build grow communities
around them for the benefit of
governments so the first of these
projects was geoserver started about
four years ago and it's an open source
server to publish and edit geospatial
data has strong support for open
geospatial consortium ogc standards
including WMS wfs filter and sld i'll
hit on those terms a bit later and the
big thing it does is really kind of this
middleware translate wit layer you know
you have government agencies already
gathering a bunch of different data
commercial companies but they all kind
of keep it in a bunch of different
formats that's inaccessible to the wider
web so we really are sort of middleware
to connect you you know from your
existing stuff we don't make you buy a
whole new system and convert to the
latest greatest thing will read your
formats and stick it out on the sort of
broader geospatial web and you'll output
in a bunch of different formats I mean
we haven't there's not you know one huge
standard format like HTML yet but
there's definitely some emerging so we
output gml shapefiles kml and kmz jpg
gif SVG PDF and it's easy to add more
formats to as stuff gets popular we'll
look into doing that so tops geoserver
motivations you know as I've sort of
been hitting on is really to make
geospatial information more accessible
to increase the sort of government
transparency and we're really looking to
have it be sort of a substrate I mean
one of the original things we were
interested in is sort of traffic
modelling and have these sort of
open-source traffic models but we had to
kind of go back one level down because
you couldn't get you know road data to
do cool traffic models and eventually
want to push that but you know were
contribute to and making a sort of
environment of you know open-source
around geospatial data and our thought
was really sort of instead of harassing
public officials and being like oh you
know you need to open this data you need
to spend all this money either you know
many sort of traditional advocacy
organizations might do our thought is
you know make tools that can make their
job easier so we started geoserver our
focus was wfs which is an open standard
that you know it lets you access
geographic information really lets you
get at the data behind a map the sort of
source code of a map if you will and on
top of that you can do stuff and do
analysis and it's really about that you
know real access to it and just like
open source not everyone's going to
check out the source code but you know
you want some people to be able to you
know analyze it and fix it and do
various stuff with it and then the sort
of other motivation was we wanted to see
if you know as a non-profit we could
really bootstrap a community around it
so original goals for geoserver we won't
needed it to be you know supporting and
advocating open standards extremely easy
to use and setup so there's no sort of
additional training costs and whatnot
connect to a variety of formats has to
scale I mean GIS data is huge as I'm
sure most you know and we really wanted
to track these outside contributors
build a wider ecology that's not just a
monoculture and we really believe that
that would make something stronger than
you know just us working on it alone
would do and I think we've had pretty
good success with that from our original
goals were
are currently the reference
supplementation of the wfs specification
1 point 0 and working on one point one
now we implement transactional and
locking we have a fully certified WMS
and I'll get into what that means in a
bit installers documentation email
support but also commercial companies
starting around it connect to pretty
much all the popular spatial databases
performance you know work with gigabytes
of data but the thing we're really most
part of about the current success is
this community there's really the sort
of successful open source ecology one of
the things we did early on was choose to
build off geo tools and you know there
were other open source projects there
were similar tires that sort of built
their own tool kit but we really felt
that you know working with the wider
community would pay off and kind of like
some of that community would rub off and
geo tools was started by James McGill is
actually working at Google now and he
always sort of you know he was the
founder but never wanted to be you know
the benevolent dictator he wanted you
know a real community around it and we
initially did sort of a lot more
contributions than we got out of it we
really you know it wasn't super far
along and it seemed kind of like well
why are we putting all this effort into
open source you know projects other than
ours but in recent years has paid off
incredibly we only wrote one data access
format all the rest have come from geo
tools and it's this sort of wider
community and people know that you know
since we're out of that that you know
there's a real open community as opposed
to just you know open source and license
only and we know of contributors from
companies universities government
agencies there's blue sewer technologies
in Africa where fractions in Canada
social change online in australia geo
solutions in italy Axios in spain
academics from leeds in penn state have
contributed massachusetts GIS has done
some great contributions of late and the
u.s. Forest Service as well and we
recently formed a project steering
committee and this is kind of you know a
great sign for us that you know there is
you know individuals from seven
different organizations all you know
taking collective action and that it's
no longer top sort of dictating you know
this is where the project needs to go
but it's you know in
the hands of the community and recently
we've got a nice sort of modular plug-in
architecture that makes it easier for
people to build on top of it I mean this
is eclipse and Firefox and all the
successful open source projects have
this architecture and you know we've
kind of evolved to that as well and you
can build commercial services on top of
geoserver too so as for the future the
future is really in the hands of the
community and from the community we're
seeing WCS which is another
specification that lets you get at the
raw data of a raster as opposed to
vector imagery which the wfs does and
putting raster suborn WMS you can read
geo tiffin netcdf and you know jpeg 2000
all those formats in another group is
working on complex features be able to
have sort of nested elements and these
kinds of you know more complex
geographical notions that people are
wanting to represent and to connect that
to a back-end database and do
complicated joins the community is
really pushing this open platform and
you know we want to build new innovative
services on top of that and really it's
an open community I encourage people to
join us and help build it as Google has
done and as a strong member of the
community we're still you know the open
planning project is still going to push
our motivations we want to make
geospatial information more accessible
and the thing more really looking on is
this sort of user contribution
participation in maintenance and
creation of geospatial data the sort of
CBS for the geospatial web if you 0
which I'll talk on a bit later and we're
going to continue to do kind of more of
the dirty work and you know put releases
out and work with new formats and just
the stuff that's not as flashy because
you know how open source funding
generally works we have you know can
keep pushing that and we want to work on
this bigger picture of a true open
geospatial web you know we want to get
to the situation where citizens demand
open geo data and I think Google Earth
is really making strides in this but you
know governments you know had in the
past wanted to share documents and you
know citizens might have wanted them
open but the world wide web came along
and people you know demanded you know
you need to have govern
met online we want to see the same thing
for geospatial data where you know
there's such obvious value to everyone
that they start you know demanding it
from the government's that you need to
get on this you need to you know have
your layers accessible on Google Earth I
need to see the zoning information this
transport information download it to my
client on the sort of open geospatial
web so that's the basics of geoserver a
couple words about open standards before
we get to sort of what we did with
geoserver and Google Earth so why open
standards the big word is sort of
interoperability you know someone else
can write a different server yet the
same client can talk to both servers
different clients can will talk to you
know my server so that you really have
this broader ecology of people who you
know work with one another and it really
Spurs innovation too because you can you
know build them in different ways and a
big thing is sort of lowering the
barrier to entry level in this
plainfield ESRI you know they sort of
used to dominate the server market and
they didn't follow up in standards and
there was this sort of you know you
could search geospatial stuff but only
on their network and only if you bought
their product whereas you know with open
standards you know you can get open
source software you can commercial
software and it's easier to jump in and
really this sort of idea of building
something bigger than any organization
can alone in Louie days of the internet
there was this danger of going to this
sort of Netscape web and Microsoft web
you know they both had browsers if they
also have their own servers and you know
they started adding a bunch of different
extensions on to them and this would
have led to this world where you had to
pick you know do I want to be on this
Microsoft web or do I want to be on the
Netscape web and the thing is that would
have limited this overall value of a
true web where anyone can get on and you
know put a whole bunch of information on
because you know they would have had to
buy a server the thing that really
prevented that was the Apache server and
you know it had this lowest common
denominator implementation of standards
and help build something far more
valuable than a Microsoft web or
netscape web and that's a lot of what
we're looking to do with geoserver sort
of an Apache for the geospatial web if
you will
so the open geospatial consortium is the
main standards body in web-based GIS
overall they do good work I definitely
have some issues with them sometimes
sometimes they're a bit in need of
reality check and I think you know
commercially oriented organizations can
start to give that to them and they're
starting to sort of wake up as you know
how Google within kml blowing through
there you know gml specification they're
starting to realize oh we need to
actually support users as opposed to you
know just governments but there are some
great standards there WMS is the most
successful one I'll get into that wfs is
you know this sort of source code and
then sldn filter there's also GML which
is an xml language geographic features
that's pretty compatible with KML but
it's just focused on the actual
geometries where's Kay ml's this sort of
whole packet of you know styling and
view and sort of 3d information and
there's also wfs transactional that
allows user collaboration and geospatial
information so next I'm talking about
geoserver and Google Earth so we've done
work recently to be able to interoperate
with Google Earth I'm going to get into
some of those implementation details of
how we went for it but first a bit on
the motivations from the google site as
i understand it it's to provide a way to
link sort of existing databases of
geospatial information directly to
google earth there's you know of course
the fusion server that you know
replicates and has this highly scalable
stuff but lots of times an organization
you know once connected to their
database where they're constantly doing
updates and just push that out as onto
google earth and there's this great KML
format that lets you do that so instead
of you know and of course there's KML as
a format and it's great for these
smaller datasets you know pass around a
file but it doesn't so much scale to you
know the size of most geospatial
database gigabytes and terabytes in size
then there's also I mean Google thought
of this and came up the sort of network
links which are this you know very
powerful construct but they leave a very
heavy burden on the implementer you know
it kind of says you know return KML
based on this bounding box
and a good solution this is an open
source project in general have those
people who want to serve their data as
kml collaborate on you know a shared
code base and Google is smart that they
sort of found geoserver as we already
did you know the reading of data formats
the putting into it a common you know
feature programming API and then just
needs to translate that into the kml
output and from the geoserver
perspective we wanted to give our use
another option to visualize their data
you know we want to have it be
accessible as many different formats as
possible and Google is great for making
it accessible to you know less technical
Nnanji is people who can you know
visualize these layers that these
organizations may already have but you
know only the GIS specialist kind of
know about so the use case is behind
this you know it's definitely not for
everyone but youth for a lot of these
edge cases this primary use case is an
organization that already has a whole
bunch of spatial data they have their
existing servers they've invested in ark
st they've invested in Oracle spatial
and they already have the workflows in
space and they just want to expose that
onto Google Earth you know both
internally and externally as well so
they can just sort of stick geoserver as
this middle layer you know it translates
from their format into the kml there's
also you know transaction capabilities
that are quite nice you know collaborate
on a shared resource last time I was out
here and talked a bit with guys from
Nature Conservancy and they really
wanted this you know global you know
Conservancy database of protected areas
but they're not going to be the ones to
fill it out themselves they kind of want
to open it up and you know with a KML
file you can definitely pass around
update it but as soon as you have more
than a couple users you know working on
that you know that's the whole reason
that there's you know version control
for software for source code you know
you want to put it in a central place
take it in and out so it really sort of
allows this collaboration on a shared
resource and then a continually output
that as Google Earth there's also this
sld specification that really puts the
sort of styling in the hands of the user
the server can sit there and exist
you know you can actually change how
it's going to render it and emphasize a
different aspect of the of the data set
so you know the initial map may be
colored in red that emphasizes some
certain aspect and you may you know
color different sets and as a client you
can actually send that to the server and
get that back on your google earth
without sort of having to set up your
own server and then we want to enable
access to raw data one conservative zoom
through google earth and then you might
want to download a shapefile of the area
and you can do that with geoserver and
output as different formats and then
also connecting to remote wfs is and
then use geoserver as your sort of
middleware to style from this open data
into kml so this is a bit of an
implication overview that I'm going to
get to but the general sort of approach
is leverage open standards and existing
code as much as possible so the root
specification behind this is the web map
service and this is a sort of restful
you know online API for a quest to get a
map you know an image from a server the
first request is get capabilities which
is you know tell me what you have on the
server you know what layers are there
what styles are they available in what
projections are they available and you
know what do you have server and then
after the client gets that then he can
request a map and you should have put in
a URL and then there's a bunch of a
couple basic parameters the request is a
get map the layers you know you can
request just one layer you can require
have the server you know compose a bunch
of different layers and send it back the
styles you know what's this map going to
look like there's different options on
the server the spatial projection you
know what coordinate system do I want to
see this in the height and the width and
the format you want to see it in and the
bounding box of the area you're looking
at so the great thing about WMS it's
really compatible with a bunch of
different software it's supported
natively by a bunch of different
projects but it's also compatible with
other services and we've had some good
success and others online have
on Google Maps API version 2 it allows
this sort of custom tile layers and
people soon sort of connecting that
directly to WMS servers so they already
had their existing service and it sort
of worked with a few tweaks to the API
and we've been supporting that in
geoserver for a while you can there's a
JavaScript library that will hook you up
with google maps quite quickly and the
other thing you can do is WMS is a
dynamic protocol but the cool thing is
you can stick something like squid to do
all your cash in for you in front of a
sort of tiling client and you'll get a
lot of the benefits of you know the nice
styling idea that Google Maps came up
with and made popular the other thing
you saw with Google Earth was the sort
of KML WMS reflectors they were among
the first sort of network links to come
out that really linked to some valuable
data because these servers were already
out there and all they needed to do is
take that be box request of the network
link append it to the rest of the WMS
request and then wrap it in a ground
overlay which google earth could then
render so it's just you know a couple
lines of code to connect from WMS to
Google Earth and WMS allows a lot of
different output formats so there's PNG
gif SVG PDF flash that's supposed to be
so why not KML kmz why not make an
output format directly well that's
exactly what the approach we took this
is great because there's no sort of
additional configuration for geoserver
users we can utilize the same
connections and configurations they've
already done and no links can connect
directly to a WMS they just request KML
or kmz as the output format and if you
want sort of an active you know region
based network link you can just leave
off that bounding box parameter and
Google Earth will send the sort of
refreshes as you said it and add the
bounding box in and continue to get you
know more and more data as you zoom
around and from our development
perspective you know we just had to
write a new output format we didn't have
to rewrite the whole connection stack to
support KML and kmz network links
another implementation thing we did was
a KML reflector to make the WMS even
more accessible you know so you don't
have to you know as you can see up there
this ladder is you know traditional WMS
request of all these sort of variables
but from a user perspective you know
they know the layer they want and that
might be about it and in Google Earth
you know your spatial reference system
is set you know your height and width
can be set you can you know I'll have
defaults for all these variables that
can go straight to Google Earth so what
we did was you know if you put in that
the kamo reflector it'll fill out the
rest of the WS variables for you but you
can also customize those variables as
you like and the reflector understand it
the other thing we do is divide up
layers into net each of their own sort
of network links so if you request three
or four different layers you'll be able
to get each one in Google Earth and turn
it on and off and we do nice things like
set the default reloading for the camera
we set it to three seconds after it
stops and another refresh and we also
return the correct mime type so that you
can just type this into your browser and
it will fire Google Earth up and just go
another thing we did was chose to use
sld for styling now sld is a pretty
school cool specification it's stands
for styled layer descriptor it's a no GC
standard for styling mapping data you
can think of this sort of CSS or
geospatial information it's a
vendor-independent sort of style sheet
that works against geospatial data and
it's very quite powerful and combined
with KML output because you define it
based on sort of rules for your data set
as opposed to having to set you know
each at each attribute you know with
each feature to style in a certain way
you can just say you know color these
things this way these things that way
and we're already using it natively in
geoserver so the data is already defined
with sld and it's just sort of allows us
to use those same configuration stuff
you can figure the styling once you can
view it on google or viewed on your
desktop GIS view it on a 2d map as a PDF
etc so this is a basic sld use a laser
pointer although it's you know a bit
more complex but basically what this
says is you know style this green more
of the sort of XML is used when you get
these bigger requests but you know this
is basically X
that just says you know this is the rule
do this advanced sld gets into a bunch
of different rules you know so you
compose you know your sort of style
sheet of you know do this for this do
this for this you can base your rules on
filters which are sort of sequel where
statements if you will against the data
set that says you know limit to these
features limit to these features you
know and you can also do minimum maximum
scales to limit the number of features
you know at this zoom level portray
these at this zoom Homer betray them
like this at this zoom level portray
them like that so you can do stuff like
sort of color all streams blue you could
also say you know use a road type
attribute and say color major highways
orange minor highways yellow you know
and normal streets white with black
outlines and then you can based on the
zoom levels as well you know at this
zoom level drama 3 pixels zoomed in more
with seven zoomed in more with 13 and
this really lets you do sort of thematic
maps and color you know base your colors
on sort of quantiles and statistical
analysis and really sort of you know do
a bunch of different you know divide
this attribute latest attribute take the
cosine of it you know and color those
blue if the cosines less than six that
does make sense but you you know it
really has a whole bunch of power to you
know set a bunch of rules to portray
things as you will and then you can also
do user-defined sld and i think this is
one of the cool coolest aspects where
the sort of administrator is not the one
that has the final say on what your maps
going to look like you know they may say
you know there's these four default
styles but a user can also define their
own sld file past that to the server and
the server is going to render it back to
them as they want to view it so this
really sort of opens up you know
visualization possibilities for clients
for people just using it and there's two
ways to do this you can either include
the sort of XML directly in your WMS
request or you can point the sld file or
remote location so with geoserver and
Google Earth you can sort of define your
style as you want pass that to geoserver
request the kml output and you'll get
your whole map you know rendered as you
want to see it
and have the kml output that so other
things we did were an sld wizard this is
sort of very basic the point was to
replicate google earth pros shape file
import functionality just kind of picked
the line and pick the color you want to
see it previously you had to actually
edit your sld XML files by hand but this
you know you just click on a few things
and you're good we made it based on ajax
so it's it's own utility independent of
the geo server web insist on use
standard I put style operations so the
goal of this is to you know eventually
maybe make it its own thing where it can
customize other WMS servers and you know
work on top of other clients you know
you could have a preview window in that
Ajax on top of google maps of you know
styling or WMS on that nice base map and
then sort of upload it to geoserver and
you're good to go and we hope to expand
that functionality to min max scale and
filter and get at this whole you know
complexity behind sld but really make it
easy from the user perspective the other
thing we did was a cam score parameter
and this is basically you know sometimes
it's more efficient to process the data
on the server then and send an image
back as opposed to you know dumping all
this XML so what we do with the cam
score is basically it says you know the
user can say over you know a certain
number of features don't send me back
the information and could you know it
may you know be too tough for google or
surrender so we have the server make a
2d sort of ground overlay as opposed to
passing that full KML the server renders
that image and puts it back it uses the
same sort of WMS code wraps it in I mean
it's similar to the kamo reflector but
it's you know sort of natively done as
the output format and sort of KML 2.1
regions are another solution to this you
know they can help with these massive
amounts of data on the server but at the
time we were working on it you know that
we it wasn't released yet and indeed
this is sort of very compatible with KML
2.1 regions as well you know sometimes
you know the region still may be too big
and you want to sort of render a flat
image to the km score
is quite compatible with that and then
just a bit about the KML writer we
leverage our sort of GML writer because
the the two are very similar for
geometry is than we used our existing
sort of rendering code for 2d
applications and did it KML a cool side
effect of this was that we streamed
directly from the database to the output
stream if you have a 2d image you have
to load it all into memory before you
send it up the client but with XML you
can just sort of stream it directly and
it's based on geo tools which you know
is a great tool kit and that it's sort
of on the fly transfers from the
database to your output format so we
actually get very low up memory overhead
when outputting KML cuz it's this nice
XML format as for the future we're
looking into 2.5 dimensions stuff allow
users to find an attribute to be used as
the altitude of a feature so you could
you know have you know building heights
be you know actually rendered into kml
and I've got a screenshot of sort of a
prototype of that and you could also
combine those with a filter and do sort
of interesting statistical analysis and
visualization you know have crime be the
height attribute of different states or
different counties and you know it's
this nice compelling sort of 3d
visualization environment and we can use
all the sort of filters and functions to
do that we're definitely looking to do
KML 2.1 regions and super or fillets you
know use that min max from sld and stick
that into the KML and really get that
nice stream in effect and make it you
know much easier for people to you know
they just stick in their data set and
geoserver will do all the work of making
this you know nice streaming thing for
them we want to expand that Saudi Ajax
editor and another thing we're looking
at is this native cash and once we get
into this big tiling stuff you know WMS
is a dynamic protocol but what you can
do if you've divided the world up into
tiles as you can start to cash them so
as clients request that same area you're
returning it and we've had good success
with squid which is an open sort of sort
of HTTP caching solution but it'd be
really nice to have a sort of pure Java
solution there as well that you know we
can just distribute a plug-in and not
make people install a bunch of different
software and again sort of what what you
might think of we're an open source and
open community and you can definitely
join and become a part of it this is the
2.5 d sort of prototype with the you
know this is a building layer and we're
just using that sort of height attribute
to render so the last topic is
geospatial our architectures of
participation this is a topic that's
really sort of close to my heart and you
know what i like to think about these
days an architecture of participation is
this term i use for the sort of open
source process it was coined by tim
o'reilly initially to sort of describe
you know how open source works but he
recently has used it much more in the
sort of passive way of you know Napster
you know people put their files on and
they're automatically shared which is
you know great for this sort of business
focus of how you can you know leverage
these architecture of participation but
money interest is still this sort of
active participation of you know users
who want to contribute interactively
building stuff together it has strong
roots and ben coolers kosas penguin he
talks of Commons based pure production
and I basically take an architecture of
participation to be that thing that he
is talking about the results from this
peer production whoever also hits on
these ideas so my definition is that
sort of an architecture of participation
is social and technical it leverages the
skills and energies of users as much as
possible to cooperate in building
something bigger than they can alone the
prerequisite to all this is that it
needs to be open you know it needs to be
guaranteed to be available to everyone
in the future in software this is
complet the licensing the sort of
open-source licenses and you know within
this architecture motivation the chance
of our highest for success if you're you
know working on something useful or
that's going to be useful soon if you
view your users your co-developers you
know give them responsibility and
they'll meet that you know don't you oh
I'm giving this to the world
but you know let people participate and
lowering the barriers to contributing
you know first time contributors aren't
going to come back if it's just a huge
hassle to contribute to the core so the
geospatial web fortunately I had to cut
this to get the talk down to time maybe
we can talk about it a bit after but I
see the sort of a world wide web for
geospatial information world wide web is
really a great example of an
architecture of participation you know a
bunch of people collaborate you know
rfcs establishing the protocols and then
users start to put more and more content
on it becomes you know this great
amazing thing that you can then build
you know other webs on top of and I see
geospatial web has sort of being built
on top of this route wed its contrast to
spatial data infrastructure 'he's
approach which i never heard of before i
went to zambia but then learn that it's
this whole sub academic field that is
working for about 10 or 15 years on you
know you know government agencies have
data how do they share it with other
people you know and they have these that
you know expansive catalogs where
everyone feels out metadata and then
they can search it and for me that's
just not the way to work it needs to be
bottom up and really google has kind of
drastically changed the landscape in
this sort of sub SDI field because
they've shown the value you know there
are is much more data available on
Google Earth as mash sort of these
mashups on maps and KML files then has
been and you know ten years of
governments you know being like telling
all their agencies they need to put
their data online it needs to get on
there so it's really you know this much
more bottom up show the value and then
you know as I was saying before citizens
will start to demand even more valuable
geospatial information so that's the
sort of geospatial web the thing I'm
going to talk about a bit more is
architecture to participation for the
actual geospatial data the goal is to
sort of create a movement similar to the
open source software movement but around
geospatial data you could have users
correct the base data set you know your
streets or your parks but also
collaborate on new data sets of value
Wi-Fi spot scenic views you know bike
trails and this topic is really where
we're putting a lot of our energy as I
saying as we start to you know reinvest
as we grow successful we want to put a
lot of energy into this it's still very
minor I mean it is heart starting to
happen in many ways it's like these sort
of early days of the free software
movement you have hobbyist you know
running around through GPS is you have
sort of hardcore freedom people my goal
is really to have this evolved into you
know making economic sense for a large
organization where you know you have
largely addition on Eclipse and Linux
and IBM you know at some point it makes
sense for them to put energy into linux
make it good enough for them as opposed
to continue to buy you know proprietary
software I'd like to see that for
geospatial data I mean there's just a
few you know large vendors of geo data
and if you know all these people using
it sort of break that monopoly or
oligarchy then they can sort of
collaborate on that base data but it
needs you know a lot of thought and sort
of research before we get to that point
this sort of prerequisite is as of a
center that needs to be Commons based it
needs to be guaranteed to remain open
and for this and geospatial I think we
really need this sort of clear set of
licenses I mean we have people
definitely putting stuff online but
they're just not sure of the terms I
think that you know if there were clear
licenses that were you know very well
marketed people would start using them
more and applying to another geospatial
data Creative Commons is a great example
of this the Hat really has their name
out there and they could potentially be
you know a good ally in this and
bootstrap onto their marketing effort
also I mean they may need to be
customized for geo data I mean if you
have a sort of share alike license does
that mean if I add other layers that
they infect you know those layers from
my base layer or you know is it just the
data of one layer you know is the cut is
the data copyright is the produce map
copyright as it styles or data I mean
there's just a lot of sort of confusion
that people don't feel confident about
you know putting a Creative Commons
license or you know what kind of license
they apply to their data to make it an
open access type thing and I think it
needs to be used as defaults and
creation tools and geoserver and KML
creation tools you know what license
would you like to use as opposed to just
putting out there and no one being sure
and then there's sort of two sides to
this the social and the technical on the
social side of really think these sort
of we need innovations in these
workflows we have two strong models to
draw on there's Wikipedia in their
screen open source software
openstreetmap is a project doing speech
geospatial information sort of on this
Wikipedia model anyone can commit and
they sort of rely on rollbacks but you
know on the other of the spectrum you
have free and open source software and
you know people think of as this you
know very collaborative thing but you
know I'm not going to give commit rights
to my projects to practically anyone you
know I want people who are going to be
good because if they you know aren't
that good they're going to break the
build and it's got not going to work for
anyone you know so there's this you know
control within free and open source
software that allows it to be open and I
think for maps we're probably going to
end up somewhere in between Foss and
Wikipedia that sort of let it anyone
edit a map might be a bit much you know
so some people might need rights another
thing that I think can make a lot of
strides is automatic rejection of
features you know you can set a bunch of
rules and we actually have a sort of
validation engine in geoserver that lets
you you know set these defined rules so
that if someone you know scrolls their
name in you know streets across the u.s.
like it automatically say no that
doesn't work you know roads shouldn't be
you know Chris homes in California also
could build in you know peer review
process and you know commit rights to
just a certain area of the map and I
think another sort of point you know how
it's going to be different than we
competed in more like open source
software is we're not going to have this
sort of one Atlas to rule them all that
has this one way of working you're going
to have a bunch of different you know
projects that might you know some might
work with some social models of an
evident hitter some might be you know
more democratic base some may actually
work in a Wikipedia model and let people
in but it's going to be different for
different datasets I mean you're not
going to you're not going to want your
emergency response you know precise maps
to be you know contributed by anyone and
sort of vandalize and you want workflows
and process through that but for
something like you know bike
rails you know you're not no one's going
to die well hopefully not and then
another thing I think we need is sort of
incentives you know why are people going
to contribute you know maybe a dual
licensing model maybe sort of some
people choose to buy it outright others
agree to contribute a certain amount to
get access to the data but you know
that's definitely sort of an open
question on the technical side I mean I
still come back to open stands on this
but you know use this wfs transact no
it's already a standard to edit a
back-end data space you can use existing
clients and their strengths and the sort
of diversity and then you can extend on
the standards for rollbacks
notifications limit commit access etc
and another thing that I think is need
is this notion of a patch file an open
source software you know the dictator
you know will review patches and decide
what to commit you could perhaps use W
fence transaction XML there's also the
KML sort of update tag which is
currently kind of tacked on in front but
if you could actually send that to the
server and you know have that you know
maintain or apply that update to the
core data set then it can be available
for all and I think we need to sort of
allow pluggable workflows I mean let you
pick how you want your stuff to you know
work in wfs transactional do you want
automatic validation do you want peer
review do you want hierarchically
limited commit access or make it open to
anyone sandboxes rollback link to issue
trackers and really sort of open the
door for the social to innovate on top
of the technical and then finally you
know you're going to need something
that's not these like full board GIS
systems that are sort of very
intimidating to people we want these
sort of scale down systems there's you
dig that already has wfs transactional
can make you know simplify it for just
gps have google earth sort of work
against this sort of collaboration
platform you know connect to the server
and update instead of you know when you
click you know at a point it goes to a
common space and maybe you could send
that sort of KML update file through wfs
transactional and then Ajax applications
built on top of Google Maps submitted
edit points a couple ideas on how to
encourage
a big one would be to make available
high-quality sort of based satellite
data under the sort of share like terms
the guarantee that you know it's going
to remain open you could also I mean you
probably need to hold that copyright a
neutral organization you see this with
sort of all open source projects in the
recent open source geospatial foundation
a lot of the impetus behind it was
autodesk wanted to open source something
but you know people aren't going to
trust autodesk but they will trust in a
more neutral foundation and you see this
with Wikimedia as well people like to
know that you know it's going to remain
open this is an entity that is
guaranteeing it to remain open you can
start with public data like tiger or V
map build applications on top you know
integrate with other stuff and but allow
this sort of you know malleability have
them exposed this button that has fixed
me and takes them to the you know editor
that lets them change it as they like
integrate with handheld GPS devices and
the last idea the next slide is sort of
a hosted service of geo data Commons
this was originally a paper by holler
and on thread where he described you
know this online system where people
could upload a shapefile you know an
academic who you know was studying bird
migratory patterns and you know just
wanted to make it available so some
person the future could also look at
those patterns and just at you know make
a few metadata calls but in a sort of
natural human language way of oh when
did you gather this what stuff is there
but in his mind it was kind of like Oh
justice for positive where I could then
download that data I'd like to extend
that to sort of a web services
environment you know anyone uploads
their data pics that license but give
people a compelling reason to upload it
I mean if I you know why should I just
put my shapefile that no one's really
going to use but if I can upload my
shape file and then suddenly have it
available on Google Earth and show it to
my mom you know I'm much more
incentivized to you know upload that
shape file and then you could add user
contributions to this you know wfs
transactional let people decide the sort
of commits rights are they going to
accept patch files are they going to you
know let anyone edit it make their
workflows and you know then it sort of
becomes this sourceforge for the
geospatial web
this you know collaborative open
projects on hosted environments and this
could really sort of amine be a boon for
lots of work you know then Africa saw a
bunch of eight organizations and they
come in and do these you know big
expansive projects and they gather say
you know all the radio towers in Zambia
but there I mean their goal in it was to
you know figure out where to put the
next schools not to you know just gather
this base data but if there was some
easy place where they could sort of
upload that then someone else may choose
to maintain it and really get the sort
of you know flow in geospatial web so as
for the future I really see this you
know being just as the world wide web is
the sort of substrate for the geospatial
web so to this can enable these other
open collaborative webs with the open
planning project lot of our initial
interest traffic model in and allow you
know these traffic models to be shared
from New York you know to different
cities and you know they just have that
geospace do that they operate on and run
the models but then have these sort of
ways of you know figuring out and
collaborate on top of it you can do
urban planning and zoning information
and environmental modeling and you know
really things we can't dream of because
you know we're still establishing that
substrate to build interesting stuff on
top of I'd really like to see the sort
of more effective collaboration between
citizens companies and government you
know as opposed to some people
controlling it allow you know citizens
to feed back into the process and that's
a lot of what they've been planning
projects getting at is you know have
citizens play an active role in this
society and help fix you know that core
mapping data and make you know the
things of value for everyone I'd also
like to see this you know search and
find geospatial datasets you know
overlay and analyze them and even
contribute back you know I want to be
able to search for Chicago crime maps
and put that on top of you know Chicago
craigslist and view that myself and turn
that into my own mashup that you really
have this web of information as opposed
to just one-off applications and you
know search and find and the open
planning project you know we're building
geoserver to help make this future
possible and we definitely encourage any
and all to join us thank you
wst video server side geoserver does
client side oh the question is is there
a WF st implementation i'm not sure if
he's asking client or server side but
all yeah well I mean it's their
independent of one another so geo sort
of implements its server side already
there's you dig which is a desktop GIS
there's Matt builder that does wfs
transactional in a sort of Ajax
environment there's commercial there's
plugins on top of arcgis the do wfs
transactional yeah there's a couple
other desktop programs openlayers is
another open source one that is looking
to do web mapping type thing so yeah I
definitely exist in those environments
is kind of a way and begin to assemble
this data so I've learned just like it
this is more of a web services approach
and you just incline in a way the
in line the data sources so that if you
were to go into a scene you would really
only need me in the scene description to
have links and not necessarily hopefully
as the data and then use cash and things
like that to provide
you're talking about Barry Sanders so if
I have a date is that if I can just post
it on my own server and not really copy
it out there and have to worry about
publishing and distributing and things
like that really just keep it locally on
my server provide a link then maybe
that's a way to and it filled that or
yeah so the question is like you ain't
mine in you know whatever win by
headline and low in line sorry yes yeah
and you don't actually have to have to
host it yourself and then you can have
more of the web services oriented fruit
yeah so the question is you know you
have this inline image thing on the web
that allows you to not host your own web
server just call a different image and
put it on there and it's an answer is
yes I mean that's how it's working that
you just you know reference a server I
mean that's sort of how the W mass spec
works is that you're not going to host
that data yourself you're just going to
have a lightweight client I mean at this
point it needs to be a sort of Ajax
client to make those calls you know we
don't yet have that language for in
browsers to say like Oh WMS here but
yeah I mean I think that's definitely
the direction to go I mean and from a
you know rich client perspective on
Google Earth yeah you just put in that
link you're not hosting that you know
inmate cash a bit but yeah
yeah we have we got a nice bump in
downloads we were about 4,000 a month
and it's closing in on seven or eight
thousand a month so yeah there seems to
be more interest and did some sort of
press release so I mean I think and have
had questions on the user list about
implementing it so it is a sort of nice
option that people have have you started
dating work on the two ones don't get
the question is have we started any work
on the 21 stuff um I've done a few
little design documents haven't started
implementing there's a couple of things
we were still working on really
tightening up the 2 point 0 stuff I mean
as with any any project you put it out
there and then people find you know
little fixes so we're kind of still
wrapping up that and make it in that
support very solid but yeah I mean
there's ideas of how to do sort of more
trivial implementations of it of just
you know do a bunch of WMS links but you
know also thinking about these you know
better caching and better approaches
that use sld and whatnot so
but there will be emailed yeah yeah
there should be emails yeah i'll also
yeah i'll try to put a links to other
stuff i've referenced in here as well my
blog is see homes wordpress com and I'll
at least put a few links up on there and
link to the talk and link to the slides
and whatnot see homes dot WordPress you
know where for us wordpress com it's
just a hosted blog environment anyone
