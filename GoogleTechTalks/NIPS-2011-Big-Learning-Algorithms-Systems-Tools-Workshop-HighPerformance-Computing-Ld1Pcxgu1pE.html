the talk to be a microphone school today
use machine learning in vice versa but
supposed to be adopted you mean tomorrow
meanwhile I will be better suited for
this I want to talk more about some sort
of synergy between machine learning and
high pollution so let's get started so
we will talk about high performance
computing aware i wish in learning and
whatever you bring to the table
otherwise has been very useful to us
then we'll move another diversion only a
computer for me the white evo i will get
back to trying to convince you guys to
kind of like converge so we work with
high-performance computing going to your
privacy it's possible to have some
machine learning awareness behind
computer help having some machine
learning techniques to have packet so
let's get started with each piece to
wear so let me present you like what i'm
working on so i'm interested in the
problem of visual object while you may
wonder if you probably all know that the
problem that's all people including my
mom in subsequent asthma simple to
implement i actually went to pull the
field at i'll talk i will be actually
pretty easy to solve it in summer that's
actually nice too
so what about people in this furniture
so that's that humans have really fast
organized PT objects very highly afraid
I thought that's much to think about you
just start like something a variegated
mathematical problem just open your eyes
amis it's critical to survival from the
selection for the injury by going to
install CD it's very very important
usually what makes the community hub is
the title you have to tolerate a lot of
image relation skill acquisition
elimination ok so why is it half an
unconditional point first of all the
world is two-dimensional but once the
image it's your retina actually to the
original production so you will never
heal post and cognition poem once the
image gets the retina your activity in
the order of a million the only answer
so the dimensionality of the boarding is
extremely high and again you have to let
you know responsible image relation
handle the fact that it's so easy for
you it's because basically there is a
very last faction of your brain a very
affectionate one of the most next in
purse that is dedicated to learn
Archie's driven by visual process so
that's why it's so it falls evolutionary
we are so dismal the reason why you
might receive Alex because a lot of em
Harper's communicators actually I want
people think that you have learned to
see like there is some pots are sedated
some automatic it actually learn
throughout the development and you two
were you will actually put into square
in a simple but I actually would go to
me who you want horny so Megan also you
know that you are interested in reverse
and following
great we think is a pretty interesting
idea to do that in the same hat so it is
just some people studying biology I mean
lucky holding that the engineering that
might be some synergy that that would
happen if like the same groups of people
wolf so interested in reversing during
the national system should because
that's kind of an association of the
working system so we want to study how
the pressure system works the charger
for me initial hypothesis you learn them
in natural systems rheological not take
photos large-scale in positional system
that I see it work and what we hope is
that there will be some really nice
actually so what we see when we reverse
attorney right all we see is that once
the image is right now that it goes to
like part of the number rather than how
he actually motivates all that LG n
which is not a topical yet but then hits
the the primary visual area which is V 1
then B to D 419 or join the forum is
physically so and the way people think
about it is deafening about this
transformation as being this kind of
canonical module of this tournament of
the truth that's being applied again
again exactly the same function the only
thing that changes being within the
output of that object and we are really
open up the case because engineering why
that would be much easier for most
tender going that way people think a
complex subject of exams and change your
forum or interesting the this
computational fact about reversal in the
brain some estimates about the
competition or kappa b to the brain is
around 20 paragraphs that's a lot of
compute power in your brain if you think
that out of it is dedicated to vision
then it's like 10 setup loves to be home
to do believe so that's a very very
large number if you want to solve your
basketball you need to think about
that uh so when we work on organ during
this context we thought it was all about
money and all of the computational power
was to actually extract statistically
right these from from this special
Terfel data and hitting your retina I
really thought it was all about this
kind of like supervised learning how do
you how do you turn this snappy way we
work sure that would be the case that's
why we kind of move to like a bill GPU
machine the river so what we saw is that
it actually doesn't matter that much
what matters more this is the parameters
of the circuit detect if you have like
what be layers in the malos he doesn't
really matter if you learn or not at
least for now doesn't that we have the
right method in a given to it well what
matters most is all of this red
parameters actually there was another
little dirty like a number of filters
the number of units number of layers
kind of nonlinearities in the network
but this awesome reason matter much more
than bringing Iran and that's what we
saw very early on and I thought we have
to move kind of like to change our
schedule where it's more on the on the
hyper parameters and less on the dirty
so usually just are all of this thing's
on how does it work usually the usual
formula i do take one grad students you
will play with them all is unity by
runtime and the library this lab you
test fit and intro to get remove some
nice results from a benchmark and
hopefully give you published at all
unlike paper where you get a few and the
form of this is your physique ET needs
to go out by the size of the mall and
since there are parameters you want to
be able to speak therein 20 times kind
of like all people call that actually
graduates from deserve this idea of
having that this model and actress
private saloon will click it by the sea
he works on on one measure and another
one and a kind of
one of mine was saying that know what
would be better than this and you
actually take two ballet students
together and do some concrete
resistances this sounds together it
works some you have multiple people kind
of tweaking of a metered and we can
already a factor but that would be nice
if we could sound of automate that and
have machines do this fella so we're
trying to so let's do it a little bit
differently you take the test time grad
student i'm going to try towns and
thousands of deep models rather just
like kitchen sink it's mostly because
when i started this father has didn't
know anything about it i don't know what
was right what was wrong people are very
open idiot about what works and what
doesn't work I just wanted to learn for
myself it was easier to just 00 p eople
get from papers out and so um I'm a
really big fan of me falling for nobel
prize winner and eq hash him and some of
these students and some of the people
working on it right how do you get
something with a year why are you so
good at that this scientific aim and
what saying you won't put a guilt this
the number one thing is just a ton of it
and learn how to the quick cup of
steaming up the good ones I'm throwing
away the values the problems I'm not
doing it fall into enrich bad as
throwing your waiter to do by one so I'm
more relying on computers to throw it
about how that saw brute force and
they're coming you can call it something
else we we we actually found a very nice
term biology for me that's really
beautiful was renounced about response
on this kitchen sink approach let's try
everything in what see what works and
study them that it doesn't work that
because it just don't use enough you
just need to put more more emissions on
the problem and mobile for at some point
something oh boo you offer matter I
think therapy we come pretty this brute
force approach that they have in my own
here we try to build a very lush famille
by model between five we try to be the
ring because if I have some of the
secret sauce of some groups hope the
public space of our of all these
potential Commission subscribe the part
is here like some parameters the 3d
models from on the data it's important
thousands of the mall and we still one
at a time who have the brain Melvin
brings a diner with no of the shelf we
love engineering let science actually
goes to know sire so we kind of resolve
offer you the absolute in those time and
a lot of engineering so taking on the
Albert software demonstration try to do
some fires at me and to do this we try
to capitalize on auto markets that are
investing a lot song like buildings are
really compositional heavy machine and
we try to capitalize on to market web to
the o computing amazon row and gaining
gaming our where so you have this like
maximum amount of OMG that is extent on
trying to make this graphics card game
consoles go extreme impacts just to be
able to play crysis like we quickly as
biomass today so if you can capitalize
on that and take this computational
power and put it on my kitchen sink
approach that would be nice because in
there will be moved very quickly graphic
card also kind of nice because I'm
interested in vision and wrap it up
cause you to be awkward and interesting
inverting the process for this is a
nasty turn around so we built a lot of
hardware that kind of fun detonated
circumstance out our scanners
interesting so we've been playing with
with the 2,000 texts at the time he was
kind of complicated yet to use like
graphics pretty and then we would
question 3 and move back
you double the speed we were up over the
techniques of animations are there on
yes quite fast so here I'm kind of a
very unfair comparison I'm comparing
against like my fabric reproduce if you
try to implement this mobile room at
that still using like BFF either much
light pollution or tab what kind of
performance you'll get in terms of media
plus and at the time we thought was like
around that point we care for so one
tomoko a very very close if you do the
job of like coding me for the CPU will
you be well enough for ten gigaflops but
as soon as you get into the GTU of
playstation 3 you can make all those of
my youth pastor you don't do the same
type of science with this victory you
don't do again no Google Earth I at all
and a thousand times PDF is game
changing so you can lead to feel like a
nice in a grad student and it has very
stupid questions because we get your
answer right away so you your feet and
report actually do not think and near
the computer scientist I like that
instead of the picture of you my work
and if I get some good results they
actually tend to be less biased because
you try to be more do I to put three um
so we get brute force search so since
it's going so fast we can just draw away
laughing at the problem and when we do
is that we take tons of different models
different ideas and different the top
and test them on some real small task of
object recognition for example and here
you can see the countess histogram here
to the count of the models between
images between 2,500 and models
efficiencies of this time and you see
the performance it's kind of not read
that use if you have a stupid design
most of the models like below the 50-day
time if you do move but you see that the
fuel of optimism just pop that really
good one so the the brute boat
approaches us to take this model and try
to feel chicken if you can analyze and
go here it's snow Bruce foster on this
paper pretty em over
however while i take this putt but
without over seating on the care of the
place sweetie comments on but we can sit
on top how do we play off we've seen it
Timothy those who don't want all the
co-op render images on providing
background stars really exposed if you
go to the bottle problems the bottom
dollar dollar devaluation sky you keep
in your life but what you see what
people tell you take it tomorrow if we
do this against the state of the other
the factory for provision is where
people used to match that performance in
traffic 11 but you can feel that are
some of the nights are getting better
than this you want like designs you want
like stays on Devil's and all of the
other ones I said maybe he insisted like
one all of the top by that will not
scream let this cure that actually
getting better than this instead of
there but again you know not pretty
natural its control that still scarab
like user small test at will be tested
on patient here is very interesting on
faces most of this feature actually
pretty bad down people use other type of
future below type of modification but
still did stop by malls but some kind of
generalize to pieces there are ministers
in case against in city faces far away
from natural images you may see if ice
cream every day invitation whoever will
follow up on that we compared against
humans who are thinking in your hands
lab they forget to rate tiny we are
outputting up still on top so now we
have good models we can start analyzing
them you have so many of them we can
analyze and Percy were works what
doesn't work but we so very briefly is
that the dimensional ET matters a lot to
get a lot of filters like yeah
so now when you have been almost we can
start analyzing them just so many of
them has nice and interesting what works
what doesn't work when we saw very
reason is that even showing two matters
a lot together a lot of filters and we
have our roles and tons of them works
much better in a small boat so I always
pretty difficult when we saw I learned
that if you kiddo their own in your eyes
good as if you go with sometimes somehow
those go get errors so moving there the
/ voice there are another round is a lot
of the hyper parameters very deadly
secret so there are raising be
implemented in support the non-linearity
that very room of the most particularly
the normalization nomination was kind of
missed by all the holes and now it
integrates by other people grumpy and
see me remove an Audi boosted by
performed racemia please email
opposition which has been inspired by
the alienation have a competition
money is a very very important Tyson
suppose whatever your connections so
what are they don't miss Dorrit really
useful objects assistance they are good
for background so if you could there are
you on the data set that most mostly
over like a ground a category one that's
got you see through objects to really
make this is more than that that this is
the app for project conditional pmf oh
oh so that's it for the first first
partition server machine operator it one
more thing so some people fear we don't
mind if I will use in this game works so
they are wondering if I can actually
feel real world natural application to
this approach so we will need to test
generic instead
approach so because some be really real
horror we took place which is like
massive amount we had tons of these
people actually put it back annotate the
spaces for asking and so we could
already collaborated with external see
kind of hard for this and try to see if
it's possible to a place is very simple
random approach brute force to this /
depart why is that if you can build
walls kind of tension pieces of candy in
fearsome addition to that was not
anticipated seems that social networking
interesting or question again in the
same approach because all right with me
we do the exact same approach we took
like a screening test as I was
anticipation I was not at all attention
and we disable your supervisor knee but
she was making everything stolen home
same approach me Destin illegal face in
the world natural benchmarking face
detection and welcome to get much better
performance
the term sale but after that that's
great the ambulance lifting while still
at it today we do face would be to take
to equal social website or comet friends
to accomplish won't be able to fight and
welcome to 86 person actors what does
this mean not much but we can do however
is take the best the condition
technology out there which is like
fizzled under the tightest in best
technology around and convergence so
that's what we did with this stupid our
accelerated brute force and again mobile
provider use just a few days available
of her phone case of comp which is
highly specialized shoes for business
again the other Pushkin na matter change
10 mac is really happy about in smash
bathroom is better the hardware is very
important so how do I even learning this
girl ok let's talk about how we
go to this performance up so the brain
is its massive card 20 bit of a little
freedom hey you will prep those you pass
randomly people's problem we also learn
them to be vegetable right you want to
be able to pair off with the diameter of
the
different models are very very different
some notify I cook you look very close
game register the fiddle night almost
this is if they are must keep blacking
out three details of em so if you are
our direction we just experienced looks
like so far answer 30 pack of the forum
once you use wait up for me go some say
what one is with the right word for this
well it Apple longing is like psyche
arriving programs i work right for us do
you leave the ground programming the
computer can use the word successful and
you know processing libraries and
niharika libraries like access this
ability to you know the bra absolutely
none lfw when you use these libraries to
actually auto tune to the meta program
to generate them the best code for your
particular always so how do you do this
well when you start programming GP used
a lot of options you can have me from
blocked i'll walk sighs there are a lot
of different techniques to optimize this
is all right for you to use multiple the
idea to just implement them all as weak
as you learn and you just learn let the
computer try to find out soon or coffee
all pipe again the same approach like
random chance and we'll try a lot of
different ions and find the vector so to
do that we use return to try to see what
we do the best tool so what we use this
fight on which is kind of like a little
bit we arrived but you have a hyper
computing movies as cryptic slow
language well I tone might be slow but
to generate tons of different codes it's
actually quite fast and what really
matters is is the Seco that you generate
through Python what we use is like
template later running so we just use
some Python in some C code to be able to
interpret from template the sequel very
easy you could use C++ templating as
well this much faster much easier to
fight on tues high-level language so you
can inject some Python inside vehicles
with a program of you drama
so we use PI to that for this so that
helps us analyse do the heavy work of
like Oh piling the source code which is
in C and rolling into the GPU executive
in the conference so everything is
standard in Python as soon as it hit the
GPU of course it seemed like I think you
up close MGP binary code so only kind of
like the driver fight to the end by sir
um so busy give you with a phone system
looks like this so we have our templates
and drink in python that will kind of
get itself and fidgety program you'll
generate tons of them and talk about
let's get get those performance metrics
if I Oct can additionally our words and
Perry gets better and better performance
also it's the channel template may be
cases if you actually a random this
yellow you'll start getting any huge
fell out actually unroll the loop on you
for example if you have a four by four
Colonel this is a template miss a
program you may end up Oh ppl while you
don't let the comparison any accusation
you are the one performing this
condition if you get it when you to the
bios file if you do either a typo
coalition you know about all that is
kind of cash hi kuya so you don't have
to regenerate them the benefit of this
approach is that if you do all of
optimization it shall you slow other two
reasons all is how we're all of times it
becomes really really ugly very very
easy right you get like all of these
optimization the code is unreadable with
template metaphor mean you can actually
smooth this impacted early because it's
in Python like doing the loop unrolling
it actually look like a real loop except
in I convents and actually once you get
rendered all that it was rolling and
then you can don't care about the secret
you just care about the Python the base
you could do a false if you use the frak
mountain or from the provider they it
just happens that the compiler never
read us what you want and even if the
two operation lose the same photo for
this operation you and this one if you
use this one which is exactly turn every
phone yo gets a prize like this one
still and you see she recently this year
you'll get like thirty percent less so
never trust me your provider of hope I
of Technology in particular you want
trying to really a high-performance
computing
the off that we can do we can available
an argument this offseason really a lot
of different things that you can you can
talk more about this doesn't really
matter here but what's important that
you can have really the freedom explore
a lot Yoko so if you're interested in
implementing alone you read a paper
about nice optimization technique what's
cool is that you can implement it let it
in the cool have just a branch I will
just select this giant against the other
and you can explore how the hour works
out and software works how's the
optimization technique first and just
have really nice and compact food to you
can hand cute and try to understand java
api into this up forget as me insight
about the problem of the alga that way
and since you operating in high-level
language is kind of achieve your max
faster again night for30 the problem
that won't just so many dishes kind of
pass the buck with and you may want to
keep them into them also it's if you
cannot decide which of condition to use
it's just better to just put all in
there and again let some sort of
auto-tuning algorithms figure out what's
the best combination of all so meet the
programming enabled efficient learning
on earth of the GQ objection if you are
into this maybe this dissonance is not
that interesting learning about you but
we don't a lot about the architecture
through this technique that was not
available in the program you guys and
another day you can really exploit
entirely believe you in front it's very
very close terms of resolve your exam
but
haha this how to you this is never even
as we cannot take your bed to it right
now on the throne aware of current Uncle
Phil to translate it without overall
nice for one another okay discovery with
a program e14 dish people to Philip drag
their top you gonna just another person
can refer hi lift it like this you're
very easy to you to write a su 5 10 3
not that will help you get drastic speed
us we got like really rustic very busy
and you will practically difficult
indonesia's the topic of the next the
next section which is trying to bring
machine learning into high performance
of a so see all of these different
volumes of codes it there could be a
machine learning algorithm could find
that the best code for you in certain
search that would you realize you just
cut them all you let someone could all
the different previous organization for
you and you guys haha machine your new
really good machine learning algorithm
try to find the cause for you that would
be nice then you have nothing to do so
that's the topic of this this section
which is trying to having intelligent
and fast also tuning with machinery why
do i say fast because it could take some
time to do the to generate the best
coast but if you can have a definite
like post really fast in download you
could produce is also fast I can get
this goes very quickly then we'll be in
VT k Vanessa work the permanent always
with James so your top model has degree
that we use you should book James about
that so I really trying to bring your
session
so no two children generally they are
two approaches the first one is the
anonymity to announce it on all
available so the proof of that one is
that it's very generate so the idea is
to build an analytical model a
mathematical model of the out we're up
to the code that you wanted that you
want to optimize of input to try to a
mathematical model a pure mathematical
model so it's really really fast clean
difference you just need to derive them
all and you can get the best good for
particular aware of that student
association and moon to confirmation so
very very easily that's what all the
camaros do you have the models down
where and that's how they easy that's
how to get this cool if you see that
from three that they can detect
interview it very fast doesn't have
interested in the program is kind of how
to build this analytical model it's a
lot of manual work someone has to come
up with this analytical model and
finally you you're basically bound by
the quality of this action each you have
a lot of degrees of freedom in yard
where it could be excuse me how to do
almost compatible I thick metal net for
more and you need a very high I quality
domain to give up to and as a result
since you are bound by the college at
that mall the mall tends to be simpler
and you user your code that you just
excuse me stop from what you could
really reach that's why the compilers
don't really do what we want Institute
the type of technique is called
empirical condition empirical musician
is really really good because it's just
trying a bunch of Colonel that's the
approach of a minute of programming
where you try a bunch of variance you
think of the one that is the best let me
catch it on some time later so it's
really good because you'll get close to
the to teach that you will be won't
forget and that's what you use for these
libraries i specialized Valerie's desire
is really want the best code so that's
pathetic empirically try to all the
difference valiant stand and it's very
easy to do no need to deliver it to
promote the problem usually it's very
flow when you want to generate something
I was not part of the
you have a new input oh you'll see my
problems are in context and power up to
input if you have a non power to include
then you like to catch them as a power
that our internal run fast but if the
empirical conditioner was a tune for
something else he will be extremely slow
oh I have to do all of the empirical
human again and again every time yes
different people the problem is that in
our application we have all of these
different includes different diameters
it constantly change all the time we
don't always do an FFT 2048 possible so
we need something that has kind of the
best of both worlds we go to be really
close to teach but without having to
build updated model and that's where
machine learning it can be okay so is it
possible to have the best of what about
the possible to combine and what's
really good about the end from all the
passengers I being able to predict what
will be the best good for a new into in
you are where and also that the close to
keep performing concentrated fear well
there are 51 because install ones and
that's something that I here also
empirically learn model dangers in this
and the pros are basically all the pros
of both approaches and any digit account
will be that the pilot and explore
that's why I'm gonna talk to you about
this if the National need to work on
this problem now I think really good
because your pelvis this notice the
relationship between 40 and you could
maybe I'll optimized code for high
performance computing design and get
this kind of a loop so that you could
lose to be other that's too deep what
that's that's not right that's what you
want 45 libraries we are all into
specialized whatever reason we focus on
from this Sookie officialized ivory for
my itunes be they could be using this
approach to the change sir please
describe the entire the chimney
but that's what the gym stretch movies
all night and so we push the paper with
impression so it's like a twisted 3 5pm
50 and 60 100 again so before we both
and james randi dollar is what we saw it
that if you do empirical tune into the
school version the one that can assess
all of these give him a new input you
will take minutes to come up with the
best food this one is on the x axis yeah
he takes minutes start to generate add a
spoon and if you take the approach that
then good luck with the Julian 36 less
than point one second and if you look at
the performance reached by water desert
without very very welcome soup with a
fraction of a second electric can get to
think a part of me that seems to be Jan
of going the right direction and I was
kind of a finished shot them soon to be
work and again if you look at this point
here actually with Texas by a 1.1 para
throttles observe performance that's
eighty percent of what the Machine
Jensen it's almost coast that you cannot
really get much further and this
approach was able to find it very
quickly so what else could we do with
this um so what we can do it try to
minimize observe performance that's
eating the son of a mission
souls cannot be measured and this
approach was able to find very good
we do with this so what we can do is
also try to minimize failure can try
with machine learning to understand
failures of multiple por favor so what
is important is esta super computers
when you have like thousands of course
the 91 feeling would be extremely high
so if you can machine learning
approaches from predict which one will
fail under what condition that will be
also very interesting
we'd also try to minimize these
procedures so all the times what works
what really makes the performance of the
given algorithm
data is an interest rate enumerate
communication so automotive results
nice things about me specificity instead
of using the whole precision use our
precision which is much lower in the
memory food consumed
best advice but then my some sort of
herbs because numerically
not committed numerically this gradually
air so between reason and the most
random it means using million different
pairs better understand y agua feature
and how they interact with each other is
our pictures address be to become
extremely difficult to understand
especially our interactions because now
that we have part of processes no one
really knows what's the best of it is
here no one really knows what to do so
they just have tons of job that's why
it's extremely how to the ends or more
because the one is sure how we will it
will work in terms of the architectural
detail before back in today's in a
single for everyone has come to
agreement how to the architectures was
easier to learn some more so here maybe
we can understand better people states
interaction and maybe help the
high-performance computers and the out
where our designers to design their
architectures that way I hopefully we
can get this university relationships
and maybe they can sell more annoyed
performance computing hardware for us
without them so from from my point of
view that there will be a win-win-win
situation so if you can think of it
about the problem maybe you'll find
minus small negate that to be
interesting and just start veritas when
I drop on those computing guy and maybe
you'll be able to get something
interesting that that that was that was
the outline so again I awareness in
machine learning we all agree that
simple numbers for you I will hear and I
will my attempt here to try to bring
imagine trying to win you be using the
table with I like to thank my labs in
charlotte MI skills lab and it dropped
at Harvard the sponsors are being like
supporting my research and my teaching
and I'm you for coming
so this has been done here without
eating right accommodation the
generative army so it works really good
really really well the issue is the UTP
the new including you are where it's
very slow so the dispatch interest of
them dozens it's not getting out there
but that steps maybe there is more
research to be done is to try to be able
to balance out the ricotta to be
possible
so the input speed interest rate will be
a very latest research interface so like
five on four parameter they could be
used when loading or you don't like a
bunch of parameter like that and the
output is this time to run this
configuration of forgot about them so
how many how many treasure you use on
this particular processor this kind of
it's actually when you look at it from
when we look at this department of space
it's highly different in years it's it's
a very hard on the nettle tea different
polymers and I click the best-performing
code are usually at the clip of the best
performance because that's where you
hate how we're resource minutes so it's
the space is kind of like complicated
but just like the bunch of options
privacy metal
yeah oh yeah nope the point is that is
take off tonight sighing yeah
what is your reduce to mr. Cooper for me
is the money to a caster sugar just
listen but you just assaulted not all of
the things to make it a real library
maybe the real library you have to like
have many more options so the data
layout matters a lot depending on if you
have like a very fat from all the
silhouette or very sing to the lord of
the teachers falafel it's very different
yes yes issue with this is this kind of
like computer initiative are like
generate enough is that all the time you
don't get performance because they are
to generate for example if you today
while new convolutions to do an FFT a
weekly the lane and the fact is that
this convolution here is a filter bank
there is another dimension of the data
that I kept it up looking everywhere so
to get maximum performance this library
need to know about the packages over
there so here it's probably talking
about trust or like a few days like I'll
Committees of the other dog developing a
lot of times you cannot get performance
on these kind of tensile operations for
various reasons to make the library very
ordinary in terms of stencils maybe you
can get them were to compute engine but
again that's this is kind of side
projects so far so that these are all
very interesting questions if you had
more time oh you guys never cooperate if
you have to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
