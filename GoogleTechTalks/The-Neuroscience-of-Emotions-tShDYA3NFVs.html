is Ming and I'm the owner of the search
inside yourself program in Google or the
siy program siy is Google's homegrown
emotional intelligence sorry
homegrown mindfulness based emotional
intelligence course and we hope someday
to make this course accessible to the
whole world and this to this lecture
will become part of the content for the
siy course in the future and I'm
delighted today to introduce my dear
friend and siy instructor Philippe
Goldin
Philippe H the clinic Ana chemical is
clinically applied affective
neuroscience group in the department of
psychology at Stanford University he
spent six years in India and Nepal
studying various languages I don't
actually know how many languages I speak
but it's like more than three and he
studied Buddhist philosophy and debate
at various monasteries and then he
returned to the US to complete a PhD in
clinical psychology at Rutgers
University his research focuses on
functional neuroimaging investigations
of cognitive affective mechanisms the
effect of mindfulness meditation and
cognitive behavioral therapy and the
effect of parent-child mindfulness
meditation training and oh by the way he
is also a meditation teacher in case you
miss that and in person I find Philip to
be very smart very capable and very
compassionate and I'm very happy he's my
friend he's just amazing and my friends
please welcome Philip Godin
very nice okay so it's an honor to be
here and I know that everyone is very
busy so I really appreciate that you are
here let's begin so yes I'm going to
speak about the neuroscience of emotions
and yes I do come from an academic
background and also a practice
background and just to be really clear
the intention for today is to give you a
brief introduction to a little bit about
what we understand about the
neuroscience and how the brain works
with respect to emotions emotion
regulation emotion intelligence but
it'll be brief because we only have a
short time and this obviously should we
should start with some history so Darwin
speaking about emotions made it very
clear that emotion animals need emotions
to survive so do we they need fear as a
trigger to escape predators and
aggression to defend their territory
they're young and they're and food
emotions are he believed that motions
are really maintained from our animal
past in the trajectory of evolution of
human animals and that we really rely on
different emotions in different ways to
make click often complex decisions so
why do we have emotions as you can see
here just look at the looking at this
photograph just notice where your
attention goes notice what you see so
from multiple decades of research on
emotions we know that there are several
functions one way emotions help to
direct our attention it helps to enhance
our memory and how we actually encode
and consolidate different pieces of
information especially for information
that's personally salient it also helps
us to organize our behavior and our
orientation towards other people
specifically how we drive it helps to
drive and direct social approach or even
social avoidance and probably most
importantly for this group and for the
course the search inside yourself course
different emotions of the way our
learning history with emotions really
helps to develop moral and ethical
behavior when emotions and the brain is
functioning well it can be an incredibly
adaptive system meaning that its motions
bring richness to our experience how we
interact with people how we interact
with ourselves when emotions are
dysregulated out of control exaggerated
this can lead to things like anxiety
depression burnout even suicide so this
is really a very important aspect of the
human experience there are different
classes of emotion so research that
researchers have talked about six
primary or basic emotions they are
happiness as you can see happiness
surprise fear sadness disgust and anger
and you can check your own experience as
we go through this talk to see how this
aligns with what you've experienced in
yourself there's also kind of a
background sense of emotion or mood
moods are long-term emotions are more
punctate or short acute so they talk
often about well-being versus malaise a
sense of calm versus a sense of tension
feeling is a pain emotional and physical
as in contrast to pleasure and then
importantly especially for social
animals like human beings all of us
though there's a whole other realm of
social emotions that are in contrast to
the primary and this really has to do
with interpret interpersonal
interactions so emotions that arise like
embarrassment jealousy guilt shame sense
of pride so this is a rough sketch of
the different kinds of emotions now
emotions are obviously expressed one of
the most powerful ubiquitous ways is
through our facial expressions so these
are the six primary emotions and the
facial expressions of those emotions as
you can see and apparently in the
English language are over 600 words to
describe different emotions and on your
face there are 42 different muscles that
work together to express very subtly
different emotional expressions and
Paul Ekman from UC San Francisco
emeritus professor actually came up with
a facial action coding system to
actually delineate what muscle groups
need to arise in order to make different
emotional expressions so there's a whole
science behind all of this it's not only
an American or a North American
emotional expression thing in fact lots
of research by Paul Ekman and other
people have shown that the the
identification of different facial
expressions is cross-cultural as you can
see and there's a very high rate of
consensus across different cultures
different backgrounds about what
constitutes happiness sadness disgust
and so forth
another very important purpose for
studying emotions is that emotions are
truly if you think about it and check
your own experience are an important
source of information and feedback that
help to direct our behavior and also our
social interactions so you can think how
often do we use a gut feeling or a gut
instinct or kind of an intuition to make
a quick decision and in fact I would
suggest that if you check your
experience this is happening many times
per day so emotions are really
contributing to cognitive processes
thinking reasoning decision-making now
we know that here in the brain when a
person has a lesion right the absence of
a be it a tumor or some kind of disease
we know that frontal lobe lesions often
result in impaired emotional awareness
which is goes along with impairment in
social reasoning or interpersonal
problems and also problems making
decisions so we know that there's direct
connection between the functions of
brain systems and different aspects of
emotion and their sequela
emotions really exist on a range from
stating the obvious from a normal sense
of emotions and then the extreme forms
of those emotions so I would posit that
sadness which is a very normal human
experience in its extreme can lead to
major depression can be a very important
component of major depression anger
which also is a very normal human
emotion when it reaches an extreme or an
exaggerated form can become unprovoked
aggression an angry orientation in all
of our social interactions pleasure
again normal in its extreme it can lead
to addiction fear which of course is
appropriate in dangerous situations as
protective mechanism mechanism in its
exaggerated form can lead to anxiety
different kinds of phobias even panic
attacks or panic disorder and worry in
itself when it's out of control and when
its extreme can lead to generalized
anxiety disorder so we can really
appreciate that the emotions shift and
move along a continuum from normal to
extreme the brigham emotion in the brain
well we know when people have different
emotions it manifests in the in brain
circuitry and specifically different
functional areas in this case really the
focus over the past several decades has
been on the motion related brain
circuitry in the limbic system which is
really a distributed set of brain nodes
or brain regions that function together
to have the experience of emotions and
maybe even to generate emotion
experience and to detect what's
personally salient and emotionally
significant for us so this is happening
in a distributed brain system where you
see her and bright red is the the
amygdala the left and right amygdala
which is as probably everyone here knows
is a very important node within this
limbic system for emotions here just to
flesh it out a little more the limbic
system really is made up of multiple
brain areas including the amygdala
hippocampus hypothalamus and other brain
regions and even other paralympic
regions like the orbital frontal cortex
so we're only beginning to really
understand how these different brain
circuitry's contribute to different
kinds of emotion and the ability to work
with our emotions so having said that
how do we actually measure emotion well
many many different ways one way as you
see here is actually taking first-person
subjective emotion experience from
moment to moment to moment here you can
see it's actually oscillating from
neutral to amuse or to sad and this is
being induced by watching film clips so
this is subjective emotion experience
first-person report that's one window
into emotion another way is using a
peripheral autonomic psychophysiology
skin conductance facial muscle
contractions heart rate breathing rate
these are all autonomic
psychophysiological measures that we can
use another way is literally looking at
facial expressions of fear for example
another method is which I will be
talking about is functional neuroimaging
using for example brain imaging
techniques to look at an index of neural
activity here it's shown is bilateral
amygdala and in another methods that's
relatively well launched it's been used
for several decades is literally putting
a grid of electrodes right on the cortex
to measure under the skull and of course
this is an invasive procedure so it's
only done you know during epilepsy it's
not done to study emotions by itself not
to worry brain imaging techniques like
fMRI which I'll talk about is wonderful
because we can go under the skull
non-invasively no harm just to drive
home the point when we talk about
different emotions this is one study we
did where we had neutral sad and abusing
film clips brain imaging fMRI signal
what's called bold the blood oxygen
level dependent signal it first-person
emotion ratings from moment to moment
heart rate and then breathing rate or
breathing intensity and it's just to
really make the point that this is a
dynamic interactive system and this is
only four channels there many other
channels that we often looked at look at
can look at as well a full explanation
of a phenomena would really go from
looking at the genes or genetic
contribution to molecules to neurons
neural circuitry and then how different
cognitive processes thinking
decision-making emotion behavior are
instantiated in those neural circuitry
for today's talk I'm only going to be
talking about the top two but a full
explanation really is from genetics all
the way up to interpersonal interactions
and currently we have the technology to
look at all
of that many different modalities of
functional brain imaging there are many
different tools they all have a pros and
cons strengths and weaknesses what we'll
be looking at is in black box is
referring to the orange circle is fMRI
functional magnetic resonance imaging so
that gives us a single on the order of
seconds across the entire brain and
approximately we get the unit that we
can analyze is approximately 2/3
millimeters voxels so it has its pros
and cons but it's non-invasive and
that's what we use now no one here is if
you've not been an MRI machine
essentially it's a magnet and it's a
beautiful elegant machine but it's a
magnet and you can see that people are
lying down on their back and we put them
inside the bore of the magnet and I'm
going to give you a one slide primer on
the dependent variable in fMRI so you're
lying in the scanner you have this angry
harsh critical face presented to you
you're perceiving it this sets off
firing and specific populations of
neurons that activate neural circuitry
distributed neural circuits that then
are consuming glucose and oxygen send a
signal downstream hey the neurons are
firing send more cerebral blood volume
more blood flow and specifically more
oxygenated hemoglobin and glucose so
that the neurons can continue to fire
and you can replenish what's been used
then we do a lot of signal processing
and statistics to create brain maps
which you've seen in magazines I'm sure
to actually infer the 'nor underlying
neural activity that's occurring in
response to looking at an angry face and
then we use functional art knowledge of
functional neuron at imme to try to
infer what these different brain systems
are doing in conjunction with specific
experimental design to tease out the
function of different brain activity
that's a one slide primer so there are
many ways to probe the brain and to look
specifically to look at the motion
related brain regions in the limbic
system one way would be dynamic social
feedback so you can imagine
person in a video clip looking at you
going people don't really like you
that's one man especially for people who
are socially sensitive you could also
use music studies have used both
positive and really sad music to induce
very rapid shifts in emotional state and
you can just check your own experience
listening to different songs or Bruce
Springsteen songs or whatever another
ways as we've already shown is facial
expressions because we are super
sensitive to the slightest shifts
whether we're aware of it or not in
people's facial expressions electric
shock a very powerful especially the
anticipation of the shock even if you
don't deliver a shock sets up all kinds
of anxiety and fear and defensive
responses that you can begin to measure
in the brain another method that's
closer to sight to what we do in
psychotherapy or clinical practice is
people's own negative self-beliefs so
for example some something is wrong with
me having that thoughts spinning in the
mind can actually induce activity in the
limbic system and is really the basis of
what we begin to work with the NAM for
people with depression and anxiety what
are the core negative beliefs so these
are this is just a sampling of different
methods that can be used to probe the
function of the limbic system but then
there's a whole other part is beautiful
prefrontal cortex that is so fully
developed in the human animals which
allows us to take perspective to think
to analyze to use language all in the
service of emotion regulation in what
ways can we actually think in a certain
way that helps to change the meaning of
something that's going on right now in
our life or even right this moment to
change its intensity to change its
duration to even shift our
interpretation of me that what that
emotion is doing and why we're having it
that's this prefrontal cortical area
that allows us to make abstractions
think take perspective apply different
strategies but this is not new almost
two millennia ago Marcus Aurelius said
if you are distressed by anything
external or even internal
the pain is not due to the thing itself
but to you to your estimate of it and
this you have the power to revoke at any
moment profound profound statement
definition of emotion regulation so it's
not a new phenomenon in human animals
it's been here for thousands of years
but this is really something specific
about our prefrontal cortex that allows
us to work with these processes to
modify our experience for a moment a
moment so there are different stages of
emotion regulation and just as I'm
saying this check your own experience
preconscious are their proclivities or
even cognitive processes that are
happening in the brain when something
when a situation is occurring even
before we are aware of it that's
influencing how we interpret our
emotions how we interpret our current
situation then this leads to immediate
attentional shifts when it bursts into
conscious processing something scary is
going on
there's threat do I shift my attention
to the source of threat social approach
do I shift my attention away avoidance
both of which our forms can be forms of
regulating my attention and which
thereby
influences emotions another aspect is
emotion appraisal how do i label that
emotion how do I interpret what that it
with that emotion is and then cognitive
reappraisal using our thinking and
perspective-taking ability to change the
meaning oh that's not a source of threat
it's only a stick or a rope it's not a
snake well that person was only was
looking at somebody else not at me and
then finally and more subtly
metacognitive how I view how I process
thinking how I view these my ability to
create a space to understand how my mind
works
so more metacognitive processes which
can all of these things that we're
talking here can be trained through
different practices a little bit about
the neural anatomy so wonderful work by
Mary Phillips Helen may berg Wayne
drevis
Kevin Ochsner on on and on some
fantastic neuroscientist
who really have in the past 10-15 years
begun to create models brain anatomy and
functional Anatomy models of emotion
reactivity and regulation so in the
context of a threat real or imagined
this can rapidly shift our affective
state fear anxiety arousal and this is
really embedded in the emotional
reactivity in the limbic system amygdala
anterior cingulate this sends a
bottom-up signal to recruit help from
other parts of the brain other brain
systems and that's working correctly
then in blue you see here that there are
regulatory systems that then begin to
process what is that threat what are
some strategies how can I work with it
and when it's working well it sends a
top-down signal to modulate the
intensity the duration the
interpretation of that ongoing emotion
experience but I would also add that
especially in human beings
this is mediated through our view of
self be it positive or negative or
otherwise and our ability to use
language and thinking to modulate and
understand our experiences so this is
beginning of a complex system that
people are beginning to examine using
all kinds of neuro scientific tools
terms of emotional intelligence which is
a relatively new concept
Peter salivate and John Mayer have
defined it in the following way it is
the ability to monitor one's own and
others feelings and emotions to
discriminate among them and to use this
information to guide one's thinking and
actions in a way that is not harming and
hopefully helping others and self so
this is very fundamental to human social
interaction human systems Google the
world but this really relies on previous
work by Howard Gardner who had a very
very influential book where he talked
about multiple intelligences so in
cognitive psychology clinical psychology
we often talk about IQ intellectual
cognitive abilities but of course there
are many other kinds of intelligences
which are as important and in some
situations even more important in the
domains of interpersonal skills and
intelligence and also intra personal
skills so the idea is that there are
multiple forms of intelligence and that
these are important to develop
volitionally intentionally and to find
methods structured work on that to
become a more full skillful optimal
human being some of the skills and
competencies that we're thinking about
especially in search inside yourself
emotional awareness the inverse of that
is alexithymia the inability to detect
and even describe one's own emotional
states let alone others mindfulness the
ability to volitionally place one's
attention in the moment on purpose from
moment to moment without negative
critical self judgment self awareness
enriching and enhancing our
understanding of what actually who
actually am i how do i function and the
ability to regulate when I am off
balance do I know how to regulate and
bring myself back into balance off
balance back into them that's a whole
set of skills motivation what's the
motivation or intention for engaging in
action behavior interactions with other
people
empathy as we'll see in a moment the
ability to actually tune in and feel the
reverberations so to speak of the
emotional state of another person
dropping the self just enough to attend
to someone else
in deeper and deeper ways and then
social skills both linguistic language
body language even vocabulary and also
just being able to evaluate and take
feedback so all of these are in the
service of enhancing psychological
flexibility and well-being so I did a
little intelligence and brain
functioning but one that caught my eye
is the following which is done by
Kilgore and colleagues this this
particular study they work with 16
healthy
children and adolescents and they had to
do processing of fear facial expressions
here's one example so fear face
expressions processing those what they
found is on one of one of many emotional
intelligence questionnaires the more
emotionally intelligent via self-report
questionnaire that these kids
demonstrated this was associated with a
reduction blue a reduction in brain
activity in a distributed set of brain
systems that had to do with somatic or
sensory experience emotion reactivity
and even kind of cognitive control so
reduction in the need to try to control
two viscerally feel and in red enhanced
activity in some of the visual
processing areas as a function of
reporting greater emotional intelligence
so this is one study but it's very
promising to see even in a younger
sample of children that emotional
intelligence has have correlates in the
brain that are interpretable and
important in terms of emotion and
sensory experience empathy so I said
that we talked a little bit of empathy
so currently is a hot field it's a hot
area within neuroscience a decade ago no
one would have touched this so this is
really talking about a paradigm shift
among scientists who took by definition
tend to be rather conservative and what
we study but understanding that we now
have the tools to be able to begin to
dissect deconstruct manipulate levels of
empathy so here we can understand how
can we understand the other person's
mind you can say theory of mind is one
aspect of this and what is the neural
circuitry involved so empathy I would
say really relies of earlier developed
skills in fact some that are innate so
what I'm putting here is a picture that
shows that children infants actually can
imitate imitation facial expressions and
motor movements in adults this is a very
important clue so now we're
becoming detectives the ability to
perceive others and to imitate their
behaviors is a building block for
empathy in fact some studies have shown
that there's a frontal cortex to purr
ayatul network that's implicated in
mirror neuron systems for the ability to
perceive others and to imitate their
behaviors in their actions so when you
see kids
for example sticking their tongues at
each other there's in fact a brain
network the yellow part has to do with
visual information feeding the red the
two red areas that have to do with
generating the motor pattern and then
understanding how my motor pattern
matches what another person is doing
observation of an action automatically
triggers a simulation of that action in
the brain even if it's not expressed
premotor cortical neurons fire during
goal-directed actions as well as during
observation similar actions so
throughout the day as we observe others
parts of our brain are actually setting
up simulations that mirror other
people's behaviors and we say that the
neural basis of imitation as shown here
is really a basis for empathy which in
one way is an inner imitation of the
emotional state of another person so we
actually have the neural basis that we
can begin to probe and see how they
change with training so empathy here can
be construed as identification with an
understanding of another's situation
feelings motives intentions the state of
being in tune with another person
particularly by feeling what their
situation is like from the inside not
just intellectually and empathy this is
interesting may or may not precede
sympathy which is a basis for developing
the ability to cognitively understand
that person's mind how they view things
so empathy being more on an affective
state in fact this is shown here one
study that had to do with looking at
empathy for another person's pain
physical pain emotional pain triggers in
the perceiver shown here brain regions
associated with emotion processing
visceral experience bilateral insula a
very important area that has to do with
a visceral experience when you see
someone else in pain in this particular
study people viewed short film clips of
people who either were neutral not
effectively or not in pain versus people
who are in a very painful response you
imagined the feelings of the other
person or even oneself having that pain
and here what I just want to point out
is that they measure two things personal
distress and empathic concern and what
you'll see is the empathic concern was
much greater when you saw the other
person in pain not oneself the personal
distress was greater when you imagined
yourself in pain not the other so here
this is a double this is a double
dissociation where we can actually begin
to delineate different aspects of
empathy and where they're playing out in
the brain and again insula insular
cortex this visceral experience of pain
and others so this starts to get
exciting in fact another very important
review paper came out recently by Haim
and Tanya singer trying to delineate two
different aspects cognitive perspective
taking which is something that we
probably are all doing many times a day
trying to understand what other people
are thinking the ability to understand
intentions desires and beliefs of
another person resulting from
cognitively reasoning about the other
state how is this person seeing the
situation how could they actually do
problem-solving how what are the things
that they are important in their process
and decision making that lead to their
behavior in contrast to that the empathy
is is really getting into the affective
state which is caused by the sharing of
the emotions and the sensory experience
of another person dropping the self just
enough just to begin to experience the
emotions of another person at least in
some to some degree in some level and
so these two different perspectives on
how to understand another person green
and orange are actually mapped on two
different parts of the brain and that
the cognitive has to do with more medial
prefrontal cortex higher-order abstract
mental representations of the other as
well as taking actually areas that have
to do with social cognition perspective
taking how other people how I represent
other people in my mind versus the
orange which has to do with this
anterior cingulate and B again the
insula which has more to do with trying
to resolve conflict actually experience
the visceral state of another person's
emotion so there's kind of tuning in on
an emotional level so the brain is
actually showing this even without
people's first-person report so this is
a very interesting way that the brain
imaging is leading to understanding
about how people are functioning that we
may or may not be able to verbally
express or always reliably express
verbally I should say compassion so I
would suggest and I listen can be open
to debate and thinking empathy the
cognitive perspective taking our
building blocks both are necessary for
developing compassion compassion being
truly well that the definition come up a
deep awareness of the suffering of
another person
coupled with the wish the intention the
motivation to relieve that person from
their suffering so it's both an
emotional component and a cognitive
component a tender feeling sympathetic
sad concern for someone in misfortune
pity for others with a desire to help
and I which put here I would pause it
here in bold that empathy and cognitive
perspective taking and behavioral action
is really the crux of compassion and
this can be trained so it's the emotion
the cognition and the
to relieve others from suffering
compassion doesn't mean we have to
become angelic angels and I put this up
it because that that's action obstacle
to even thinking about how can I become
more compassionate at work at home in my
relationships if the goal is too lofty
I'll stop from the beginning this is not
the case the absence of compassion can
lead to incredible painful decisions to
abuse other people as we see in Abu
Ghraib in this picture but also in the
same field of the theater of war there
can be moments of compassion where
person decides to pause enough for a
moment to connect with others so this is
really important so this is not just
theoretical this is actually playing out
from moment to moment either in very
safe environments like Google or
Mountain View or in very dangerous
environments like East Palo Alto or Iraq
or Afghanistan and everywhere in between
so this is not theoretical this is
actually fundamental so in fact one
quote here I feel the capacity to care
is the thing which gives life's life its
deepest significance so when is the
Dalai Lama says love and compassion are
necessities not luxuries why because
without them humanity cannot survive and
I think that one reason that
neuroscientists neurologists
psychiatrists psychologists researchers
even physicists at Stanford
neurosurgeons and Beyond are actively
putting their intellectual resources
their money and their time into studying
this why because they realize that this
is getting pretty serious it's not a
luxury it's a necessity for human
animals to continue to exist on this
planet so that's why the neuroscientists
who wouldn't have touched this ten years
ago are actively studying this now
because now we need to do more
and we can do more in fact what the
people at Google say the Googlers say
don't be evil
how wonderful at least do not harm
others and if you can if possible bring
some benefit to others so I like your
motto EEG another imaging tool different
capacities can we look at people who
worked on training their minds well the
answer is yes when people are doing
loving-kindness meditation which is one
kind of compassion meditation practice
there are specific parts of the brain
from which we can begin to measure rapid
electrical firing patterns that show
when an adept a really well trained
meditator in this case but it could be a
chess player it could be a mathematician
it could be an engineer it could be a
therapist can invoke a state of mind
that's open to loving kindness towards
all beings and how does that manifest in
these electrical patterns in the brain
well in fact we can begin to delineate
that can we train it and that brings the
last part of this talk the most
inspiring part I hope neuroplasticity so
until recently we thought you can't
change the brain you can't change the
anatomy you can't change the functioning
or the the linking of circuitry well in
fact we're finding more and more that
you can so until recently they thought
okay so maybe when you're infants you
can the brain is plastic but as you
become data lessons and adults you
cannot that also now has been debunked
and in fact training the brain training
influences brain structure and brain
function here we go this is a very very
simple engineering diagram of the brain
very simple the brain is super what is
it Google X refers to ten to the
hundredth right a goo that's what a
Google is I looked it up the I would
posit that the brain is that complex
we are only presenting we reduced
reductionistic aspects of the brain the
brain is much more complex and beautiful
than we can imagine but
we know from our own experience and I
hope this is true that in our own mental
states can be like a fly stuck on sundew
leaves stuck not able to fly and at
other times via our own experience we
can experience our own mind as a fluid
mountain stream and I would posit that
it's about our choice we can train the
mind in either of these directions we
can also bring a sense of acceptance to
both of these mental states in ourselves
and others so what's the evidence from
neuroscience well for people who have
obsessive-compulsive disorder a study
now ten years ago a decade ago looked at
the orbital frontal cortex right up
behind the eyes and actually found that
a part of the V at baseline you could
actually predict based on the metabolism
of glucose in that part of the orbital
frontal cortex predicted who would
respond to both medications and to
behavioral therapy this was a very
important study groundbreaking study
that could show brain functioning can
predict who will benefit from at least
two very different forms of clinical
treatment in people with
obsessive-compulsive disorder very
exciting fast forward now three years
ago christa charms formerly at stanford
did in fantastic study looking at
showing people in the MRI scanner a
little igloo with a fire the greater the
fire the greater the neural activity in
a specific part of the brain this part
of the brain and he had people up and
down regulate from moment to moment
their own brain activity and it was
represented by the flame inside of an
igloo for people with chronic physical
emotional pain and show them that they
could actually up and down regulate
activity in a specific part of the brain
that's neuroplasticity in a clinical
intervention for people with chronic
pain using what's called real-time fMRI
this is one of my favorite studies
London cabbie drivers cab drivers
showing that the number of years of
experience driving in London which
apparently is incredibly complex grid
not like New York City that they
actually had greater activity in the
hippocampus on a struct absurd
structural changes in the structure of
the hippocampus based on the number of
years of experience driving a cab in
London direct experience literally
changing the shape of the anatomy of the
brain again neuroplasticity these are
examples specific phobia showing that
cognitive behavioral therapy which is a
gold standard psychotherapy for most of
the angry actually all the anxiety
disorders in this specific phobia being
one kind showing that from pre to post
cognate behavioral therapy activity in
the whoops here shown in the anterior
cingulate and also in bilateral insula
was reduced following cognate behavioral
therapy so people's cognitive conflict
cognitive command also their visceral
emotional reactivity reduced in the
presence of the phobic stimulus from pre
to post cog behavioral therapy
here's that's another study that
actually we're doing this is preliminary
evidence showing that for people with
social anxiety disorder when working
with your own negative self-beliefs pre
post 16 sessions of cognitive behavioral
therapy for social anxiety read here
means increased activity in areas having
to do with self-regulation access to
linguistic processing and then attention
and cognitive regulation increases in
people when they're working with their
own negative beliefs pre to post
cognitive therapy this is a very
interesting study that was done
cross-sectionally not pre post but
looking at Insight Meditation
practitioners that on an anatomical
level these two areas which normally
decline as you age this is gray matter
normally decline as you age which I
actually was preserved in those people
who meditated and in fact
of years of meditation act was shown to
protect was a protective mechanism
against the normal decay or loss or
degeneration of gray matter
cross-sectional study not pre-post so
it's a different kind of design but I'm
sure that somebody will be working on a
stronger experimental design soon so
again more evidence that what how would
we choose to do with our time influences
even across the aging opposes the aging
process um and this is just another
studies showing that with mindfulness
meditation in people with anxiety
disorders what's in the circles is a
network of brain regions that's in which
attention regulation is instantiated and
that those regions are increased ie
better ability to use the brain to shift
your attention pre post mindfulness
training and even though before I said
about the self we also have preliminary
evidence it's not been that's out into
at least two different labs or three
different labs but for people with
anxiety disorders or even depression
that the neural network that supports
self focused attention can actually be
modulated with attention training
mindfulness meditation training
so in summary threat real or imagined
definitely we can see is that you can
modulate up or down and hopefully down
your the intensity of emotional
reactivity and then you can use all of
these other brain systems called your
regulation thinking attention regulation
volitionally shifting our awareness our
attention mediated through self view and
language to lead to greater well-being I
have done this work with many many other
people it's the people in my group and
many others who aren't even in pictured
here and this is where I am virtually
I'm actually right here and thank you
for your attention
we have about 10 minutes for questions
and answers maybe only questions okay
okay any questions or any pondering it
doesn't even have to be a question a
reflection so just on during our well
least lights be posted well we have
access to these the whole talk is going
to be uploaded to YouTube in its
entirety okay thank you go you can
ponder it even more would you be able to
go back to this study on the adolescents
and um just go over I I wasn't sure what
no good because it seemed like you were
saying something that to me seemed
contradictory but but maybe I was just
yeah I was misunderstanding okay so here
so this is one study one thing I want to
make very clear is that uh don't trust
one study trust the result the meta
analyses or trust a study that's been
replicated at least once preferably
twice not in the same lab that's one
thing that's a caveat the science don't
trust any one study here this is one
study with sixteen children and
adolescents so already that's kind of a
wide range but supposedly what was
presented in the studies that the
greater by self-report on a
questionnaire the greater the emotional
intelligence score reported by kids and
adolescents the reduction blue in these
regions and other regions that had that
have to do with emotional reactivity
visceral response to fear phases
specifically to fear faces yeah this is
just one exemplar this is to fear facial
expressions and people the human brain
is super sensitive to facial expressions
of fear anger and have a reliable neural
once okay thanks but it is interesting I
mean why what exactly so this is a very
kind of course what aspect of emotional
intelligence relates to less emotional
reactivity to fear that was not answered
that's why we need multiple into further
studies and is that only in the
adolescence or is in the younger kids is
it age dependent in fact another study
that I don't think is published yet from
our group
James grosses lab at Stanford
psychophysiology laboratory looking I
can get from eight year olds up to 22
year olds boys and girls every single
age the ability to use thinking
reinterpretation strategies cog ie
cognitive regulation or cognitive
reappraisal in clinically said cognitive
restructuring to emotional probe to
emotional reactivity was actually
predicted by cognitive development which
totally makes sense so the older you are
the more cognitively cognitively
developed the more cognitive development
you demonstrate on neuropsychological
tests the more you're able to use
cognitive reappraisal strategies to
down-regulate
emotional reactivity so there is an age
dependent thing at least from 8 to 22
but then it raises the question from 22
onwards 70 80 90 what are we doing can
we train can we overcome anger can we
overcome low self esteem can we overcome
insecurities and how and what are the
best methods yeah
so I think somebody behind you I say
white guess I was search inside yourself
one method to do that or at least to
begin to try to do that I'm just
wondering if there's any consensus among
the critics or skepticism around this
work that might be that might that we
might be able to address as well um
there's any but I mean I have my own
skepticism are you okay in your mind
that's uh no no I don't in fact this is
all very new and very exciting I yeah
I'm happy to you know one of the great
things were being in science is that we
can be skeptical professionally so I
have my skepticism in the following way
I'll try to just briefly so in so for
example in cognitive behavioral therapy
which I'm trained in it's change
oriented identifying mistakes in
thinking thinking in ways that are
actually harmful not beneficial that
need to feeling worse about myself or
others one method to work with that is
to identify those thoughts modify them
change them deconstruct them find
evidence that that those thoughts are
either not accurate or that they're not
beneficial so that's really a heady
logical linguistic language approach
shift I'm also trained in mindfulness or
meditation different kinds of meditation
techniques one of which is mindfulness
meditation there you go for change but
it's not language based it's not
linguistic it's not cognitively
challenging my thoughts it's actually
shifting how I approach my own
experience radically different from the
COG behavioral approach but probably
leading to the same kind of
psychological flexibility currently
people are how do we know when someone
walks in the door or even a friend what
methods work best for whom we actually
don't know that would how do we know
that a combined approach would work best
for this for Joe or for Sally currently
we actually don't know and this is one
of the biggest problems if I trained you
in certain skills where I assume this is
going to be helpful for you even they're
not we're just wasted energy time money
even actually maybe inducing more
frustration so for example meditation is
not good for everybody
we know that as a fact coggan behavioral
therapy doesn't treat everyone's anxiety
or depression 100% we know that as well
what's in the 30% that don't get better
how calculate figure out who will get
better yeah yeah okay I mean have many
more questions and doubts but that's at
least one of them I can share
you just listed off two different types
of treatment besides meditation what are
some other tools that you use I mean
like can you kind of give us like a case
study or some examples if I have to walk
in your door and what what would we do
sure how about exercise exercise is a
powerful mood regulator and but one of
the things that happens there and
because we're actually doing a study on
our brain imaging pre post exercise for
two and a half months for people with
anxiety that may or may not be just as
effective as mindfulness meditation or
even coggan behavioral therapy but there
might be very different mechanisms so
that's something a whole other thing
would be that we're not studying that
could be very powerful to study because
since we are so embedded in logos or
language is communication skills how we
actually process language even on
training ourselves to use language and
linguistic processing in a way that's
less harmful to self and others that
would be a whole other method that's not
about therapy it's not about meditation
those are at least two examples that
come to mind and even like we talked
about mindfulness but here's a whole
other realm which is compassion so for
example here's a thought you take
somebody who has an eating disorder be
it bulimia or binge in or whatever or
anorexia is there could you actually
train the person to view themselves via
met compassion meditation on the self
and others to actually move around the
distorted self view that leads to
constriction of food or dissolving into
food or vomiting etc I'm not sure that's
been studied but there are approaches so
that so for example I think we have to
think outside the box right now - you
know when Google is a thinking company
that's exactly what we needed to do as
well instead of just staying with our
normal you know psychotherapy or
trainings there may be other ways to
work with the mind that could be more
powerful that we just haven't tried yet
or thought about so even just to be
clear mindfulness meditation is one type
of meditation there are many many many
kinds of meditation for example many of
which haven't even been translated or
incorporated
to Western psychotherapy yet Zen has and
like dialectic behavioral therapy mind
fills based cognitive therapy etc but
there are many other techniques yeah
there are waiting to be tried out so
it's my experience and also read that
basically if you take any kind of action
or just express the emotions then it
basically becomes less so is there any
study on that aspect or you didn't touch
that did you say dis expressing the
expressing and just in any other kind of
action for the emotion then just keeping
it within basically obviously has an
effect on ya in general yes so that
should is a very elegant study by David
Creswell he was at UCLA now he's at
Carnegie Mellon where he just had people
doing emotion labeling using language in
MRI scanner and found that just the act
of applying a word or a label or a
phrase to describe the emotion that one
is feeling in the moment helps to reduce
amygdala reactivity helps to actually
shift neural activity in the brain
that's emotion labeling emotion
expression catharsis in many cases can
be helpful but we also know that has to
be done in a very skillful manner so for
example exposure therapy has to do with
exposing oneself to what would I fear
and addressing it so for example
exposure therapy for post-traumatic
stress disorder can either be very
effective it done well repeatedly in a
very concrete fashion but it can also
totally backfire and you can see people
actually melting down emotionally when
they're trying to express and we live in
emotion so it's a more situation and
context and person dependent so no
blanket thing that catharsis or
emotional expression is always helpful
the other issue here is how is it
affecting the other people maybe it's
beneficial for me but I also the people
around me from doing it with a
professional versus a friend or at work
or whatever I have to recognize it may
have different replications depending on
which context I'm in yeah
thank you this is wonderful to hear
you've mentioned a lot of great things
I'm really curious about the fact that
neuroscience and is very excited about
compassion recently and it's wonderful
when we hear that Sciences are
validating age-old wisdoms so the idea
of slowing down being more mindful being
in the present good food exercise so
friends good friends good relationships
all of that good loving yeah I'm just
curious whether or not you have a
certain perspective on how that fits
into our society because those age-old
wisdom are are sound and true but in a
society where we're constantly
fragmented or even the idea of memory
it's being fragmented even by the fact
that we're searching every day and we
don't bother remembering things and
memory is important from an emotional
context for understanding who we are so
yes we're understanding it yes we're
validating it to you do you have an
opinion on how we can integrate it into
our lives and it complementing perhaps
our our our need to be fast-paced and
hungry and diverse it's a great question
and introducing silence and stillness
appreciation for silence and stillness
going into stillness in oneself in
little kids in families in fact my
favorite studies are about training
whole families to become quiet to
actually take stillness as a family
exercise can you imagine taking
stillness as a work exercise so for
example some of our lab meetings my
little group we begin in silence
the Quakers do it introducing silence
both mentally and communally as a
practice that's not bizarre or weird
that actually reinforces how people feel
each other but the key thing you're
saying is right how do we integrate this
both intra personally like in me and
that's something that each person has to
figure out how do I find that still
quiet place inside nourish it enjoy it
actually like enjoy it how do I
experience that with other people so in
psychotherapy these the sensibility has
kind of been infused lately
mindfulness acceptance etc and people
are experimenting both in individual
couples group therapy in workplaces
people are recognizing that well-being
is as monetarily valuable to creativity
to ill to lack of illness to a communal
sense and even for example to creativity
so if the mind if you're a company that
really requires thinking outside the box
and you know there's different forms of
stress that make me box like wow gosh I
have to address that and actively
creating community be it on a family
level be it amongst people here be it
even like a little work team I don't
know what vocabulary you use but
introducing that sensibility as either
just as a tool for people to become more
still creative aware even pausing for a
moment before responding and then again
it's all of this there's the muscle of
attention and anyone can develop that
and then there's becoming search inside
yourself to become more and more aware
how does my mind work
how does my mind work in curious how do
I impact others how do I understand when
I feel off or emotionally off-balance
how can I bring myself back how can I
become more skillful with myself not you
know other people take care of
themselves but just myself so I think it
starts from an individual practice and
then it's it will automatically touch
other people so just a simple example
you know Paul Ekman who spoke yesterday
MMPR and who's oh he was a pretty
intense intense difficult researcher guy
he went to India specifically because
his daughter wanted to meet
I don't think Blackmon was interested he
went there and he was smitten that's the
right word touched smitten that by
something inexplicable and so much so
that he said yesterday on the radio that
when he saw his wife who did not attend
this meeting he said you're not the
husband i noon for the past several
decades
he'd been touched by something and he's
still trying to figure out what that is
so there's also this sense of contagion
so emotional contagion can either drive
us nuts because somebody else is you
know totally off-balance and it's making
me off-balance that's the negative side
of contagion the other part can be
emotional contagion or compassionate
contagion one person the room is like
present and other people like who I feel
that and that's a that's a positive side
of contagion being touched by influenced
by another person's inner development so
that's possible and we have evidence
that that's possible yeah maybe one last
question you penny
um maybe this isn't as related but
what's your view on psycho analysis and
how is that related at all or I mean cuz
you were kind of these these are almost
sometimes I I wonder if there are kind
of bigger things that prevent
mindfulness or cognitive based therapies
from actually taking as much effect so
dree Epstein New York City
psychoanalytically trained and
psychotherapists also Buddhist
practitioner he has several really good
books addressing exactly this question
within psychotherapy approaches there's
a wide range of how people work and also
it's different skills for different
kinds of problems if you would treat
elevator phobia very different than
relationship phobia for example and also
you know if you go back to Freud he
talked about hovering trying to get the
right vocabulary I think it said
hovering awareness this ability to just
let the attention just rest and hover
and be aware and that actually could be
concept that's one aspect of resting and
mindful awareness with
nothing to do nowhere to go just
observing and enjoying that so in fact
that could be something that that arises
from psychoanalytic practice so not just
theory but practice so yeah I mean this
is all we're all humans and we can give
different vocabulary but it's the same
suffering with slightly different
flavours and it's the same tools to
restore well-being balance psychological
flexibility not being stuck and also
believing that I actually can do
something that's that's one of the
things that arises in any form of
therapy or training or even friendship
true friendship is that oh my gosh I can
expand I can be more than this that is
sense then you trust that and you're
hopeful that something can happen so I'm
actually doing a study on hopefulness
and hopelessness and it really is you
can actually see in the brain you can
differentiate hopeful hopeful state or
hopelessness and even about being able
to develop some people don't believe we
can train the brain and that's kind of a
hopeless state so let's let's actually
change that with evidence personal
evidence and the dead thank you Phillip
