I'm talking about and
to take it a step or two further with it
with any luck all right so how can we
better understand customers now I talked
to some of my former students who now
work at Google and they told me there's
six things that are on their minds maybe
some of you are interested they'd like
to design products that preserve the
Google brand and maybe extend it they
want to solve the problem of getting
remote teams from all over the world
coordinated with mountain view different
countries different markets have
different needs and they want to know
how do we tailor our products to those
different places how do we avoid
confusing our customers with too many
products can we find out what people
really want quickly and inexpensively
because boy it's a pain to do these
focus groups in these surveys we need a
quick fast way to do it and finally what
about products that don't even exist
that customers can't quite relate to yet
how can we find out whether they'll Buy
in or not so my goal today is to show
you three big ideas not in great depth
because of the time limit but at least
get you excited about these number one
and probably the most interesting one is
the thing I called I call stock markets
and you'll see you'll see what the
acronym stands for in a moment but some
of you have heard of a book called the
wisdom of crowds and it relates to that
idea that a bunch of smart people or
even a bunch of average people may have
more expertise than any one expert and
so we should learn how to listen to that
crowd and get their consensus view on
something and your google internal
markets basically gathers the consensus
about internal Google issues i'm going
to apply that in a slightly different
way the second thing is if you really
want to understand customers and
especially this idea of overloading them
with too much stuff you need to
understand how they process information
and specifically and maybe the number
one source of success for google if you
think about it is that they need
simplicity people like simplicity so you
have a very simple interface and one
little
box where you type stuff you may even I
was able to print my own badge coming to
this place that was impressive first
time I've ever done that in my life so
how do they do that and so we've
developed an algorithm that identifies
how each person cuts through all of the
complexity to make their life a little
easier that turns out to be important
i'll show you why and finally if you ask
somebody what do they want and you ask
them again and you ask them a third time
you'll start getting inconsistent
answers so you can't really be sure what
the truth is in research we call this
error and we just throw a little epsilon
into our equation say all theirs error
there but it turns out that can really
confuse somebody's trying to figure out
what should our product be and what
trade-off should we really make and so
I've been working on reducing error and
i'll show you how for any of these
methods to be good what they have to do
is predict something like what will
people by how many will they buy they
should be fast so it doesn't cost us too
much time or money they should be cheap
on the money side and they should be
easy for both us and customers and
that's really the biggest problem with
market research today it's not these
things it's not good fast cheaper easy
can be bad on all four dimensions I'm
trying to improve on all four dimensions
simultaneously all right the first idea
this is joint work with some colleagues
in Germany in fact all the work we do
runs on their servers and all the tests
have been done in California so it sort
of demonstrates that if you built a
solution like this it could work
worldwide relatively easily and we're
just academics we don't have the
resources of Google to really do this
right but it still works the question is
on what dimension would a market and in
this particular case a stock market
outperform the other methods you might
have used to find out what people think
what they want when I first presented
this this work a year ago at a
conference in Boston that
day this article appeared and it
basically said that Google was trying
this idea and as far as i can tell
google like microsoft like
hewlett-packard like a few other
companies that have used this concept
mainly using it internally what do our
own employees think will happen what
will our sales be how many printers will
we sell will our software ship on time
and those were all real questions asked
by companies such as yours what I'm
about to show you is a slight variation
on that theme and instead of predicting
a future outcome like sales or shipping
ship time I'm trying to measure people's
preferences their opinions their their
emotions things like that so here's that
here's the way this works this is sort
of a rough model of how this works each
of you in the room if I showed you say a
cell phone could have reactions as to
whether you like it or not let's call
that my own personal preferences but you
might also have an opinion about what
the other people in the room will say so
if I showed you three cell phones you
might say I know which one of those
three I would buy at those prices and I
have a guess as to what percentage of
each of the other people in the room
would buy and that's something that we
could do in a very simple survey in fact
that's exactly what I did at Qualcomm
last week and not just about cell phones
but about 64 different aspects of cell
phones now after they think about what
they like and what other people might
like I put them in a room together and
in our case I had about half the people
in the room just about this many people
and even more people sitting at their
desks all over the world on a computer
and they were all just tied in through
the web and they played a game and the
question is how do they play that game
they were winning the game means having
successful stock trading head you know
making money you guys know something
about making money from stocks right I
think yeah you do you do just by being
at this place you do
so how do you how do you know how to
make money with stocks well the basic
idea is you buy stocks that you think
are going up and you sell the ones you
think are going down and that's how you
make money but here the only information
you've got to help you with that is your
own belief about these things I just
showed you and your expectations about
other people the amazing thing about
this is even though each one of you may
be very biased in the process of doing
this and there's pretty good evidence
that people are biased the market
pricing that mechanism the fact that you
are trading with each other leads to
some good results so we're going to look
at that the only key assumption of this
and this is a big assumption is that the
people playing this game want to win so
we have to give them an incentive to
want to win it turns out at Qualcomm and
with my own students at UCLA they want
to win because just pride but you could
use money as an inducement as well so
the kind of markets I think you've been
running here are what I call information
markets prediction markets futures
markets event markets the way they work
and there are many examples that
preceded what Google and the companies
have done for example the most famous is
Iowa electronic markets that attempts to
predict who's going to win an election
there's already a stock called Hillary
wins in 2008 you can find out what is
the probability that Hillary Clinton is
your next president right now by going
to Iowa electronic markets these things
are trying to predict an actual outcome
which in the future you'll be able to
observe like an election outcome they
don't necessarily tell you why people
believe that they just tell you this is
what people believe and they typically
run up to a year long so the Iowa
electronic markets is already up for the
2008 elections that Microsoft and
hewlett-packard markets run a matter of
weeks and months I don't know how habo
how long do your markets typically run
about one quarter so 90 days how is what
i am doing different than this well
first of all i'm not measuring future
events or outcomes i'm measuring your
current preference what's in your head
right now
and there will never be a future outcome
that will come true or not first
different second difference is I try to
discover the underlying reasons why
somebody likes something so I get down
to the granular level of what specific
feature that they like or dislike and
finally my games are all over in under
an hour you're in and out in an hour if
you want it to run longer you just run
another game basically that's those are
the differences and by the way I used in
that previous slide scalable preference
markets you see that in the upper right
you'll see in a minute that due to a
little bit of creativity and good luck
we figured out a way to make this thing
infinitely scalable you give me more
people to play I can handle more and
more questions I'll show you how we do
that so the category that I'm going to
use for the rest of the time we have
together is this category of smartphones
but don't get obsessed with smartphones
this could apply to basically anything
that people can get their hands around
including vague concepts of a software
product user interfaces new services you
might offer it doesn't have to be a
physical object but I've done a lot of
research on smartphones and what's nice
about that is I've got data going back
five or six years now I started this
work about six years ago and we can
compare over time what's happened so
here's the kind of question you might
ask let's say your Motorola and it's a
month ago right it's middle of May let's
say and you have to decide what should
we launched as a cell phone a smart
phone in particular and a smartphone is
how many of you already own smartphones
that can do email web browsing etc how
many of you are thinking about getting
one in the next year all right so we
want to tap into that market and the
motorola q phone that i show you here
was announced relatively recently about
the time after the time that i'm talking
about what should it be how can it
compete with these other five products
so going back a few years when i was at
MIT we did this research we built a user
interface
on screen you saw everything you needed
basically a list of stocks and how their
trading price is up and down we created
a list of stocks that people could trade
and here you see 14 stocks and they
represent and this is the part people
have the hardest time getting their
hands around typically what is what is
one of these stocks mean well it's the
percentage of people who would pay an
extra ten dollars to have a smaller cell
phone the percentage of people who in
this case this could have been a PDA
without even cell phone capability so
turn your PDA smaller ten bucks save
three ounces and these are a whole list
of trade-offs and the simple thing you'd
put in these boxes is what percentage of
the people would have chosen those
things so we had MIT students trade and
this is what happened if you compare how
they answered surveys versus the stock
prices you got pretty good results this
is an r-squared of 0 point 59 it's
pretty decent and then you say well
these were students and they had filled
out these surveys what if we brought in
executives who had never done the survey
exercise and I had 241 students actually
fill out surveys on what they buy these
executives didn't fill out any surveys
they just traded stocks in about 30
minutes their results were even better
their results basically predicted what
happened in the survey r squared of 0
point 8 7 which is in my kind of
research is considered pretty good so
very happy I first attempted this and
the thing can can pretty much predict
people's preferences okay showed this
around the country people liked it a lot
but they said well what's so magical
about it it's you know the survey could
have given you the same information and
then I realized what makes stock markets
extraordinary is the volume of
information they can handle every day
right you know just today 5,000 plus
stocks got traded by millions of people
and every one of them has a price and
everyone now has an opinion of what it's
worth how does that happen well it
happens because in normal research
which everybody answers the same 20
questions basically you give them a
hundred questions they start getting
really upset so you give them 20
questions they answer them you collect
it and send it to the statisticians in
stocks what you can do is a little
different you can have one little group
of people trade or answer 20 questions
and another group answer a different 20
questions and so on and so forth think
about how each of you might have a stock
portfolio you need to be focused on 20
30 stocks but together you could trade
5,000 stocks so we're going to use that
principal where's an example where we
could have a whole lot of stocks where
we need that kind of capability well
smart phones turns out we sat down and
just made a list of all the things that
might make someone like a smartphone or
not and this is just a short list and we
eventually turned it into 56 stocks and
this was two years ago this was 2004 I
had the students in my classes look at
these things and on a vacation day when
they didn't have to be in school I
invited whoever wanted to to show up and
trade and 113 people showed up which was
about ninety percent of the people it
was the first test that they passed that
they were willing to do this because it
seemed fun and again for each one of
these the theoretical question the value
of the stock is what percentage of
people would have picked each one of
these things before we get to the result
of a stock game though we did two
surveys the first survey was would you
buy this thing for yourself and I had
117 people answer that question so these
are simple percentages a hundred means
everybody said they buy it zero means
nobody would buy it fifty percent means
half the people said they'd buy it half
would not okay and I'm going to compare
that against the second survey question
I asked which is what do you think
everybody else is going to say what
percentage of the people are going to
answer each of these things so the
question we raising here's our people
good at predicting what other people
will say this is sort of the wisdom of
the crowds idea if they're good they
will line up along this 45 degree line
so this is two years ago 117 students
and at UCLA and here was the result
turns out people are pretty darn good at
predicting what other people will answer
so this ability of you to take your own
preference and sort of project what
other people do not have bed but when
you run a regression through this you
see the lines not really 45 it's a
little tilted down so basically people
are a little conservative they're not as
Extreme as the people actually are did
the same exercise at Qualcomm last week
got really good results again this was
people predicting what the other
Qualcomm employees would say and roughly
the same regression line this tilting
means people are a little conservative
about how extreme their colleagues are
going to be and the are squares were
pretty good roughly 30 yeah roughly
seventy-five percent of the variability
and individual answers were explained by
people's guesses so there is wisdom of
crowds this is evidence of it now will
it work in a stock market okay by the
way before I leave this result I just
want you to know something the very best
person guessing so this is the averages
across all the people this is kind of
aggregating everybody the very first
guesser was around a point six and the
very worst was around a zero so some
people were really bad guessers the very
best was a point six when I aggregated
my improve let's see what happens in the
stock market before we leave the server
I just want you to know there's strong
evidence that each person was very
biased by their own preferences so if I
liked a feature I said other people will
like it and if I didn't like it I said
other people wouldn't like it and that
happened about eighty seven percent of
the time okay so basically eighty-seven
percent of the time eighty-seven percent
of the options people were biased by
their own preference the market is going
to correct this in a minute so here's
how we did this each person came to a
website slightly modified version of
what i showed you before it listed their
stock
and they became a member of a group they
didn't know that they were a member of a
group but behind the scenes each person
was assigned to a group and so they only
saw a subset of the 56 stocks they saw
20 in this case they learned a little
bit about the stocks they saw pictures
they could see graphs of how the prices
were moving and they saw a thing we call
the order book do you use an order book
in yours too okay so they could see
who's willing to buy and who's willing
to sell and what the supply and demand
for each stock was here's the
experimental design that allowed me to
have people only look at 20 stocks at a
time and yet trade 56 stocks there were
six groups of people and roughly 17 to
21 people in each group and they were
each trading 20 stocks and you see
there's some overlap I think this is an
innovation we kind of pioneered
realizing that the real stock market
works this way and we could apply it but
in our case we control who sees which
stocks right you could envision a case
where people could self select the 20
stocks their favorite ones the ones they
know the most about that might even be
better and here was the result in about
35-40 minutes we had an r-squared of 0
point five six we just randomly stopped
these games after about 30 to 40 minutes
and so people's stock trading very much
was in agreement with the surveys we had
done how about Qualcomm last week what
do you think better or worse any guesses
the students were all MBAs the Qualcomm
people were all sort of mainly technical
folks engineers and so on who happened
to know a lot about cellphones worse I
was positive it was going to be a lot
worse I was positive it was better it
was better and I want to tell you it
astonished me for a whole lot of reasons
they're not professional traders they
barely could figure out the interface in
the first 10 minutes and half the number
of people showed up so I had 113 traders
on the left
I only had 62 traders on the right on
the right instead of 56 stocks I had 64
stocks more stocks less time half the
number traders they did phenomenally
well and I just want to remind you the
best guesser in the entire group of 62
had an r-squared of point six one the
average r squared was 0 point three but
when they traded stocks it's almost
point seven it beats every single one of
them by the way I had as experiment my
daughter my sixteen-year-old daughter
tried to guess the value of these 64
stocks she got point five six she's in
the 95th percentile of Qualcomm
engineers and figuring out what people
want on smartphones alright so again to
good results you see by the way not only
are the r-squared is decent but they
line up on the 45 degree line which is
what we want to see here's a very
important question did they like it did
they like doing this they had no reason
to lie about this and the way I worded
the question was what did you like
better the stock trading or the survey
and this was stuff relevant to both
groups because they were studying this
the students liked it a whole lot more
eighty-five percent of the students said
they preferred it and the Qualcomm folks
eighty-nine percent of the people whoops
eighty-nine percent of the people
preferred it I would expect this result
to sustain people don't like doing
market research surveys they do like
competing in stock games that's
important so conclusion it's scalable
because of this experimental design it
cost less because you can do it quickly
and they like doing it you get good
response rates and they care about
giving you the truth because they want
to win not because they're trying to
tell you the truth because they want to
win a big big impact they learn from
each other by watching these prices they
learn from each other and we deal with a
lot of the biases that I showed you
earlier where you think everybody else
is going to like what you like and hate
what you hate the market mechanism
controls for that two problems this is
only for aggregate data I can't tell you
anything about each person and their
unique heterogeneous preferences
and I have to get people on the web at
the same time i'm going to show you two
other quick ideas but not get into them
in the same level of depth and then have
a few questions so fine we use the stock
mechanism to identify the important
attributes of a smartphone but what we
really want to know is how do they pick
a smartphone what actually happens when
they're trying to decide which internet
service provider which website to go to
which smartphone to buy so this is work
with three colleagues at MIT and a
couple of them are operations research
geniuses and the other two guys myself
and John Hauser are simple old marketing
guys here's the basic idea imagine
there's a fellow by the name of Alex
Bell and we want to know how he's going
to pick phones how does he buy a phone
well he might say you know phones could
have flip phone or not they could have a
mini keyboard or not could be this brand
could be that service provider could be
the size and they might assign values to
having each of those features and what
you see about these numbers is an
interesting thing which is that Alex is
basically making trade-offs and what do
I mean by that any one feature could be
offset by having any of two of the
others you see that with the numbers so
flip which is where 10 points can be
offset by any other two features so it
becomes a trade-off ok alternatively he
might assign points like this in which
case anyone feature will not offset the
others if I have a flip phone doesn't
matter if I have these four things
because you add up these four numbers
they don't cover 16 points it turns out
that for most decisions people are more
like this they use this kind of
mentality as a way to simplify their
life and eliminate lots of stuff and the
question is can you identify this turns
out to be a very difficult problem
that's been worked on for about 30 years
and hasn't been solved until now and
I'll tell you just briefly briefly the
the solution these are examples it's
just an inch
an example that coins in the United
States and actually everywhere else in
the world that we find our lexicographic
that means anyone coin is worth more
than the sum of all the coins below it
it's not a coincidence so if i showed
you plates of coins any combination of
single coins you could immediately put
them in order just by saying the ones
with the dollar coins always beat
anything with the silver dollars which
beat anything with the quarters and so
on okay and that's because of this two
to one relationship in the numbers right
exemplified by that now by the way the
same is true with currency so if I
showed you you know you went to bestbuy
or something or fries and you saw a
whole bunch of phones like that sitting
there and I told you pick one you'd go
nuts trying to rank order these phones
and that's the task we give people to do
typically in market research why would
you go nuts because there's a literally
a billion billion billion billion ways
to do it and so are we surprised that
when we give people that task they make
errors we shouldn't be surprised they
can't possibly keep track of all that
they're doing so they come up with these
simplifying tasks so the last two ideas
real quickly are one can we identify the
process of elimination and two is can we
keep people consistent to make a long
story short process of elimination would
look something like this I'll only
consider a flip phone it's got to have a
mini keyboard and it's got to be from
blackberry that eliminates most of the
phones and now you're down to two or
three maybe a pick one okay the question
is for each person that's going to be
different how do you identify it and
just to make it clear these are four
different people think of it as for
different people they all have they all
are in agreement spades are better than
hearts hearts are better than diamonds
and so on aces are always better than
Jack's and yet depending on how they
make that rule even though they're all
in agreement by the time they get to the
fifth card they've all diverged their
ranking their choice of which product to
pick would be different so it turns out
it's hard to identify this and the long
and the short of it is with the o our
geniuses we got to work with turns out
you can use a greedy algorithm to
solve this and some nifty computer
programming and that's what we did and
we tested it with the phones and it was
good all right it basically cut the time
dramatically that people needed and it
it predicted what people picked in
outside tests that we ran and it beat
the state of the art that's used in
market research today which is a thing
called hierarchical Bayes ranked logit
so what I want you to take away from
that is stock can get from 64 features
to the really important ones and this
technique can tell you exactly how each
person is wading through all the options
so for example it turns out with
students the number one way they pick a
smartphone is they reject the expensive
ones that's the first thing they do then
they pick the flip phone then they pick
the small size by that time you've
eliminated most of them the last idea
and actually would you rather hear about
the last idea or take a couple questions
now I leave it up to you guys how many
of you want the last idea how many of
you rather do questions all right you
lose so I'll be quick though I promise
the last idea is this how many of you
have ever used a navigation system in a
car you've used it you know how you
enter the street so you type the first
letter of the street name and then
there's like a little mini keyboard that
you're touching or clicking on and then
as soon as you type the first letter
most of the other letters get greyed out
or disappear and you're only left with a
few letters why is that well that's
because they're looking at a dictionary
of street names and they don't want you
to type you know qz if they know that
after q it's got to be a you right so
why let you make that error well you can
apply the same thing that's what
consistency is it says I'm going to
guide people to get right to the thing
they're interested in so imagine if
Google could implement a thing like this
somebody says I want to Maui vacation
and what you bring up on the screen is
exactly what they want to see in the
order they want to see it that's a hard
thing to do now you get really close
with your algorithms
but that's what I'm striving for so how
do I do it well what I do is I use the
fact that i'm only going to let them go
on real street names i'm only going to
let them give me answers that are
consistent with some known possible
answer that I'm looking for and I list
all the possible answers they might give
me and I guide them to one of those I
have a demo I can show it to you see
what this thing feels like it basically
eliminates things off the screen that
make no sense so I typically show people
something like phones or ipods or
whatever the product category is and
think of it this or how do i do it well
if I knew that Alex Bell had that
utility function right if I knew that
that's how he was waiting things then I
would know exactly how he'd answer all
my questions right if I knew this in
advance I know he'd pick this then this
then this well I list out all the
possible behaviors that someone might
have and then I only let them go down
one of those paths that's how
consistency works maybe if you see it
it'll make more sense and I basically
make a database and database doesn't
have to be 6 billion possibilities the
database could be there's a thousand
possible people types out there and I'm
going to find out which of the thousand
types you are and guide you down that
path turns out that in two or three
clicks I can nail it all right so the
payoff of doing this is that it's very
accurate it's super fast it costs a lot
less and people love it because it cuts
out the effort in answering your
questions just very dramatically reduced
effort in our experiment by
seventy-three percent it's also scalable
as your computer's get larger you can
handle more and more people types you
can learn every time they click you know
something more about them so even if
they stop Midway you know you've
narrowed things down and they only have
to tell you things they like they don't
have to
start answering all sorts of questions
about things they don't like so to wrap
up three ideas the stock method is going
to narrow things down the process of
elimination is going to keep you in the
game you got to know how not to get
eliminated and we can get people to be
consistent in their answers just by
having the computer guide them a little
bit I do have a little demo if you want
to just see how this thing works I'll
save that until you until you ask me to
see it and I guess now we can open it up
for a few questions yes okay the
question okay so the question the
question was what are the people
actually trading in the stock game what
their trading is a stock that I've
defined for them specifically it
represents the percentage of people so
it's a number between zero and a hundred
percent percentage of people that picked
a certain option so let's say you wanted
to know what percentage of people prefer
a metallic blue cell phone well I showed
people questions like metallic blue cell
phone pink cell phone green silver gold
and black there's six choices everybody
answered the question I happen to know
what percentage each one picked they
don't know that they only know which one
they picked and they have to basically
guess what percentage of people picked a
metallic blue cell phone the real number
is something like I don't know eight ten
percent that stock price should converge
to about eight or ten dollars and it
does it does with about seventy percent
accuracy in 30 minutes or less is it
still confusing let me tell you defining
the stocks is the thing that took me the
longest to get my hands around
ok so when you start out the game let's
see if I can get back to the user
interface to show you
when you start out the game you see a
portfolio of stocks these are these 0 to
100 sorts of things so it's hard to read
from back there but the first one says
cell network Nextel the second one is
cell network sprint so there are four
cell networks Nextel sprint singular and
Verizon and you start out the game with
a hundred shares of each of those with
nope no price we don't know what the
price is there blank prices you own a
hundred shares of each let me just ask
you do you have a cell phone what
network is it on which one singular ok
so singular is the third one there what
percentage of the people in the room
would you guess ah run singular thirty
percent now we could actually find out
right now but the astonishing thing is
without finding out just playing the
game in this room I could make a pretty
good guess as to what percentage of you
have singular just because you each know
which one you've got and you have a
expectation of what like you just heard
thirty percent what's your name again so
is it Robby so Robbie's expectation of
all of you is that thirty percent of you
is singular he should believe in his
heart that that stock is worth thirty
dollars if the price in the market is 50
what's Robbie going to do what should he
do he should sell sell sell how these
suckers they think it's worth fifty i
know it's worth thirty he'll sell that
will put downward pressure on the price
some of you think oh no no i happen to
know that at Google sixty percent of the
people use singular you're going to be
by by buying and that's exactly what
happens and in fact the way this works
is a transaction only occurs if one of
you is willing to buy and another one of
you is willing to sell I have no market
makers which really makes this hard
because 30 minutes 60 people it's hard
to get them to trade enough but they do
and I give them huge rewards I walk down
to Qualcomm with six baseball caps
UCLA baseball caps that's what they were
playing for now then after the surveys
over you ask well why were you working
so hard because they're really going
crazy and they're trying to win you know
pride I want to be you know can you
imagine saying I beat all the other
Googlers at the stock game what do you
do Bo for your winners do they get
anything thousand dollars alright so
just so you know these guys are going to
kill me you don't need to give him
anything they'll play just as hard for
nothing my students came in I've done it
4-0 I've done it for fifty dollars and
I've done for serious money no
difference people like winning now in
the long run especially within a company
you need to compensate people maybe it
gets into your reviews if you're a good
player or you give him the thousand
bucks because you want him to play a lot
he wanted to come every time in play and
and they deserved a thousand because
they're giving great information by
playing this game yes
first one is however the results change
as the number of people has detective
people protecting become more definite
to me taking people that they are trying
to collect so is it with people from
that's a very insightful question
because nothing about what we've done
here says that you have to be predicting
what the other traders prefer personally
it could be our consensus view of what
Joe Bloggs in the middle of this you
know country will buy and the key issue
is do those people have insight do the
traders have insight about the the group
most of my experiments are about one
group predicting people similar to
themselves because I think that then I'm
pretty sure they have insight about
themselves but I've done tests where
people who've never met you know people
are 30 40 years older have never met the
original group never took the study that
the original group did and just jump in
and you saw one of those where the
executives did it for the MBA students
and their r squared was the highest I've
ever got enough point eight seven so my
answer would be as long as they have
insight the more they can learn about
people about the Preferences about the
details of the products the likelier you
are the more likely you are to get good
results okay so my second question was
about you're saying that the results are
better the more the people want to win
so can you potentially look at the
behavior of the people that are trading
and adjust it based on you can't more
from the people who are doing higher
volume trading or other characters like
that would you get better results so
that little can of worms you've just
opened is one of my favorites can I tell
you anything about a person based on how
well they trade how intensely they trade
and most importantly of all whether they
win can I say for example if you're a
winner oh you have greater insight about
this market than other people the answer
is every test we've run so far the
answer's no
right I don't know why that is and I
asked the people who win these games
what did you exactly do to come out ten
percent better than anybody else in the
room and they they always answer oh I
found this one stock that was being
neglected you know the market said it
was worth five dollars which means five
percent but in fact I really thought it
was worth at least ten percent and I
just bought it like crazy and I sold out
everything else and went whole hog on
this one stock so yeah that person had
insight about that one stock but do they
have insight about the other 63 answer
no you can actually test for it
statistically so I the answers I cannot
tell you anything about which people
drive the overall game what I can tell
you is which people drive each stock and
they are what we were called the
marginal traitor the marginal trader is
the person who's willing to buy or sell
in significant volumes whenever that
price is off of the number they believe
to be true and they have confidence in
that number and they drive the price
right and those people self select stock
buy stock they know about a particular
feature but I have not been able to tell
you you know take all your google folks
and and have them trade for like a year
and then now you can identify your
hundred best people who should always
trade from now on it doesn't work at
least i have not found that result yet
been looking for it haven't found it
real quick question before we wrap up
how many of you though you got to close
your eyes for a second how many of you
love playing these google stock games
the way they are now how many of you
don't like it so much how many of you
are afraid to anti raise your hand at
the moment okay so we didn't get any
feedback on this you could probably run
a stock game to find out what people
think of the stock game that would be
yes are you familiar with a field of
combinatorics called design of
experiments absolutely so it seems that
that overlapping thing that you were
doing is is just that that's true and
it's the first time that I'm aware
that it was applied to this field ah I
see but it was sitting there low-hanging
fruit for the right brother plucking and
it's perfect because you know here's my
theory as to why nobody's ever done it
before in the real stock market such a
thing would be unacceptable you know we
we use the real stock market as sort of
the mental model for what we're doing
here in the real stock market you can't
tell people you you must own these and
you can't own those but this is a game
so no problem and in fact I've been
thinking long and hard about that
experimental design and what
possibilities it might offer it offers
incredibly exciting opportunities let me
just give you a few that I've thought of
one you could run the same stock market
15 times simultaneously and compare the
results if you if you you know you want
to know how confident am I in my results
there's just multiple versions of the
same stock and you just assign different
ones to different groups but they're all
connected by some stocks that market
will equilibrate and you'll get 15
repetitions of the same experiment
that's one example second example what
if you want to know how much will people
pay and I actually ran this experiment
in qualcomm they don't know it yet but I
did you offer a feature each of these
features typically comes with a price
tag right I say for example blackberry
7100 T that's the little cute blackberry
that they've slimmed down now I show it
at two hundred ninety nine dollars well
what if I want to get a demand curve a
demand function to know how
price-sensitive our people about this I
just offer seven versions of that stock
and I just changed that price I'll get
seven numbers back and I can plot a
demand curve those are just two examples
you could run multiple versions you
could run price sensitivity you can do
all sorts of stuff with experimental
design applied to stock market I wasn't
sure that my computer guys in Germany
could figure out how to assign an
individual person to an individual set
of stocks where the set of stocks was
part of a universe that's tradable by
everybody turns out they did it in a day
so I kind of have a feeling you guys
might be able to do that with a little
work I don't know but I think that's the
future that makes it infinitely scalable
you just give me more traders I can
handle more questions oh one last thing
oh yeah sorry so you would say design of
experiments it could probably be useful
at Google I've been trying to convince
people of this for like months but
nobody is not only can I generally be
useful but it's outrageously useful for
this uh-huh look at it this thing's
right did I just say the wrong thing no
so look at it this way third possibility
you could do you could run 10 markets
simultaneously right the way most people
would run 10 markets so what's a typical
market bow that you got what's the last
market you guys ran here without
disclosing anything too sensitive yeah
oh sorry I'll repeat it
when will gmail go out of beta so a
certain large operating system company
asked exactly that same question about a
piece of software of which i'm not aware
and they offered stocks two months early
one month early on time one month late
two months late three months late all
the way up to six months late and of
course six months late was the high
price stock and the product shipped six
months late okay that was that's public
information because it was presented at
a conference in New Jersey you could
have run that conference that stock game
simultaneously with who's going to win
the World Cup using experimental design
there's no reason that you have to run
one for that another one for world cup
soccer and another one for smartphone
features just and and the participants
you could even say well which market do
are you interested in in a World Cup
timeliness of a piece of software or
smartphones they pick one and they join
the group where they see those stocks
but in fact all the stocks are being
traded like the five thousand wilshire
5000 stocks and the reason that's
important you might say well why what's
the benefit of that is the equilibrium
across all the stocks that's a key
element here it's the fact that some
people holding certain stocks here are
trading with other groups that hold
similar stocks and so the price
equilibrium happens across all the
stocks right that's I mean try to
imagine a world where high tech
companies had their own stock market and
people who held those stocks could not
buy or sell you know dow jones type
stocks or or you know food stocks
agriculture or international each market
can't can't hold multiple ones that
would not produce as good in equilibrium
so that's why this design of experiments
is important I feel that that particular
thing alone was was an exciting
discovery but when we added a couple
other things like the notion of breaking
a product down into little features that
that was sort of unusual that hasn't
been done as far as I know and it all
seems to be working
at least so far I'd love to do this on a
larger scale using either you guys or
your you know some beta site and prove
that it works with real people out in
the world that's the one thing we
haven't quite done yet we've done it
with executives and companies we've done
it with students be nice to test it with
real real folks see if they could learn
how to trade and so on okay well thank
you very much oh wait one more questions
is this a system you a licensing or
setting or I working with some people in
the group I mean in Google million
dollars a copy take it over
unfortunately we academics are kind of
dumb about this stuff everything that I
do is I give away pretty much the piece
of software that i'm using i've used now
two or three pieces of software i'm not
really you know i'm agnostic about the
software as long as it's a database
quick database that trades between
people it's fine with me the colleagues
in germany who wrote this particular one
are thinking about licensing it and my
expectation is that sometime within the
next year or two a Google or Yahoo or
some small player is going to make this
just the totally available it won't be a
big deal it'll be you know how putting a
website up used to be a big deal and now
it's not it's going to be like that the
real action here is not going to be the
software that allows trading it's going
to be who can figure out how to define
stocks cleverly and teach people how to
trade and get people to come and do it
that's that's going to be the challenge
not the underlying software did you guys
soom you wrote your own software here to
do the trading and it takes a little
effort to do it and have an i use a
database of some sort in the background
i assume you need a database it's got to
be able to do quick transactions to
match people up that's about it so yeah
think of it as free and you guys are
probably in the best position to build a
platform where companies and individuals
around the world could do this you know
how many stocks do you want to set up 52
okay type the names in download some
pictures okay you're ready to trade and
then they just go run their trading
just give me URL send everybody to the
URL have them login and you're ready to
roll I do these games by the way in
about from the moment we thought of the
Qualcomm one to the time we ran it was a
matter of a few weeks the actual time
involved was on the order of three four
days of effort I want to get that down
to 10 or 15 minutes of effort but it's
not that hard to do it's the easiest
piece of market research I ever do is
are these games okay any more questions
all right well it's been a real honor
honestly to be here and I hope I get to
come back and talk to you about other
stuff in the future thanks so much for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
