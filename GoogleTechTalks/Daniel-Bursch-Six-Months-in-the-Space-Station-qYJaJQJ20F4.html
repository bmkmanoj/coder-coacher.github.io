yesterday today we have Daniel burisch a
NASA astronaut joining us here at Google
to tell us about his fascinating stay at
the International Space Station I'm
really interested about what he has to
tell us about this because one of my
interests is Mars exploration and
possible human missions to Mars and one
of the elements of those missions will
first certainly be a six-month trip to
Mars
so Daniel brush had three space shuttle
flights and this stay in in the
International Space Station he has a
long and distinguished career at NASA
and I'm not going to read you know like
this long resume that you may have sent
a day at the Tech Talk announcement so
please give give a hand to daniel brush
and welcome Thank You Boris thank you
thank thank you very much I'll first
start with the disclaimer the bad news
is is I had to take vacation to come up
here but the good news is I got to I got
to use the Google dress code not my
normal dress code and also I'll try to
be as Frank as possible as I can during
the talk because one of the biggest
challenges I think of long-duration
Space Flight is as are the psychological
challenges to kind of set a seed right
now is is think about for the next six
months never getting out of your cubicle
or out of a Winnebago if you went out
for a long trip so and with two other
people in the same can with two other
people so that just sets the stage for
some of the challenges that we had up
there most of my talk today will focus
on the six and a half month the half
becomes important especially to my
spouse who reminds me that it wasn't
just six months it was six and a half
months I was away from home but on my
last mission the space which took place
from December 2001 the June of 2002 this
is a mission patch that describes that
at the top there if any of you govern
eat at Purdue ski it's it's Russian it's
in the Cyrillic letters for a URI on a
free anko he was our commander for
expedition 4 and then my name on the
right and Carl walked on the left part
one of the things I had to do was learn
Russian when I started training in 1997
didn't launch till 2001 but guess what
the Russians have their own acronyms ISS
on the left their international space
station and and it's not MKC it's
actually MKS on the right for mesh do
not o deny accustom each a sky estancia
so as part of the deal
Yuri learned English as well as he could
and Carl and I learned Russian as well
as we could and and so but overall went
very well beef and again I'm here
representing dan burisch myself I do
work for currently I work for the
Aerospace Corporation and they support a
chair position at the Naval Postgraduate
School which leads me into the to the
next slide
some of you may know that captain
Michael Smith and Commander Willie
McCool
they were both pilots on space shuttles
Mike Smith was a pilot on space shuttle
Challenger and Willie McCool on space
shuttle Columbia most people don't know
it that the Naval Postgraduate School
that's not too far away
what 7080 miles away from here has
graduated more astronauts basically
where astronauts have become graduates
from the Naval Postgraduate School have
become astronauts than any other
graduate school in the world and two of
those did perished in the space shuttle
accidents what I'm trying to do is to
collect funds and it for an award a
student award in honor of Captain Mike
Smith and Willie McCool and I have the
information here I'll repeat it later
but if you choose to contribute the
information is there it might be easiest
just to call the number of the eight
three one six five six two three three
nine
but diaval I saw is important throughout
my career I've been very fortunate had
maybe a few close calls either in the
Navy or with NASA but there's a lot of
people who haven't made it and I thought
it was important to remember both Mike
Smith and Willie McCool so with that
here was our crew of three on the
International Space Station I say we
were lucky because we had a crew of
three do you recall after Columbia we
couldn't get enough astronauts up and
back actually enough food and water and
clothing to International Space Station
after the Columbia accident so they went
down to a crew of two for a period of
time but I say we were lucky because as
a parent I remember always hearing never
let your kids play in threes
and so we're a crew of three on space
station I started scratching my head so
but and I'll talk a little bit about
that how that comes into play my
recommendation for any mission to Mars
make the crew as large as possible okay
and but so this is unusual to have a
crew of only males we happen to be all
military on the left at the time I was
active duty Navy I was a naval flight
officer
as they affectionately call in use : in
some of the fighter airplanes I was a
give a guy in the back but I was
actually a Gor a guy on the right
because I flew in an aircraft called the
a-6 intruder then Karl waltz on the
right he was a flight test engineer for
the Air Force and in URI on a Franco era
Air Force pilot Yuri had flown I once
before but was on Mir Space Station so
he already had a six-month deployment
under his belt launching in the space
shuttle
fully fueled weighs about four and a
half million pounds produces about seven
million pounds of thrust allows us to
accelerate of course my wife gives me a
hard time because when people say well
Dan what's it feel like when you launch
in the space shuttle and I always say
well my experience of launching off the
aircraft carrier it just felt like a
catapult launch off the aircraft carrier
it just lasted a lot longer and my wife
goes yeah and most people know what that
feels like but that's what it felt like
to me it felt like launching off the
aircraft carrier instead of going 0 to
150 miles an hour so in two-and-a-half
seconds we went from zero to 17,500
miles an hour in eight and a half
minutes it just keeps going going and
going and we celebrate fairly rapidly
this was the first time I sat in the mid
mid decks or lower portion in the
shuttle so I had no outside viewing no
window close by and so it'll actually
allowed me to feel if you remember the
Space Shuttle when it launches it
actually rolls rather quickly once it
clears the launch tower it rolls rather
quickly and I remember my previous
launches I was so focused on the
instruments I almost never saw that roll
or felt the roll but just sitting in the
mid-deck where all I had was to feel the
acceleration I could actually then feel
feel the roll when we went off the
launch pad those those boosters last for
two minutes and then they fall off it
sounds like a big thud when that when
they come off and the acceleration
actually decreases to less than one G so
you start on the launch pad on your back
feeling 1g you accelerate to up to two
and a half G's and then at two minutes
it goes back down
less than a G it gets very smooth first
stage is very rough there's a lot of
vibration there's so much vibration that
is really hard to even read the
instruments in in front of you if you're
on the on the flight deck so that's why
we really rely on the on the ground to
help us help us out with any any
problems there and then once you lose
the solid rocket boosters it's almost
like an electric drive it's very very
smooth
this was our this was our holiday photo
in space we decided to go with the
Russian Russian where for this photo
they have about half of our food was was
Russian half of our some I wouldn't say
quite half of our clothing was Russian
but part of the many international
agreements I had to go on before we flew
in space and this happened to be in the
Russian segment and a lot of the
psychologists the Russian psychologists
had had more experience with
long-duration flight with with the
Russian Mir program and they told us
that some of the challenges that they
told us to watch out actually this was
part of our training they said around
the three month or four month timeframe
look out for signs of depression in your
crewmates and this is like several
months before I'm flying and I'm going
what am I getting into here okay so but
it was good I mean they but actually for
me the toughest part of the flight was
just at the beginning because around the
holidays away from my really away from
my family and incidentally when I went
off in into before I left Houston
Houston to go to Florida I remember
trying to sneak out of the house at like
6:00 in the morning because I knew my
five-year-old then was having a really
tough time with me leaving and he kind
of caught on that dad was going to be
leaving for a while so I tried to sneak
out of the house at 6:00 in the morning
but sure enough he wakes up and so I'm
trying to sneak out of the house at 6:00
in the morning with my with my
five-year-old tugging on my leg begging
me not to leave so as a parent that was
hard no it was hard doing that so this
was our Christmas photo a tough time but
there were a lot at that time in in late
2001 there were a lot of people that
were deployed and in service of our
country so it was real easy for me to to
say okay I'm okay nobody's at least
nobody shooting at us or
there might be stuff out there that I
don't know about but that but at least
nobody's shooting at us and in Space
Station when we orbit in space shuttle
or Space Station
I say we're only about 200 nautical
miles or so above the surface of the
planet and if you know that I believe
that the diameter of the earth is on the
order of about 7,000 nautical miles so
if you think about it if you're only 200
nautical miles above the surface we
really are kind of skimming over the
surface this is kind of what a view
looks like if using a probably about I
don't know a 400 millimeter lens maybe a
little bit less to zoom in on on the
ground but this is the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida and you can see that
the two launch pads there in the middle
of the picture 39 a and B that that
originally launched the Saturn Rockets
and then in the lower left here you can
see the shuttle landing facility where
the shuttle likes to land because then
most of the time it's saved some money
in processing I'd been in orbit about
two months and Yuri Yuri was a good
commander he pretty much let us do our
thing as far as I'm sure everybody no
matter where you work you know there's
certain types of bosses you like or
dislike but you know Yuri was was good
he let us be in charge of our
experiments our projects let us do them
and then on occasion if he felt he
needed to you know get an update he
would ask for it one time I think he
felt like I just been working inside too
often and so he grabbed me and he pulled
me towards a different window most of
our windows on Space Station looked
towards the earth their nadir they look
towards the earth so to get a view of a
sunset or sunrise and we see this view
every 45 minutes we go around the earth
maybe 90 minutes see this view about 40
every 45 minutes and quite honestly I
don't even know if this is a sunset or a
sunrise they look so you see so many of
them if you're watching for it so he
pulled me towards a window that happened
to look towards the horizon and it was
just one of those moments he you know he
felt like you know his his crew member
needed a little bit of time off and and
just look at the sunset so after about
15 seconds he who said good ok now go
back to work so
this is this was an experiment in
testosterone levels to see if they stay
the same in orbit next note note was an
accident this was after this was after
our first spacewalk I had done probably
nine years of training in a u.s. suit to
do a spacewalk my first spacewalk
happened to be in a Russian suit and and
this isn't just stylish Russian evening
wear this is actually these this is an
undergarment that we wear inside the
suit in the next picture you'll see what
the spacesuit looks like but in space as
as you know we don't have any free
convection hot air doesn't rise in space
so you do have forced convection where
you force a fluid or air around and then
you can get some cooling and then we
have conduction so what's difficult to
see here but there's thousands of feet
of plastic tubing throughout that suit
and that's what cools us inside the suit
because believe it or not even though
the temperatures get very cold and very
hot in space inside the suit it's your
own heat that you have to get rid of as
you're working in the suit so that's
taken away by those tubes that that that
go around that that stylish underwear
there I used to say I need to take this
slide out of this presentation but I
came up with something different today
so this is a Russian suit the Russian
suit works at a little bit higher
pressure I know there's probably some
scuba divers in the audience but for
when we go on a spacewalk we have we
have that the risk of decompression
sickness when we go on a spacewalk
because we go from about 14 pounds per
square inch a sea-level atmosphere
inside space station to where in this
suit it works just over five pounds per
square inch and the u.s. suit works even
lower at four pounds per square inch so
the advantage of working in a higher
pressure suit is that you can get out
the hatch a little bit earlier you don't
have to pre breathe as long you don't
have to scrub the nitrogen doesn't take
as long to scrub the nitrogen out of
your bloodstream when you go the
challenge though working in a higher
pressure suit is then you're working
against the pressure with your gloves
it's also not your you're not going to
go out and fix the Hubble Space
Telescope with this spacesuit however if
you need to get out fix something a
rough operation in a hurry you can do it
in this suit
the other thing about this suit is kind
of one size fits all
I don't do real alone and one size fits
all anything but and I actually had
probably about that much room between
the back of the suit and my back so it
was it's difficult to work in this suit
however just like anything else
you'll learn to work with it and you
spent many many hours of training to
work in it this is inside the soyuz
capsule the Soyuz capsule I went up
Space Shuttle Endeavor took us up in
December dropped us off and then they
left after seven days and then the three
of us were left on onboard space station
the Soyuz capsule becomes our lifeboat
when we're up there so if something were
to happen where we couldn't save space
station we had to get to the ground or
we had some medical emergency we could
get back quickly with the Soyuz that
also brings up the issue of going on to
Mars if you have a medical emergency on
the way to Mars there could be a point
where you're not going to get back for
several months it's just a little
mechanics it's going to be a long time
so that's another big thing to think
about too if people have a serious
enough problem to where you know they
may not make it for the mission then you
know you have some choices to make on
that so that'll be that'll be a
challenge as well but the Soyuz there's
not a whole lot of room inside of that
but you know when my size I felt pretty
comfortable inside there you probably
recognize this picture you see the Bay
Area
this was taken probably about the
march/april timeframe of 2002 and this
is a little bit this is probably taken
with a 50 millimeter lens so this is
probably if you took your you know 50
millimeter SLR camera and took it took a
picture and then if I get my geography
right I guess you know 101 probably
comes up this way and we're probably
Google maybe around this this area I
know just past so I'm pretty sure this
is Moffett or Ames here so just
close to here this is taken at the same
time still with a color basically as a
digital camera but it's supposed to be a
color picture tough to tell that just
with the Sun blooming out but some of
the things that you can see with with
with the picture are some of the the
waves coming off the pylons if you can
see the the bay bridge in the lower
center of the picture you see Treasure
Island and Alcatraz is north of that I
see the Bay Bridge up to the top but
just the things when you get the Sun
angle at the right angle the things that
you can see just when you look down at
the ocean here's a Monterey Bay Naval
Postgraduate School is located right
about here when I first got that picture
back if some of you know the geography
know that the right there is a Salinas
Valley and when I first looked at this
picture I was still in Houston and I
thought well this must be early morning
or late afternoon with maybe some fog
settling in and and after living there
several years now I know that that can
be any time of the day that fog rolls in
that area it's nice to come up with the
get an increase of 20 degrees or so to
come up here this is on the East Coast
and right now you're probably thinking
what this guy do through his whole
mission you just take pictures the whole
time well what I found that enough
experience of giving these talks is that
people really are interested and mostly
as far as visual to see what it what it
looks like from Earth most of the time
everybody would set little timers if the
ground would say we really want you to
get a picture of Patagonia because the
weather is clear at the time so
everybody would set their little timers
and so you hear this timer go off and
the first question would be whose timer
is that you know and then you try to
find a window and then get your camera
ready and and take the picture but this
happens beyond the East Coast the the
pictures kind of rotated so north is on
the right side of the picture any
guesses where this might be yeah you'd
have to be from from the Norfolk area
but this is actually entrance to the
Chesapeake Bay if any you've been over
the Bay bridge-tunnel it's a comedy
I think it's about 22 miles long
combination of a bridge and tunnels over
the the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay
there you see the Delmarva Peninsula to
the to the lower right-hand part of the
picture and other things that you can
see just from the photo again you can
even see ship wakes from from that
altitude Space Station when it's on
orbit actually loses about 200 meters
everyday in altitude so it does have to
make it up and most of the drag comes
from the solar panels because even
though it is technically a vacuum up
there there are still molecules that
eventually slow down or bring the
aircraft the spacecraft lower so every
so often they do have to boost up the
orbit because it continually decays just
because of all the drag and it's only
gonna get worse because of the the
increase the solar number solar arrays
onboard storage on Space Station is a
lot like storage here in California
there's not a whole lot of it unless you
want to pay for it but so here's the
airlock on board that this is the u.s.
airlock onboard space station when it's
not being used it becomes a closet but
then if you want to use it as an airlock
what do you have to do you have to move
all your stuff out so that's what we did
a few times a lot of people say well why
do you have why'd you have two kinds of
suits on Space Station why do you have a
Russian suit in a Russian airlock and a
u.s. suit and the u.s. airlock actually
what one of the things I've found is
through international cooperation a lot
of times you get built in redundancy
because if you have people that are that
achieve are trying to achieve the same
mission let's say to go on a spacewalk
they have similar equipment but they've
been designed differently so if you have
some generic fault with some of the
equipment you can use the other
companies or other countries equipment
to achieve to achieve your goal so I
think the one good things about
International Cooperation is not only
just the the obvious benefits of working
with other people throughout the world
but also you get some built-in
redundancy with your equipment
so this was after we cleared everything
out my second spacewalk was actually in
the u.s. suit us suit a bit more
expensive than the Russian suit it is
more custom fit however it also gives
you a bit more dexterity works at a
lower pressure but you know there's
trade-offs with everything it takes us a
little bit longer maybe a couple more
hours to get out the hatch so if you
needed to get out in a hurry you might
choose one suit over the other but they
did the two suits did give us some
built-in redundancy and actually after
Columbia I mean if you know if you knew
it but most of the spacewalks were done
in Russian suits because they were just
designed to be on orbit a longer time
albeit you couldn't do have do the type
of tasks that you would want to do who
are you if you needed the dexterity to
do it different philosophies and using
the suits - part of the training process
is that if I wanted to use the Russian
suit the Orlan
it was the Russian trainers and the
Russian doctors that had to certify me
to use the suit so that was again part
of the international agreement so that
and there were different protocols
because a protocol meaning if you go out
in the u.s. suit we had a constant
tether it was like tether reel with a
wire that was always attached to you the
Russians don't do it that way they have
to - tethers with hooks that you would
manually change as you as you go along
and always using your hands to hold on
and that took some use - you almost had
to make a mindset of when you're
training in one suit versus the other
you know in some cases you could just
let go with the u.s. suit not advisable
but you could they trusting that wire
tether and and I remember coming back in
the Russian suit one time it was at
after that Russian spacewalk I was about
oh I don't know about five feet from the
hatch so I wasn't very far from going
back to the end of the hatch but I moved
my tether one of my tethers and I
reached back to grab my other tether and
it was floating free so at that point I
think on the ground they saw my heart
rate go up a little bit but anyways but
that was that was a close call
unfortunately nothing nothing happened
with that
this is inside the u.s. laboratory on
space station they have terms they say
the US segment of the Russian segment at
the end of this year they're supposed to
launch the ISA the Columbus module up to
International Space Station now be a big
step forward for the International
partners but inside space station it's
fairly roomy the amount of you know I
speak in terms of square foot big square
footage because that's probably what
people can relate to as far as sizes but
I would say the equivalent was about the
equivalent of maybe a 1200 square foot
home but it's kind of you know if you
can think of it's all kind of in
hallways kind of the configuration now
it felt bigger than that because of
course we're floating free and we can
use you know the eight or nine feet
above us you know freely and float
around and sometimes you could actually
even float upside down close your eyes
and then open your eyes and and make
your brain think that the floor is now
the ceiling and the ceiling is a floor
and sometimes just for you know the
things we do for fun on Space Station
you know one of the things I did for fun
on Space Station is normally you just
you have you're a creature of habit you
know I'm sure everybody when they come
to work probably has a stairwell a way
that they get to work you know the
shortest distance may be or it goes by
one of your favorite cafeteria well in
Space Station we seem to always
translate down you know along the floor
because for whatever reason that felt
more comfortable and then about halfway
through the mission I said well I'm
gonna start translating on the ceiling
and see what that feels like and it was
really strange because all of a sudden I
was like wow I didn't know that was
there I mean you'd think that living in
this small area you'd figure that out
but just the the the tricks that you're
that your mind plays on you so if you
think about it again three people in the
same I say can now it's a very
complicated can and complex and it was
it was very comfortable and everything
but again it's working with two other
people in very close quarters for a long
time this was robotic workstation the
Canadians built the robot arm that's on
space station they also built the robot
arm that that's on the space shuttle and
in fact if Columbia had the robot arm
installed one of the reasons why club
couldn't inspect it with a robot arm is
that they took it off for weight savings
they saved several hundred pounds by
taking off the robot arm one of the
mistakes now they always fly the robot
arm because you can use it to inspect
other areas around around the space
shuttle one of the differences on
operating the robot arm on space station
though was that we didn't have any
direct viewing on the space shuttle you
kind of have the back window to look out
over the cargo bay or payload Bay and
you can fly the arm many times just
looking at it directly whereas here we
had we had to use only cameras and you
don't get that three-dimensional type
feeling when you're flying it so that
that was a that was one of the
challenges of learning how to fly that
robot arm this is an abandoned copper
mine in in Ajo Arizona
I still believe it's abandoned but one
of the the reason I put this slide in
here is you see the shadowing effects on
the ground a lot of times you'd look at
the ground and you'd try to pick out
let's say a valley or a mountain and
sometimes you look down and you're not
quite sure okay where is the valley
where's the mountain if you're trying to
get a picture of something in just some
of the effects that shadowing does when
you're trying to see some of these
features
here's anybody recognize that
yeah San Diego Coronado most of the time
the cities tend to have that grayish
look to it and in fact whole continents
tend to have kind of a color their own
color so if you're up there long enough
and you see it you know you could look
out the window and without even looking
at let's say a world map that we had on
a computer you could actually on a
laptop you could actually just look out
and see the color and go okay that must
be Australia but and a close-up a
Coronado now this is a little bit fuzzy
and I'm gonna blame it on going the five
miles a second you know there's 17,500
miles an hour is equivalent about five
miles a second so when you're trying to
take a picture I think this was it like
with a 800 millimeter lens you know it
wasn't the camera you know wasn't the
you know the photographer's fault of
course must have been just that five
miles a second where you actually have
to kind of move the camera you know
rotate it a little bit as you're taking
that picture
this is in the southwest part of South
America an area called Patagonia I
talked briefly about it before but it
was ad time usually this area is just
covered with clouds and they can't take
pictures of the area but there are
several glaciers in this area and they
told us the ground asks us hey when you
when you pass over that can you take as
many pictures as you can just to try to
document the the size of the glaciers
and latest I've heard is that the
glaciers are receding as somewhat of an
alarming rate one of the one of the
interesting things that I really didn't
notice at the time but after you look at
the picture you look at the lower right
and you go well that glacier looks like
it's breaking up a lot differently than
the glacier up at the top of the middle
top of the photo and the only thing I
can surmise is that that's enclosed
water right there it's probably cooler
colder water and the glacier isn't
breaking off as quickly as the one the
lower right which probably has some
entry into the into the ocean access to
the ocean I call this glacier art just
eventually taking the taking these
pictures and and again we didn't spend
all of our time in the window and
actually it was probably less than 1% of
our time working up there it was a
combination of either things broke your
you had experiments to work on if you're
getting ready for robotics you had to do
some things to prepare for that if
you're getting ready for a spacewalk you
had to prepare for that a lot of times
we ended up doing a spacewalk that
really wasn't planned during our mission
and they actually sent up the procedures
and we were able to use basically a
virtual-reality type of a 3d picture on
a laptop to help train us for that
spacewalk here's in I believe this is in
Guatemala they want us to take a picture
of a volcano that seemed to show some
activity
it was cloud covered at the time but a
lot of times you look out the window and
you see contrast and you say well that
looks interesting so you go ahead and
you take a picture of that and at the
center of the picture apparently was a
volcano they had already erupted
probably the year before and then what
you see the remnants of after many rains
the
the all the ash flows down and chokes
the rivers that come down from that
volcano it looked like it was having
some some smoke up there some burning
one of the challenges while I was up
there was before I went on this and I'll
call it a deployment
I'd been on in the Navy and gone on
several deployments on aircraft carriers
and in larger ships and I felt well the
deployments going to be no different
than being on a ship in the Navy well it
was much different because it's almost
like go on a deployment in the Navy and
never getting out of your stateroom I
mean you're with the same people you
couldn't go to flight deck go for a run
exercise was important it was a time
where you could have kind of by yourself
and and not only feel you know
physically good but mentally it was a
time kind of to recharge your batteries
and just the aspect of just knowing that
you know you weren't that far from home
200 miles isn't that far but to get home
is pretty is a pretty big event to do
that so that was one of the biggest
differences of a deployment let's say in
for me in the Navy versus deploying on
the International Space Station this
happens to be Key West of Florida the
Navy for some reason seems to get some
pretty good pretty good places
throughout the world I guess they always
have to be near water so one of the
challenges one of the things I found was
that not only before you fly in space I
mean you have you have your list what
was a OKR did you say four four okrs
everybody has our ok ours you have your
goals you know you want to achieve these
things at Google I had my own list of
goals of course I wanted to you know
bottom line my wife said you have to
come home safely or don't you know don't
bother coming home then the figure that
went out but and and so one of the kind
of my own kind of goal that came up with
is I wanted to take a picture of certain
spots around the world and so this
happens to be the Naval Academy if you
look in the top center of the picture
there Naval Academy a lot of the playing
fields are built on on the landfill that
goes out in the Severn River and out
into the Chesapeake Bay
so one of my goals I said I want to try
to take a picture of every place I've
been in the Navy and that was just like
one of these personal goals had had
really it was hard to describe other
than it was something that I knew I had
control over because every minute of
every day on orbit the ground pretty
much controlled our schedule we would
check the laptop computer it had the
schedule this is what we're supposed to
be doing we had a little bit of leeway
but for the most part everything else
was controlled so the ability on a long
mission to just come up with something
only you wanted to do you didn't have to
tell anybody didn't have to get approved
you didn't have to have a peer review
look at it and do all these things you
just you just did it and that was
important for me psychologically just
being being in an environment that's
kind of isolated and but with with other
people but somewhat of an isolated
environment
here's Patuxent River Maryland that's
where the Navy test pilot school is I
went through not as a pilot but as a as
a test flight officer as enable as a
navigator at that school that was
actually where I first got interested in
the astronaut program because I guess
everybody likes to do field trips and as
part of the school we did a we did a
trip to the Johnson Space Center talked
to some astronauts there's all different
kinds of astronauts we have astronauts
never been in the military most of the
pilots have been in the military we have
mission specialists that some have been
the military most have not been in the
military but that was where I ended up
finding out about I could become a
mission specialist with with my
background and actually the the
requirement to be a mission specialist
is you have to have a bachelor's degree
preferably in in the sciences and then
you apply to NASA and and they like to
have three years experience plus a
bachelor's degree PhD serves it can be
in lieu of the three years experience so
that's why a lot of times you see the
mission specialists with a PhD that that
become mission specialists so our
astronauts that are mission specialists
so the bottom line requirement is to is
to have bachelor's degree and so we have
a lot of different I keep talking the
president I'm a form
astronaut left the office a couple of
years ago but it's kind of hard to let
go after so many years and experiences
such as this here is a naval air station
oceana in Virginia Beach being on
deployment kind of even when you go on I
went on a cruise ship for the first time
many many years ago and and a real
cruise ship not on a Navy cruise ship
and even on the beginning of the cruise
ship what do they always do they have a
drill right they kind of have a drill
get everybody together and discuss that
this is what we were doing here is
anybody guess what we're what specific
drill we're doing CPR we were doing so
this week was our CPR or medical
emergency drill so we brought out all of
the medical equipment that we had if you
look down here it's a it's a basically a
resin non-conducting surface because we
did have a defibrillator on board and if
you win it if you put somebody down and
didn't insulate them from the rest of
space station you'd give the whole
entire space station a good shock if you
if use defibrillator yuri was busy at
the time so what we used was if you look
closely it's good old duct tape duct
tape works great in space as well so we
took some towels rolled it up try to get
it about the right distance for Yuri's
chest what I was trying to show was that
to do the chest compressions it's
actually easier to push off the ceiling
well what you could consider the floor
depending on where you are but and to do
it that way other than because the first
guess when you go to get up into orbit
is to do everything just like you do
here on earth but what you find out is
that when you're weightless it's a lot
easier to do a different way so that's
what we were doing here and practicing
the two-person CPR with Karl at the head
of the patient I'd been in orbit about
about two months and I went to Yuri and
I said Yuri I really you know not only
was the places I'd been it was some of
the places that just fascinated me I'd
read the book into thin air is anybody
read that book before I'd read that book
I really want to get a picture of Mount
Everest and so after two months I went
to Yuri and I said Yuri I've been trying
to get a picture of Mount Everest and I
can't get it and Yuri just goes don't
worry it will come around again
and so sure enough he was right you wait
long enough you know you stand out orbit
and you'll you'll you'll find it
happened to be about 3:00 in the morning
basically our sleep time incidentally we
would run by GMT time we'd wake up about
6:00 in the morning go to bed about
10:00 11:00 at night GMT time so
happened to be 3:00 a.m. GMT time in the
middle of my sleep I got up happened to
see that we were going to be flying over
the Himalayas so I got my camera ready I
knew to look for if you look at the top
near the top center of the picture
there's a big upside-down V and I knew
that kind of pointed north and if you
look down the east side that was where
Mount Everest is and so ma'am Mount
Everest is is right up there and but
again you see when you're when you're up
there it's really hard you might look at
this area and go well that area might be
higher or that area might be hiring and
so so I got my picture of Mount Everest
and again I don't know how to describe
this other than like one of those little
personal goals like yes I did it you
know I I I was able to do that and it
wasn't on a timeline anywhere except my
own we wanted to promote reading so yes
this Hill as a canned photo used with
with a timer on the flash what I didn't
realize was after the photo you notice
your he's arrogant and a little bit
longer I'll talk about that long later
but Carlo I think wins the wins the
award for I guess the intelligence
quotient for what he what's he's reading
he's reading Stephen Ambrose and wild
blue your ease reading an atlas of
fishing in the Moscow region Yuri was
what they call a Nastya community Bock
which means a real fisherman we would
fly over Newfoundland and Yuri would
just look out the window and just be
salivating because he just he just knew
all the fish the the plethora of fish
that would be down there but he was so
close yet yet so far and then yours
truly I have Harry Potter okay so what
what can I say
every so often about three seem like in
the middle of mission we had a product
of progress is an unmanned
a cargo vehicle that comes up docks and
it's kind of like a supply ship for
space station so along with material
supplies it would also deliver some
amount of small amount of fresh food and
I remember when it first came up before
we opened hatch and this was the first
visit by anything we had been on board
three to four months and we hadn't had a
visit by any other ship and so this is
the first time our families are able to
put in a small package about be a big
you know little letters and letters and
cards and stuff like that and of course
we could communicate them with an IP
phone every day that we had but we
didn't have a constant internet
connection it's kind of like my it's
it's kind of like like my connection at
home I won't mention the company but you
know it's sometimes is there sometimes
it isn't for the broadband but that was
kind of on on-orbit but so we had good
connection with home but there is
something special about getting a
package you know so before progress came
up I was really excited I was like a kid
before Christmas you know I want to open
up that hatch and see what I got and
when I opened up the hatch I smelled the
fresh oranges and apples and it just
overcame me because we don't have fresh
food up there we don't have well we have
some medical refrigerators or freezers
and sometimes people like to sneak you
know little little ice cream bars and
stuff in there that they're not supposed
to but but anyways I remember opening
the hatch and and smelling the fresh
oranges and apples and it just overcame
me I don't want to get into specifics of
what inside of Space Station
smells like after three months with just
three guys on board but but to smell the
fresh orange is Annapolis was something
that you know you take for granted just
the senses that you don't think about
when you're in this enclosed environment
for a long time this is a roar Australis
so the Southern Lights and this picture
doesn't do it justice one of the things
that hopefully will improve with
technology is just the sensitivity of
the cameras especially in color when we
take some of these pictures how you can
bring back some of these images and of
course they there's they somewhat dance
around the the Aurora's and they're
beautiful and spaced on one of my
previous missions we were actually only
at an
altitude of 100 nautical miles I
remember actually flying through the
aurora and that was kind of eerie to see
it kind of dancing around the space
shuttle as you flew through it
here was a Space Shuttle Endeavor coming
up to pick us up
and this was kind of an exciting moment
because I knew the mission was coming to
an end but at the same time I'm thinking
of the crew inside the Space Shuttle
that's just beginning beginning their
their mission so kind of different types
of thoughts that go through your mind
when you see your ride come up now of
course you're really happy when they
dock and you know everything's ok and
and they come on board but in the cargo
bay of the shuttle there you see one of
the pressurized logistics modules that
basically is a huge suitcase which later
is pulled out by one of the robot arms
and attached to space station so there
was our the crew that we trade off to is
in the light blue shirts included peggy
whitson on the right you know there was
a lot of I remember in the office a lot
of concern oh this is Peggy Whitson it's
her first mission it shouldn't be Space
Station mission and and because of
long-duration but she did great on her
first flight she did great you see Yuri
in the middle by the end of the flight
we nicknamed him Fabio both Karl and I
got haircuts and the way you do haircuts
is you get in front of a intake for the
air vent and the filter collects all
your hair there and then you then you
actually vacuum it up so it's not real
high tech but you want to do that
because this stuff just will float all
around if you don't do something about
it but and I asked Yuri I said well Yuri
why don't you want to get your hair cut
and he explained that he had been in the
military so long this is the only good
excuse he had for not to get his hair
cut but for me it was just convenience
thing you know because of the resources
we have there we don't have we have a
waterless shampoo but I mean it works
okay but believe me when I came back
down the earth getting a nice real
shower was really good it felt really
good so it's just almost like a timing
thing convenience thing for me it was
just interesting I told Yuri I don't
believe the you know the haircut bit
about being in the military I thought he
just didn't trust the Americans with
sharp objects
leaving Space Station was somewhat of
kind of an emotional event because I
remember of course when you're when
you're approaching Space Station in your
space shuttle there's like maybe mainly
two windows that you can look at as
you're approaching and that's pretty
prime real estate for seven or eight
people to start you know shoving for
space and of course the commander gets
whatever he or she wants and then you
know everybody else gets whatever
whatever they can but so you try to get
a picture but all I can say it was just
a psycho lot after going through this
mission and then leaving it it was
almost like my brain had been reek aged
as far as just a different viewpoint and
so as I was leaving Space Station it was
kind of a emotional moment because I
look back and I go gosh I spent six over
six months on board and that was my home
so you're leaving your home for for a
long period of time and chances are I
won't go back or at least my my wife
says I won't go back with that life so
so but but anyway so just I just
remembered leaving it and and just being
kind of a it just surprised me of one of
those things psychologically that that
surprised me I figure do i I should be
happy I'm going home but just leaving
something that was your home and it
truly is a I still think an engineering
marvel especially in the number of
countries that are involved with it you
see the large solar arrays also you've
probably seen this people show up before
but look at the Earth's atmosphere you
see that thin blue line over the horizon
of the earth it's very very thin that
really gives you an appreciation of how
very I mean the atmosphere seems like a
thin shell around the planet here's a
close-up of Space Station that's kind of
basically how it looked like when we
left it as you if you've seen pictures
you know that they've built on several
segments to both to the left and right
side of Space Station there and and
added on some more solar rays this is
actually the docking port for the Space
Shuttle docks to it there and the robot
arm that you see you'd think after
eighty three million miles or so I would
have gotten an upgraded seat on the
Space Shuttle on the ride home this is
where they first told me I had to go but
but actually this is in the lower deck
or mid deck of a space shuttle and
actually felt kind of comfortable a lot
of people say well how do you sleep up
there excuse me it's it's actually it's
in sleeping bags you just tether it
someplace and the hardest thing for me
is was just I had lower back pain for
like 45 days while I was up there for
some reason I don't know it's just kind
of a dull pain everybody reacts to
weightlessness differently some people
they get violently sick for the first
couple of days and then they're okay and
then there's people like me who are
we're just kind of have these gradually
nagging problems for a while and then
and then I got used to it but it is
amazing how quickly the the human body
adapts to weightlessness this is the
landing in California my wife also gives
me a hard time because she was waiting
patiently for me in Florida and so we
landed
and she says that's just great after six
and a half months that's just great you
can't even come home to where you're
supposed to can't even land we're
supposed to well the weather wasn't good
enough to land in Florida so we landed
at Edwards Air Force Base instead I have
put up the information up there I'll
leave it up there but again to go back
to the psychological challenges of
flying long-duration missions is one
thing to relate it to is is probably
everybody can relate to let's say maybe
when you went to school and you
initially had a roommate that you
thought was your best friend
well after you start living with them a
while you know you figure out some of
the different you know idiosyncrasies
and those are some of the things that
you just have to work through now I'm
not saying that you know we had big
problems up there but certainly we had
some conflicts that we had to resolve
and I think that's important thing just
to let crews understand and it's one of
those things that I'm sure that NASA
told us about it
but at the time you're in the training
mode you're focusing and you okay right
I got it
okay I got it I'll look for a sign to
depression a three-month point yeah
right right okay I got it but it's it's
things that you have to think about and
understand and it's important I think
it's it's almost a good lesson in
conflict resolution because it was one
of those things where you had to talk to
the person you couldn't just not
communicate with them because next meal
you're gonna be right in front of them
again so with things it was good I think
I've learned a lot about myself and
about working in close quarters with
other people in that mission that's all
I had for kind of any prepared remarks
so I was gonna go ahead and open it up
for any questions that you have yes go
ahead
her question was how did we figure out
our decompression times when we went on
spacewalks essentially it's it's a table
it's in a stand it's a standard protocol
that that that they use for the space
shuttle what the Space Shuttle does is
the day before they will actually bring
the pressure down to 10.2 psi and then
that reduces the amount of time that
they have to pre breathe pure oxygen and
to get out what they also started doing
was they came up there was another
astronaut named Mike Bernhardt who came
up helped develop a protocol to where
you exercise and breathe oxygen through
a mask and that actually reduced the
amount of pre-brief time that we had to
do so now on Space Station before they
go on a spacewalk they'll get on the
exercise bicycle exercise for I think
it's 15 minutes or so breathing pure
oxygen and so it's it's all by timeline
and so the ground thankfully the ground
is there to kind of keep us on on
schedule so it is a very standard
protocol and the Russians have has
something similar but they don't use the
exercise protocol as azavea yes
his question was what what precautions
do we have to take to avoid getting a
sunburn through the window
they have UV filters and actually
there's on the side hatch of the space
shuttle there have been people I won't
name any any crews certainly I never
forgot to do it but anyways there there
is a side window that for whatever
reason they did not put a UV filter and
this is something you have to do after
you get into on-orbit you have to
install that UV filter if you don't you
can pretty much get a sunburn I think in
a matter of like 30 seconds and you've
seen you can see people with obviously
to have this round kind of burn on the
side of the side of their face so so
most of the windows do are naturally
protected except for for a few yes his
question is when do I think the flight
to Mars will happen I'd have to go to
the to the NASA website to look at the
latest the latest information that I
think I've read calls for going back to
the moon in 20 I believe in 2015 but I'm
not not certain to that and I think the
Mars certainly follows that but I don't
know what year right now I'd have to
look at the website myself yes sir
yeah his question was and that's it's a
good one what type of relationship did
do the astronauts have with the people
on the ground basically mission mission
control and and did we feel like they
were our parents you know did they feel
like we had to do everything they told
us to and and and really that type that
relationship hopefully gets built up
over let's say the year-and-a-half
before you fly because you do
simulations you sit in a simulator where
you bring the whole space control team
in during the simulation and you talk
with them not only the capsule
communicators but all the people that
sit in Mission Control
so hopefully you spend some time and not
only doing training but also have some
type of social events where you meet
with them and really comes down to what
type of reporter you have basically with
your management I mean it's hard to I I
always felt free if we had a question
about doing a procedure like one time
the ground said we want you to do this
maintenance procedure and and we had
some concerns about it so we went ahead
and we wrote back and then they they
wrote us back or talked to us and said
this is why we're doing it and they'll
come up with rationale so you know our
flight control team I felt that we got
along great but it really is something
that you try to establish not not only
just after you get up there but it's
it's through the training but most of
the time it's kind of like you're
working together and and really they I
would the the ground controls all of the
basically all the reboosts for Space
Station at least when the Space Shuttle
is not there so it is give or take and
we did have leeway to let's say if I
wanted to exercise in the morning and I
wanted to trade with Yuri or Carl I
could do that so that was more working
with my crewmates to say hey can I do
this and and so I I can't think of a
point where you know I was you know
either cussing underneath my breath
saying you know gosh darn up why can't
they get that can't they understand that
but it really was not us us they
relationship
yes
yeah I guess I think if I understand the
question is when I went on Space Station
did I did I find many things that were
unfamiliar that I had to work out by
myself do you mean as far as the
configuration wise or just old mechanics
okay yeah so most of when I got on board
Space Station was not a surprise
you know bits and pieces are mocked up
so we could we could train with with
mock-ups and and so most of it was not a
surprise I'm trying to think of I you
know unfortunately the training we do is
in kind of fractional type of training
we'll train for a spacewalk but it's in
a pool it's in a suit that's not exactly
like the suit so but it pretty much all
came together but we did have about
about a week to talk with the crew that
was already up there and that was
important because they would say okay
this is how we kind of learned it on the
ground but it's a little bit easier to
do it this way so that was important so
that we did have a dedicated handover
time it was always rushed you know but
but it is you know the few minutes you
have to talk to somebody to say okay how
did you really do this you know and that
that was very helpful so I I don't
remember any any big surprises up there
you go on this vision at six months we
just got sodium
yeah his question was why why was I
chosen for this long-duration mission
versus let's say somebody else and
because the missions is you can imagine
are somewhat different as space shuttle
that brings up a point first I want to
make is that space shuttle is more like
is more like a sprint it's kind of like
finals week everybody can relate to that
finals week where you very little sleep
you know probably living on a lot of
caffeine more than you should and then
with with Space Station is more like a
marathon you have to kind of spread it
out because psychologically you can't be
under that kind of stress for that
period of time as far as how they select
I know that they do some psychological
screening and it's different over in
Russia versus the u.s. I remember
distinctly the Russians have this test
where you look at these you look at
these pictures of different people and
you pick out which one you like and then
they have colors that you pick out and
is all very strange but somehow I guess
you know I passed but you know to be
quite honest part of the biggest
criteria early on in the flight was that
you had to be you know when you go to
the amusement rides and they say you
have to be you know you have to be this
tall to go on Space Station well for
Space Station we had you have to be
shorter than this because initially you
have to fit in the Soyuz even though the
Space Shuttle is taking you up
if the Soyuz is going to be your
lifeboat you have to fit in the Soyuz so
initially until they modify the Soyuz we
had to fit you know be within a fairly
tight range of anthropometric
measurements so that wasn't that was
part of the selection criteria itself
too but and you also get to work with
the crews have been changed around in
the past I've heard a lot of different
rumors of why they were changed around
sometimes it was just because of the
specific mission they were doing they
wanted a robot for robotics person
versus you know a VA or spacewalk person
so sometimes that's changed around but
you go through survival training now
they're sending crews on I think they
call it the National Outdoor Leadership
School or Knolls where they go out and
they you know so concentrate in time and
they're somewhat stress and they
how crews react to that I think they're
looking at that as well so that goes
into it they're doing a lot more when I
was selected for a fourth space station
as far as put crews under stress and
then see how they work as a team yes
yeah yeah we had yeah i'm kt5 pnu ham
ham radio license and weed I didn't use
a ham radio sorry his question was did
did we have any time just to have fun up
there and not to be serious I hope I
wasn't serious the whole time today but
but yeah we we did and that was
important
some people like Yuri was closest to the
ham radio he seemed to use a ham radio a
lot more than we did we had DVDs up
there that we could watch every every
weekend we team we had a crew movie
where where we would all go and watch a
movie I remember one time floating back
might where I slept was in the u.s.
segment in the u.s. lab Yuri and Karl
were back in the Russian segment that's
just happened to be where their quarters
were and I remember floating back it was
crew movie night and I remember floating
back there and I see Yuri and Karl both
with two each with one of the speakers
we had the portable speakers with the
DVD player watching movie each with one
of the speakers to their ears and I
guess I wanted to squeak out every
little bit of battery that they had left
in the speaker's you know before they
changed it part of the problem was it
could be very loud in some of the pumps
that were back there so we watched DVDs
we could we read books I had books on
tape and and so we eat everybody had
brought up that you could bring up a
like a little package of like hobbies
you know Yuri's your was fishing so he
brought up what he hoped to do was
actually I think tie some fishing flies
I don't think he ever got to do it but
you try to do something think of things
that you like to do when you're up there
other people just like to the ground had
a long list of you know is kind of a
to-do list
they called it the job jar and so you
would go in there and take up your time
doing
but I would say overall was pretty we
had the time to do that but mostly
during let's say half a Saturday and
some of Sunday we would do that yes yeah
yeah yeah our mission was it was
continued building Space Station one of
the flights that came up brought up that
trust segment that you saw see if I can
go back to it yeah was that truss
segment that came up the experiments
that I was in charge of I had a plant
growth experiment that one of the
challenges of going to Mars is is trying
to grow let's say in an enclosed
environment Space Station right now is
very much a throwaway environment to
where we use things once or twice and
then we don't reuse them some of the
water the condensate is collected from
the humidity in the in the air is reused
but on a mission to Mars I think they're
gonna have to rely much more on a total
enclosed environment so one of my
experiments I had was a plant growth
experiment apparently with growing
plants you know plants not only scrub
the co2 out of the air they also put
other gasses into the air that could be
harmful in an enclosed environment that
was one of the experiments I did I
enjoyed that particular one because it
was very much a hands-on experiment some
of the other experiments we had were
protein growth protein crystal growth
experiments and the robotics much of the
robotic arm work that we did was in
preparation for future build missions
was working out the robotic arm was
relatively new so we had to work it out
before they brought up other big
segments like like in the middle here
this big truss segment that goes across
the u.s. lab was installed using this
arm and it had lifted the airlock before
but nobody had used the procedures to
that we're going to use that segment
itself so much of our time unfortunately
is spent on just maintenance of the
space station the amount of science they
I've heard they want to increase and
focus it more on long-duration and going
back to the moon and on to Mars but with
only a three-person crew that
tough because you know he seemed to
spend a lot of your time doing a lot of
the upkeep but hopefully as more modules
get up there they can increase the size
of the crew other crew members had their
own experiments
my least favorite experiment where were
ones that kind of I was a test subject
there was one there was one called a he
was actually looking at the I'd be
careful here I don't want to tick off
the the principle investigator for this
one was a particular experiment where I
had to put electrodes on my leg and take
shocks to my leg and then they were
measuring the reaction and my reflexes
so that wasn't my favorite but the
ground always has a sense of humor the
box for that that gave you the shocks
the acronym of the box was H R T you or
hurt you so I mean they have to have a
sense of humor thanks yes
yeah our question was how did you feel
coming back to earth and in feeling
gravity again on a space shuttle mission
of seven to twelve days usually you feel
I kind of felt normal after three hours
or so but even when you first land with
that your your arms feel like they weigh
a hundred pounds they just feel very
heavy you just feel exhausted even just
to lift your arms
whereas coming back from Space Station
one of the biggest effects was
neurovestibular wise whereas if you
think about your inner ear is kind of
disconnected so if you think of a
peripheral you know on your computer
that is disconnected and then you
connect it again you land on earth you
connect it again and then all of a
sudden your brain is going you know
unknown equipment you know detected you
know no driver found and that was kind
of what it felt like when I landed back
on on earth after Space Station because
all the sudden my inner ear now is
giving all these signals of sensing
gravity again and my brain hadn't felt
those for such a long time it said
what's going on and I immediately pretty
much got sick to my stomach and it was
all neurovestibular and and I asked the
flight surgeon surgeons I said why am I
feeling that and they said well it's
kind of a protection mechanism that your
body has if it doesn't understand you
know what's going on it assumes you ate
a bad berry
and so that's what it was he was saying
I don't understand you know so but and
so that lasted that you know that lasted
several hours and then just walking took
about three days to kind of get used to
where I could walk again and and but and
I would say cardiovascular wise I like
to run cardiovascular wise I would say
just anecdotally just in what how I felt
I felt like even after a year I wasn't
quite where I was before because it's a
huge impact on the heart and the body
you know being up there that length of
time
so uh what oh okay
yeah some of the experiments last just a
few months like some of the protein
growth experiments you initialize them
and then they're done after a couple
months and then they'll go back on
space-shuttle other experiments they may
use the same equipment like the glovebox
and but most of the experiments
typically last the longest I would say
would be maybe six months to where if
you're collecting data let's say
collecting bone density and and calcium
data on and the astronauts that would
last throughout throughout a mission so
it varies from time to time his question
was about the the centrifuge module that
I believe was removed at one time I
don't know I haven't I don't know the
the have an update on that but certainly
if somebody can prove that that that
using it has a benefit as far as going
back direct benefit as far as a human
lasting a long mission especially on the
Mars that they should bring it back yes
good
his question was did I get taller you
actually do I
I grew about an inch and a half in in
space but a lot of times people say
gravity sucks so you know I came back
down and I shrank a bit and that's
actually something they have to account
for with the space suits when you go out
they actually size them a little bit
higher because they know that your
body's going to stretch a little bit but
come back down to earth and I'm the same
height so up there but I think that's
we'll go ahead and end in the video part
at this point but thanks very much for
your attention today and I'll I'll be
able to stick around for a little bit
and answer some other questions thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
