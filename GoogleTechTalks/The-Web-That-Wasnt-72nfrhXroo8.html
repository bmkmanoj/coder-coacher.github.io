Beene I'm a user experience manager here
at Google and it's my pleasure to
introduce Alex Wright today Alex and I
have known each other problem for about
ten years do the information
architecture summit that we go to every
year and stuff like that
alex has been designing information and
organizing information for websites for
over a decade and has been running in
many of the circles that many of you in
the user experience group do as well so
he's sort of we run into each other all
the time it's really quite nice um in
his career he's built you've got the
first Harvard library website you had
something to do with it alright let's
let's say that but the first Harvard
wipes what library website founded and
led the user experience team at IBM in
the 90s co-founded his search startup
called royal Gill and has done user
experience work at Macromedia Yahoo and
the long now foundation and is now an
information architect at the New York
Times so thanks for coming all the way
out for us that's great his new book
which is available over there he's
selling copies extremely discounted for
about 20 bucks apiece is called glut
mastering information through the ages
in a chronicles ways that humans have
collected organized and shared
information for more than a hundred
thousand years you go way back that's
great
awesome please help me welcome Alex
right well thanks Jeff and thanks for
for coming out is this is this on I
guess it is on yeah great well so on so
as Jeff mentioned I've been looking into
this whole question of how we've been
organizing information over the years I
wanted to just sort of talk a little bit
about where this where my interest in
this came from you know like most of you
in this room I've been working on the
web you know but for living for the past
10 10 12 years or so and I feel like you
know it's it's sort of hard we're at the
web has become such a dominant sort of
cultural force in that period that it's
you know it's all it's very hard for us
I think to really appreciate sort of
what the world was you know what the
world could have been like without the
web as we know it today and so what I've
been sort of looking into is the whole
question of you know sort of how did we
get here and trying to look at
historical precursors to things like
hypertext
and networked information systems and as
Jeff mentioned my book takes sort of a
long view of some of this stuff going
back into even human prehistory looking
at the history of writing and the
history of the printing press and so
forth but but for the purposes of this
talk I really wanted to focus on sort of
a narrower subject which is the really
the history of hypertext and what I
wanted to do is just sort of talk a
little bit about some of the systems
that preceded the web and I feel like
you know in the technology industry we
tend to have a kind of a myopic fixation
on the future I think there's a tendency
for us to always be looking forward and
I think that's something about sort of
the nature of computing it's a very sort
of linear thing and I think it always
keeps us sort of looking at a certain
direction but I think there's some value
in trying to step back and take maybe a
longer view and take a little more of a
historical view of sort of how we got
here and as I've been looking into this
over the last couple of years I've
become interested in some of the systems
that that emerge really in relatively
recent history but sort of just before
the web and it's interesting to look at
these systems I think in light of where
we are with the web today because I
think a lot of us are starting to
realize they're starting to bump up
against some of the fundamental
limitations of the web you know there
are certain things about the basic
architecture of HTTP HTML that are
somewhat limiting and today I think
we're in a period where people are
really trying to sort of work around
those some of those limits with things
like you know Ajax and you know looking
at some of the new sort of web 2.0 II
kind of things out there but it's
interesting just to take a look back and
see how some of the people who are
thinking about this stuff a long time
ago actually anticipated some of these
problems he came up with some
interesting solutions that I think we
can we can actually learn something from
so so what I wanted to talk about
for starters was sort of the very early
history of the web so this was the the
first reference I could find to somebody
having an idea that looked something
like the Internet so this is a guy named
Charles cutter and he was a very
well-known librarian in the 19th century
he was actually the co-founder of the
American Library Association he was a
sort of contemporary of Melville Dewey
everyone knows the Dewey Decimal System
he was after a big rival of Dewey and he
had a different system that is actually
the one that the Library of Congress
uses and he was a very kind of visionary
librarian he's kind of forgotten today
but you wrote this essay in 1883 where
he was trying to imagine what a library
might look like in a hundred years and
he had this crazy idea of something
called a keyboard that could have some
kind of wire connected to it and that
you know you could punch up something on
the keyboard and something would appear
on a screen like you'd be able to pull
up a book right so it's pretty good so a
few years later HG Wells I'm sure
everyone's heard of her famous science
fiction writer wrote a very influential
essay called the world brain and he had
this idea that and he sort of this is I
think in the 1930s that he wrote this he
had this idea that over time as he saw
what was coming with radio and you know
TV was just around the corner and that
you know increasingly a microphone was
becoming a big thing and he anticipated
that over time all of this recorded
information would become increasingly
connected through some kind of
distributed network and he had this idea
I mean he was a sci-fi writer he had
this idea that the whole thing would
kind of come to life somehow and there'd
be some sort of new kind of
consciousness would emerge out of the
network and they'd use but he was
serious about him it was that this was
not fiction I mean he actually saw this
as a fundamentally new kind of
intelligence emerging out of the sort of
networked information environment he
also described the whole thing as a sort
of vast network encyclopedia which
interesting cuz that's the term that
seems to come up a lot and as people
were thinking about this the stuff
another I think important precursor was
a guy named ty yard de Chardin and he
was a Jesuit priest who wrote quite a
bit in the 40s and 50s and he was an
interesting character he was actually
banned from publishing by the Catholic
Church who considered his writing a bit
heretical he had this idea that he wrote
a lot about networked information and
this notion that
that elect the growing sort of universe
of electronic media would create new
ways for people to communicate and
collect and share information and he
went a little bit further than that he
also had this idea that over time that
activity would would let people sort of
would alter people's consciousness in
some way and that there would be some
sort of he had the sort of idea that
people would kind of approach a divine
consciousness by having had this sort of
unfettered access to information and the
sort of changing media landscape so that
was where the Catholic Church start to
have a problem with him but even though
he never published any he couldn't
publish during his lifetime everything
was put everything wrote was later
published posthumously his essays
actually he probably circulated them
privately to friends and acquaintances
and he actually developed a pretty
enthusiastic following among specially
among fellow Jesuits one of which was a
young one of whom was a young grad
student named Marshall McLuhan who
actually took the chard as ideas as the
basis for his whole philosophy of the
global village and so forth so so he was
also seemingly on to something so but so
this was all kind of theory up till now
I mean this was all I mean interesting
stuff but none of this no none of these
we were really actually building
anything they were just sort of you know
philosophizing hut in the 1930s there
was a guy named Paul Ola who I'm curious
is anyone here ever heard of Paul L a
wanted to oh wow couple P okay that's
pretty good that's two more than I you
ever get what he's talking about
so he was a Belgian fellow and he was at
information sort of one of the early
information scientists he was kind of a
librarian but he would have described
himself a little differently he was kind
of a theorist of information and
documents and he wrote quite
prolifically about the sort of future of
information science and the theory of
documentation and how to organize
information he created a whole
classification system called the
universal Decimal Classification which
was kind of the European answer to the
Dewey Decimal System and he wrote these
uh quite a few books about his theories
he also founded an institution in
Belgium was called the mundaneum
and what was interesting about the
mundaneum it was a really a new kind of
institution that was unlike traditional
libraries that were really about
collecting books his fundamental insight
was that there was a lot of information
contained inside of books and that if
you could develop the right framework to
court of sort of liberate that
information from inside the books you
could actually create whole new ways of
interfacing with that information and
sort of remix information and letting
people stitch together their own new
kinds of books out of the information
that was sort of in those books so this
diagram sort of illustrates his basic
idea so just try to explain this briefly
the idea is there's you have kind of a
classification system that organizes all
this data that was is the
state-of-the-art storage technology
during his time was index cards so yeah
so things were pretty durable last
longer than most disk drives so and that
information is pulled out of books which
ultimately comes out of people's heads
who apparently have Lucky Charms sort of
floating out of their heads
which book that's all that but this is
sort of his basic framework right so it
was pretty far sighted and he had his
books most of his work has actually not
been translated into English yet but he
has we had a great facility of sort of
visualizing information and sort of
explaining his ideas through to visual
metaphors that's what some of the
sketches quite sure what that was all
about but anyway he so he actually built
this thing this wasn't just an idea he
actually created this thing called the
mundaneum and it was built in Brussels
as and this was all happening around the
time when the League of Nations was
forming and yet this very utopian vision
that as the League of Nations took shape
there would be a he would have this sort
of global information warehouse that
would be available to anyone in the
world and he actually convinced people
to fund this and he actually got a prime
piece of real estate in Belgium and
built this whole institution and he had
it staffed and he had people basically
going through and just plowing through
huge volumes of books and extracting all
that information putting it on index
cards well it depends on the books I
mean I think for the most part we're
talking that nonfiction right so we're
looking at basically facts bits of
information with references to the
original book that they were contained
in so it's hard to generalize but it's
sort of anything you can think of it's
in a book you know facts and figures and
you know it's a data and then there the
idea was that this information was then
stored on these index cards and
classified using this classification
system but there was a little more to it
than that it wasn't just sort of a
top-down catalogue he also and this way
I think was the the big idea that he had
as people use this information that
became part that usage became part of
the record so as somebody came in and
you know pulled out a piece of
information and then went and looked at
another piece of information they that
became part of the actual catalog record
of the of the information of the data so
that it became sort of a bottom-up
system as well as a top-down system and
he had this idea what he called the
social space of a document that would
emerge by looking at the ways people use
the information and then from that
deriving some understanding of how one
document related to other documents and
so that each no document sort of existed
in a bubble but that it was you know
your understanding of that document was
informed by the documents that
surrounded it right so I was pretty
pretty close yeah close you know so so
there's a documentary that was made
about LA a few years ago and I'm going
to show a brief excerpt from it I know I
get the audio hooked up here
I think I have an audio feed is there
anyone I can plate off here but I don't
think it'll go
oh yeah yeah yeah well this is sure
you know in a pinch I can probably just
plain Bend the mic down and play it off
this yeah we'll see if this works
that's probably all right
thirty-four ugly publishers is most
important book the treatise on
documentation the book on the book this
is where we find the most visionary
pages we're already the concept of the
computer emerges here the workspace is
no longer cluttered with any books in
their place the screen and the telephone
within reach over there in an immense
edifice are all the books and
information from there the page to be
read in order to know the answer to the
question asked by telephone is made to
appear on the screen the screen could be
divided in half by four or even by ten
if multiple texts and documents had to
be consulted simultaneously that would
be loud speaker if the image had to be
complemented by oral data and this
improvement could continue to the point
of automating the call for on-screen
data cinema photographs radio television
these instruments taken as substitutes
for the book will in fact become the new
book
the most powerful works for the
diffusion of human thought this will be
the radiated library and in televised
book
so that was this book was written in
1934 the documentary was made recently
but the yeah that all that was from 1934
right so that's pretty yeah yeah well he
thought yeah I mean coming so right so
why is no one heard of this guy right
well I mentioned he built this in
Belgium we all know what happened in
Belgium and I think was 1939 the Nazis
marched in and they promptly gutted them
unto nay I'm carted out all the index
cards and threw them away and made room
for an exhibition of Third Reich art and
they basically died in obscurity about
four years later you know the whole
country was ravaged his life's work had
been thrown away and he just you know
was completely basically forgotten after
that for about 25 years he completely
just fell into obscurity in you know
post-war Europe people had other things
on their mind and rebuilding their you
know their countries and his papers were
basically locked away in an obscure
little office in a corner of a building
and it was they've been locked up for 20
years and you know it was just
completely forgotten until this grad
student a library science student named
Boyd Rea word happened to somehow
uncover a reference to him and started
getting became fascinated by him and
actually trekked to Belgium track down
his address and got somebody to let him
into his office and found this you know
office full of cobwebs
you know just cluttered everywhere and
he went through the process of actually
you know sifting through his papers and
actually sort of started to reconstruct
his legacy and Aleya finally sort of
getting his due but he's it's been a
long road I think part of the problem is
that the heritage of the you know the
internet and the coming out of sort of
you know the anglo-american sort of you
know world and just given the cultural
forces that have taken shape since then
you know the contributions of sort of
obscure Belgian information scientists
who never wrote in English have been
sort of overlooked but anyway but it's
probably starting to get get a little
bit of credit which is certainly overdue
so I won't go into too much detail about
how the whole thing worked but I think
there are a couple things worth worth
pointing out that I think in terms of
his vision I think are actually quite
quite interesting so I mentioned that
there was this notion of the framework
he developed had the had this facility
for managing a top-down classification
system with a kind of bottom-up social
framework which I think was a pretty
interesting idea and very you know
pretty far sided he also had this idea
that those links between documents could
carry some meaning so that you know
unlike today's web which for the most
part you know a hyperlink is a fairly
dumb link right it's basically this
document points to this document he had
this idea that those links could
actually be encoded with some kind of
judgement it could be like this this
document agrees with this document or
the sacrament disagrees with this
document you can even say house like how
strong that agreement was or you have
other flavors of those kinds of
relationships so it's a pretty good idea
and so it's certainly lacking mostly in
the web today so it's a kind of thing
about what would the web of look like if
it had sort of come out of what lays
vision well you would have had some
little more of a top-down framework than
we have today which is really a pretty
purely bottom-up system this idea of
constructing sort of the social space of
a document although I think we have
something like that with with Google but
I think it have been a lot more explicit
invisible in LA's world and this notion
of links that have some kind of meaning
associated with them I think is also
pretty important ideas I think we can
just look at those and see there's some
pretty interesting thinking in there
that I think is worth worth pondering a
little bit so it's also interesting to
look at how you know today people are
still you know people are trying are
starting to approximate some of these
kinds of things so this is a prototype
that was built by some guys in Europe
and it's called face tag might be
pronounced facet tag I'm not sure it's
meant to involve to basically use
faceted classification to enable you to
create a top-down framework that has
bottom-up tagging within it people know
what faceted classification is kind of a
library science term but the idea is you
have sort of a controlled framework for
identifying a domain of knowledge with
some sort of controlled vocabulary
within it and then below that
you have the ability for people to
assign freeform tags and then there's
some facility for sort of normalizing
terms disambiguating and that sort of
thing so there's sort of an interesting
sort of step in that kind of direction
of sort of marrying a top-down or
bottom-up system this is another sort of
faceted classification example that uses
wine basically it's a Cisco Jeff you
probably know what this is called this
is a Peter storing bills list anyway
it's a it's a wine faceted
classification prototype so there's also
an interesting proposal floating around
to do something like these these flavors
of links this is a proposal that's out
there for vote links and I don't really
know where this stands but it's an
interesting proposal it's basically an
idea of expanding the href tag to
include the ability to vote for or
against things so it's a very simple
sort of would be very simple addition to
a hyperlink that would let you say this
agrees or disagrees with a particular
document so there may be other things
along these lines floating floating
Rapids is one that I'm aware of them so
the next person I want to talk about is
somebody I'm sure many of you have heard
of a couple of common misconceptions
about bush one is his name was actually
pronounced veneer I've been discovered
recently and his uh he is no relation to
the current occupant of 1600
Pennsylvania avenues I'm happy to report
so he was Bush was a major figure in
post war while during the war in the
scientific establishment he was a
prolific inventor in his own right was a
science advisor to FDR held all kinds of
positions including being president the
Carnegie Institution he was at MIT for a
while
he accomplished a lot but what he's best
known for today and the sort of lasting
legacy has been this essay that was
published in 1945 called as we may think
actually discover he actually wrote the
essay before the war in 1939 but it was
delayed published me delayed publishing
it because he was distracted with other
other things um so it was in that essay
that he proposed this idea of a machine
called the Memex and it's certainly I
think many of you I'm sure have heard of
the this idea of MMX
it's tip often acknowledged that sort of
the direct philosophical precursor of
the lab although it doesn't really grow
that much resemblance to the web but
they're sort of a lineage of thought you
can trace from this essay straight
through to Tim berners-lee inventing the
web what's interesting about the Memex
is it was based on some of Bush's own
experience experiences trying to develop
microfilm reading systems during during
the 30s and 40s and he encountered a lot
of technical obstacles to actually
implementing his idea so when he just
proposed his idea for the Memex he
actually had no intention that it would
actually be built it was meant to be a
concept car and he really what he
proposed at the time was actually not
really entirely possible given the state
of technology at the time so he decided
to sort of liberate himself from those
constraints and really just think big
about what what could or should this
tool look like you know be able to do
and so what he proposed was a what in
many ways resembles a personal computer
although there was no such thing as
microchips or digital circuitry then so
it was a very analog machine it was all
built on microfilm and the idea was that
a user could sit down at this desk and
have access to all kinds of different
documents that would be stored on
microfilm and they would be able to pull
up two of those documents side by side
in the windows at the top there they
would also have believed in the original
idea each user would have a camera on
their forehead that would be kind of
like a scanner kind of thing and the
idea is you should be able to pull up
these documents and then make
associations between them they'd be able
to say this document relates to this
document and then continue building a
trail through a set of documents and to
create a pathway through those documents
that would then be visible to other
users who might come in later
so unlike laser vision Bush saw this is
completely bottom-up system there was no
sort of classification or anything the
ideas it would all be user driven and
Bush apparently had some frustrating
frustrating experiences working with
libraries he felt they were too
bureaucratic and institutionalized and
he wanted to basically basically have
users do the work of organizing
information you know within the system
so a couple of excerpts from from the
essay I think we're worth worth putting
up here this is sort of his vision for
how these what he called associative
trails would work so the idea here again
I won't read it but the idea is that the
user can go in and create a link between
two documents and that I think the key
point here is that that pathway is then
made visible to other users so think
about the web today you can't really see
where people are going oh maybe you
maybe you can see where people are going
but most people are going right but his
idea is that those pathways would become
part of the record and part of the
surface of a paper trail if you will of
the document which i think is a pretty
interesting idea he also had this idea
that over time he also used the term
encyclopedias this idea that that that
sort of new forms of documents would
emerge out of this activity where these
these trails themselves would have some
meaning and could be doc sort of
documents on their in their own right
and then would be you know put back into
the Memex and people could then build on
them or tailor them or tweak them so
forth so so even though the web as we
know it today is is in some sense an you
know an outgrowth of Bush's original
idea there are some important ways in
which the Memex was actually more
sophisticated than the web one was this
idea that links forgot two medicines
that links work in both directions
so the idea of you know this document
links to this document you can see the
incoming link as well as the outbound
link that's a pretty important idea also
this notion that the pathways are made
visible to the user was sort of a
critical part of his component of his
system so in a way the web is kind of a
much sort of Dumber system in a way than
what he had in mind and it much more
sort of a one-way street whereas he saw
it as a much more sort of collaborative
enterprise so so but again it's
interesting to look at the web today and
see how people are trying to sort of get
at some of these ideas so I think
trackback is a great example of an
attempt at kind of a two-way link right
it's a it's a kind of a ham-fisted
attempt that's you know you know
obviously with spam and everything it's
it's not really completely there but but
it's that it's that idea that you could
have a document and see what's linking
into it as well as to what's what's
linking out
certainly with something like delicious
we see at least an attempt that's
something like seeing a user's pathway
although it's not really a path away a
man truly just bookmarked but at least
its summit that you know there's some
effort to make the users another user
sort of experience of the web visible to
other users so that they could build on
that and sort of ant it to you know use
that as a starting point to create their
own trails so so the next I want to talk
about OPI just talk briefly about
Garfield because probably more more
people here know nobody was then been at
a lot of places Garfield was a a
librarian sort of in the 1950s well he's
actually still around who created this
thing called the science Citation Index
and the science Citation Index was a new
a whole new idea for how to create an
index to scientific journals was
basically the original idea and his main
insight was that you could learn a lot
about the importance of a journal
article or book or what-have-you by
actually following by actually ignoring
the contents of it the contents of the
article and actually looking at the
footnotes and his idea was that if you
tracked the sort of connections between
footnotes between different articles you
could actually build up a real picture
of where a document resided in a sort of
larger information space and that you
could look at the frequency of a
document being cited to assess its sort
of weight or its importance and that you
could then look at the weight of the of
the documents that cited it and that
that could then be used to derive you
know some sort of algorithm that would
give you some way of weighting the
relevance of things right so right okay
right so so what would you Jean
Garfield's web look like well probably
looks something like this right all
right so and I believe that your
founders cited Garfield pretty
prominently in their original paper when
that when the original paper on Google
at Stanford I think so yeah so the next
person I want to talk about is a Doug
Engelbart and he is a major major figure
in the history of hypertext he he's a
largely you know strangely better-known
I think is the inventor of the mouse
which is certainly deserve
for and somebody actually had a head of
one of his mice floating around here oh
yeah is yeah maybe maybe later we're
going to show it but when he was at SR I
in the 60s he led a team that developed
a pretty innovative system called the
online system NOS and as part of that
effort he was this was largely done
under the auspices of the Defense
Department that sort of funded this work
he also wrote a paper called augmenting
human intelligence it's up there on the
web it's a fascinating read and very
really visionary piece of writing about
how networked computer systems could
come together to create new ways for
people to collaborate to share
information to sort of get things done
was interesting about Engelbart is he
was particularly interested in how
computers could help groups of people
work together more effectively so in a
way he's kind of the father group where
you could say although yet he had a lot
of other things too he so in 1968 he
gave a demo that's come to be known as
the mother of all demos so very was done
at somewhere in San Francisco and this
was where he demonstrated a working
prototype of the of NLS and he gave this
presentation around it explaining his
concept and he had these slides with
pictures of her groovy 60s people and
their jet airplanes and so forth
but when he finally gave the demo and
I'm going to see I've tried to give this
before and it's never quite worked but
I'm hoping it'll work this time let's
see I actually had it up here all right
let's give this a whirl I think this
might work
let's talk about it as a system there's
a link sequence to jump in there to what
we talked about NLF in the online system
a very general term it's going to eat at
us for many many years online systems at
volleyball right now we consider it to
be primarily an instrument the vehicle
for helping humans to operate within the
domain of complex information structures
what we need is operating well the poles
study modified in place we started now
we know there many other things you to
do but we want to get them out study and
modify and want to further information
about what is complex structure mean
we're talking about complex structure
and emphasizing structure because we say
although the content represents your
concepts there's a structural
relationship between that content
underneath that should represent the
relationship between the concepts of
human thought and we know whom akin to
that very well within your text so
inside the computer we can represent
that quite well in fact we can represent
it to may see structures in a computer
that would generally be more far too
complex for you to study directly but
anyway serves as a tool to roll over
that
navigate your complex structure in the
find your way navigating move about of
apathy they will see what you want to
see at any given point so we take an MLS
at the tool right these are all very
important concepts to us because these
together and strapping that told us
where to start we start by building an
instrument that we can fit at work
during our day organize the kind of
working information we need in the task
force developing systems we need to
write our specifications our plans our
for bales our users guides on
documentation reports and even on
proposals so we've been using these he
returned back here so sorry it's so
grainy but that's the only copy I've
been able to find out there it's a real
player hope maybe somebody'll get it up
on youtube at some point but anyway so
if you sort of got the gist of that the
is what he was demonstrating was this
ability to create basically sort of
hypertext trees of information and the
ability to actually create sort of
componentized information and create
sort of a browsable tree structure that
you could then zoom in and out of and
later in the demo he shows like an
example of creating like a shopping list
and convert turning that into a to-do
list and go to the grocery store so it
was pretty good me this is 1968 when
people had barely seen a computer screen
at this point he also had a live video
chat he had somebody in Palo Alto in a
lab and they're doing a live video
conference on this thing he had a word
processor in there I mean it was pretty
amazing and he really kind of thought it
all out and this really this demo became
really the inspiration for a whole
generation of hackers who started like
the homebrew Computer Club and the
founders of Apple sort of came out of
that I mean it was pretty there was a
real sort of in a moment in the history
of computing certainly out here so it's
interesting think about what Engelbart's
web might have looked like he certainly
was more focused on sort of
collaboration tools then I think you
know I think certainly the web for the
most part is kind of an experience
tailored for an individual user but he
was very focused on how groups of people
could use these kind of tools together
to share information he had this idea of
process hierarchies which
is actually kind of an obvious idea to
us now it's this notion that you could
have smaller sort of subsets of
functionality that could then be
stitched together for example you could
have a word processor you might have
like a spell check function or word or a
you know print function that you could
take those features and sort of
componentize them and then build new
kinds of app hire applications on top of
those hierarchies they had built an
audio and video conferencing so it was
pretty pretty far sighted again it's
interesting to look at you know on the
web how people are trying to approximate
some of these ideas for instance
collaboration something that that's not
done all that well on the web today
partly because the I think there's a
lack of basic infrastructure to support
it in terms of managing identity and you
know basically a lot of the tools have
to be sort of hand hand-rolled but we
see the emergence of things like wiki's
which are certainly you know I think a
response to that need for better tools
people to share and collect information
in groups look at other examples of this
sort of thing out there people are
trying to create sort of group where
tools on the web with with mixed results
sometimes but the clue there's a sort of
an unmet need out there somewhere that I
think it in go Bart's are anticipated
and obviously a lot of these kinds of
tools are more appropriate within an
organization and the web you know it's
supposed to that sort of open
environment of the web but clearly there
seems to be a need out there so I'll
talk briefly I'm not gonna say a lot
about ZRX parks I think everyone sort of
knows about Xerox PARC but they're
really where the modern PC as we know it
was was essentially invented they also
coined coined the term information
architecture back in the early 70s this
is an example of an early screenshot
from the Altair computers and I think
what's interesting there is they had
built Ethernet was built in very early
on and a lot of the sort of basic
conventions of the modern GUI you know
really in a way the desktop GUI hasn't
really evolved much in 30 years you know
35 years so so the I do want to spend
some time talking about Ted Nelson
because I think he's uh to me a
fascinating figure and he's really
probably the guy who was most other than
Tim berners-lee most directly
responsible for the web
we know it today and that's what
berners-lee himself has decided Nelson
as a sort of primary influence for
people who don't know much about Nelson
he's a really interesting figure he's a
kind of a contrary in' figure in the
computing industry he started out as a
grad student at Harvard and I think in
the sociology department in the 60s and
he started sort of hanging out in the
computer lab and he became kind of
fascinated by computers but he never
took a computer course to this day he
has no idea how to program a computer
he's a sort of devoutly non-technical
guy and yet he's proved to be incredibly
influential he um he said when he
started working with the people in the
computing lab he came to the conclusion
that the trajectory of the computing
industry was dominated by scientists
mathematicians and that it was really
sort of a very exclusive club that was
sort of keeping that everyone else out
and he felt that a lot of the impetus
for the development was coming was sort
of funded by governmental you know
military-industrial sort of priorities
and he sort of railed against that and
he was kind of a devout humanist he was
you know he was about half crazy if you
read his stuff he's a real character but
he's also kind of a genius some of his
writing is really I mean some of his
ideas are just so visionary farsighted
and sort of on and yet they're wrapped
in a very because his writing style is
very kind of outlandish he's books were
all he's published all his own books and
sort of handset them so you have to sort
of get through his personality a little
bit to get at the real insights in there
but you know this is an example of one
of his books like computer play you know
out of the people yeah this is probably
his best-known book literary machines
where he explained his vision for
something he called Xanadu Xanadu is for
an appropriate name it's become this
kind of mythological system it's been
called the greatest piece of vaporware
you know never built it was a it's been
in development for about 35 years plus I
think and it's an attempt to create a
system that sounds a lot like the web
it's basically a hypertext information
environment with sort of a an ability
for users to create new
kinds of documents Network them together
and sort of share an information space
it has a lot of features in principle
that the web doesn't happen I'll talk
about those in a little bit but you know
is early in the early 70s he was coming
up with these kinds of ideas like a sort
of flat network of PCs that were that
were potentially could be potentially
unlimited where people could could
create and share information he also
coined the term hypertext in 1968 and
this is how he defined it and this is
you know a pretty big idea I mean nobody
had really thought of this and in these
terms before the idea that you could
take a string of text and actually break
it apart or have it interact with other
pieces of text in a direct way was a
pretty huge insight that nobody nobody
had really thought in that way about
what computers could do before and he
had it kind of he has a genius for
making up words right I won't try to
explain all of these but some of these
ideas are actually quite provocative
transclusion I think is a fascinating
idea it's the idea that you could have a
document that would instead of just
being a sort of simple link from one
document to another you could actually
embed a piece of one document inside of
another document and that it would be a
dynamic link so as one document every
document would be live so you could have
kind of a dynamic window into a piece of
information that could be constantly
updated and so that's what transclusion
is so it's a sort of more sophisticated
kind of hyperlinking in a way like
linking in a whole piece of a document
rather than just sort of a pointer to it
things like fresh hyper books and
anthropological hyper books you had this
idea that you could have different kinds
of structures appropriate to the kind of
information you had so you might have
something that was kind of an original
contribution like an original document
that somebody had written and that could
be a fresh hyper book and then somebody
else might come along and create kind of
an anthology or tie things together or
create an overview of that space and
that might call for a very different
structure or different looking and
acting kind of thing and a grant system
might be even at a higher level
something that ties it all together and
so as opposed to the web today where
everything sort of has to fit into a
webpage the outside you could actually
have a very different type of
interaction depending on what kind of
what kind of animal it was so so it's
worth taking a look at Nelson something
it's interesting he's his stuff is
mostly out of print by now
which is surprising he's actually
somebody I'd talk to somebody who's
trying to get an anthology was running
published he can't find a publisher
which is kind of surprising considering
you know his his influence but oh is it
that literary Machines
oh really I would love to see that yeah
really Wow interesting huh so he's more
recently I mean he's still going he was
recently at Oxford I think he left there
recently and he's still actively
pursuing his vision with Xanadu and a
new thing called seek zag which I
confess I don't understand well enough
to explain but it sounds interesting so
this is an exam sort of a diagram that's
pulled from some of the zig zag material
and this is one of his original sort of
skills or diagrams for for Xanadu like
things so it's actually thing about what
Nelson's web would have looked like even
though in some ways you know we have
Nelson's web but um but what we have
today is really not not nearly what he
had in mind notions of transclusion the
ability to zoom in and out of
information spaces he also did a lot of
pretty deep thinking about things like
copyright and intellectual property and
and one of the real key features of
Xanadu was really having protections in
place for that stuff that's sort of an
infrastructure level it's also
interesting - well these are some
examples of I think from Xanadu this is
the idea of like dynamically linked
documents
it's another idea if this is
transclusion where you can see that
different sections of documenter sort of
stitched together this was an
interesting prototype book by a guy
named Brad Neuberg who has actually done
some work with Engelbart as well
he developed a sort of experimental web
browser called paper airplane where he
tried to incorporate things like
transclusion and making it more of a
two-way sort of browser so the user
could use the web browser not just to
sort of consume information but actually
to publish back and sort of annotate
things so it's a pretty interesting
prototype it's floating around out there
out there somewhere so what does Nelson
think of the lab well not much and and
you could say this was sour grapes I'm
sure to some extent it is but but yes I
think some good points - I love the
phrase of the vacuous victory of
typesetters over authors sort of sums up
is this point of view I think
and and he still is sort of railing
against the you know the establishment
you know so he's a die-hard radical but
but fascinating guy I think you know
just you know certainly worth worth you
know understanding and appreciating for
first contribution so a couple of people
don't leave time for questions I was
going talk briefly about a couple of the
folks on trees Van Damme was actually
one of Nelson's early collaborators he
was the currently the he's at Bray's
been at Brown University for forever ice
I think chair of the computer science
department our he's even in a loft your
job in that but but for a long time he
led a lab that developed some of the
very earliest working hypertext systems
he worked with Nelson to create the
first was called the hypertext editing
system and this was in 68 69 this is
before there was a mouse and so instead
of a mouse they used a light pen and a
little foot pedal as a plenty device it
was like a point and kick interface yeah
and then that system evolved in
subsequent generations and you know more
more refined systems and they'll
eventually in the 1980s they started
building a system called intermedia
which was a pretty fascinating system
and I actually saw it right went around
I saw briefly when I was in college they
developed it was sort of a closed
network system it was all built on
McIntosh's and it was basically they
created a classroom environment with all
kinds of networked publishing and
authoring tools sort of built in and the
idea was that they they had things like
a networked word processor you know you
know drawing tools audio video and the
idea was that students in class could go
through and actually they would create
not just papers but create all kinds of
information in the system that would
then be networked together and
cross-referenced with other kinds of
documents like for instance you know
reference documents or papers and the
ideas they created kind of a little
petri lab petri dish kind of Lab for
hypertext where they had sort of a
controlled experiment but they would
have like 30 or 40 people in a class
actually networking their information
together and they did this both in the
sciences and in the humanities with
pretty interesting results a lot of the
stuff is sort of archived out there and
they created what some documents that
eventually got published as websites
but unfortunately this whole experiments
are wound down just as the web was
coming up they sort of around the night
early 90s they didn't get their next
round of funding and I think part of
that was there was sort of a recognition
that the web was coming and I think
unfortunately like a lot of these sort
of early alternative hypertext systems
the web has become such a just fact that
it's very hard for people to get real
research money to fund truly alternative
sorts of visions for this kind of thing
because the web is just such a you know
overwhelming force at this point but it
is interesting I think to look at some
of the recent history and see what sort
of ideas we're out there so in this
particular case with the intermediate
system iris was the name of the sort of
organization that ran it one interesting
idea is that they had network
connectivity sort of built into the GUI
at the GUI level so you didn't
necessarily have an idea of a web
browser but you had a word processor
with built-in network features you had
audio and video tools that were built
into the everything was built into the
network so you had sort of tools that
were appropriate for the tasks you were
doing that all had sort of embedded
access to the network
hyperlinks also worked both ways in this
environment so you could see outbound
link and an incoming link for any given
resource and it was a closed system
which is why they were able I think to
do things like two-way hyperlinks which
are sort of hard to in a way hard to
imagine on the web because it would just
be overwhelming but but in this case
they were able to create you know enough
of a bubble that they would have to
actually able to use them productively
so so a couple others just to mention
quickly Xerox note cards I was over at
Apple yesterday and felt like I had to
mention hyper cards and these are also
certainly important precursors although
they're less I think lesson less
interesting sort of a network and point
of view but certainly from in terms of
the heritage of thinking about hypertext
and how to create these sort of document
spaces Hypertech a hyper card is
certainly an interesting sort of
forerunner and then finally Tim
berners-lee who I think probably all we
all know who he is
he created the web and this was one of
his early screenshots and this is
actually the next box where he actually
wrote the first version of the web Brian
I was at I was at a conference in a few
years ago and actually had this on
exhibit at the Louvre briefly so I got a
snapshot on it so
you know it so I'm going to skip through
the rest of this quickly so just a few
just to sort of sum up a little bit when
we think when I think about the web as
it is today and so what we can learn
from some of these earlier precursors I
think it's a few things that I think are
interesting to think about one is this
notion of you know looking for ways of
having Moore's a more stable top-down
classification that could somehow work
in concert with a purely bottom-up
networked system I think the notion of
two-way linking is interesting to think
about although the implementation is you
know certainly conceptually challenging
but I think it's a powerful idea the
idea of links of pathways through
documents that could be visible I think
is certainly something that that would
be would be pretty interesting
gradations of link society of links that
carry some kind of meaning as you go
from one document to another and I think
also important Lee this notion of the
web browser as more of a two-way street
you know as opposed to sort of a tool
for consuming information and this is
something that Tim berners-lee himself
had said that he wishes that web
browsers had evolved to be more
collaborative or to have to give users
more of a voice and not just be
something that we used to read but that
it could also be used for writing and
for sort of interacting certainly if we
look at the popularity of things like
blogging tools we can see that the
demand for that sort of thing and also I
think this is the part I skipped over
but I think we're also seeing the rise
of increasingly sort of a kinds of
interaction online that seem to have
more to do with kind of traditional oral
culture than with more traditional forms
of literate writing and I think that's
interesting to think about from an
interaction point of view as well but
that's probably probably another talk so
anyway so that's these are a few
references
I'll leave I'll put these back up in a
minute but and this I've written about
this and among other things in a book
which I've got a few copies of here if
anyone's interested in and when I put
these up and see if anyone has any
questions sure I think we're going to go
microphone yeah
yeah so I don't know if you've heard
this anecdote but I guess one of Larry
and sergey's original projects was this
thing called bang back rub
back rub yeah I think old back rub and
the idea was to let you see backlinks
like you take a pill and you could see
what pages are linking to it and right
now unlike Google advant if you do like
advanced search that's one of the
options is you can find pages that link
to the page and so my question is kind
of about the - a link thing it seems to
me like something like that like kind of
a separate application or search tool to
look for backlinks is about all you
could ask for because I mean imagine if
I had a page and anyone who wanted to
could kind of edit my page and put a
link back to their page on it right like
you said it get like pretty cluttered
pretty fast right well I think you're
right I mean I think you wouldn't
necessarily you would want that to to be
available at sort of the browser level
you know and not it not necessarily it
you have to embed on the document like
track back you know but if that could be
more open and available think would also
be interesting if you could have more of
an ability to sort of put some
boundaries around that so it wasn't
necessarily totally you know looking at
everything but if you within the context
of sort of a group of people or an
organization you could actually have
sort of more sort of more of a social
view like a social network or someone
friends you and someplace like that and
then your link um yeah sometimes there's
been some experiments with that sort of
thing but recent have that kind of
control I think my other question is uh
what do you think of Wikipedia and or
social networks and do they do you feel
that they've kind of answered any of
these wantings well I think I mean I
have kind of mixed feelings about all
that stuff it's I mean I think Wikipedia
is interesting I mean it's fascinating
that it's this sort of exists right at
that I think this boundary between sort
of a traditional literate culture and
sort of an emerging sort of bottom-up
space you know I don't know that it
really answers any of these problems I
think it answers some other problems I
think it's interesting to keep an eye on
I think in terms of social networks I
think we are seeing this interest in
sort of looking at the social space of a
piece of information so if we look at
like a YouTube video or increasingly you
see this you know my day job I work at
the New York Times and we're seeing this
a lot we're actually increasingly users
are much more part of the the imprint of
a particular article
we look at you know what's the most
email or the most popular and
increasingly we're sort of trying to
make that more part of the record of
these things and you can look at things
like facebook and see you know there's
sort of a emerging interest I think in
having be able to look at a piece of
media in a social context and not just
sort of for the thing itself so see I
think to some extent that that's true so
I'm interested if you've done a study of
the sub area in search and indexing i I
see search now as sort of evidence of
the failure of the earlier ideas for
indexing that we're now Google has this
fairly inelegant brute-force search
we've indexed everything and we can do
some nice things with it right right but
for example there was a search tool in
the early 90s whose name escapes me by
Brewster Kahle
where our way alexa or ways or ways ways
was it yeah yeah yes and it have very
elegant user interface we can say this
is relevant this is not um have you
thought about that area well I mean the
example of comes to my for me is when
Yahoo was trying to categorize the whole
web remember they were they had this
whole big data army of librarians going
in there and trying to basically you
know organize every website on the web
into some top down directory and that
was obviously that just wasn't going to
work right so I think any kind of manual
attempt of doing that is sort of doomed
but but I think there is seems to me the
possibility of more some kind of
controlled information space that might
be kind of domain-specific you know for
instance if you took you know the
medical world they have this incredibly
sophisticated framework called the mesh
subject headings that are very you know
incredibly you know thought-out
controlled vocabulary for managing
medical information and it seems to me
if there were facility to leverage some
of that kind of thinking has already
been done in a specific domain and
through some sort of automated process
you know apply that and I don't quite
know how that would work but but I think
there are you know there is you know a
pretty good heritage of thinking about
controlled vocabulary that I think is
being kind of left by the wayside in the
sort of bottom-up world of the web and I
don't know you know if you're going to
see how things happen with like the may
also variants in like a meta web project
and how that's going to play out you
know in terms of doing more sort of
automated classification or mapping of
chips between documents but but yeah
it's a good question I don't claim to
have that you know the crystal ball
there but something to think about
sure you mentioned a couple things you'd
like to see at a high level in the web
and early on you mentioned that the web
is built on sort of crude low-level
infrastructure and I'm aware that you
know one generations infrastructure that
enables a certain level of technology is
often an obstacle to the next generation
of things I wonder if you have
recommendations about what sort of
low-level technology would enable is
sorts of things that you see is
desirable for the next generation well I
think it would be nice to see web
browsers take another step I mean see
that the web browser hasn't really
evolved in seven eight years really you
know I feel like a lot of the ability to
manage your identity I think is a
critical sort of shortcoming and I think
that would actually facilitate a lot of
a lot of these kinds of things of having
a better sort of identity management
facility within the web browser which
would open up all kinds of possibilities
not having to have to for instance
sign-on to every site and that sort of
thing I think you know I think most of
the the kinds of things that I would
like to see the other big thing for me
would be having a better sort of session
state within the browser like the fact
that you have basically just this flat
sort of metaphor this document metaphor
that we're all sort of stuck with we're
looking at basically a page that gets
delivered and it's a very sort of
antiquated metaphor anyway it's a print
metaphor and people over the years have
tried to sort of work around that with
things like Ajax or you know Mac meteor
now Adobe is doing some things trying to
use flash as a platform for doing more
dynamic session state kind of stuff but
the you know the web browser itself just
doesn't it may think HTTP is really just
such a sort of brute force sort of
simple thing that it really does
preclude doing a more interesting sort
of application he sort of design without
having to come up with sort of you know
strange workaround so so I think those
are a couple things that I'd like to see
that seem like they might be possible
yep morning Adam I got the monk you've
talked about what it could be and what
what precursors there were but I'm
wondering if you have an opinion above
sort of why the web is the way it is I
think Ted Elsa would say something like
bad drives out good right but maybe it
was just the right time for it or maybe
it was open versus closed well yeah I
mean I think the reason the web has been
so successful as it is open and the fact
that it is pretty simple and the fact
that anybody more or less can build a
webpage and it's sort of simplicity is
the key to its success
and so you can't mean I'm not necessary
mean I'm not again I'm not opposed to
the web and I think it's great that's
like made a living off of it but but I
think there's a even so I think there's
still some basic limitations that I
think could still be addressed within
that framework I think but I think you
know the reason that Nelson's vision
didn't take off me further apart from
the fact that it was never fully built
and released it was kind of a closed
system and so I think the openness of
the web is really the key to it and that
the price of that is some level of sort
of the lowest common denominator
solution so that's sort of is what it is
but so what it's a mr. Shirota question
you want to make sure oh I'm sorry we
have one more and then well yeah yeah
would you consider the Semantic Web to
be yet another web that wasn't I think
it's too early to say I mean I think
that's sort of the conventional wisdom
about the Semantic Web is that it's sort
of overblown and you know who knows but
I think in some ways it's it's still
entirely possible that I mentioned
metaweb I mean I think it's that it's
entirely possible that could turn into
something I mean I haven't really seen
the details of it yet but it seems like
the right idea I think things like RDF I
mean I think there's the potential there
I think what it's easily with the
Semantic Web it's a lot of the
infrastructure doesn't really exist to
support it but I think it's certainly
within certain domains I think it's
quite possible where there's a real sort
of commercial value to building that
kind of machine to machine level
communication I'm not sure if there's
going to be sort of a completely open
public Semantic Web that's really going
to work in the same way that the web
work I think it's just I'm not sure of
the commercial drivers are there to make
that
happen but but I but I think spell could
I mean I haven't written it off by any
means and I think it's literally going
so so so I guess I get one last shot
it's been surf I feel like a dinosaur
that wandered into the lecture at the
Museum two observations one of them
three one of them is that the web today
is still very ephemeral and so one of
the problems we have is the ability to
capture something a link for example and
keep it alive for a long period of times
right now binding to a domain name is
not a great way of preserving things
over long periods of time so we're
missing that element the other thing
that I worry about is bit rot the
ability to actual interpret the bits
that are out there in the net it depends
on the pieces of software you have to
help you figure out what the bits mean
and that too is very ephemeral and so if
we're trying to think about information
systems that last for a thousand years
we have a big problem in front of us
because the software then helps us
figure out what the bits mean isn't
permanent or it isn't is we know we
don't have any mechanisms for assuring
that it's there so in a sense everything
including today's web has the potential
for disintegrating if we don't start
thinking hard about how to preserve it
so I leave that with a little problem in
your game Hall effects now that I think
that that's a great excellent point I
mean I think there's some risk that you
know the web we're creating this vast
kind of cultural amnesia because stuff
that I mean I've worked on style you
know spent years working on stuff that
there's no trace of it on the web
anymore you know it's I think the lack
of any kind of archiving facility I
think is a big problem that eventually
is going to become a bigger bigger
problem
I think it's also in my previous life I
used to work in a library it's amazing
to go back and look at a you know there
are books that were written you know in
the 12th century that you can still open
up that were printed on like you know
cows you know on vellum on cow skin you
know and those things are perfectly well
preserved and yet there are disk drives
you know there are only 20 years old
that are unreadable at this point so you
know it all seems very permanent you're
right I think it may be maybe very
ephemeral so I love to see them
yeah thank you thank you all yeah thanks
