is Ming and I'm the jolly good fellow of
Google I'm so delighted today to welcome
my friend and amazing human being dr.
Richie Davidson there's so much I can
say about Richie and I don't I'm not
even sure where to begin so I'll just
give you the big picture Richie is the
William James and villas research
professor of psychology and psychiatry
at the University of wisconsin-madison
which his work is so important that it
is changing the world and will continue
to change the world in very important
ways early in his career Richie the
pioneering work which found that certain
parts of the brain were specially linked
to positive and negative emotions and he
went on to become a pioneer in the field
of affective neuroscience which is the
study of neural mechanisms of emotion
and as if pioneering one view of science
is not enough he also did pioneering
work in something called neuroplasticity
which is the idea that the brain is
malleable that we can transform our
brains with what we think and what we do
and with rigorous neuroscience Richie
and his team has shown that we can all
extend our range of mental and emotional
capabilities including including trading
our training our minds to be happy and
over the years which he has won many
awards including the most prestigious
award given by the American
Psychological Association which is the
distinguished scientific contribution
award he was also named one of Time
Magazine's 100 most influential people
in the world in 2006 and he wasn't even
2005 and 2007 I think was slacking off
him yeah sorry just kidding and I look
forward to Richie winning a Nobel Prize
or two and in person
Richie's just a wonderful man and I'm in
awe of him and my friends I give you dr.
Richie Davidson
thank you all so much it's really a
wonderful honor to be with you all today
and what I'd like to do today is to
share with you some of the excitement
and findings from the hybrid new field
of contemplative neuroscience which is
where I am investing a lot of my
personal attention and energy these days
so with that is a little brief
introduction let me tell you what
contemplative neuroscience is and give
you a sense of the range of how we can
approach this from a scientific
perspective today we've been interested
in using the best tools of neuroscience
and the concepts of neuroscience to
understand how the brain can be
transformed through the engagement with
purely mental practices that have been
derived from the world's great
contemplative traditions the framework
of this work as Meg mentioned is the
idea of neuroplasticity and
neuroplasticity simply refers to the
fact that the brain is the organ which
is built to change in response to
experience more than any other organ in
our body there are many different
mechanisms of neuroplasticity and it is
clear that the intentional deployment of
specific mental training strategies can
induce plastic changes in the brain
which endure and which can transform our
cognitive and emotional styles and I
hope to convince you of that today I'll
talk also a little bit about relations
between the brain and experience and how
we can actually study that objectively
in the laboratory a little bit about the
embodied mind the
yeah that our minds and brains are not
simply supported by a disembodied
architecture but rather there is
bi-directional communication between the
brain in the body which provides a
mechanism for our minds to influence our
bodies in ways that may be consequential
for health and I will make some
references to that also and I'll end
with some comments on the impact of this
work on both science and society so let
me say a little bit about this
propitious historical moment in which we
all find ourselves and that is a moment
where there is an extraordinary
possibility of a serious interchange
between neuroplasticity and ideas and
techniques from neuroscience and
contemplative practice some of this is
driven by developments in science one of
those is epigenetics epigenetics refers
to the fact that genes are regulated by
the environments in which those genes
reside the idea that our genetic
structure provides and in an unalterable
blueprint which then affects our
behavior in a deterministic way is an
antiquated wrongheaded newtonian
conception of genetics it's not the way
things work the genes that particularly
that are expressed in our brains are
ones that are tremendously influenced by
the environment including our mental
environment we know that there are
certain mental dispositions that can
produce an impact on gene expression
some of those expression changes can
persist throughout the entire life of an
organism so there there is really an
extraordinary
window that is provided into the brain
through modern research and epigenetics
there are translational research
initiatives some of which I'll talk
about today where we're taking some of
these ideas from the laboratory and
bringing them into the field and we can
glean from translational studies in the
field the impact of certain
contemplative practices in real-world
settings and collect data in the process
that will both help refine the methods
the the contemplative strategies
themselves as well as provide evidence
of their impact one of the things that
I've been talking a lot about these days
both within my lab as well as outside is
an idea called neroli inspired
behavioral interventions it turns out
that there is no more effective way to
produce localized and specific changes
in the brain than behavioral or mental
interventions behavioral or mental
interventions can produce more specific
biological changes than any currently
known biological method that is any
known medication for example medications
affect the brain quite systemically they
often produce effects in systems other
than those that were targets of the
intervention to begin with behavioral
strategies are the way to produce more
specific effects in the brain than any
known intervention today another idea
that I've been banding about on the
bully pulpits that I've been privileged
to stand on is this one of putting the
brain back into met biomedicine which is
a pathway to putting the mind back into
medicine
we know that psychosocial factors for
example play a very significant role in
modulating the course of certain
Nicholas's like cardiovascular disease
asthma these are disorders that are
major public health concerns if the
environment the psychosocial environment
can modulate these disorders presumably
information from the environment is
getting in and getting under the skin
and changing the brain in ways which
have impact on the body by working out
the mechanisms through which the brain
communicates with the body we can begin
to put the mind back into medicine in a
way which will offer potentially new
targets of interventions which is
precisely one of the important
strategies that were pursuing with
disorders for example like asthma okay
so that's just a few teasers I want to
just give you a feel for some of the
kinds of work that we've been doing over
the last several years which are brought
us to this point and one of the ones
that we've been very interested in in
particular is the possibility that we
can through mental exercise voluntarily
enhance compassion this is a an idea
which was really first first emerged in
the context of dialogues that we've held
with the Dalai Lama in the context of
meetings that were put on by the mind
and life Institute and actually Adam
Engle is in the audience here who is the
director of the mind and life Institute
which is an organization that has been
at the forefront of promoting a dialogue
between the world's great contemplative
traditions and modern science and one of
the ideas that emerged in these
dialogues many years ago was the
prospect of putting compassion on the
scientific map and when I first met the
Dalai Lama in 1992 I made a commitment
to myself and to the Dalai Lama that I
was going to come out of the closet with
my interests in meditation which had
been very subterranean
up until then I went on my first
meditation retreat in 1974 when I was a
second year graduate student at Harvard
and my the faculty there were ready to
dismiss me as someone who is totally
abandoning ship but I did have the the
clear sense that I would come back to
science and that I really wasn't leaving
science but in any case those interests
were kept under the rug for quite some
time in 1992 I first met His Holiness
and at that meeting I had a very
profound understanding that now was the
right time to come out of the closet and
to go public with this interest and also
to have the prospect of bringing the
concepts and tools from neuroscience
that we had honed so effectively in the
study of negative states like anxiety
and fear and sadness and bring those
same strategies to study positive mental
qualities virtuous mental qualities like
compassion so one of the ways that we
thought would be a useful beginning step
is okay let's take people who are the
putative experts in the voluntary
cultivation of compassion now it turns
out that there are such people who spend
literally thousands of hours actually
tens of thousands of hours formally
practicing particular mental strategies
that are designed to cultivate
compassion and we launched a study in
the year 2000 with a long-term
contemplative practitioners these
included Tibetan Buddhist monks as well
as lay people most of whom resided in
Asia and we flew them over to our lab in
Madison Wisconsin and had them in
residence for a number of days where
they were undergoing testing and a
number of people close to his holiness
were instrumental including his own
leanness himself in hell
bring us to recruit participants for
this unusual project we began an
incredibly simple way we started - we
decided to start in a very basic way and
what we did is illustrated here in a
very simple cartoon of the experimental
protocol where we had practitioners
alternate periods where they were just
in a neutral state and periods during
which they are meditating excuse me in
this case cultivating compassion and
they were doing this within short
periods of time and on during these
neutral and meditation periods we
challenged their meditation states and I
won't play these for you but we
presented auditory stimuli that were
very very loud and in one case they were
strongly negative emotional stimuli that
were signs auditory signs of human
suffering they were cries and screams
that were very pronounced and you can
think of this you know when you go to a
cardiologist you might sometimes be
given a cardiac stress test where you're
challenged on a treadmill well this is a
brain stress test if you will but
specifically looking at how
practitioners respond to stimuli that
depict humans suffering when they're
either in a neutral state or in this
state where they're generating
compassion voluntarily now what does it
mean to generate compassion voluntarily
one of the practitioners is actually
someone quite well-known who was is on
his picture can be found on Ming's wall
and he is matthieu ricard
a well-known
monk he has been a Buddhist monk since
1967 he's French by nationality the
wonderful thing about mathieu is that he
also holds a PhD in molecular biology
from the Pasteur Institute where he
worked with Francois Jacobi the Nobel
laureate in the words of met you this is
what the practitioners were doing during
this particular protocol when they were
generating voluntarily the state of
compassion and I'll just read part of
this to you he said what we have tried
to do for the sake of the experiment is
to generate a state in which love and
compassion permeate the whole mind with
no other consideration reasoning or
discursive thoughts this is sometimes
called pure compassion now you know
there's those commercials on television
which tell you don't try this at home
well I would encourage all of you to try
this at home but don't be disappointed
if it you find that your whole mind with
no other consideration reasoning or
discursive thoughts is permeated by love
and compassion this is something that
takes a lot of practice and that's
precisely the idea of using the long
term practitioners in the first place so
this is a picture of met you and I love
to show this picture because he had been
in the MRI scanner for more than three
hours just when this picture was taken
just prior to when this picture was
taken most people don't look like this
when they come out of the scanner after
being in there for three hours so he is
someone who is wonderful to have in the
laboratory because he does this so
joyously
and one of the really virtues of working
with these long-term practitioners is
they can have these short periods of
meditation where they're generating
compassion and at least by their own
report they're able to do this very
easily in the crazy environment of the
laboratory while they're lying in
MRI scanner that feels like a jackhammer
and is producing very loud sounds from
the scanner itself so we've been
interested in what brain circuits are
recruited when these long term
practitioners voluntarily generate
compassion and I should mention that we
compare these two age-matched controls
where we've taught them the same
practice and actually Mathura car
developed a training regime that we can
offer to novice practitioners who wish
to learn the practice and these are
individuals who are interested in
meditating had never done it before
and they practiced for one week prior to
coming into the laboratory this is a
busy slide and I'll only walk you
through part of it but one of the brain
regions which is strongly modulated by
this meditation practice is a very
interesting part of the brain and it's
called the insula and specifically the
anterior insula which is shown in this
axial image here the insula is a region
of cortex that is the a part of the
brain that is the only part of the brain
to contain a viscera topic map of the
body and what that means is that the
visceral organs are actually mapped like
like retina toppy like the eye is mapped
in the visual cortex the visceral organs
are mapped in the insula so this is a
region of the brain through which
information from the body is convey to
other circuits in the brain and it's
also a part of the brain that has
descending pathways to these different
visceral organs and can modulate
activity in those organs and what we
find is that in the long-term
practitioners they are the ones in red
down here the solid lines are during
meditation the dotted lines are during
neutral the blue lines are the novice
practitioners and what you can see is
these are the
Ponce's using functional MRI that we
detect in the insula when the long-term
practitioners are exposed to these
negative emotional sounds and what you
can see is a big difference between the
dotted line and the solid line in red
for the long-term practitioners it
indicates that activity in their insula
is being strongly modulated by their
meditation practice whereas in the
novices there's really no difference
between the neutral and the meditation
periods and it suggests that the insula
is an important piece of the story in
terms of how the brain is changed in
response to compassion training there
it's not just the insula however there
are a number of other parts of the brain
that are dramatically altered in
function by compassion meditation and
two additional regions are the amygdala
which plays a very critical role in
emotion and this area called the T PJ on
the right hand in the right hemisphere
it stands for the temporoparietal
Junction and the T PJ has been strongly
implicated in perspective-taking
and particularly the adoption of another
person's perspective and it's been
strongly implicated in empathy and what
we see in all of these cases is that
activity in these regions during the
generation of compassion is strongly
elevated in the long term practitioners
but not in these novice controls now one
of the things we've been doing very
recently is this and I have to tell you
a little anecdote before I show you this
this next set of findings one of the
early visits that we made to Dharamsala
India to be with His Holiness was a
visit where he asked us if we would give
a talk to young monks in the Nam Gael
monastery the monastery connected to his
residence and this was a time when
Francisco Varela was alive Francisco it
was a very eminent
neurobiologist who is one of the
cofounders of the mind and life
Institute and who developed the idea and
a hybrid discipline that he called neuro
phenomenology which I'll talk about in a
little while but francisco is on this
visit and we gave this talk to these
young months in the Nam Yale monastery
there about 200 monks in the audience
all sitting dutifully on cushions on the
floor and we had instrumentation with us
on that visit we thought that instead of
just giving a dry academic lecture we'd
actually show them how this stuff is
done and so we put electrodes on
Francisco and we had a laptop and we
were showing him we were showing the
monks the display of brain oscillations
brain electrical activity on the laptop
that we can record from a person's head
and when we explain you when we put the
cap on to measure the brain activity and
showed them on the laptop as soon as we
did this all 200 monks just burst out
laughing just cracking up hysterically
and we thought that they were laughing
because the francisco looked kind of
funny with the electrode cap on it turns
out that they were laughing at where we
were placing our electrodes they were
they thought it was hysterical that we
thought that the key to compassion was
the head as opposed to the heart now it
took us many decades to get back to
their editorial comment about our lack
of insight and very recently we have
been interested in how the heart and the
brain are actually interconnected during
the generation of compassion and I won't
go into this in a lot of detail there
are a lot of details to unpack here and
this is some very new work that we've
just been published in 2009 but one of
the on what you're seeing here one of
the really cool things that we can do is
actually take MRI
scans of the heart itself and it turns
out that there you can do functional MRI
of the heart and there are a group of
radiologists who are now interested in
the development of non-invasive methods
for probing cardiac function that will
eventually eliminate cardiac angiography
and it's done through the use of
real-time MRI and so what you're seeing
here is an image of cardiac gated MRI
where we gate the MRI scanner we record
the electrocardiogram in the scanner and
we gate the acquisitions to the onset of
the main ventricular contraction that we
can detect with the EKG recording and
this is a slice through the left
ventricle and you can compute various
parameters of cardiac function in this
way and it provides some really cool
information and I'll just show you a
little bit of this this is from a new
paper
Antoine Lutz is a scientist in our
Center and if you just look at heart
rate there are a lot of other measures
that we can derive but if you just look
at heart rate it turns out that during
the generation of compassion among the
long term practitioners you actually see
an elevation of heart rate during the
practice itself compared to the novice
practitioners and what's really
interesting is this part of the brain
called the insula that I mentioned
earlier is strongly coupled to the
cardiac change in the long term
practitioners and not in the novices it
appears that this region of the brain is
sensitive to and driving we think the
cardiac change and so this is a
parameter of coupling that is on the
ordinate here and it just shows you that
during compassion but not during the
neutral period there's much stronger
coupling in the expert practitioners in
red compared to the novices in blue and
it suggests indeed that there's
something about neuro cardiac couple
during compassion which we think is very
important and this just shows another
area of the brain which is an area of
the mid cingulate region which also has
been implicated in various kinds of
emotional processing which shows some of
the same kinds of differences as well
now one of the things I'm always asked
when I talk about this work in long-term
practitioners I should mention these
long-term practitioners are really
long-term practitioners they have to
have done a minimum of 10,000 hours of
formal practice now 10,000 hours was not
just a number we pulled out of the Hat
it turns out that for multiple kinds of
expertise sort of entry-level expertise
in virtually any complex domain starts
at about 10,000 hours so that's how many
hours you got to put in to get to sort
of the entry level of expertise and in
our study the average number of lifetime
hours of practice among the long-term
practitioners was approximately 34,000
hours of practice every one of our
practitioners has completed at once at
least once through one three-year
retreat where they are practicing a
minimum of eight hours a day for three
continuous years many of them have done
multiple three-year retreats so these
are individuals who've really spent a
very significant part of their adult
life cultivating these qualities now I'm
always asked well that's really
interesting and fine but there's no way
in the world I'm going to put in
anywhere near that amount of time so can
short-term training be beneficial and so
the study that I'm about to describe to
you is a study that we undertook to
examine just that question and this is a
study that is still in the process of
being completed we're analyzing still
analyzing the data it's being driven by
a wonderfully talented graduate student
in my lab by the name of Helen Wang and
one of the cool things that we did in
this study is to take meditation naive
individuals and offer them two weeks of
training just two weeks and we did MRI
scans before and after this two weeks of
training to determine whether just two
weeks of training 30 minutes a day
actually can produce demonstrable
changes in brain function moreover this
was a study where when participants
signed up they were told that this was a
research project in which they were
going to be offered an intervention
that's designed to cultivate well-being
we randomly assign people to either a
group where they receive compassion
training or a group where they receive
training derived from cognitive therapy
that trains people to cognitively
reappraise situations to appraise them
in ways that are more positive and so
this was a true randomized control trial
and the other really cool thing about
this study is in addition to the
participants getting comparable amounts
of training in each case 30 minutes a
day for two weeks the training was
delivered over the internet and so we
developed a way to do this over the
internet participants logged on to a
protected website and they received 30
minutes a day of training the other
virtue of having them do this online is
that we were able to monitor that they
were actually doing it because they had
to make some responses as they were
going along and they in order to advance
from one step of the training to the
next they had to make certain keystrokes
so it enabled us to have some controls
over what they were actually doing so
this just summarizes some of these key
components of the methods it was two
weeks of compassion daily practice over
the Internet
thirty minutes a day the comparison
group was taught cognitive reappraisal
the cognitive reappraisal was delivered
in the same way 30 minutes a day over
the Internet we had experts design each
of these two trainings and the experts
each believed and each had comparable
levels of confidence that the training
that they were designing would produce
beneficial effects in the individuals to
whom it was offered now let me say a
little bit about what the elements of
the compassion training were
participants were asked to contemplate
and to visualize the suffering and then
wishing the freedom from suffering for a
number of different classes of people
first a loved one now it's it's not very
difficult for most people to conjure up
visualize someone that you love it could
be a family member a spouse a child to
visualize this and visualize suffering
that they may have encountered and then
wish that they be free from that
suffering in addition to a loved one
there they also direct this meditation
to themselves in addition we have them
directed to a stranger this is someone
that they actually see on a regular
basis it might be a bus driver it might
be a cashier it might be a janitor
someone they see on a regular basis but
who's live whose life they really don't
know much about and they they're asked
to do the same thing for them to
visualize them to visualize whatever
suffering they think may they may be
having and then the freedom from that
suffering then a person is asked to
visualize and contemplate a difficult
person someone who pushes your buttons
and then engage in that same process for
that person and finally directing this
to all beings participants use mental
phrases that are silently repeated the
phrase most often used was may you be
free from suffering may you experience
joy and
they're instructed to notice visceral
sensations especially around the area of
the heart as they engage in this
practice and finally they are instructed
to feel the compassion emotionally and
not simply to repeat the phrases
cognitively now this was a fairly
elaborate experiment I'm only going to
be telling you about very selected
pieces of it
we have people go through a simulator
which is a mock MRI scanner before this
all happens at time one is a period
prior to their random assignment to
either the compassion group of the
reappraisal group they come into the
laboratory and they receive they get an
MRI scan and some questionnaires they
then go through two weeks of training
for 30 minutes a day on the internet and
then at the end they get another MRI
scan and we also give them some economic
game tasks and a donation task which
both of which I'll tell you about but
these are ways of assessing altruistic
behavior to see if we can get an actual
behavioral measure of the impact of
compassion training so I'll say a little
bit about economic games now about ten
or fifteen years ago one of my good
friends dent Danny Kahneman who is a
psychologist at Princeton who also won
the Nobel Prize in Economics maybe five
or six years ago and does work in
behavioral economics Danny once said to
me he said Richie if you really want to
change the world
you better start hanging out more with
economists and so I've been taking that
to heart and certainly have spent much
more time in the last five years with
economists and one of the things they do
is they have very clever ways of using
behavioral tasks in the laboratory to
make inferences about cooperative and
altruistic behavior and so we designed a
game based upon some things in the
literature but this is a unique game and
I'll walk you through through the
essential elements of this
the game involves three players a
dictator a recipient and a third party
we're interested in the behavior of the
third party at the beginning of the game
the dictator is endowed with a certain
amount of money as is the third party
the dictator makes the first move and
can transfer some amount of money to the
recipient the third party can act to
redistribute money from the dictator to
the recipient so that the transaction is
rendered more fair so let's say the
dictator only gives the recipient a
really small amount of the money that he
was endowed with to begin with the third
party can use some of the money that he
was endowed with to take money from the
dictator transfer it to the recipient
and the money is doubled in the process
the participants are informed that they
will actually be given all of the money
that they play with so this is for real
there's no deception and they actually
walk away with the money that that is
transacted and it turns out that the the
cooperative solution is a solution that
maximizes the gain among all the
participants yes
sorry uh no this is you mean it should
be subtracted is that well I'm not sure
what your well let me actually show you
a subsequent slide it may help to
clarify this so I want to just show you
in an independent sample not from the
intervention study itself but a study
where we had a group of non-meditators
come into the laboratory and play this
game what we found is that among when
when a dictator makes an unfair offer
that's these bars here if a person
reports themselves to have very high
levels of empathy on a standardized
measure of empathy if they're the third
party they redistribute significantly
more money compared with individuals who
report themselves to have low empathy
and in response to fair or generous
offers by the dictator there are no
differences in the amount of
redistribution as a function of empathy
so what these data simply indicate is
that those individuals who are behaving
in the third party who redistribute more
wealth they are the ones who also report
high levels of empathy and that this is
just another way of showing it so higher
levels of empathic concern are
associated with more funds that are
redistributed by that third party now if
you look at the effects of compassion
training it turns out after just two
weeks of compassion training there is a
significant difference in the
performance on this game with the
participants after two weeks of
compassion training redistributing more
wealth compared to the group that was
assigned to the reappraisal condition
remem
these participants were randomly
assigned at the outset so these are not
pre-existing differences now in terms of
the brain imaging findings I'll just
show you a snippet here one of the
things that we did in addition to the
economic games is we gave people a
simple donation task this was a study
done in college students and we paid
them a hundred and sixty-five dollars to
participate in this study and we told
them at the end of this study that I'll
just move to that we told them at the
end of the study that we were going to
offer them the opportunity to donate
some amount of money that they were
receiving to any charitable cause of
their choosing the only constraint was
that the charitable organization had to
have an online mechanism for
contributing so this is you can think of
it as a real-world index of helping
behavior and they were offered the
opportunity to donate any amount of
money from the funds that they were
being given to any charitable cause and
this was again for real there was no
deception
they actually executed the transaction
online and did it in private so there
was no one looking over their shoulder
okay now there was no difference between
the compassion group and the comparison
group excuse me and how much money was
redistributed so two weeks of compassion
training is insufficient to produce any
change in this donation task it was
probably naive for us to think that we
could produce a change after two weeks
however we did find something
interesting and that is when we looked
at the brain data it turns out that
among people in the compassion group
those who showed more activation in an
area of the brain that's been implicated
in positive emotion
were the ones who donated more money so
the greater the activation changed that
is the more increase there was an
activation in this region as a
consequence of the two weeks of
compassion training the more money was
donated by the participants in the
compassion group the participants in the
reappraisal group showed no significant
relation between activation in this
region and donations so what these data
suggest is that people respond to this
compassion training in a very variable
way which is not surprising to us and
those who respond the most who are
showing the biggest boost in activation
in this brain region are the ones who
show the largest increase the largest
amount of donation on this donation task
we also looked at changes in this region
on certain questionnaire measures that
we gave and there's this measure of
self-reported love I must confess that
I'm not a big fan of these kind of
self-report measures but nevertheless we
give them to see if we can learn
anything these are two example items
from this questionnaire I develop strong
feelings of closeness to people easily I
find it easy to trust others those are
two items and it turns out that people
in the compassion group again who show
greater activation in the nucleus
accumbens report a greater increase in
love from time one to time two that is
over the course of two weeks so the
bigger the boost and signal in this
region that has been associated
previously with positive emotion the
greater the increases in love they
report and you can see that the purple
dots are the participants in the
compassion group the blue are the ones
in the reappraisal group and the
participants in the compassion group are
showing the biggest boost in both the
measure the self-report measure of love
as well as in this brain signal
so one of the things that we are talking
about at lunch was pushing the envelope
on methods to interrogate brain function
and structure which is a important piece
of what we do in our Center so there's a
strong methodological component about a
third of the scientists in my group or
physicists these days who are developing
new methods and one of the methods that
we use is diffusion tensor imaging and
the uncinate fasciculus is a pathway
that connects limbic regions onto the
prefrontal cortex and in order to
regulate our emotions to change our
relationship to our emotions which is
something that we hypothesize occurs
through certain kinds of contemplative
training we think that this pathway is
going to be a target of those
contemplative interventions and so this
is just the kind of image that you can
get with diffusion tensor imaging and
this is the incident fasciculus and we
can quantitate parameters of the fibre
track that goes between these regions
and this is something that we're
interested in examining as a potential
structural target of training and is
part of our ongoing research today I
want to just briefly talk about neuro
phenomenology because the relationship
between the brain and experience is
really a central piece of what we do and
one of the wonderful opportunities in
working with long-term meditation
practitioners is these are people who
have spent years familiarizing
themselves with the mechanisms of their
own mind and when we went into this we
had to conjecture that we would find
closer connections closer correlations
more robust correlations between
people's reports
of their experience and neural
correlates of the experience among
long-term practitioners because these
long-term practitioners spent years
training their mind to become familiar
with its processes and content and so if
we were examining correlations between
the brain and experience we would
observe those correlations more robustly
in these long-term practitioners and so
this is an enterprise as I mentioned
earlier which was pioneered by Francisco
Varela and so we have been looking at
this recently and this is just an
example of how we do it this is a a monk
in our lab where we're monitoring brain
electrical signals with a 256 channel
net that's on the head and the
practitioner is rating the clarity of
his experience clarity is a specific
technical term in the contemplatively
kakan of practice and there's quite a
lot of variation in the clarity of
experience that these practitioners
report when they're engaged in
meditation so we have a practitioner
meditating and they are reporting on the
clarity of their experience this is
actually a picture from some early work
in recent work through they are using a
joystick to rate this continuously and
this is the kind of data that we can get
where what you're what you see in red is
a metric that is related to their
reports of clarity on a moment-to-moment
basis this is time moving along the
abscissa and on the ordinate here for
the red line is the clarity of
experience and the blue is a particular
parameter of brain activity of neural
oscillation that we've previously found
to be robustly increased during
meditation
practice its oscillations in the gamma
frequency range these are about 40
cycles per second and they are thought
to play a very important role in certain
kinds of learning and we see them very
robustly in these long-term
practitioners and so this just shows the
correlation across time within a
practitioner between his reports of the
clarity of experience and the the
magnitude of signal in the Gamma
frequency range that's recorded with
this measure of brain electrical
activity so this is from one
practitioner and this is another example
where there are different blocks
throughout several days of practice and
this is the quantitative correlation
these are again the correlations between
their verbal reports and the gamma
signal and it turns out that these
correlations are highly reproducible the
blue lines are the correlations in the
gamma range in the gamma frequency the
maroon is correlations in another
frequency band that's not nearly as
robust and each unit here a 1 a 2 etc
through a 9 is a different practitioner
so this is for nine different
practitioners some of whom we tested on
repeated days and what you can see is
that most of the correlations exceed
point six and all the correlations are
positive and a way to summarize it is
here this just shows a depiction of the
spatial distribution of these
correlations across the head and you can
see that these correlations are quite
restricted to the frontal region this is
an aerial view of the head this is the
nose here and the red depicts highly
significant correlations and you can see
that that is found in these long-term
practitioners in the frontal scalp
region and we do not find correlations
that are significant at all in
mr. practitioners now in the next
remaining minutes I want to give you two
other examples one is the effects of
these kinds of practices on attention
and the other is the effects on
peripheral biology and in the interest
of time I'm going to skip a lot of the
details but I want to read you this one
quote this is really a favorite quote of
mine this was written in 1890 in the
chapter on attention in William James's
2 volume tome the principles of
psychology it's really an amazing
statement he said and the Faculty of
voluntarily bringing back a wandering
attention over and over again is the
very root of judgment character and will
no one is compo soui if you have it not
an education which should improve this
faculty would be the education par
excellence and by the way the italics
are in the original but it is easier to
define this ideal than to give practical
directions for bringing it about I think
if James had more contact with the
contemplative traditions he would
clearly see the utility of this kind of
training for attention and this is a
process that we know a lot about in
terms of its underlying neural basis and
we know how to measure it very
sensitively behaviorally in the
laboratory and I won't go through a lot
of details but one of the ways we look
at it is with the attentional blink task
and just let me tell you what this task
is if you are presented with a rapid
stream of stimuli one every tenth of a
second so you get ten stimuli a second
and say you get a stream of letters and
every now and then there are numbers and
I simply ask you to report every number
that you see in a stream of mostly
letters it turns out that you will most
likely miss a second number if it
follows an initial number within a
window of around three or four hundred
milliseconds this is known as the
attentional blink it's as if your
attention is blinking in
as if you are going momentarily
unconscious so the stimulus is presented
but you are totally unaware of it and
many psychologists have referred to this
as a kind of neural refractory period
where the brain is just in a in a off
period and you simply are inaccessible
to incoming information we were
skeptical of that conjecture and we had
the intuition that training in certain
kinds of meditation practices which
specifically strengthened attention
should transform this process and
decrease the propensity to show this
attentional blink or another way to say
it in a more positive way is it simply
increases awareness moment to moment
awareness and that's exactly what
happens I won't go through all the
details but we were able to show that
over the course of three months of
training longitudinally and it changes
brain function in predictable ways as
well these are data which have been
which were published a couple of years
ago one of the characteristics of kids
with ADHD is that they have very
variable response time distributions the
distributions in the middle here are
skewed distributions that come from kids
with ADHD where you find a right-sided
skew which means that they're showing
abnormally long response times whereas
these are normal subjects up here that
show a much tighter distribution and it
turns out that meditation tightens your
distribution of response times to make
it much less variable and it changes
certain brain patterns which promote
this kind of stability and again this is
very new work that's just impressed now
and I won't go through the details
because we don't have time let me just
give you a teaser about peripheral
biology we did a study several years ago
where we had people go through an
eight-week meditation training procedure
the training was done in the beginning
of September it ended
around Thanksgiving time and we gave
people flu shots at the end of their
training and we had a control group and
we simply looked at antibody titers
mounted in response to the influenza
vaccine and this is what you find after
eight weeks of training there's a
significantly more robust response to
influenza vaccine suggesting that if
these people are exposed to comparable
amounts of virus the people who went
through eight weeks of meditation would
have a more robust immune response from
the vaccine so this is just eight weeks
of training in otherwise naive subjects
more recently we have decided we need to
do this a little bit more rigorously and
experimentally and this is a bit of a
gruesome picture but we this is blown-up
magnified we use a vacuum procedure I
was telling some people over lunch about
this where we raised the first layer of
skin over a course of about 45 minutes
to create a blisters there are 12
blisters in a ring it's a painless
procedure I've had this done to myself
too many times we smear capsaicin cream
around the blister which produces a
local flare or an inflammation we can
then extract the fluid from the blisters
and look at molecular markers that are
associated with healing and inflammation
to look at local changes in healing and
we can compute measures of flare size
and I won't go through all the details
but again eight weeks of training in
mindfulness based stress reduction
compared to a comparison condition
produces significantly decreased flare
size and practice matters those people
who practice more over the course of
this eight weeks turn out to show a
larger change in pro-inflammatory
cytokines which are play an important
role in modulating inflammation and
healing which is what these figures show
here people who went through meditation
and practice more showed a bigger
reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines
the comparison group showed non
significant changes in the opposite
direction so let me just end with a few
challenges conundrums and opportunities
and sort of summarize where I think
we're going to be in the future
I've talked well I'm going to skip that
really about practice and experience in
the interests of time one of the
challenges in research of this kind is
active comparison groups I didn't have
time to go into details but we spent a
lot of time thinking about appropriate
comparison groups like the cognitive
reappraisal group for the compassion
training and we've developed another
control group that we've used to compare
mindfulness based stress reduction that
matches these methods on all kinds of
characteristics that are very important
where we are particularly interested in
applying some of these methods to
atypical populations for example
children with autism also educational
settings to prisons where we may help to
cultivate skills of emotion regulation
which would benefit prisoners
particularly after they're released
we're interested in further exploring
internet-based interventions for obvious
reasons we've been very interested in
how we can better measure practice we've
developed a wired zafu which we give to
people which is a meditation cushion
that actually has a pressure-sensitive
device in it and can record the number
of minutes you're actually sitting on it
and so and even dedicated meditators
will sort of slightly inflate the so we
give these to people we don't tell them
until after the fact that they've had a
wired zafu and their reports of their
time meditating don't always conform to
how much time they actually are sitting
but there are other ways of getting at
this through Experian
in sampling where people are beeped
during the day and so forth these are
all things that were working on we've
also been interested in more novel
outcome measures of such as
healthcare utilization the conjecture
here is that these kinds of practices
may encourage people to take more
responsibility for their health and
actually show decreased healthcare
utilization which may make a big
difference in terms of the bottom line
and also this idea of sustainable
well-being one of the things that we
think happens with this kind of practice
is that individuals become directly
directly experience their
interdependence with the environment and
sustainable well-being can be defined as
psychological well-being in the
numerator and a person's ecological or
carbon footprint in the denominator and
where we've been very interested in both
the numerator and the denominator and
how they may be affected by this kind of
training and we're doing studies now
we're getting indirect measures of
people's ecological footprint to see if
that might be something that is altered
through long-term practice so just a few
slides about envisioning the future in
2050 I believe that mental exercise will
be accepted and practiced in the same
way that physical exercise is today also
in 2050 we will have a science of
virtuous qualities in 2050 will
incorporate the mind back into medicine
and better understand how the brain can
modulate peripheral biology in ways that
affect our health and I think this will
lead us to collectively take more
responsibility for our own health
we'll also develop a secular approach to
provide methods and practices from the
contemplative traditions to teach
teachers and children ways to better
regulate their emotions and attention
and cultivate qualities like kindness
and compassion and regard these
qualities as the product of skills that
can be trained will transform
Corrections so that forgiveness can be
cultivated in victims and emotion
regulation in stress reduction in
and increased awareness of our
interdependence upon others and upon the
planet and be more responsible
caretakers of our precious environment
and finally I think that in 2050 we'll
see the more active promotion a more
widespread adoption of these practices
into major institutions of our culture
and I think this will help restore some
basic virtuous qualities like civility
humility gratitude and other similar
qualities in our culture so to help
catalyze and focus our efforts we're
launching at the University of Wisconsin
the Center for investigating healthy
minds and this is our mission and you
can check us out we're now online at
investigating healthy minds org I also
want to call your attention to an
upcoming opportunity I think that you
got a flyer about it this is a meeting
that's happening in a few weeks in
Washington DC with the Dalai Lama and it
is a mind and life sponsored meeting
it's also co-sponsored by a number of
major schools of education including
Stanford and Harvard and Wisconsin and
we've recently got word that the US
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is
participating in this meeting it's going
to be held October 8th and 9th in
Washington DC and finally I want to just
extend my deep bow of gratitude to the
people who really do the work I these
days feel like I'm mostly an orchestra
conductor and do what I can to stay out
of the way of an incredibly talented
group of people some of whom are listed
here and also to His Holiness who has
inspired this work tremendously and I
want to end with two quotes and then
I'll really be finished these are again
among my favorite corpus one is from
Henry David Thoreau he said as a single
footstep will not make a path on the
earth so a single thought will not make
a pathway in the mind to make a deep
physical path we walk again and again to
make a deep mental path we must think
over and over the kinds of thoughts we
wish to dominate our lives and I want to
end now with one of my all-time favorite
quotes from Albert Einstein this is
something that he wrote in a letter to a
friend of his giving advice about a
daughter who was in need of of some help
and Einstein said in 1921 a human being
is part of a hole called by us the
universe apart limited in time and space
he experiences himself his thoughts and
feelings as something separated from the
rest a kind of optical delusion of his
consciousness this delusion is a kind of
prison for us restricting us to our
personal desires and to affection for a
few persons nearest us our task must be
to free ourselves from this prison by
widening our circles of compassion to
embrace all living creatures and the
whole of nature in its beauty thank you
you
