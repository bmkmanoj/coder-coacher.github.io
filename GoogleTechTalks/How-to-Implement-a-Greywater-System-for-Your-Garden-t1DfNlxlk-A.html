user experience designer on mobile and
welcome thanks for coming I want to
introduce Laura Hallen who for many
years has been a champion of grey water
out of Oakland she was the founder of
gray water guerrillas you may be aware
that it was used to not be strictly
legal to use grey water for irrigation
so she led a lot of the work that got
those policy changes and things done
we're very happy to have her and and
Greg Bullock is a contractor and
installer who builds these systems and
he's going to talk about some of the
ways you can go about thinking through
whether a gray water system makes sense
for you
and I think they've got us they're gonna
lay down the gauntlet for for us
Googlers so without further ado take it
away Laura and Greg and thank you so
much for being here thank you thanks for
having me I'm Laura I'm a co-founder of
gray water guerrillas now known as great
Water Action before we start talking
about gray water when I think about
we're seeing think about water for a sec
so I have a couple of cups of water over
here and I want you to so the first one
represents a country it's totally full
it's got a hundred and fifty six gallons
of water in it anyone want to guess what
country might use this amount per day
this is per capita use yeah United
States
this other cup this represents a
continent now and this is representing
about 88 gallons per person per days is
just residential used cooking drinking
watering the landscape not agriculture
or not industry anyone want to guess
what continent might use this much yep
Europe
Europe on average uses about half as
much as Americans use in England is a
really low water user they use about 40
gallons per person per day and so now
this cup this is another continent it's
representing 22 gallons per person per
day any guesses
yeah Asia yep
now we have another continent this is 12
gallons per person per day
and the guesses
it's Africa
and the last one this is one of the
lowest water using countries in the
entire world it's representing 1.3
gallons of water per person per day any
guesses it's a country yeah you're close
yes it's Gambia so it's one of the
lowest water users in the world so we
just wanted to start with you know how
much water we do use in the Unites
States we have a lot we have a lot of
water and we use a lot and so we're
excited to talk about some better ways
to use that water ok so just picking up
off that theme a few more questions for
you
anybody want to have a guess at what the
recommended amount of water per person
is recommended for basic sanitation and
health needs per person
Charles you should know this 113 gallons
how many people worldwide have no access
to any water within a 15 minute radius
of their homes
home delivery for me
and how many gallons of raw or partially
treated sewage flows into u.s. waterways
per year
Oh exactly okay and final final quiz and
then we'll get onto some more content
that's that's everything yeah that's the
whole management system across the
country yeah
final quiz who said whiskey is for
drinking and water is for fighting over
fighting for any guesses
Mark Twain said that okay back to you
Lauren
so but to start talking about greywater
there was a really excellent report that
came out last year looking at the how
can grant really meet our needs and it's
a non potable source of water so if we
look at how it can be our irrigation
needs we can find that it actually
matches up really well so those two
charts if you just look at shower and
laundry water these are kind of average
per capita use in California and then
you look at the outdoor used for
landscaping and there's a really good
match so we can just take all that water
instead of sending it to the sewer plant
which often you know doesn't treat it
properly often it does but not always we
can use that to irrigate outside things
that don't need potable water and
another thing to note is you know how
much water is this like you know each
household great water system like does
it really will it really impact
California water and if we look at the
this is millions of gallons per day of
savings if people take that water and
irrigate outside you can look at just
from washing machines how many millions
of gallons you'd save showers and
washers and then all grey water and I
wanted to point you to one number that
10% pollen if just 10% of people in this
is just Southern California reuse their
gray water to irrigate plants outside
that would offset the need for a
medium-sized desalinization plant so
instead of you know looking for new
sources of water we can look for this
source we already have um
so getting into gray water one of the
first questions is is this legal like
can I do this legally and the
regulations around grey water have been
changing over the last couple of decades
grey water used to be viewed as sewage
it was part of just the whole water
stream going down out of the house
considered sewage dangerous you can't
reuse it and slowly over time it's been
shifted to be seen as a resource to be
able to be used for the non potable
sources so in California we were the
first state to have a code is written in
1992 and it was a code it's a plumbing
code designed to allow people to reuse
gray water but the way it was written it
really was more of a disposal code and
so people weren't able to do that to use
actually reuse it they were kind of
asked to dispose of it deep under the
ground and so between 1992 and 2009
pretty much all grey water systems were
done without a permit which they were
technically illegal because the code
really wasn't in line with why people
want to use it how it was practical to
use
and so there's millions of unpermitted
systems and last year a bit a lot of
there was drought there was a lot of
pressure of reducing water and so there
was a big push to rewrite the code and
make it actually fit with grey water
being a resource and so the Department
of Housing and Community Development
wrote a new code a lot of people were
involved in that to really make it so we
could use the grey water as a resource
and so from last year and onward to the
future gray water is seen as a resource
and we're gonna show you some simple and
legal ways that you can reuse it yeah
we'll get to that in one second yeah
good it's actually right right here so
gray water who's heard of gray water all
of you does anyone have a gray water
system not yet anyone interested a
couple of you yeah so gray water it's
from sinks showers and washing machines
so it's water that's a little bit dirty
but it's not too dirty to other plants
it's never from toilets and it's not
from washing diapers so it doesn't have
fecal matter in it it's not not like the
toilets which would be not safe to reuse
kitchen sinks it depends on what state
you live in if it's considered grey
water or not in California kitchen sinks
are not allowed to be we're not allowed
to reuse that water legally so I want to
break grey water into three ways the
first one is for outdoor use this is
just taking the gray water sending it
outside you're taking a shower it's
going out just directly and irrigating
your plants so that's the simplest way
to use that it's low-tech we try not to
have pumps or filters or things that
require maintenance and mechanical
devices the second way is also for
outdoor use but this is a little
different it's taking grey water and
sending it through a drip irrigation
system which is a lot more complicated
because grey water has hair in it has
lint it has little you know chunks of
things it's a little gunky and so if you
want to send that to drip irrigation
you're gonna have to really filter it
and get all the particles out and so
then you just have a much more complex
system so it's a really different way to
use the water and then the third way is
indoor use and so that's for non-potable
uses such as toilet flushing and
possibly laundry washing and it's also a
lot more complicated to get grey water
back inside because it has to be
filtered and disinfected and it's pumped
and it's connected to the domestic water
supply and it's
just a whole other level of system it's
also not really allowed under the new
code in any practical way and so it's
definitely a good resource for bigger
scale projects like commercial buildings
for residential it's usually not very
appropriate and so when you're thinking
about any type of greywater system the
soaps and the products you use really
matter because now that water is going
to your plants so there's a couple
things you want to avoid you want to
avoid any salt compound salts you know
sodium all that will damage the soil and
damage your plants you want to avoid
boron or borate that's also gonna damage
your plants and chlorine bleach is
obviously you not kill things so you
don't want to send it outside the next
thing to kind of just get a little more
informed is is a lot of there's a lot of
chemicals in our personal care products
that are really just not good for us and
it's not really a plant issue or a gray
water issue but it's often a good time
when people are gonna reuse their water
they want to think about well what's in
this stuff I'm using and so if you're
interested in doing a little more
research there's a database it's called
cosmetic database org and you can enter
any product and they'll tell you what's
in it you know things are oftentimes
it's kind of shocking to do this but any
of you guys tried this not yet no I
think it's it's frightening so be ready
if you do you want to go down that route
but it's definitely informative if you
can find out all sorts of things about
the products and then the other thing is
there's there's products that are
recommended so if you don't want to do
lots of research you know we we can tell
you what products that we've researched
and found to have no salt no bore and
boron and not a lot of other
carcinogenic things that are in a lot of
products so there's just a few examples
like Oasis bio pack eco Sabra organics
there's more to
so I'm gonna talk about kind of some
basic things with grey water and this is
just for the first way that outdoor
simple systems and a lot of times it's
really gray waters its unique source of
irrigation so the kind of common-sense
knowledge with other types of irrigation
don't really fit with grey water so it's
important to kind of understand it and
see the different kind of do's and
don'ts with grey water irrigation so the
dues the things you want to do is mulch
is a really important component of a
system do you guys know what mulches
yeah it's just like woodchips you know
things covering up your landscape so
it's covering the soil mulch is really
important for a graywater you also you
you always want to have a way to go back
to the sewer it's called a three-way
valve and Greg's going to show you an
example in a sec you want to use plant
friendly products because it's going
outside and then you want to use I put a
proven design in quotes because there's
you know so many different ways you
could get your water outside and there's
lots of ways people can tinker and you
know get it to get go out there but if
you use a design that other people have
tried and you can just get some
recommendations it tends to work better
and have less problems so now we have
the don'ts the first don't is a very
common error don't store grey water you
if you store it has nutrients in it it
has you know little pieces of gunk and
stuff it'll start to break down and
it'll basically start to smell very bad
so you don't ever want to have in a
container and store it for later you
also use great make great water every
day so there's no reason-- practical
reason to store it you don't want to
have a filter that you have to actually
fit manually clean because that's just a
point of failure people forget to clean
things if you need to have regular
maintenance so that's a not a good idea
you don't want to use it if you're near
a creek or a river it has nutrients in
it and those nutrients can actually
pollutes like a fertilizer so if that
gets into the water it will cause algae
to grow and to rob the creeks river of
oxygen so some sites are just not
appropriate for gray water and you also
don't want to use it if you don't have
very good drainage on your site because
you don't you never want to have pooling
of grey water or running off you need to
make sure it can soak properly into the
ground to irrigate plants
and so the next thing mulch basin who's
heard of a mulch basin that one person
yeah this is a kind of a common issue
landscaping technique to be water
conserving it's making putting mulch
around trees it let's so what you do
with the mulch Basin is you go to the
drip line of the tree and you remove
some soil kind of like a doughnut ring
of soil removed and you fill it up with
wood chips instead and this allows if
with grey water when you are gonna
irrigate with grey water it goes into
that mulch basin it can spread out
through all those wood chips it gets
actually kind of filtered in the
woodchips
naturally and it soaks down into the
ground and you never see it it doesn't
pool or run off it's just going
underground and irrigating so it's
probably the most important piece of a
grey water system and it's not often
spoken of because it's you know out in
the landscape it's not a pipe it's not a
plumbing part it's something you do to
your landscape but it's really important
to have a well-functioning gray water
system and so as that grey water goes
into the landscape the other really
critical thing is something that you
don't really see it's the billions of
microscopic soil bacteria that are in
the lynn the soil they're consuming
nutrients they're taking any kind of
gunky dirty whatever's in your gray
water and turning it into plant
nutrients so they're really critical for
a gray water system and you don't
actually have to do anything you just
need to have healthy soil and I just
want to show you my favorite one this is
a you know sort of not an exactly
realistic picture so microscopic
organism this one is called the tardy
grade many of you heard of the tardy
grade now this little bitty microscopic
organism went into space and it survived
space it firm turns itself into a cyst
and can survive pretty much anything it
came back to earth and reproduced so
these things are you know in the soil
there's really strong and organisms that
can do just about anything like survive
space so we don't if we get our gray
water going into healthy soil we don't
have to worry so much about the
nutrients in it in the gunky stuff
so the tardigrades are gonna save us
guys okay we're gonna take a little bit
of a deeper dive now and focus on one
particular system the laundry to
landscape system and I think the value
of taking a focus on this one is this is
considered like the low-hanging fruit of
greywater systems it's a great place to
start and I'll just run you through at a
very high level here how it's done
firstly obviously as Lauren mentioned we
have to be careful about what detergents
or soaps we use in the first place we
have to use non-toxic ingredients and
then we can reuse that water that's
coming out of the washing machine divert
it and I'll show you some parts here in
a minute add to the landscape and row
food with it or shelter or a beautiful
backyard oasis really whatever we desire
in terms of our backyard spaces or front
yard landscapes for that matter
here's a little deeper dive excuse me
this is a schematic of a laundry to
landscape system it shows you how the
plan would work in a face obviously it's
showing the collection plumbing here
that distributes out to the landscape
thank you add to the landscape and
actually emits the water directly into
the soil and that connects with the
mulch basins that we just heard more and
talked to so the beauty of this system
is that well for one it has a built in
pot it uses the pump of the washing
machine so if there are any distribution
challenges maybe you have a slight
incline there are there are some ways to
overcome those challenges because you
have this built in pub apart from that
no additional gadgetry is required no
filters to break down which is wonderful
so if this is a design well design
system up front this system will never
fail over time a very low-tech but high
effective solution some rough estimates
this is a doable system for a somewhat
handy homeowner it's not for everybody
but but can be done material cost would
run between hundred to two hundred
dollars if you were willing to do this
yourselves if you wanted a professional
install a good rule of thumb would be
about $700 to up to about two thousand
depending on the size complexity of the
job one thing quickly to know greywater
systems are very site-specific it's very
situational so it's important to kind of
you know do those assessments up front
and and obviously have a fair idea
whether grey waters are practical
solution for your for your own backyard
here's some pictures and just while
we're looking at this let me hand out
some parts for you guys
it's really considered like the heart of
a laundry to landscape system and it
gives us the ability to turn our system
odd to take the water out to the
landscape or to turn it off or if you
like back to the sewer line if we're
watching those dirty diapers or we're
using bleach or you know any other
potential health risk that that you know
may come from pathogens in that water so
it's important to have that facility to
turn it on off other key features to
note here the auto beds anti-siphon
device actually breaks a vacuum in the
system and the one-inch diameter pipe is
important because it's consistent with
the hose typically coming out the back
of the washing machine so there's no
alterations with water pressure that
could create some you know perhaps
unforeseen problems further down the
line I'm going to keep it nice stable
and consistent and then the system won't
let us down here's some pictures of an
actual installation going on we can see
on the left-hand side here this is where
the water is finally emitted so these
are the actual mulch bases that we
talked about it shows an emitter coming
out here the code does require that
water gray water is emitted 2 inches
below the soil surface that's a health
and safety concern that we have to you
know convey to what we kind of a clever
design on on this system is that we
actually reuse the plug pots that we buy
plants from a garden center cut the tops
of them off cut a little hole about
halfway up the plant pot and feed the
emitter directly into that that has a
really nice way of obviously protecting
the emitters it keeps it suspended off
the ground level so it actually stops
any root growth that could over time
root grow into search of water and grow
into those holes and plug it up and it
also keeps it covered and keeps it
identified so over time you know there
will be adjustments that you need to
make to your irrigation zone so this is
an easy way to mark them
what a lot of people do to make it a bit
more aesthetically pleasing is cover it
with a rock or a natural stone of some
kind and then you have your markers
there that you know exactly where the
water's coming out we do bury in state
the tubing so once our system is
completely installed obviously there
would be no visible piping here so
that's partly buried and then covered
with dirt and plant mulch over the top
and the half-inch irrigation lines is
just a way that we can control pressure
and make adjustments if we need to so
the right amount of water gets to the
right amount of of zones that we create
here's a picture of a example of there's
a bitter here that's covered under a
natural stone that is code compliant
because it's not accessible for children
or pets it's to which is underground and
then on the other side there we could
see an example of an odd coke employment
in a midst water above ground which
which isn't legal
and just to wrap up that on this example
this is a great example of a typical
laundry to landscape installation
obviously we stress the importance here
of labelee that's for you know education
it's information for those that you know
less familiar with the system they can
obviously come and see which direction
they need to switch the tap if you're
obviously renting a home or you're
summing it odd labeling is very
important we can see here very typical
installation where the gray water is
this is on the far corner is focused on
the trees so we have six trees I think
in the yard here and then a veggie bed
in the middle which is irrigated with
fresh water important point to note
there is that gray water is legal and
completely safe for food grown above the
soil surface so any food like root crops
obviously that are grown in the ground
gray water is advised that it isn't
legal for use there so focus on trees
vines bushes and shrubs a quick
breakdown will cost this was a self
install about a hundred and fifty
dollars 15 gallon was a high-efficiency
machine so that's a 50 gallon load was
the calculated how many loads a typical
household would do a week and then
distributed based on the soil type the
size and the type of plants and
obviously the climate so that the the
yard is in
to be quick pause any quick questions on
this particular example
yeah boy experiences hot water to be
avoided particularly for young plants
let me kind of pull lower into that too
you have any advice on that one yeah
once when it goes to all the piping and
then after it soaks through the mulch
layer and by the time it gets to the
roots it's cooled down a lot so I've
never seen that an issue but again you
wouldn't water like seedlings or
something very small and fragile these
are set up for more perennials and
larger plants that have a huge big root
area so if by chance that did damage one
root the plant would have thousands of
other roots to draw from so it's really
kind of a non-issue but then we also
encourage people to you know use warm or
cold water too it saves energy
internets those compatible with
yeah definitely eCos is a really common
brand the easiest to find that spray
water friendly and it's compatible with
all the different types of machines so
loaded Costco yeah because
it's a little easier all right thank you
I just wanted to show to other parts
with this so in the outside it's a
tubing it's a high-density polyethylene
which is kind of a more environmentally
friendly plastic and the emitters Greg
was talking about they're not they're
lis different than like a drip emitter
it's actually just an opening this is a
tee so it's 1 inch by 1/2 inch so it's
reduced a little bit but it's still a
half inch opening so if there was hair
or lint or anything it could fall out
there it wouldn't clog so when gray
water emitter is not going to be the
same as a drip emitter this is more like
an outlet for the water to come through
and then also just wanted to show you
kind of a newer product for gray water
well it's actually for irrigation but
we're gonna start using this it's called
blue lock and it's a well all the
fittings and the tubing is all the
high-density polyethylene which is just
a better type of plastic this is a PVC
fitting which is you know PVC is the
worst kind of plastic so the next kind
of system right now we're kind of
totally jumping to a different type of
system the other system greg explained
was from a washing machine it was not
altering the plumbing the pump from the
machine was just pumping out the water
through its hose and then we just
connected to that hose the valve and so
it set up a whole different system we
didn't alter the household plumbing in
any way
this kind of system from showers or
sinks this is drainage plumbing so you
actually have to get under your fixture
so usually under the house in a
crawlspace in a basement maybe on the
side of your house if you have external
plumbing and you're actually gonna have
to alter the plumbing so it's a totally
different type of system and it has you
know different ways it's used so this
system I'm going to show an example from
a shower this is this all these systems
require permit because you're altering
your plumbing so for this the first
thing you have to do is identify what
drain it is make sure you have the right
one you're gonna cut into that and
install and it's called a three-way
valve but it actually just goes in two
directions
so this one's bigger because with
drainage plumbing the water has to flow
by gravity do either inch and a half or
two inch pipe so it's the same concept
as the brass one that went around it's
just bigger this one tray out of plastic
it turned you turn the handle and it
turns off one side or the other and this
one squeaks so be ready when it comes
around and you can look inside and you
see there's a ball that kind of rotates
and it shuts off one side or the other
so this would be under your house your
you can add a motor to this in case your
crawlspace is really small and you don't
want to crawl down there to turn it you
can add a motor to this and run a switch
into your bathroom that's definitely a
possibility or if you can access it you
just manually turn it so when you have
that installed like you can see in that
picture number three the gray water
comes in and that can either go to this
gray water irrigation side or to the
sewer and you just turn that Valve
whenever you need to if it's raining
outside or if you're gonna bleach out
your tub or for whatever reason you
don't want it to go outside so that I
want to describe one kind of shower
system it's called a branch drain and
this one the materials again a couple
hundred dollars it's a little more
usually than the the laundry type system
installation it depends you know a
thousand to three thousand the the
complexity of it really depends on the
yard and the plumbing and there's a lot
of variables and also let me go back
real quick to that other slide you can
imagine if you had a concrete foundation
you can't get under there so and there's
some houses you and retrofits you
actually can't use this type of grey
water system you have to be able to
access the pipes so assuming you can
access your pipes this system is a
gravity based system so there's it's
just flowing it doesn't have any storage
and it doesn't have any filters again
it's a very simple and elegant system
how it works is the water all flows out
through one pipe and because you don't
want to send all of your shower water to
one plant you divide it up with flow
splitters
so we're using regular ABS drainage
plumbing pipe so it comes in and this
splitter divides the flow equally in
half so you know how now you have half
of your water going to one side and half
to the other and then you put in a
second one maybe a third so you're
dividing up your flow into half eights
quarter sixteenths and so you'd really
want to match how much water do you use
and then how much do your plants want
and this is all gonna be outside in your
landscape that little white thing is a
clean-out you can unscrew it so here's a
picture this is an installation before
the landscaping was done so you can see
the gray water's coming in the flow
splitter is stationary on a brick so
it's level and then all the rest of the
system is sloping down so you can see
that future tree is gonna be irrigated
on both sides in that kind of sunken
area that's gonna be filled with mulch
so the gray water goes through the mulch
and here's another picture them this one
is in existing landscape so this type of
system it does take a lot of work to
install cuz your trenching and sloping
and making sure it's got a good slope so
all the water flows out but once it's
done it's very you know there's really
nothing to break no moving parts it's
just flowing out into your landscape
you're dividing it up you can see in the
on the right side it's going to four
different outlets that's from a pretty
high you sink so it's going to four
different mulch basins with some
established fruit trees and then the end
where it terminates to the landscape
that middle picture
so it comes in do this is called a valve
box it's an irrigation valve box and
greg described how to make this out of
that plastic planter you can buy them or
you can make them yourself but the water
comes into the middle this is a ground
level so it's all buried up to here the
water is coming in it's dropping through
the air so roots don't grow in and then
it's soaking down into the ground and
this is a place you can access you can
look in you could cover this with a
stone and you can see on the left that's
an almost finished installation so the
pipe is still slightly exposed coming to
that valve box area it's in the drip
line of the tree and then on the right
that one's totally finished everything's
covered there's a stone on top and you
really you know can't see anything
except for the access point
yeah there's setbacks in the code
there's a whole chart of setbacks you
can't be I believe that it's two feet
from a building foot in half from a
property line
there's definitely setbacks if you're
near a water source there's lots of
other considerations so that's the
details that you would want to research
or ask your installer so here's a kind
of picture of the finished system this
is from one shower again it's all
subsurface there's nothing to see it's
all gravity flow there's you know just
flowing out by gravity and there's no
storage so you're taking a shower it's
being spread up through this branch
distribution system under the ground and
soaking into the ground and all those
blue arrows are present where the grey
water is coming out in this yard a bunch
of really new fruit trees are planted
the same time as the installation so you
can see everything is kind of small
but all that will get really big and
this isn't a front yard so if people are
walking down the street they would
really have no idea that this entire
yard is being irrigated by grey water
it's very you know subtle and discreet
doesn't even have questions about the
branch drain just okay so just out
really quick some common errors and this
is sort of from the legacy of systems of
the past you know a couple decades it's
also kind of misappropriating
information about other types of
irrigation so common errors are storage
tank like having a big tank to store
water pump zealous people want to pump
to their roof or the top of their
property or all over the place and
filters that need changing so I just
want to show you one kind of example of
someone's idea and I want you guys to
help help them so this person said I'm
gonna put my gray water to the top of my
property store it in to five hundred
gallon tanks then gravity flow it down
the hill to irrigate through a soaker
hose see any potential issues with this
it's all wrong you want something
specific
yeah so Kurt you guys know soaker hose
is like the water kind of weeps out it's
got very very small outlets they usually
clog just with regular water so you can
imagine if you put grey water into a
soaker hose but probably clogged and
like I don't know 30 seconds maybe a
minute
yeah and and the top of the property
sometimes you have to pump if you have a
hill a lot of you know San Francisco
homes or places with hit on hills the
houses down at the bottom all the
Landscaping's up at the top you do have
to pump but usually you want to pump
just the lowest amount possible so pump
to the plants you want to water and
don't pump to the top of your property
and then gravity float down you've just
kind of defeated the the purpose of the
pup so there's another one but I'm going
to skip that one so really briefly I
just wanted to show you kind of the
other type of system the more high high
tech more complex system if people want
to irrigate lawns or lots of really
small plants that do need the type of
irrigation that drip irrigation performs
you're gonna be looking at this other
type of system
it's called sand filter to drip
irrigation and these system the cost of
them really goes up you know seven
thousand ten thousand dollars maybe even
more they're really just a lot a lot
more expensive and a lot more complex
and these pictures are from rhe water
it's one of the oldest companies that
does this kind of system they you know
they do lawns they do other things and
you know we encourage instead of lawns
having other things that you can water
but if people need lawns with gray water
that's the other type of system you'll
be looking into and just to give you
just a quick kind of sense of the
difference in scale here's a schematic
so the grey water goes into a big
temporary tank called a surge tank it's
pumped out through a filter the filters
automatically cleaned so it has to have
special protection so you don't
accidentally pump the grey water into
the clean drinking water side so it's
called an RPI reduced pressure backflow
preventor in some cities don't allow
those so permitting gets a lot more
complex but you do have you know a lot
of control there's controllers that can
say oh there's not enough grey water I
want more fresh water to come in so you
really can have just a your grey water
can be compatible with an exist with a
system that works like a regular drip
irrigation system so you go on vacation
it's still getting watered the other
types of systems just don't there they
don't have this level of complexity to
them so I just wanted to give you the
the range of that and one example on the
commercial scale these you know systems
again are going to be more complex so
this is an example that a lot of
commercial laundry mat is irrigating a
whole kind of mini mall shopping area
this is from that company rewire in
Chula Vista so under that handicapped
parking space there's a big underground
temporary tank that the water comes into
and then it's pumped out filtered to the
subsurface drip irrigation so definitely
possible there's examples of big
apartment buildings doing this and other
areas with this other type of grey water
system
okay so let's kind of do a recap of some
of our the highlights of the
presentation so far you know firstly
it's encouraging you to think about what
we traditionally think of as a waste
product
waste water and finding a resource for
it again or a need for it again and
that's the first thing you know thinking
about gray water as a resource saves us
water which is a scarce resource
obviously as we know in this state saves
us money saves us energy and chemicals
that are excessively used in sewage
treatment plants by the way it
encourages healthy product use so be
thinking about the relationship or if
you know for instance what we either
wash ourselves we're they'll wash our
clothes with and the relationship that
has with the soil and if you want to
take it as far as what the food we eat
well you know that whole cycle and
education and understanding will
ultimately encourage us to use healthier
products will be more in touch with that
the implications of such it does get us
out of our backyards which I for one
think is a good thing we're surrounded
by a lot of busy lives and Technology so
sometimes it's it's nice to be out there
in the quiet and the peace it
facilitates local food production and
community and I think this is a very
important point
growing food sharing food gets us out of
our suburban homes and actually kind of
meeting each other again which I think
will be an important step for us as we
look into the next 10 maybe 20 years
great water could be at the heart of
that it protects our oceans and risks
it's part of the solution as Laura's
said when we looked at the 10%
desalination offset could be a
significant contribution 10% across
California is not that much to ask for
so I want you to take away from this
that there is something that we can do
that would make a difference
it redefines our relationship with water
because we're educating about it we
understand where it's coming from where
it's going to and we're making
significant improvements into that whole
system of a process does create green
jobs I think you know very important
obviously for where we are as a country
economically and around the world
greywater gonna be a huge part of that
and I guess I'm living proof of that
it's legal it's fun and it's inexpensive
so if nothing else it couldn't finish
you this afternoon I promise you it is
those things all right so on to the last
part of our presentation title obviously
we've covered how great water can green
apart state what could you do as
Googlers to help this situation I think
the first part of this obviously we
think about reduce reuse recycle so the
first part of this is you know just
conserving water in the first place how
do we make slight adjustments in our you
know lives that can reuse them reduce
the water use in the first place
and that that we do use because plants
love gray water obviously we can reuse
that for irrigation purposes another
idea that I want to leave with you that
we have talked to to order to inside
Googlers is the opportunity here to do
something with your on-site laundry
facility and redirect that great water
to create something beautiful and
productive and wholly sustainable I have
a picture here of a very beautiful
established Kiwi vine on a trellis just
as a suggestion
obviously there's potential also for
fruit tree orchards taking against
something that we consider a waste
product and giving it value again and
creating something beautiful and
productive out of this so we're going to
leave you with that and obviously you
can let us know if that's something that
would be of interest with you I'm also
interested if there is any other ideas
from you guys today
all right thank you okay so any any
other questions
like things the cities we're doing it's
all like great water systems like
aggregation it was prior to last year
2009 there it was possible to get a
legal system there are you know few
example there's estimated 200 legal
system versus 1.6 million illegal system
so not that there were none it's just
that the percentage was very small and
most of the ones that were done legally
that got a permit they had an engineer
design and stamp the drying so it wasn't
really accessible to the average person
that's why most homeowners or you know
interested renters or whoever wanted to
do it they just did it and they weren't
able to do it legally so the examples
you've seen they were probably done
legally but with an engineer design
stamped which kind of removes liability
from cities
great water
they're online
yeah some areas like Tucson Arizona they
have a mandate that every new construct
new building has to have it's called a
stub out so the greywater separate and
there's a place to access it that's the
only place to my knowledge it's done
that there's been talk in general plans
and other places of doing that and I
believe some counties in California have
done that in the past but currently
that's not just like a mass blanket
thing that's happening but it there are
some examples and that's something that
we should all be pushing for for
municipalities water districts are
supporting gray water in a few ways
there's rebates that are happening
Sonoma County has some gray water
rebates there's a couple of examples
like santa rosa city of santa rosa is
several cisco san francisco is
developing a rebate program there's some
examples of that happening it's still
even though it happened last year it's
still sort of new that people can
support it that way the other answer to
your question on the large scale there's
reclaimed water or recycled water which
is different because it's all the waste
water everything together industry
toilets everything goes to the plant
they treat it then they have a higher
treatment process to treat it to
tertiary standards and they pump it back
through purple pipe and that's just
another it's a it's a different type of
situation but there are there that's
happening getting that water is they
only give it to really large water users
because it's expensive to run that new
pipeline back
you have two years yeah reclaimed water
yeah
yeah
I think it's the infrastructure cost is
very expensive to win like if you
imagine a city that's already built to
get that new pipeline there have to dig
up this all the street everywhere and
bring it back so it's very expensive to
do that but it is happening
greywater is a lower cost decentralized
alternative so you can just keep the
water that you're using use it
appropriately match the needs and you
don't need to treat it to that level and
send it all the way over there and then
all the way back so it's a different
alternative
a I think gray walls of
my storage
yeah so there's so the questions about
using toilet flush gray water for toilet
flushing and in Europe it is very common
the storage it's a if you're using it
for outdoor irrigation you don't want to
store it you want to just use it for
toilet flushing there will be some
temporary storage that water's filtered
it's disinfected so it's treated to be
able to be stored so in a resident if
you're irrigating outside there's really
no reason to do that
you wouldn't so it depends on the
context and in Europe there's in
Australia too there's companies that
will sell you like a mini treatment
plant that will fit like in your
basement or you know if your apartment
building and the you know garage and
they will treat the gray water to the
quality needed to flush toilets and
there's several companies that have been
very successful the regulatory climate
of the United States is not very
supportive yet to that so it's kind of
we're taking baby steps you know from
now we can do subsurface outdoor
irrigation legally and the next step
will probably be indoor use with
appropriate regulations in place
yeah
yeah and for toilet flushing rainwater
is a much lower hanging fruit because it
starts out so much cleaner so mow around
in this area of systems that collect
rainwater then they use it to flush
toilets that's a lot better like what
the regulation for California
residential greywater says is basically
you have to treat it to the same quality
as the reclaimed water plant does and
which is daily testing and it's it's
just economically unfeasible for people
right now but that's something again
that will be changing I think in the
future and you can't store a right
Walter so yeah it kind of gives you that
added advantage
you're the questions
thank you so much thank you forget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
