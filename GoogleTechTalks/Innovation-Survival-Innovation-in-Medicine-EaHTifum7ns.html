approximately 12 years I thought it was
going to be a 12-week deal 12 years
later found out it is extremely complex
I've studied it in these six disciplines
the ones that have a check mark to the
left those are ones that I have
presentations on one of them is the
evolution of the surfboard the industry
of flight of the Voyager I did here are
my FIRST Tech Talk military weapons last
year worship evolution today's talk is
innovation in medicine notice please the
red ! the reason why that is there is
this is the toughest talk of them all
not on me on you so brace yourself we're
going to leave jet contrails here and
move on so how many people feel lucky
today I'm going to try and give away a
hundred bucks I've got a hundred-dollar
bill right here and for people out in
the audience that are watching it on
cable there it is alright so this one is
much more preferable the next one all
you have to do is name everybody
identify their picture on the next slide
in 10 seconds okay ready it's like
sometimes like seven or eight people all
you have to do is name so here we go you
ready boom one two three okay we give up
ok so there's seven people here how
about 50 bucks for six anybody want to
go for six ok twenty bucks for five ten
bucks for four
five bucks for three all right I'm going
to make it easy I have a golden dollar
coin here and anybody named one okay
come on get the epocrates yes I won't do
it to you but i'll give you the buck for
at least trying okay all right the
answer is these are the guys that's who
they are that's what they did and in
many respects we are in large measure
indebted to them because if they had not
succeeded that they had not innovated we
might not even be our parents or
grandparents or lineage back for a
couple hundred years these are largely
great guys we're going to go through
each of each of them what they did and
when we get done without talking about
them we are eighty eighty-five percent
done in time and we are sixty percent
done with our slides let's see how we're
going to fix that so let's move on what
you're looking at here is an actual page
out of one of the greatest books ever
published in medicine this was published
in i think in 1543 by Andreas Vesalius
and it turned the corner in medicine to
verifiable fact anatomy back based
anatomy and this is this is the man this
guy was was incredible back he was born
in 1514 and back then medicine anatomy
studies had not changed for 1,500 years
it proceeded under the teachings of
Galen who was a Greek working in the
Roman army and and he was considered
infallible I mean it was word he said it
that's the way it was 1533 Andres force
alias goes to the University of Paris
and he is absolutely enamored with
dissection so he's out digging up bodies
in the cemetery he's cutting bodies down
to the criminals that hung up to crucify
were rotting fighting wild dogs for him
and he brings these carcasses home to
his dorm room think about it all right
I'd like to have a dorm room like that
so
there are a lot of rope to sections
going on the way they taught the section
in these universities was there were
three people there was a teacher reading
out of Galen's book there was a cutter
who was actually performing the
dissection and there was a guy that was
demonstrating and pointing things out
like that's the stomach that's an
intestine you know that's an eardrum
that kind of stuff and 1537 he goes to
university for doing he gets a PhD in
anatomy and he becomes a department head
now notice his former advisor jacoba
Silva's because we're going to see him
on the next slide that was back in Paris
so he starts giving he is so enamored
with the section he gives his own
demonstrations by himself he's a one-man
show people come for hundreds of miles
to watch this guy he is good and very
popular one day he's dissecting a
Barbary ape and he discovers a nerve
complex in a Barbary ape the Galen
describes as being a human one but he
had never seen and he figures it out
Galen had to secta cows dogs horses cats
you name it no people he says help what
an opportunity I can fix this so he sits
down he writes his book he creates he
corrects 200 errors how was it received
well his old advisor writes a letter
became talking about him producing
nothing but air ridden filth treason
violent mendacity to question Galen to
say that it worked out poorly would be
an understatement hey punish him
severely worst example of ignorance and
gratitude err old man you know that's
pretty heated stuff here who could have
known that telling the truth would exact
this kind of a reaction I'm personally
shocked so they even argue that human
bodies have changed since Galen had
looked at them syllabus what was Silvis
and what was his opinions they were the
highest paid person's opinion in the
room the hippo and I've seen some of
your executives talk about hippos and
how to kill them right so anyway what
happened Basilius gathers his books up
in the square and torches some
incredible invaluable research and
comments and annotations and things like
that horses it he leaves to become a
physician to a king and after doing that
he discovers that the king is a a slob
the royal court doesn't like him because
they're Galen fans and he life is really
tough because the King doesn't listen to
it like simply isn't listen to him so he
goes back and he petitions for his old
job back in padulla on a crusade to the
Holy Land and he's over in the Holy
Lands and he discovers that he has the
position so he comes he starts on his
way back to Italy from from Israel but
he saves a nickel and he takes a pilgrim
ship which is not very good and gets
caught in a storm and it flounders
around for weeks and finally they
shipwreck on a Greek island he barely
crawls onto the beach alive he dies a
few days later nobody knows who he is
they're going to feed his body to the
animals and passing King says or captain
says how I know who this guy is this guy
said disguised the dude so they gave him
a nice burial it's unmarked he is
forgotten in the visalia no change for
about a hundred years ladies and
gentlemen welcome to innovation 1010 so
move on to the next topic scurvy scurvy
is an absolutely disgusting disease it
was an occupational disease and for four
sailors and for people that were on
marginal nutrition or eating regimes yep
if you ever had a scar turns out scar
seal up with collagen and when you get
scurvy the quality dissolves and your
scars start opening up again and
bleeding your teeth fall out your gums
swell to over your teeth they turn brown
you can smell people's breath from 30 40
50 feet away you know the tongues turned
black and people just crawl behind
barrels on ships and die it's an
increasing problem because they had
started longer and longer ship journey
and it became a larger problem at least
these things huh now the ships were
absolutely filthy and a lot of them
particularly the French ones there was
vomit there's raw sewage and on the
bottom you name it you know rotten food
the the diet for the cruise was
absolutely wretched they didn't mind the
larvae in the the biscuits it was when
the larvae turned into very bitter
beetles that's that's what really got
him so the food they had was absolutely
wretched making a cop of cooking pots of
a food was acidic they get copper
poisoning and Iran Iran example Vasco de
Gama 1497 goes to india from africa
makes it just fine ignores warning to
coming back and instead of taking 34
days to get back it takes him hunter
takes him 134 days sixty percent of his
crew rats on the vine dead boom just
throw them over into the let's sharp
Skinner in 1601 the good news here is
Sir James Lancaster figures out he does
a clinical experiment three ships one of
them Bishop has lemons and he feeds
lemons to his guys and they're all a
okay and then he has to take people off
his ship put on the other because
they're dying so fast that they cannot
even the mana so 1601 scurvy figured out
lemons for barricade you against it
unfortunately that lesson is neglected
it gets diluted and it gets forgotten so
bad in 1740 was that 140 years later Sir
Anson goes on his round the world boards
ninety percent of this 2000 crew died
it's so bad they have to take a ship
completely abandon it and burn it out in
the middle of Pacific Ocean because
there's nobody there to do it now these
ships require two thousand oak tree
to build these are capital ships very
expensive so in essence is threatening
Britain's national security plus the
fact the French had more powerful
gunpowder so 1747 James lindos if
another controlled experiment and six
treatments one of them was citrus and
then a bunch of other ones that we know
today were ridiculous and he discovers
he rediscovers hate citrus is the answer
but he writes it up on two pages in a
454 page document it's diluted it's
forgotten and it's washed away plus
there's a guy over here named so John
Pringle who reports back on Captain Cook
had good good response with malted work
to like a beer which is absolutely post
because he was grinding an axe here and
so he falsely reported to the Royal
Society so so all of this stuff got
slimed and hunt you know tens of
thousands of people died because of this
guy now it also got complicated because
Lynn said hey if a little lemon juice is
good concentrating it will be really
good unfortunately concentrating it
breaks down the ascorbic acid which we
call vitamin C and whatever little is
left rots anyway and he was doing it in
copper pots and it was acidic and it was
causing copper poisoning and on or not
or not I mean these poor sailors you
know not that they were people you want
where the next door to you but this is
the guy that fixes it so Gilbert Blaine
he actually captures the French ship
down in the Caribbean full of lemons and
eat some of these is oh oh this is it
and so he pushes it through alright 1795
that's a 195 years after was discovered
first the British Mandate sit and make a
long story short 264 years because the
fort became standard practice to give
lemons part of the problem was they said
hey these lemons are expensive let's
save a nickel and use West Indies limes
West Indies limes are great they're
citrus but they only have one quarter of
this score back acid content there for
scurvy citrus yeah work
19-point 1932 they figure out its
vitamin C and it gets isolated all right
next topic smallpox looking at a woman
who is deathly ill with smallpox I can
assure you I hope she's married before
she got it because when this gets done
with her there nobody i'm going to want
to look at her and that's the way it was
i believe that i got this off of Larry
brilliant your former executive this
number of learn brilliant your former
executive of google.org sensitive
director in the 19th in nineteen hundred
five hundred thousand people died of
smallpox it's now in and Larry brilliant
by the way was one of the guys that
actually exterminated smallpox way it
works is thirty percent fatality rate
seventy percent live all that seventy
percent thirty percent are blind
permanently right so you got off lucky
fifty-fifty chance if you were only
grotesquely named you know that's that's
that one you want if you're only maimed
if you're blind that's big problem
particularly back in the eighteen
hundreds and if you're dead well really
not a problem probably is is this stuff
here this on her face slough softened is
infectious for a year and a half so
would go through and waves through
communities and then it would refire
back up when new populations had
children so what they discovered and I
say today is probably the Chinese they
discovered that wait a minute there's
really severe smallpox and there's not
so severe paul pox smallpox about
whatever you get when you get it you
never get it again so they sat in I
thought about it you know I don't really
good stuff happen in China back in them
you know 1100 mm right is it love let's
deliberately give people the less
dangerous one and that will give them
immunity so they have this deal where
they betake these these these scabs they
could sniff them up their nose or or
they would slip them under the skin
called variolation and deliberately give
people smallpox
and they would get up there we get a
localized infection we have a picture of
it and then a slide and really worked so
hey you know 1700 there's a 400,000
deaths per year going on in Europe with
smallpox this is this is you know
serious problem so here we go these are
papers that are in the philosophical
transactions of the royal society
actually got these this is published in
1714 talks about this hey you know give
him give him a minor version of it right
and here's one that was more
authoritative but it's written in Latin
in 1716 so now everybody in London knows
how to barricade people against the
ravages of smallpox can anybody guess
how this what happened well what changed
anybody guess that's right nothing
changed hey I tell this woman came along
and if you've got nieces or if you've
got daughters whatever this woman is a
role model this woman was an absolute
firebrand in her day she'd gotten
smallpox and it had absolutely maimed
her face and corroded our eyebrows off
and everything else that she knew she
was the wife of the ambassador in
Constantinople for for Britain and she
found out about this she took her
sundowner her daughter down and got them
inoculated and she writes back to
England I would I wouldn't mind you know
bringing this back and really being an
advocate in a you know a champion for it
except I don't know any doctors that
want to lose their revenue stream for
this cruddy treatment that that they
give when people have smallpox I mean
was it was a money machine was an
evergreen industry of people buying it
well she comes back and she pushes in
1720 lunch gets the king and queen to
conduct a test in a prison and it's it
is successful king and queen get their
children and oculi tit and by the way
kings and queens have died of smallpox
resulting in revolutions in
and thrown over throws in turmoil so
it's a big deal the problem was that
there was resistance to this now I said
hey this is God's gift and other people
said really what about God's will you
know like maybe God months these people
to die and you're in you're intervening
like what are you people doing you don't
have the right to do this know that as
these people are havens over there in
Constantinople you know Mike you know
only a look at our church what are their
credentials you know so like you know so
they you know it was just like you know
we're not going to do this plus there
were collateral epidemics because there
were incompetent inoculations people
we're using didn't understand that they
can cross contaminate their needles so
people will get giving people very
strong cases of smallpox plus they are
they some some of the people had
syphilis and you know you get syphilis
all across the town tuberculosis slowly
it got adopted and what I got adopted
what the doctor said okay here's the
Evergreen is here's another evergreen
industry let's mutate what we got so
what they get is they brought him in for
two weeks they bled them extensively
until they were you know within you know
and three inches away from death they
gave them diuretics and everything that
you know we're cleaning out their
intestinal tract made him eat vegetables
and just about when they're ready to die
then they get it to him and that was
good in American colonies American
colonies had read about these
philosophical transaction reports and in
fact in the Boston epidemic in 17 c 1721
they were actually doing this and the
slaves by the way knew about this from
Africa because they have been doing it
for a long time so 1706 it was described
to a Cotton Mather and he writes if he
writes a paper about it along comes
Edward Jenner now inoculation is in full
bloom meaning you're getting a full case
of smallpox but it's just a minor
version of it and he had been inoculated
as an orphan
and absolutely terrified him maybe he
just is just left him mentally damaged
almost and in 1761 he becomes a
physician's of Prentiss and he's out
wandering around the countryside in a
milkmaid says oh I can't get smallpox
because I've had Cal pox and he goes
what so he goes in any studies about 12
years later he's identified the cowpox
train it turns out cowpox is a bunch of
different diseases but there's one
particular one that if you get it on
typically these milk women would get it
on their hands and they get this big
yawn sore big draining sore on their
hands boy when they got that they were
they were really happy because they knew
you know I'm not going to get smallpox
and so he identifies it and he actually
goes and starts advocating it he becomes
an evangelist for it and he and they're
basically tell him to shut up cuz they
known about this for years and shut up
its folklore you know like go away he
says but yeah if we give these people
cowpox instead of small talks to
everybody will be happy because it's
just a big yelling sore that's all it is
so they threaten them kick him out of
medical societies but he actually does
it and he does one test it works and he
says Eureka he writes it up he sends it
to the philosophical transactions of the
royal society and they say noon and
guess what they're right because it
turns out that the kid that he tested it
on might have been naturally immune to
smallpox anyway for some reason didn't
know so like you need to do big field
test you know like one case here so he
he he's told hey don't risk your
reputation because they like you here
remember so don't you know like don't
compromises and they pressure on 1798 he
goes in by 1798 is a whole bunch of
bogus tests and and one of the patients
actually dies in the middle of them and
he publishes this paper and lightning
strikes how boo
and it goes off and now the inoculation
clinics the guys that are you know the
evergreen industry the Burton you know
the bleeding of the Persian they start
complaining because a it's quicker
faster cheaper more effective and
everything else so he got slide by
doctors it turns out that there are very
serious errors in his paper very very
serious errors but no big deal and an 18
to 40 finally inoculation of the real
stuff is banned and everybody moves into
vaccination this is a vaccination that
is a inoculation all right this is cow
pox material that is smallpox material
and Justin quite it quite a difference
here's some of the ridicule that he
faced this is an actual cartoon right
out of Wikipedia right if you look you
can see cows popping out of people's
necks and mouths and legs and stuff like
that so he was getting slimed at a lot
in a lot of ridicule but what's
interesting is it turns out with any
great discovery it is very rare that the
person that gets all the credit really
really did all of the first work here is
priority here there was a guy in 1765 31
years earlier that had written a paper
about this submitted in the Royal
transaction society yep rejected out of
hand 1769 over in Germany guy here are
six known ones here and the one that
looks to be the most authoritative is a
fella by the name of Benjamin Jesse
there's a book about it absolutely
beautiful book written by Patrick Jamie
titled vaccination rediscovered and this
guy in 22 years before Jenner and when
the neighbors found out about it they
rode him out of town they just hounded
him mercilessly about doing so and then
finally there's a 1791 there's a fella
by the name of
platt whoo-hoo eight years before I did
it actually reported it to a university
and it was rejected so yeah there you
have it president is very tough next
subject childbed fever does anybody know
what childbed fever is is anybody all
right you know it okay we got one person
knows which I'll bet fevers childbed
fever is an affliction that struck women
in the 1800s and generally killed him
within three days it was an excruciating
death happened right after childbirth it
was a mystery and of course this was the
day that where everybody thought
diseases came from bad smells and stuff
like that there was no concept of germs
or microbes or anything like that so the
it was just it was just miserable now
when you go into a hospital this is an
actual long excerpt out of a book the
doctors war felt coats they bought one
when they became a doctor and they
retired the felt coat when they retired
they never washed it it was stiff with
gunk dry blood goo you name it puss it
was all air and the more crap you had on
your coat the more credentialed you were
as a doctor literally you could in
Vienna go to dinner and know when a
doctor was sitting two tables away
because you could smell it on their
hands they were doing so incredible
incredible epidemics of gangrene would
go through wards because they were
washing amputations with gray slimy
water that had what we now know is like
streptococcus in and causing blood
poisoning and massive infections and
hundred percent death rates and some
words so
and 1789 his fellow dr. Alexander Gordon
he's watching this epidemic of childbed
fever go through this town Aberdeen
Scotland and he notices that it seems to
follow certain midwives and it and if
this Midwife attended a woman that had
childbed fever the next patient seventy
percent chance they were going to get it
and so he goes and he says wait a minute
it it's the attending physicians and the
midwives that are causing this infection
22 to perpetrate and he makes a mistake
he writes a report if he names the
midwives by name and what do they do I
put him on a bowl and they run him out
of town they said who the hell you know
who you you know this is in fact and so
anyway nigs midwives he gets run out of
town the lost opportunity to 18-49
Finland he writes an invisible and
undetectable poison is transmitted
during examination of patients guess who
was examining the doctors 1843 Oliver
Wendell Holmes over here in the United
States he puts two and two together and
he says man he writes his paper the
contagiousness of corporal fever you
should read the pushback in the medical
journals on this one two guys fought
back in a physician's when after what
I'm claiming the physicians or gentlemen
and gentlemen have clean hands and so
therefore they can't be doing this and
so in his rebuttal to that one he says
okay let's take a look at this guy and
by the way the next date women died you
know so it can be done well Google talks
about data based analysis all right data
steeped analysis Scotty not civilized
he's the guys passion bordering on
finatus you do you do not truck you do
not trifle with this guy lightly he is
Hungarian he's course he doesn't even
speak Hungarian very well and certainly
doesn't speak German you know where the
hood is over in vienna and he is
in the Vienna general hospital maternity
ward it's an assistant in 1846 and he
notices there are two obstetrics clinics
here where children are delivered one of
them is populated by medical students
and this is the death rate the other one
is with midwives simply notice anything
like this line is always above this line
he goes how can this be he serves me he
so he changed serves meals at the same
time when they change the sheets which
is probably you know like every three
months despite the fact that they had to
crack them off the mattresses because
they were stuck with the pots of blood
and things like that um change the
sheets at the same time everything was
to say open the windows at the same time
sherton the clergy came in at the same
time guess what change and then what
happens is one of his friends is doing
an autopsy on when these dead women and
he gets a nicht finger and he's dead a
week later with precisely the same
symptoms as these women and he figures
it out the doctors are taking dead
material from these cadavers and putting
it inoculated injecting and in these
living women in their examinations and
you could spam these dives would come
right from autopsies and go and and and
deliver children and and and do obstruct
Rick's examinations of things they were
inoculated killing these women these
women knew that there was a problem with
this warrant they wanted to have their
babies in the muddy streets and alleys
of Vienna rather than wind up in this
ward so he says the way we fixed this
way we barricade women to get is we get
this stench of death off people's hands
and we washing chlorinated water we call
it Clorox today so they washing
chlorinated water instituted boo
there it is guess what the doctors
resented it who is this course Hungarian
coming in to tell these
ultra-sophisticated knowledgeable svelte
smooth speaking Viennese doctors what to
do they fired him guess what he leaves
hand-washing stops boom in the wrong
direction women's start dying twenty
percent death rate you know so this is
it he's not it's not renewed he goes to
Budapest he does the same thing at a
hospital there and note the name here
rochas Hospital you see it in this in
the epilogue right point 85 Vienna is
ten fifteen percent so it's like sixteen
percent higher 16 times higher over
there publishes a book he rants against
the medical establishment calls of
killers he suffers a few dementia he is
tricked into inspecting Anna st. asylum
but they're actually admitting him and
he gets left there and about a week
later he's dead and story was that he
showed up with the Knicks finger like
his buddy and very tragically and
ironically he died of an infection from
the thing that he was trying to rent
we'll get back to you he was right for
the wrong reason
this was the right reason turns out the
childbed fever is a massive
streptococcus infection streptococcus is
not a bacterium is a family of bacteria
and Louie pastor had discovered all of
this kind of stuff he was fighting the
same problem in Paris where there was a
hundred percent death rate in a outboard
obstetrics clinical with the hopeful
what's everybody called the house of
crime ten women would go in you know and
then Tim women would go out in coffins
about eight days later and he he
supposedly said this in a debate no I
actually have an english translation of
the transcript of this debate I don't
find it in there but it's representative
of what he was up against the doctors
did not believe him they still subscribe
to this miasma theory of bad wind and
odors and things like that like that but
it gets adopted in 1890 and now they
have the mantra they have the recipe if
you're sick find the microbe and kill
the microbe the patient will get better
so that's it for disease right by the
way he had zero medical credibility
Louis Pasteur same you know why he was a
chemist who and a doctor he didn't know
big toe from an appendix you know what's
this guy doing right where his
credentials so seek the micro so now we
have the answer microbe theory gets sick
you killed a micro black guy here's why
I've been able to find that a literature
about microbes being foreshadowed we
talked about precedence again goes back
to 116 bc right certain features float
in the air into the body serious disease
I need germs propagated these are
literal quote coming in and leave on
hook himself 1676 was looking at
bacteria under his microscope his
animals and things like that next topic
pellagra now we know what the matter is
now so when this disease began to sweep
through the southern United States they
were looking for
the other juror well in a 15th and 16th
century the conquistadors arrived in the
New World right and there were whole
whole region's subsisting on corn based
food corn base that was it that's what
the aid right and I was a food staple
they said hey this stuff's really good
high productivity lots of energy Rose
well let's take it to Europe so they
taken over the earth and they start
buying it in 1730 these are getting
reports of his weird disease pellagra
they call it palabra ok 1900 massive
crop failures in the southern United
States and this epidemic and Susan so
all of these all of these conditions are
hypothesized is to you know it's being
you know causal agents right I'm cured
corn you know these guys live bad lives
but hair huh hey hey thank goodness for
oh boy thank goodness for pass to her
because you know we're going to looking
for the microorganism so the big search
now goes for the microorganism no
progress search and general really
starts getting concerned about all this
and so it gets Joseph Goldberger who was
in Detroit and just solved a major
diphtheria epidemic problem turned out
it was political corruption and
ineptitude on a health guy he's although
1914 he says get down south and solve
this pellagra problem this is you know
this really bad so he goes down he looks
at his his wait a minute these people
are eating corn meal molasses and pork
fat that's it that's her diet you know
how many ways can you cook cornmeal you
know there's fritters and there's this
and there's Maggie cornbread
yeah he says this is not a microbe
disease this is a dietary deficiency be
people thinking all right they said no
and why did they say no this was a
completely socially unacceptable
diagnosis anybody know why answer was
the Civil War had concluded what about
you know 30 40 years earlier and where
was this guy from he was from Yankee
town he's one of them Yankees and wooden
well we're not you know we lost the
Civil War but we won the war
reconstruction hi by golly we're not
listening to this stuff from Washington
DC the guys that sent those armies down
in march of charmin you know Sherman's
march i don't know no way do is bogus so
they rejected well so he does an
orphanage experiment well there's Polly
girl rapping in an orphanage it goes in
and gives these little kids good diet
damn cures him so what doesn't mean
anything right so then he goes to a
prison farm where they have good food
and he says look I'll make a deal you
guys get out if you do my test 90 days
to get out they say ok so he puts him on
the corn bread and molasses and pork fat
diet and time goes on come goes on and
time goes on and on day 89 first case of
pellagra shows up week later BAM
everybody's got it he comes in he gives
them their original diet ma'am
everybody's cured everybody's released
of course that doesn't mean anything
does it absolutely not so it says okay
you guys looking for microbes what will
do so he goes to wards where there are
people are cases and against mucus fecal
material saliva skin scrapings you name
it and he puts in capsules and he holds
filth parties for he and his friends and
their family members in just those
capsules
I guess what nobody gets sick no microbe
my goodness so 1937 they figured out it
is a niacin deficiency in a read your
cereal boxes vitamin b3 so the question
is why didn't American Indians get sick
if it was it why didn't they do it
here's why because they didn't like the
hulls on the corn kernels and so they
took water and they poured it through
fireplace ashes and that put calcium
carbonate calcium hydroxide excuse me
into the water and when they soaked it
growth the vitamin b3 loose out of
combination with the that kept it from
being digested right and that was it so
the conquistadors got the corn but they
didn't get the recipe it didn't get the
methodology why was the lesson of
dietary deficiency forgotten when it had
been settled in 150 years earlier was
scurvy beats me because they were on a
mania on microbes so we're almost out of
time how are we doing here oh my
goodness okay just as I said we're 45
minutes in the presentation almost out
of time and we got a whole bunch more
slice to go so this is where you get to
work nobody's going to be sending emails
like this wonderful guy over okay i'm
going to give you 10 seconds per slide
you're going to read them i will not be
reading these slides out loud so here we
go our first one these guys here all
have opinions here we go Richard hooker
take that to the bank machiavelli
the great American patriot Thomas Paine
nobel prize for literature Maurice
Maeterlinck
the great Jewish rabbi Moses Maimonides
this next one if you follow any one of
these people this is the one this is the
one that Thomas Kuhn read in German did
not understand what he was trying to
save for long long reason and based in
large measure his is rebel you know
Scientific Revolution book okay ready
Ludwick Fleck my privilege
notice there's no mention of correctness
in this statement and then we got our
good friend mr. Paul Sappho
great observation so we're in the
epilogue now people ask me have we
learned our lesson you know is it any
different now now we've seen all of
these catastrophes and failures
everything else like this don't bet on
it please here's some more examples I
didn't even go into yellow fever Carl's
Finley told the world for 20 years
mesquita was the infection vector for
yellow fever ignored Cuban doctor proven
by Walter Reed and his crew down in
Havana hey very very nutritional court
white car excuse me rice white rice
ignored I couldn't no headway ran
offered summer I think this man should
get a Nobel Prize he was studying slight
night night blindness and children and
he went to do a follow-up study and they
couldn't do it because they were dead
and he said how can this be and he went
in and he discovered that a slight
vitamin A deficiency which caused night
blindness increased the death factor fer
for poorly nourished children by a
factor of three or four over in Africa
so he goes and get four cent vitamin E
capsules gives him to these kids they
are cured of night blindness within like
four hours he writes it up the first
rebuttal comes back titled too good to
be true it wasn't it was the real deal
dr. Burwick we talked about hand washing
chlorinated lime and things like that
he's fighting constant uphill battle get
doctors to wash your hands and share
information hospitals don't share
information because they are competitive
advantages so if you're going to get it
like a brain scan or something in a
hospital you want to shop around and go
to the go to the best one in the area
because they don't talk to each other
not mrs a doctors are washing your hands
18 as much as they think they are you've
got people going out in scrubs out of
hospitals spreading seed if boy you
don't want you don't want your
intestines to fight
about c-diff let me tell you so no we
haven't learned it okay nonetheless in
1967 Surgeon General the United States
supposedly made this statement time has
come to close the book under Section
diseases we basically wipe down
infection in the United States I'm
unable to verify it but I look pretty
hard well Stephen Jay Gould he has some
interesting observations that you can
just sort of like parse the likelihood
of that previous statement you know we
live in the age of bacteria and it lives
in places we won't even think about you
know like 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit you
know like you know 3,000 feet below the
ground and all this stuff here dominant
form life ten percent of our dry body
weight is made of of bacteria and some
of them we cannot live without so we're
walking petri dishes so we go back to
that original statement here here the
contradictions HIV SARS Ebola handlebars
toxic shock syndrome Lassa fever West
Nile virus oh oh here's no avian flu and
you know swine flu and all those forks
and everything turned upside down down
in your cafeterias now all right yeah
sure evolving antibiotics gene
reassortment going on and swine flu you
know swine flu isn't necessarily past
you go back and research the flu of 1918
came out mild in the spring and then it
killed you know they think 40 40 million
people maybe 100 million people later
that later that winter so all these
things here it can all make a resurgence
and come back this is a man you may
recognize dr. Larry brewing he's your
former google or executive director we
might be entering the age of pandemics
and this guy is the real deal he was
part of the party that annihilated and
exterminated smallpox incredible man i
didn't did not know about it him until I
read Wall Street Journal article about
it so we're going to start in some
quotes again
and of course no conversation is
complete without referencing uncle
George
and I think this has got one more
as a competitive advantage you can
almost bet that your competitors will
forget something very very fundamental
like if you know the fact that there are
dietary diseases and things like that in
technology they'll just forget lessons
of the past Napoleon once said never
interrupt the enemy when he's making a
mistake so it's a good strategy it's one
of the reasons why it's not good to talk
about a lot of the things that you do
which is what most of you don't talk
about and that's good Gibson not a
neuromancer he wrote neuromancer this is
out of an NPR interview what happens is
this what a precipitous change becomes
evident or in the necessity for it it is
not monolithically perceived throughout
the universe and so as a result you can
capitalize on that for short time the
epilogue folks heard about past juror
and germ theory and all this other stuff
and they say you know this rings a bell
and civilized had been buried in Vienna
pretty much in an unmarked grave but it
was marked and there were about four or
five people there it is his funeral no
no family right they said you know this
guy say this guy's a national hero let's
go dig him up and bring him back to
Budapest so they build this beautiful
beautiful statue here in front of the
hospital were heated and they Ribery him
in another cemetery in in Budapest we
had to call him save your mother's
everything looks like that and that's
where they bury him well some
enterprising people say you know we have
an asset we ought to really monetize
this asset you know it's a fungible
resource so let's monetize it and love a
Baba his house is just a bottom mile or
so away from here let's go fix up his
house and barium there on the grounds
and and we can set up hot dog stands and
sell curios and things like that and we
can
monetize this asset so they do you know
what they go clean up the house and they
go to go to cemetery they open up his
crib get him out and you're on their way
and they say you know what we caught him
out let sex Ram let's x-ray egg dots
okay so they take him take over the
hospital you shoot a bunch of x-rays and
then they go plant him in his house
where he is now and they go in and they
look at these x-rays what do you think
defined he didn't die of an infection
from the knick finger he had crushed
skull he had broken ribs broken arm
wrists things like that he was beaten to
death in anonymity no one ain't personal
it's just what they did with people and
insane asylums back then and so this is
one of the greatest minds and this is
how it ended so good friend mr. Voltaire
and as Kenny Roger says you gotta know
when to hold him and you got to know
when to fold them because innovation is
a full contact sport and some people are
out for blood just ask niccolo
machiavelli certainly true for mr. Simo
weiss and now one of the greatest
engineers this next slide was tough to
get put together last night Bob Noyce
never give up because innovation is what
it's all about do not be encumbered by
history but understand that when you
step out onto the battlefield you better
be prepared and it will come the attacks
will come quite often from very
surprising places all right so you want
to be ready for it if it doesn't show up
and sometimes it doesn't so much the
better all right this is a picture out
of Carolyn Katie's book used with her
permission and this is a wonderful book
here that she put out portraits of
success pictures of all of the most of
the Silicon Valley founders so this is
my bibliography plus a whole bunch of
things that I'm beginning to find now
thank you google on your book project
out of university of michigan you know
1850 books there's 18 27 books that i
found on the james lynn biography things
that I just absolutely couldn't find
three years ago are now becoming
accessible to me and I am deeply deeply
thankful that I can repay Google here I
like to thank everybody for coming thank
you for your patience this has been a
tough top presentation that's why it is
number six in my list of you know lights
part 6 it's been a privilege to be here
on my google third tech talk and I'd
love to come back and talk about sports
or science or whatever is open thank you
very much
