at researchers is Claude calm you will
see save or like 225 post a week about
web security and several post about
Black Caps blackhat spam SEO if you have
any question after this presentation you
can always email me at j su brigade that
zscaler calm I've written I've corryton
a book called the power security tools
and I've been walking on black at spammy
SEO since december two thousand nine so
during this presentation i'll try to
answer these questions what is black at
spam SEO how attackers are using black
at spam SEO how prevalent it is
especially in google search results what
are the different type of attack that
they use what search engines are
currently doing about black hat spam SEO
how users can protect themself and Sri
cannot see the button how search engine
can protect their users better so what
is black at Spanish you so what
attackers are doing is creating
thousands of fake pages for popular
search terms and creating it in a way
that they will rank high in Google
search results so to get a list of
popular search results they use google
hot trends and we've got hot trends
display every day is a list of popular
searches in the US for that day there
are 20 hot trends popular searches are
they so they get their information from
this tool to know what kind of pages
they should write then we need to get
the content and to do that they do
another google search for this popular
term and along with with the links
Google will show a short paragraph for
each webpage so they actually use this
paragraph from the google search to
create the spam pages and usually add a
lot of dates in the in the content to
show as up-to-date to google to have a
better ranking and so now that they have
all their spy
pages they need to fit them into google
so they create additional pages that are
links to these spam pages so this is an
example of spam page links to spam
content you see a lot of popular
keywords that were that were popular in
in August I think so what is the goal of
these fake pages so these texts pages
are used only to get indexed in Google
but they actually want so they want the
user to click on one of these spam page
in the search result in order to
redirect them to malicious sites and the
way they differentiate between a search
engine color like Google boat and the
user is by checking the refere so the
check if the request is coming from
somebody was in a Google being a yahoo
or any other search engine and they also
can do the resurrection with either
JavaScript or flash to make sure that
this is a real browser hitting the spam
page so that way they can feed the spam
page to Google in order to get indexed
and redirect the user to the malicious
page so to do that to create their spam
pages they actually don't use their own
website they hijack some legitimate
websites and to not be detected by the
web masters they don't modify the
existing pages they add new pages on the
website the trial will always try to
hide their spam pages so you will you
will see spam pages using xml RPC dutch
PHP which is a for wordpress page that's
used to remotely control your blog they
use robotic steel which is used by again
search engine crawlers not seen by
regular users they hide in the image
folder where the web method does not
expect to see pages they create hindin
folders on Linux like a dot something
dot file folder so they really try to
hide
the RPG is from the web editor to not be
detected and this is what spam pages can
look like so here you see just plain tex
basically with no link know CSS no style
sheets no images just content with a
bunch of dates and the sentence is put
together don't actually make sense it's
just a bunch of sentences that they got
from the google search razor put
together around one keyword but now the
spam pages are getting a lot smarter and
looks more like a real website so this
one is not an mtv page we was taken from
some water hydroxide and you will see a
lot of dates but here you will actually
see real images they make links to HTML
website I've seen links to freakers to
Facebook to NSA def style sheet and they
really look like real real page but of
course the page is actually very
different from the rest of the website
so now that they have created their
webpage they have a script on the on the
hydroxide that Roger x user to dementia
site and again they do it based on the
referer header they do it based on the
user agent so they may check if you were
actually using Internet Explorer Firefox
or any of the regular browser and you
can even use flash and JavaScript to
detect fake border from your browser
this is an example of a request and
fortunately you week ok we cannot see
the entire slide on the screen but the
first request is from a google search
you can see the referrer here is from
google com and the search was for meteor
shower tonight and the first request is
to a spam page hosted on Space Coast
dash trading that I pour calm and when
you hit the web page you see you
user does not see any content there is a
resurrection to another domain a WS
domain extension where which does
actually all checks for which does
additional checks to differentiate
between a real user or a crawler or
security tool and what you don't see
here is that this website WS will then
redirect you to we redirect the user to
a malicious site that hosts the new
malware in this case is killing 77 dash
virus Dutch coded CC but unfortunately I
cannot show the entire page here and
they slide so in a nutshell that's how
it works so a user sorry google first
will follow the blue line so Google will
connect will call the I jack site and it
will be redirected to a spam content and
that's what will be indexed in Google
that's what google will display to the
user but if a user the red dot make
popular search in Google he will find
this hijack site in the search result
click on the link but instead of going
the spam content it will actually be
redirected to to a malware they could be
more than one resurrections and it's a
simplified version with the ID there's
usually a common control server involved
which tells the hatchites act how what
keywords should create page on what
content should be there and to what
malicious website they should redirect
so how prevalent is so again that's for
the 20 deadly popular searches that
Google hot trends shows so for this
search is more than fifty percent of the
popular search content at least one spam
link in the first ten pages so all my
research all the research that I've done
was onion on the tane first page is the
first 100 result and that was from
messing march to to august so almost
sixty percent of the popular searches
contain a span
link in google and we I've seen up to
ninety percent of the first 100 links
being malicious and this is a breakdown
of all the malicious or all the searches
popular searches that I've at least one
malicious link and you can see here that
ten percent of the infected search
results add more than fifty percent of
malicious spam link so more than 50
spamming in the first 100 pages so what
are the types of attacks so what all
types of website that I that you are
redirected to after connecting to spam
page the most popular one is the vacant
average page I was green shot here so it
looks like a desktop antivirus running
on your computer which ones you that
your computer is infected with viruses
and nicely prompt you with the download
box where you can download the solution
the fake and DNT better which is of
course malicious executable i have a
video of it that i can show you if I can
if I know how to use the mac see since
hear this one so this was done on April
15 just after tax day which is a sink
April 14 so one of the popular many of
the popular searches way around the tax
day and in this example that will show
you in a minute I went to Google hot
trend looked so trend for Google's
tax-free be i believe i did so i entered
the curie in google and the first
regularly you know under the twit
twitter links and the face bullying and
some of the other real-time link the
first link on the page on in google was
malicious spamming thats redirecting me
to fake interest page
okay I'll be able to do it for screen so
this is google hot trends this is one of
the hot trend for that day I do a search
on Google gets to the first link click
on it and here it is this is a fake
interest page so you see looks like a
desktop antivirus shows me that the pc
is infected and whatever you do even if
you don't click you actually get pumped
it for executive board to download if
you try to leave the page you get
prompted for the english youtube or
against to download so that's by far the
most popular type of attack these days
with spanish you okay where's my open
office here
but of course they are changing their
attacks all the time so the other
popular type of attacks is a fake video
player you go to a page that often looks
like a YouTube page and they want you
that you either don't have the right
codec to to read the video or you don't
have the right activex in this case or
you don't have the right video player
and again you're asked to download and
install the video player and it's of
course malicious file they do the same
thing with flash update they tell you
your Flash version is out of date and
you need to update to be able to read
the video they also do more targeted
attacks for specific buzzer so for
example for Firefox they may tell you
that your Firefox action is out of date
so on this page I was actually running
firefox 3 that six at eight but I told
me my vision was to too old they also
told me my flash version was too old and
I was had to download the new version
and if you have Firefox you will see
that the page looks really like the
official Firefox page they use the same
found the same image background say Mike
type of icons and even the domain names
are pretty good for example for the
malicious executive all for the flash
update the domain name was flash update
coded CC so very easy to full user
they're pretty well done and of course
there are non-malicious span you may be
more familiar with it so this
presentation is not on this harmless
spam but really on militia spam but that
I thought I will mention it the most
popular non-malicious spam is a fake
search engine so they do the same thing
as a male spam they create fake the
hijack fake paid legitimate website they
create a new page a new spam page but
you get directly to a vacant a fake
search engine and all the links that
they show to the user are actually
advertising so they get money every time
a user click on them and there is of
course just plain old so what are the
search online doing about it so in my
opinion not enough when you see that
fifty percent of the popular search
results are actually in
fected asking this some improvement that
can be done so google safebrowsing is
not I believe the answer so if you're
not familiar with google safebrowsing
google maintains a list of black list of
malicious and phishing sites this black
list is used by most of the browser
firefox opera chrome safari but they are
limitation that we're going to more
details one of them is that x-pro does
not use google safebrowsing google will
sometimes show one in the search result
even though that links is matches they
will actually want the user and i'll
show you an example little bit later
well what's what was very surprising
from is in google you have an option
called safe search which is on by
default and with the word safe in it I
will be I will have saw that it will be
used to filter out dangerous and save
result but this time I think only use
for other content so this is an example
of a warning that Google night show in a
search result at the top here so under
the link that says decide may harm your
computer and if you still decide to
click on the link they will not redirect
you to the website they will redirect
you to another google page one in you
again that you should not visit this
website and there's no direct link
actually on this page you have to copy
and past the you will form the page to
to go to the malicious site yeah so but
what about this warning how many
warnings can you see in a google search
so i've made a comparison of at the top
the number the distribution of warnings
among such results and the number of
spam links which don't measure spelled
spam link which don't have a google
warning so you see here in purple that
41 search results had more than 50 spam
links without any warning but they were
only three popular searches that had
more than 50 warnings so the number of
warnings does not
is much lower than the number of actual
militia spam links and if you see how
will evolve over time I've looked at two
example two popular searches at some
point and I've seen I've checked how
many medicines links that's a blue line
they are in the first 100 treasured so
this one don't have any warning and how
many one in google is showing so you see
here for Anacostia River pop singer we
started day two so the second day after
it gets it got popular in it and got
listed on Google hot trends they were
about 75 militia spam links in the first
100 results and there were only the
second day only one or two spam links
and you see over time the number of
warnings goes up the number of malicious
links goes down but you see I even after
10 days there are yes there are more
warnings than spam links without warning
but they are still about seven spam
links in this search result and in the
second example it's even worse so this
one I've looked at this search 16 days
after it was popular to 20 days after it
was popular and we started with around
37 spam links without warning and after
20 days we still have more spamming that
don't have any warning than Google
warnings so even so over time Google is
doing some cleanup in the search result
there are still a lot of spam links that
are not being blocked by google and then
get the other issue with spam links so
here this was asking the first popular
solid i saw that had more than 90
dangerous link in the search result so
this time Google did a good job of
cleaning out the search result after a
few days after a few days they were
showing warning the problem is you had
to go to page seven to see the first
link without a warning so the first
seven pages of result where links where
you could not click on it because they
had a warning and you you may not see
you go well on the screenshot body and
save searches on
so I would argue that you need there's
no value for the user to see seven-page
of dentures rather 20 is looking for for
something because these pages are
dangerous and even if you're not getting
rejected to the measures websites as
absolutely no interesting content on
these pages so Google self-rising what
are the limitation of google
safebrowsing so number one is a big one
it's not part of Internet Explorer so
whatever you're doing with Google's
Rosie not protecting more than seventy
percent of the users who are using an
explorer and which do not have google
safebrowsing in the browser google
safebrowsing focus on detecting the
malicious sites so they try to detect
the measure site not the spam pages but
the the measure side that you are
redirected to after the spam page so as
a result you always a step behind spam
pages may redirect you to different
measure site at different time depending
on your browser depending on the time of
the day or depending how many times you
clicked on them and to me does not
always make sense so I'll show you one
example of diagonal diagnosis sorry
diagnostic page for cursive writing so
concert that net is a website that
apparently is not maintained by their
webmaster at all you can actually go
there if you just go to the root
directory it's fine you want nothing
will happen to your computer so what
does it say here so this website is has
been hijacked is redirecting users to
malshej sites all the time so what does
google safebrowsing say about it so they
clearly stayed here in the first first
line here that is not suspicious which
mean is not part of google safebrowsing
but then in the first box they say that
in the last 90 days they actually found
a lot of resurrection from this domain
to malicious pages and then the least a
couple of domains of malicious domains
that the website was graduating too and
you're not his exalted PL that was
the first domain that was hosting
ninety-five percent of the fake AV pages
in the first months this year so Google
knows that this website he's
resurrecting users and is still doing it
as of today to malicious pages even note
which domain but it's not part of Google
symposium so what about the other
research online and namely Bing and
Yahoo Bing is surprisingly very clean
I've seen very very few spam pages in
the search result for the popular
searches I'm not sure why I don't know
if it's because it don't index new
contents very fast I don't know if they
actually intentionally clean out their
search result but it is very clean Yahoo
is pretty bad they also have a lot of
malicious links but it takes them a lot
of time to index new content so this
pump content will show up on on google
the next day after the work they are
created but it will show up in google
maybe a few weeks later and by the time
they show up on in a yahoo search result
the hijack site may have been fixed so
these pages don't exist anymore the
nitrous site may be down so the
rejection does not happen or and simply
the search is not popular anymore so
users are not looking for these keywords
and it doesn't really matter if they
have managed pages in there so now what
about protection how users can protect
themselves first thing will be that you
may think of is antivirus right because
all this knowledge pages try to download
and run a malicious executable you
antivirus should be able to catch it
unfortunately that's not true usually
typically less than twenty five percent
and pretty often less than ten percent
of the antivirus vendor will actually
detect anything malicious there is a
website called virustotal where you can
upload files over there and it will run
the files through 40 or 42 different
antivirus including McAfee semantic any
of the entire intervals you could buy at
frys or other stores
and if you can see here in red this is
anti viruses that found the executive
executive all has been malicious and
here's their only one two three four
five six out of the 40 antivirus vendor
found some similar issues so it's very
likely that your enterprise will not
find anything my antivirus I think that
I'm using is avg and pretty much never
find anything wrong with all the
electable I I do not of course it
actually makes my life easier as a
security researcher not having to
disable and reenable my a-v all the time
so second thing will be Google
surprising again part of firefox chrome
opera i sorry not in turn expert that's
a problem internet products own
technology called the smart screen
filter I did a quick quick comprising
about what the detect and what google
safebrowsing detect and it's not too
much overlap so I don't know which one
is better than the others but clearly
none of them catch everything and of
course they cannot detect all the types
of security issues so at this killer
we've tried to approach this problem a
different way and we released a firefox
extension called search engine security
to protect fire firefox users and it's a
different approach from AV and and
google safebrowsing in the sense that
membrane in the process you go from the
google search result to a spam page the
spam page does a couple of checks and
figure out if you are a regular user or
if you are a boat or some kind of
automation tool so if you can fold the
spam page into thinking that you are not
a regular user then you will not be
redirected to the fake to the malicious
site you will either see the spam page
content or sometime you get a blank page
so what this plugin does is very simple
it actually changes the refere when you
click on a link when you leave google
being a yahoo from a surprise that when
you click on a link to go to the spam
page you will actually change the ref
and the spam page will not try direct
you to the malicious site so this is a
quick screenshot of the plug-in so it
works mainly from he works for being
Google Yahoo and the reason is ninety
percent of a lot of Dimitri at least
after spam pages look check if you're
coming for one of these three website
and you can change your refer to
anything you can leave it blank if you
install the plug-in on Firefox and you
do a search on any of these three engine
you will see under the search bar small
notification to show you if the plug-in
is on offer for this plugin so these
plugins is helping Firefox user to not
get infected not yet redirecting to the
malicious website okay it was kind of a
joke here but you cannot see it so the
other solution might be to simply switch
to being since you have magically not
much search result I didn't switch to
two biggest still like Google but you
have to be aware that if you're looking
for everything other people are also
looking for you are at risk and that's
probably something we always say about
security user education is really the
only way to fight this once users
understand that they should not download
and install any exactly ball that the
phone on internet and unless itself from
trusted sources they will always run
into issues so what could search engine
and especially google do to product that
users better asking the best way to
protect best way to protect users is
actually to focus on the spam pages that
way you always a step ahead right if you
don't go to the spam page from google
search rather than you will not end up
on the measure site also the waistband
page is work they are all days the type
of yours they use are always the same so
if you find one spam page on one website
you know what are all spam pages for the
previous
Google hot trends and you know what will
be the you are for the next for any of
the Google other Google hot trends and
you could or you can also know what are
the URL that would be used on other
domains and you can end this Pam the
spam page always look the same I mean
there are probably two or three type of
fan pages so once you are able to detect
one type of spam page you should be able
to recognize other spam pages one of the
tests we can do to double check if it is
a spam page is simply access the page in
two ways first you go directly without
any referee you should you should end up
on on the same domain as as what you saw
in the link or or another domain you
could also but if you because one of the
things that they do some time is if they
figure that you are not a your regular
user but you know to google bot or
search engine BOTS actually I direct you
to some random website like CNN com
google com so you'll end up on on domain
a calm and if you follow the link with
the correct refer meaning a referral at
show that you were coming from a google
search wind up on a different site so
that's that's how actually I do most of
the pre-filtering for malicious domains
is I go to the same webpage in two
different ways and check if I'm and if I
end up on the same domain in both case
or on different domains and if you are
on different them and that's a good
indication that something bad is going
on of course one of the problem with
google is just a scale of of everything
you do right you probably index million
millions of pages a day so even any
simple kind of featuring will take up a
lot of resources so I've published like
about four post about try and statistics
about spam SEO and what's the one thing
I was trying to do for my own research
is trying to figure out quickly watch
what you are I should focus on so by I
came up with a simple regular expression
that allows me
to inspect only two points three percent
of all the search result that I see and
still get eighty percent of this pan and
that gets me as well seventy percent of
the spam so once i apply this this
regular expression just on the you are
more than fifty percent of the yours i
get are malicious and then I can use the
other trick to with eating the the
you're in different places to feel as if
it is actually malicious or not so my
point is I think it will not be that
hard for Google to get rid of at least
eighty to ninety percent of the spam SEO
so that's not that's not hot problem and
all the security team that Google is
well aware of spammy coz foolish white
papers about fake interest pages they
have google says both everything which
is four of these major sites in after
read directions so I think it's really a
matter of kids dealing this information
upstream and actually cleaning out
search results and at the end of the
presentation I wanted to have enough
time for for questions so again if you
are interested in web security and and
black a spam SEO you can check out blog
at research the DISCOM if you have
questions you can always talk to me in a
few minutes or just or email me at JCB
ard scared calm so I only if you have
any questions yes
right so go back to slide which
explained so I I started out by using a
web browser Firefox and selenium to do
the audio to mention and was just
clicking going to google hot trend
entering search result and going through
the solar links and what I was checking
is the page relax me to another domain
so if you go if you if you if your I I
get a list of links from from my browser
I visit the link in two different ways
once i click on the google link in the
search results so I'm like a regular
user so i go i go to the spam page and
if it's malicious I'm redirected to
another website so i can find out which
domain i end up in the end and the other
way is i just type the URL in my browser
and i go directly without any offer and
the vast majority of the spam page we
say you're not the regular user here the
spam page or a direct me to a different
them in non meshes domain so by
comparing the two domains in the two
ways of doing the resurrection i am able
to tell us something's probably wrong
then for the company itself we actually
create signatures that scans the content
and tell it and and tell the user if it
if they're if they were going to
effectively page our fake video pages so
that's how i can double check either i
can look at it manually if if nothing
triggered no no vesting at your trigger
that we look at in the manually but also
while i'll just look at the content
because most of these malicious pages
are always the same I mean they make
changes from time to time but the fake
ad pages that i found a few months ago
are still existing right now let's have
different variations of the page but did
not not that much change in general yes
so sorry okay so the question was are
you sure that they are looking at the
refer to redirect people from spam page
22 malicious site and the follow-up was
since the body is it's always a race
between good guys and bad guys so if
your firefox extension yet is getting
popular doing wield the buggy i change a
tactic and use a different trick through
direct users so how do we know that they
are using the referral deck users so
most of most of them do it not one
person when most of them to do it so the
way we know it is I I was able to see
some of the PHP script that I used to do
this resurrection and I saw which what
they actually doing for for making a
difference between users and and regular
users okay so I mean the reason for this
tool is really because Google is not
doing the filtering right what I hope
will happen is that Google will actually
be able to filter out the search results
and there won't be any need for these
two anymore so it's true that nosy story
is protecting for one type of attack but
they are already attacks that are not
being detected by this tool because it
don't actually check for the refere I
did a post a few days ago about the hot
video issue so this one is similar but
what they do is they don't actually
check for the refere they have a flash
all over the page and they do the
rejection with flat
shawnee so what they look at is do you
have a full browser with flash support
so Google again Google bot will only see
the spam page won't follow the flash or
direction but the user will get
redirected to to this flash is there
another question yes so for follow
statistics he was from like march to
July so yeah did look at this it's very
hard to tell because you might get ten
ten searches with just wondering and
then one of them gets 90 links solder it
depends it really depends on how much
good content there is for this for this
keyword so most of the popular searches
are about celebrities if the celebrity
is not that one known as it's not too
much content over there so the spam the
spam pages will be pretty high in the
list of Google search result if it is
for Britney Spears some other popular
searches are the good content will come
will come pretty fast and they will push
out the spam pages from the first 100
links so it's hard to tell how its
evolving over time but it still is to
their I'm pretty merciful finding as
many malicious links as i was a few
months ago
no other question yes yeah that's so
that's evangelizing question so the
question was they use google hot trend
to get the list of keywords or should we
change the way we we actually display
information that's very interesting
because two days ago something change in
google hot trends and all my automation
to get the list of gujrat trends
actually broke so i don't know if it was
intentional or not but medically they
the type of you are you can enter in
google bot became much more strict so if
you go to Google Trends the dead will be
for example two thousand page ten dash 8
that dash 8 and before I was entering
2010 08 08 and I was working fine but
two days ago it actually i was getting
error for that and same thing a shrimp
Forks a single girl looks like something
change a few days ago and I was able to
do that you can actually not it's not
that hard to find the source code for
some of these spam pages how they do the
resurrection so you can actually look at
how they connect to how they connect to
google trends or even how they do the
right directions and make some
modification to do that but i think you
know by the time you make the
modification did it for me for a number
when they made this small modification
to google a try and it didn't take much
time to go around it so as long as
regular user I able to see this page
both will be able to see it as well but
this page only exists for us for us I
was trying to see if this type of spammy
SEO is popular in other countries and I
could not find it this another tool that
gives trends for although all of us all
the country in the world but it's very
different and the result the hot trends
you get for us for example a very
different from google hot trends yes
so did I try with other pages they'll
try to check more pages so I didn't
really want to go over ten pages because
I don't say user will actually go that
far I have some statistics about how
many links you see per page and that's
pretty pretty well distributed so you
produce pretty much see as much bad
pages in the first page as the tens page
but over time it gets it does get pushed
down to two later pages I've also looked
at how much time it takes for the spam
to get into the google indexed and first
day you don't get anything and actually
most of the spam page will not create we
only create page spam pages for the day
before but usually if you look for
trying five days to 12 days after it was
popular that's where you get the most
number of spam pages yes okay so what
about the people were behind this so I
don't know that much what I know is
actually mainly from what my colleagues
have done other secret research I have
done it looks like they're only a few
groups who are doing this if you see the
fake ad pages they look very similar and
even when there's some small variations
the source code is pretty much always
the same I've seen the source code of
some of the botnet and what you can see
is all called old code be commented out
and well vision being done so it looks
like it's a small number of people in
Eastern Europe mostly Russia one of the
program is is very hard to track down
even who is hosting this size because
spam pages are on the team a website the
malicious domains are either free
domains like subdomain of code at CC
which is a free register anybody can get
this domain for free no
I can registration and or they also
hijack other leads my website to hold
their mail site so it looks like it is a
small group of people doing this but I'm
not going for some sure okay any other
question otherwise we can either talk
later or you can send me an email if you
have a question it should be a video
available so if you want if you want to
for this to any front of college and you
can do that thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
