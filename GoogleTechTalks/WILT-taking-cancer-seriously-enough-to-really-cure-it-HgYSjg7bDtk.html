I'm a software engineer at Google in
Mountain View California I had the
distinct pleasure to welcome back dr.
Aubrey de Grey a research gerontologist
at Cambridge University whom we had the
pleasure of receiving a talk last month
hosted by yonas carlson without further
ado dr. degree so this will do that i
haven't got my microphone I better go
love it thank you very much Russell and
for introduction and for having me yes
it's a great pleasure to be back I a
month ago or so I gave a rather general
overview of the work that I do and that
I coordinate with regard to seriously
combating aging and there was quite a
lot of interest but of course there
wasn't nearly enough time for me to tell
you about anywhere near everything that
we do so I thought that it would be good
to be able to go into some more depth in
respect of one of the most interesting
and most complicated components of this
work which is the approach that I think
we need to take to combat cancer cancer
is of course something that kills people
and it kills people with a higher
prevalence the older they get more or
less so it's something without which it
would be of limited value to fix
everything else in Renee Jing and that's
why I regard as part of my job to speak
this is going to be a good summary of
the philosophy of what I have to say
it's a good summary of the philosophy of
how I think about combating aging in
general in fact I think that a lot of
the more conventional approaches that
have historically been followed in this
area have tended to oversimplify the
problem of combating aging or in some
cases actually to under simplify it to
conclude wrongly that nothing is
possible simply because it's
unimaginably difficult and yes well I'm
stone would usually right and I think it
was a good example so the talk will be
structured like this i'm going to talk
first of all a little bit to amplify the
remark i may remember to go about cancer
being an important part of aging and how
fits into the whole phenomenon of aging
and the effort to combat it then I'm
going to talk about the general
structure of how I think we need to
combat it and why the approach makes
sense you will see during part to that
it's quite ambitious and that there are
an awful lot of things that might make
it rather difficult so I'm going to go
through some of the more obvious noting
too that in the third part of the talk
and I'm they've run out of time by then
but if not then I will go on and talk
about some perhaps slightly less
intuitive pros and cons of little broke
so starting here well those of you who
were here last time well probably
recognize that I put up a table
something like this which I spoke about
a little bit during my talk a month ago
and essentially this is the summary of
how I think we can break down the
problem of combating aging into
subproblems that can be tackled not
exactly independently but at least
individually the problems are listed on
the left hand side and the solutions on
the right hand side and the solutions as
you can see here are very much ideas to
repair and reverse the accumulating
damage or of aging that is listed on the
left as opposed to merely slowing down
the continued accumulation of those
problems I've been given another laser
pointer just as my own one has run out
thank you very much for that let me just
find the right button it's probably this
one it is yeah okay um actually I got by
to this one so in my last talk i gave
relatively brief overview of the sixth
of the seven things down here junk
ingestible molecules that accumulate
inside cells and weak lead eventually in
all age two phenomena such as
atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration
and one or two other things today where
I'm going to focus on it's the bottom
one mutations in our nuclear DNA are
chromosomes and the way that we might
cope with that now I'm going to start by
amplifying the very short description of
the problem here I'm going I'm talking
about nuclear
as opposed to mutations in the
mitochondrial DNA which I consider
useful to regard separately but I'm not
just talking about mutating the molecule
to be talking about epping mutations and
I'm going to be explaining what an epi
mutation is at the moment and then I'm
going to be justifying this rather
outrageous claim at the bottom which is
that cancer is really the only
consequence of nuclear mutations or a
permutation for that matter but we
actually need to worry about so remember
if you remember from last time I spoke
about the possibility of actually giving
people who are already in middle age
before we start the prospect of an
unlimited extra healthy life span and
it's essentially indefinite youth which
is something that I've been calling
engineered negligible senescence and I
spent some time last month on the
concept that we may be able to achieve
this very far in advance of actually
achieving the whole of the technology
that delivers it the way the reason this
is true is because of a concept called
longevity escape velocity which I
described in some detail last time so I
won't talk about that now but the upshot
is that if we can do these various
things well enough to give middle-aged
people as little as 30 years of extra
healthy life by this panel of burner
fighting rejuvenation therapies that
actually repair and reverse the
accumulation of through our various
molecular and cellular changes then that
will be equivalent for functional
purposes to a completely comprehensive
perfect rejuvenation therapy so the what
I'm going to concentrate on as i said if
this bottom one today first of all
what's an epic mutation well first of
all i'm going to say why we need to
worry about fmu tations it's a simple
thing different cell types of course
express different proteins and different
RNAs in order to have a different
phenotype a different behavior different
cell types need to do different things
just in order to be useful components of
different organs but of course all of
ourselves more or less have the same DNA
sequence so this is not done by changing
the sequence that is done by
changing something else and what it
changes are the epigenetic
characteristics of our various genes so
at the mutation is like a mutation in
the sense that it is a an accidental
adventitious alteration but it's not an
alteration to the sequence it's an
alteration to these decorations that
determine which genes are expressed and
at what level methylation of the DNA
especially of such a scene basis is the
best-known aspect of at the epigenetic
regulation and other things that happen
our modifications to histones the
proteins that the DNA is wrapped around
various different types of modification
habitus turns including methylation and
phosphorylation and then at a if you
like a higher level of abstraction a
high level of how order of organization
there are changes to the density the
tightness with which our DNA is packed
into chromosomes so all of these things
can suffer these accidental advantageous
changes and all those changes
collectively can be referred to as epic
mutations that was a term coined perhaps
15 years ago by the famous gerontologist
robin holiday now the idea that
mutations Angela permutations could only
matter in respect of cancer is a pretty
ambitious one and one thing I probably
ought to elaborate on is that I'm not
actually really saying that the only
thing that matters I'm saying they're
the only thing that matters that is not
already covered by other aspects of the
strategies for engineered negligible
senescence the sense plan certainly
nuclear mutations an epic mutations
cause damage that induces cells to
undergo cell suicide apoptosis so you
get cell death and in some cases that
cell death is not compensated by the
natural cell division of other cells to
replace the cells so you need to do
something about it and that's one of the
major categories within the sense plan
that's what stem cell therapy is for
basically and there's another phenomenon
that happens which your cells get into a
state where they're supposed to die but
they don't any longer listen
appropriately
the signals either from inside
themselves or from neighboring cells
that are supposed to be telling them to
die and that again is a separate
category within the sense plan there are
a variety of techniques now being
developed to essentially encourage or
remind cells that they ought to be
listening to signals to commit suicide
and that's going rather well so these
two things are definitely going to
happen and I'm not saying they don't
matter on the contrary I'm saying they
do matter but they are covered the
question is whether anything else
matters apart from cancer in a currently
normal lifetime in terms of the
accumulation of nuclear mutations and
I'm giving the freight a general sort of
nonspecific cellular malaise the thing
is of course that if the were a very
generalized decline of cell function as
a result of spontaneous accidental
mutations and epping attentions we could
be in real trouble because different
cells would have different problems and
would therefore require different
solutions and we have a rather large
number of cells so we could have a
rather large number of problems in
rather a large number of required
solutions and that would be very
difficult whereas here we have more or
less to rather well defined families of
problem that are altogether more
straightforward or we're not very
straight forward to address so I want to
explain to you why I think we don't need
to worry about general cellular malaise
and it's always good when putting
forward a radical interpretation of
existing data to be able to point to two
things first of all to the actual data
that seemed to support ones contention
and secondly to be able to explain from
a theoretical basis why the contention
actually does make sense even though one
might not have realized it beforehand so
here's the Dayton and this comes from
the laboratory of y and v in novato in
moraine and in fact this is the group
probably that's done the most work on
the potential for a nonspecific general
cellular malaise to result in a normal
life time from nuclear mutations and
ethel mutations and to lead to therefore
contribute contributions to aging now
some tissues accumulate mutations
throughout the lifespan this is in
I of course which is why the x axis goes
up to something in the region of three
years the small intestine is an example
of at issue in which mutations do
genuinely accumulate albeit it seems at
a decelerating rate there are good
reasons why we don't need to worry about
the small intestine and that's something
that I'm going to come back to later in
the talk so just hold that thought for
the moment and concentrate instead on
the lower part of the graph especially
on the very lowest the green line here
is the trajectory the age-related
trajectory of mutations in the brain and
as you can see mutations rise in
frequency during the very early part of
life when the mouse is growing and this
is easily easy to understand because
cell division is a very mutagenic
process it's error-prone sometimes
replication of the DNA simply throws in
incorrect basis so that's no surprise
but throughout adulthood the right the
abundance of mutations in the brain goes
up by an undetectable amount that's
pretty damn good news because something
that contributes to aging by definition
it has to change with age and if it's
not changing then therefore it really
say could probably doesn't contribute to
it to aging which is pretty good news
but why does it make sense why would we
have evolution what would evolution have
given us such good DNA repair and
maintenance machinery that there was no
increase to speak of in the abundance of
mutations in the most important issues
such as the brain well this is a very
interesting problem because we generally
believe in gerontology that our
anti-aging intrinsic systems in other
words our repair and maintenance systems
tend to be only as good as necessary but
this seems to be an exception and so
what one needs to do is explain why it
should be an exception and this is my
explanation and instantly this other
paper in which I described all this just
came out literally last week so you can
go and get it in reckless and debating
and development at the moment um there
is a very well-established phenomenon
that was in fact first
proposed about 50 years ago by a famous
evolutionary geneticist in America
called George Williams called
antagonistic pleiotropy the idea he had
was that genes or indeed genetic
pathways that are beneficial to the
organism early in life will be selected
for and retained during evolution even
if they are actively bad for us late in
life and this is simply because there
are not so many organisms around in the
wild of an older age than there are of a
younger age because of course you know
shit happens organisms get eaten they
start to death they freeze to death so
selective pressure to respond to the
good or bad consequences of the
possession of a particular genetic
pathway is lower if that pathway is
expressing this good or bad consequence
late in life than if is expressing it
early in life and if it's doing both as
I'm describing here then the young
phenotype will outweigh the old fear
inside this is not controversial at all
this is completely accepted by
gerontology by gerontologists and
possibly the most extreme example is
something that will actually come back
to later on the interdependence of cell
proliferation potential for the
maintenance of tissues like the blood or
the skin that need to be continually
replenished by stem cell division as
against the potential for uncontrolled
cell division and the need for pathways
that control cell division which is of
course something that we needed or not
to die of cancer now what I realized is
that a very similar concept can be
applied to the comparison between
mutations that cause cancer and
mutations that cause general cellular
malaise and I'm calling this particular
concept protagonist apply trophy because
what we're talking about here is genes
or pathways which are good in two ways
and let's suppose they're good for one
reason I'm going it reason x early in
life and they're good for another reason
late in life now for exactly the same
reason that antagonistic pleiotropy
works it's also the case that genes of
this sort will only be
because of the reason early in life the
fact that they have this additional
beneficial effect late in life will not
be the reason they are selected for and
that means that the defense against this
late life problem in other words the
ability to avoid the late life problem
will indeed appear to be what you might
say what you might call unnecessarily
good which of course is exactly what I
was showing you here this lack of
accumulation of mutations in the brain
is the demonstration that our ability to
avoid accumulating mutations in the
brain is unnecessarily good all right so
this is pretty good news we have a
theoretical understanding and an
experimental understanding of why
general cellular malaise will not be
likely to accumulate as a problem that
contributes to aging in a currently
normal lifetime I've gone talk a little
bit more about what the mechanism for
this is very straightforward the reason
why cancer causing mutations are special
is because it only takes one cell to
kill you if it gets the wrong sort of
mutations that cause it to divide
uncontrollably and eventually become a
life-threatening cancer whereas for
anything to matter as a biological
functional level to the organism that
does not involve loss of control of the
cell cycle it has to affect a lot of
cells it has to affect a large
proportion of the cells in whatever
tissue is supposed to have that function
so basically anti-cancer defense is a
requirement that evolution has
experienced and it had to drive the
quality of our nuclear DNA repair and
maintenance machinery up to a point that
is unnecessarily good with regard to
general cellular malaise it's had to do
this purely in order to avoid us dying
of cancer before we have had any
offspring that if the whole cup the
protagonist acquire treppie concept
applies to cancer now that of you who
know biology may have appreciated
already that this is a little bit over
simplistic here is something that we
need to bear in mind in this there is a
lot of redundancy that is built into
specific defenses we have lots of
different ways to make cells effectively
detect that they have undergone mutation
or DNA damage and simply to commit
suicide or else to go into a state
called senescence where they won't
divide as a defense against becoming
cancerous and there is also the fact
that you know these defensives only
apply to cancer as well as the fact that
they are numerous and mutually redundant
all of these things essentially offset
the argument i just gave about the cell
number the fact that it's only one cell
vs a large number of cells but this is
not a complete argument unless we can
actually suggest that they totally
offset the the number the numerical
disparity argument that i gave a moment
ago and we can see quite easily that
they would not be so good as totally to
offset it by simply asking ourselves
well let's uh let's see what would
happen over each over evolutionary time
to an organism in which this whole
concept this protagonist exploit repa
concept did not apply to distinguish
cancer from other mutations if we have
an organism in which all mutations
matter equally whether or not they cause
cancer then there are going to be a
variety of anti mutation mechanisms
whether they be stopping vacations from
happening or repairing them or whatever
and they will fall into these two
categories there will be defenses that
are specific to cancer and there will be
defenses that are there are against
other sorts of DNA damage damage that
could cause general cellular malaise now
repair and maintenance machineries that
applies to the whole genome by
definition combats both of these things
in combat mutated in all genes that
means that it will be more strongly
selected for both for its evolution and
for its retention than the pathways that
only defend against cancer therefore
what's going to happen is that the
selective pressure to maintain these pan
genome repair and maintenance path
weight will be higher and mutations will
accumulate less easily
over evolutionary time therefore you
will get a progressive essentially a
progressive victory of the pan gene and
repair maintenance mechanisms over the
strongly over the cancer specific ones
the council specific ones will certainly
be retained because they have a good
deal of utility but they will not be the
only ones that are retained so the
defenses against general cellular
malaise will end up being unnecessarily
strong in other words protagonist
exploit ropey will emerge that's the
theory now I emphasize of course at the
bottom that it is only a theory and I
would be the first to concede that we
need a lot more data on all this the
experimental work that I showed in a few
slides ago is one of the few studies
that have been done that really
thoroughly addressed this thing it's
only but only one species it's only been
done in one lab you know other
experiments have been done that are
related but not nearly enough of them we
need more work on this but that's the
general principle so coming back to the
whole theme of this part of the talk and
to basically conclude this part of the
talk I just want to explain how cancer
fits into the aging phenotype the aging
problem and in particular I want to
explain how it will fit in as and when
we develop the therapies that will be
necessary to address other aspects of
aging of course many of you will be have
only limited if any knowledge of the
various approaches that I propose to
attack other aspects of 18 but most
people know about some of them i
mentioned stem cell therapy briefly
earlier on as something that is going it
required to replace cells in areas of
the body that do not naturally replace
their cells and I'm sure you all know
that in some areas stem cell therapy is
moving rather well even to the clinical
trial level similarly other areas of
biology are bearing down very
effectively on a number of the other
types of molecular and cellular damage
that are side effects of being alive in
the first place and that eventually
caused us to die but
the point of their going well and so if
we were to neglect cancer we really
could with quite high probability end up
in let's say 20 or 30 years from now in
the rather invidious situation whereby
we can fix everything else and we have
increased our lifespan by a little base
our life expectancy but only a little
bit and then we'll all die horribly
because we'll all be done if cancer
because we dragged our feet and didn't
get on and invent cancer therapies that
were as effective in terms of post
burning death from cancer as other
therapies were for postponing death from
other causes so I don't regard that
prospect as particularly attractive and
I think that gerontologists in general
are beholden to consider cancer as part
of their problem which a lot of them
don't so what is my solution well as I
said first of all i'm just going to
really give an outline and then i'm
going to go to drill down a little bit
into some of the more obvious problems
here's the outline so cancer is the
hardest part of aging to combat i told
you one reason why that is true namely
that just one cell going awol can um you
know can kill us but the big reason why
cancer is the hardest part of aging to
combat is because it has natural
selection at its disposal it is a
furnace of genetic inventiveness in fact
every cell in a cancer is a furnace of
genetic inventiveness and there are
after all a trillion cells in a cancer
that's big enough to be clinically
relevant so we have the big problem that
if you treat if you give some sort of
therapy against a cancer that broadly
works then the will be with high
probability some cells in the cancer
that have mutated or indeed do mutation
cunt in response to the therapy to
resist this therapy and to survive and
withstand it and unfortunately of course
having withstood it they will then
proliferate just as the original cancer
did and you'll be back where you started
except that the council will be even
harder to get rid of than it was before
and you know that this is a big problem
and it's a particularly big problem
simply because we've got an awful lot of
DNA to play with
one approach to addressing this rather
daunting prospect is that we could just
apply lots of cancer therapies all at
the same time so that the cancer just
had you know an awful lot of problems to
solve so to speak and maybe it just
wouldn't succeed and that might work
some of the time but I think it's useful
to try to think a way out of the box
here and to look at the prospect that
there might be a cleaner more if you
like monolithic solution but
nevertheless one that really when it
works well and furthermore we can see
why it would work and we can work
towards if you like the rational design
of the implementation of that therapy
and a particular thing that I want to
point out it I really meant out of the
box I mean that it's okay for a solution
of this sort to be so ambitious that in
today's world we wouldn't want to
consider it in a world in other words
where other things kill us in an
age-related way already where other
things become more problematic with AIDS
what we're looking at here is something
that would we must look for therapies
that might not make sense until and
unless we fix everything else in aging
so here is the essence of my proposal it
seems to me that even though evolution
is very clever and evolution within a
tumor it's very clever there is only so
much it can do in the time that it has
before the cells just wither away and
die there are only a trillion cells you
may think that's a little bit of a
strange use of the word only but it's
still a finite number of cells and when
cancers mutate to resist therapies I
need to resist the anti-cancer
mechanisms that the body has
intrinsically what they tend to do is
they turn particular genes up or down or
on or off genes that for example will
break down some particular
chemotherapeutic compound or will chuck
it out of the cell before it gets to our
sufficient abundance things like that
what they don't do what countries do not
do is invent whole new jeans out of thin
air
they sometimes of course mutate genes so
they just don't work at all which is a
sort of special case of changing gene
expression level but creating a new gene
out of nowhere is something that Kansas
just don't do because it takes too long
it's too unlikely in the context of a
cancer evolution does it all the time of
course but evolution even doesn't do it
very often evolution mainly works at the
level of changing gene expression and
the point evolution has a lot longer
evolution of the organism has a lot
longer a lot more cells to work with
than the evolution of a cancer so this
is the proposal that I have been putting
forward over the past few years whole
body interdiction of lengthening of
telomeres another of these rather
mouthful names like seem to be rather
prone to give two things and here's the
general concept well actually no before
I give you the general concept this is
for the non biologists here a little bit
of a bit of background on the role of
telomeres in aging because this is
probably the aspect of the biology of
aging that is most profoundly
misunderstood by the general public and
indeed worse than that it's an area that
the general public think they do
understand so telomeres are the ends of
chromosomes they are sequences that play
a role first of all in stopping
chromosomes from being joined together
end-to-end by the machinery that men's
broken chromosomes but secondly they're
there to solve something called the end
replication problem our DNA our
chromosomes are of course molecules that
have ends they are not circular unlike
bacterial DNA which is circular and when
the DNA replication machinery works on a
linear DNA molecule it doesn't complete
the job this is a very profound an
intrinsic property of all DNA
replication enzymes is they are unable
to complete the replication of the very
end of the chromosome and this would
realize back in the early early 1970s
actually independently by a Russian
professor and by Jim Watson who is
famous
one or two other things so there's this
problem the chromosome gets shorter a
little bit shorter where it's replicated
so of course when cells divide they have
to replicate their DNA and over the
lifetime of the organism whether it be a
mouse or a human or whatever there will
be a certain number of cell divisions in
any given cell type and the chromosome
will thereby get shorter a lot of people
a lot number ologist think well this
might actually have something to do with
aging because our cells continue to
divide they become progressively unable
to divide any further because of this
problem because their telomeres go away
and they start doing things like indeed
joining chromosomes end to end and they
end up therefore with a problem now it
turned out that that's not true or at
least it's very nearly not true most
cells simply don't divide that often in
the lifetime of the organism they have
plenty of telomere plenty enough
telomere to get them through so they
just don't have this replication limit
on them furthermore there is an enzyme
and enzyme called telomerase which
compensates for the end replication
problem and relink sins the telomere and
telomerase is of course very important
in the germline in the cells in our
ovaries and testes that create sperm and
eggs that lead to the next generation
because of course over one generation to
the next to the next there is an
indefinite amount of cell division that
needs to be maintained but too long rate
is also expressed at trace levels but
adequate levels in all cell types that
we have that have to divide more often
than they could with the amount of
telomere that we're born with that
basically means stem cells or tissues
like the blood or the guts or the skin
or the lung which divide reasonably
regularly because the cells that they
give rise to are constantly lost in
large mammals only the cells that need
to divide a lot of times in a lifetime
to express telomerase in mice which for
this purpose can't save small mammals
there is an awful lot of telomerase in
most of the cell types well in humans we
only express the absolute bare minimum
of salama raised in the cells that need
it and that seems to be true for most
law
judge mammals and this is well
understood this is well understood to be
a really great defense against cancer
because unless you're a small mammal
then you've gotta have a bit of two
linear in yourselves just to keep the
cells happy and not joining their
chromosomes end to end but even a little
bit of telomere is enough for a cancer
to grow even without telomerase
expression without this compensatory
mechanism to grow enough to kill the
organism but if you're a human or a cow
or gorilla then you can withstand a
tumor that's let's say an inch across
it's not going to kill you and if that's
as far as it can get without doing
something about its telomeres then
you've got not you've got much less of a
problem if a cancer has to turn on
telomerase in order to carry on dividing
enough to kill you then then you better
use that it's something that you can use
to your advantage to avoid getting
cancer so that's why large mammals which
would not be killed by a cancer that was
small only by a cancer that was so big
that it couldn't get that way without
expressing telomerase they make sure the
counselors do actually have to mutate to
express the telomerase in other words
they turn to llama right off in all the
cells for which they can get away with
that so this means that the general
concept that is present in the popular
understanding of the biology of Aging
lend me the concept that sells get into
a state where they can't divide anymore
because their telomeres are too short is
only a very rare phenomenon in the human
body it happens in a few cells here and
there in a lot of tissues and it happens
in one particular tissue quite a lot the
immune system which they don't have time
to talk about today but it's a
relatively rare phenomenon compared to
what most people tend to think alright
why have I told you all about that
because I want to tell you what the
therapy is this is wilt in a nutshell
the idea is to take cells that from the
human body and manipulate them in just
the same sort of way that is very much
in the news at the moment to D
differentiate them into more primitive
states like an embryonic stem cell and
then to read if ur n she ate them into
the state that we'd like them to be in
in particular in this case
would like to get them into a state
where they were faithfully behaving as
stem cells of each of our various
rapidly renewing tissues like the blood
and the garten skin of course this is
something we can't quite do yes we're
getting there though there are an awful
lot of work going on to make this a
reality what I propose is that we
actually eliminate the genes for the
compensatory mechanisms that I mentioned
earlier on I've mentioned something
called alts here I'll come back to that
later so don't worry about that for the
moment but in particular to get rid of
the genes actually not simply to
suppress their expression but to
eliminate the genes themselves in but
using ex vivo genetic manipulation of
course we need to make sure that these
stem cells have respectively long
telomeres initially so that there can be
some use I'll probably be able to get to
this other last thing about genetic
resistance to chemotherapy so that's a
bit of a detail really but the idea here
is that if someone's got cancer or even
if once we get this working safely they
are old enough that they might get
cancer soon then we can introduce cells
like this into the body and they can act
as our stem cells now of course
themselves by definition they divide 22
and differentiate to make tissue that
matter and as I mentioned stem cells of
these sorts of tissues have to express
telomerase in order to last all our
lives so these cells will not work
forever however they probably will work
for about a decade so a periodic
replenishment of our various stem cell
pools with cells that do not have any
telomerase genes and therefore could not
mutate to compensate for their end
replication problem this would be a way
of maintaining us themselves are stem
cell pools rather without the individual
cells but not giving us a risk of cancer
question cells cells in tissues that are
not maintained by stem cells are
amenable to a similar approach which in
this case would be using in situ in vivo
gene therapy rather than genetic
manipulation in the in the laboratory
but the same concept applies
okay so that's all a bit of a mouthful
so let me show you what I mean
graphically the situation we have at the
moment in someone that doesn't get
treated for cancer is they have various
continually renewing tissues like the
blood and skin which continue and renew
indefinitely throughout the lifespan of
the organism but if a mutation or a
sequence of mutations happens that make
something a cancer or nearly a cancer
starts it to divide uncontrollably then
eventually when it gets into a
particularly mutagenic state called
crisis it will turn on to la Mer age and
thereby be able to divide indefinitely
and that will cause the cancer to grow a
lot and eventually to become malignant
and metastasize and that's the end of
you now therapies that we have at the
moment for cancer are all characterized
by this lower half of this slide namely
the same sort of thing happens and when
we notice the camp so we do something
about it we try to knock the cancer back
and kill the cancer without doing
ourselves too much damage elsewhere but
of course because cancer cells are just
cells and they are rather similar to
other cells there's only so much we can
do and so we may knock the cancer back a
little bit but by and large we won't
extend lifespan all that much supposing
we just didn't have telomerase if I
think I was able to click my fingers and
just eliminate the telomerase games from
all yourselves well you wouldn't die of
cancer because a cancer would get to
this new highly mutagenic station that
wouldn't be enough it wouldn't have a
telomerase gene to turn on so the
council would eventually regress before
it kills us and any new cancers that
came along later would do the same thing
but it would all be completely
irrelevant but could he be dead by then
because he wouldn't have any blood
because your stem cells would have given
up so well proposes that we do exactly
this we eliminate the telomerase genes
but we also periodically replenish the
stem cell pools in this way so that when
our stem cells are giving up because of
the end replication problem we rescue
the tissue by putting in new stem cells
that still don't have telomerase genes
but do have the sufficiently long
telomeres to keep the cells going for
about a decade before they get to have
the same
problem we have to do it again well this
is a rather ambitious idea and the more
you know about biology the more AG ask
you will be at what I've said so far I'm
quite sure of that but I feel that as I
said earlier on we do have to take
cancer seriously in order to have a
prayer of coming up with therapies that
will combat cancer enough as much as we
will be combating other aspects of aging
within the foreseeable future and so I'm
rather reminded of another thing assists
remark Niels Bohr who said this i think
it was to Vulcan poli at some point well
what i'm going to do for the rest of the
talk is to try to give you a feel for
why it may be crazy enough and also it
may not be too crazy i run a workshop
back in 2004 to well actually know that
workshop was in 2002 to evaluate this
this was a proposal that i first came up
with only in March of 2002 and the very
first thing I did was to convene a nice
little invitation-only workshop at which
the world's leading specialists in all
of the various areas that may that may
bear on the plausibility of this
approach came and considered the whole
thing in great detail for a whole day
and there was efficiently convinced that
it wasn't obviously not going to work
that they were willing to or sign up to
a paper that I wrote that what I drafted
anyway that was published about 18
months later so that's a good start this
is definitely not just me coming along
and telling you that something might
work this has authoritative support and
endorsement from other people so what
are the more obvious problems and what
are our chances of overcoming them well
as I say I'm going to start with whether
this is actually good enough whether
this is enough to really outwit the
ingenuity of cancer the first question
you may have it will hang on hang on
cancers and I just said are composed of
roughly a trillion cells by the time
they kill us now a trillion is only 2 to
the power 40 okay and that means that a
cell can go from being one cell to being
a trillion cells in
only 40 cell divisions now in fact
telomeres even in humans and other
species that have relatively short
telomeres and no telomerase in most
cells till knees are long enough to
allow considerably more than 40
divisions probably more like 60 or 70 so
it looks like we might be in a bit of a
problem but it turns out not to be true
for two reasons the first reason is that
there's not just cell division in the
cancer there's also a humongous amount
of cell death so it cells are mutating
all the time as I mentioned and most of
those mutations are not good for the
cancer cells at almost then we're
absolutely fatal for the cancer cells so
there's a fantastic amount of cell death
going on which of course increases the
number of cell divisions that the cells
that don't die need to do in order to
get up to this level of a trillion cells
second thing that means that the what's
called the hayflick limit the limit on
cell divisions is indeed our friend when
when it comes to cancer is that the
mutations that cause cancer don't all
happen at the same time what happen is
one mutation will happen that will knock
out one particular pathway and allow the
cell to start dividing but offer its to
buy a little bit it'll find that it's
being constrained by the extracellular
matrix so as to do some more mutation
that causes genes to be expressed that
break down the extracellular matrix and
those second mutations don't happen in
all of the let's say thousand or
millions cells in this aspiring cancer
it'll only happen in one of those cells
so after let's say it got to a million
cells after twenty cell divisions after
forty cell divisions it won't be in a
trillion it will only be at two million
because the saurian probably 1,000,000
in fact because the early what cells
will have died and of course it's not
just two mutations that you need to get
a cancer it's quite a lot so anyway the
upshot of all this to cut a long story
short is that most people recognize a
council needs to get up to at least
three or four hundred cell divisions
before it becomes fatal that's pretty
good news policy number two till that's
what is dangerous well this is true so I
mentioned earlier on that when telomeres
get too short the consequences that
chromosomes start to be joined together
and to end and that's very very bad for
the cell
but initially the cell might just
survive because the cell has ways to
break chromosomes apart again they don't
necessarily break in the same place mind
you and lots of things can happen
there's a result of that in particular
lots of genes can become either present
in only one copy rather than two or only
three copies rather than two things like
that so you have of course there by a
lot of changes of gene expression which
is exactly what cancers need to do to
mutate to do well so indeed it turns out
that having really short telomeres is
bad its mutagenic but that's only bad
for the initiation of cancer for the
progression of cancer to a point where
it might need to llama raised in order
to get beyond that you've got to have
telomere maintenance because the overall
effect of this mutation process even if
it involves joining chromosomes together
and breaking them again will kill the
cell after not many cell divisions at
all after only a few at nurse unless it
can find some way to stabilize the
system by expressing telomerase and
repairing the end of the chromosomes
again so I said I was going to mention
alt I haven't mentioned all yet too long
raise it turns out is indeed activated
to high levels for this purpose in
perhaps 90 or more percent of cancers in
virtually all cancers in the blood or
the skin or other tissues that are
maintained by stem cells but in some
tissues especially in skeletal muscle
for example which leads to sarcomas or
in the brain where you have glioblastoma
or actually um liposarcoma xin in the
fat tissue in there up to half of
counselors do not actually express
telomerase then put in a new system
called alt alternative lengthening of
telomeres what that stands for and we
have a problem we don't know which genes
are expressed in alt that caused it to
be able to do this we know the dynamics
of telomere lengthening is very
different in off than it is in salama
rate it's much more chaotic but it works
and it's rather important that we figure
out what genes are running this system
we haven't got it yet but the good news
is there must be some genes that are
actively
in alt and not present most of the time
as opposed to the opposite way it's just
sort of a loss of the functioning of
cell of James that are always activated
we know this because inactivation genes
is much much much easier than activating
genes that have been deliberately turned
off by methylation of DNA and so on so
and we know that because telomerase
activation in countries that do have
telomerase is a very late event during
cancer so they're going to be some genes
we just have to find them and lots of
work is going on this now it's
fashionable so for the purposes of today
you can regard the problem of alt as
being equivalent to the problem of
telomerase okay so that's my reasons for
thinking that this will work if we can
do it and I want to spend the last just
about 10 minutes on the question of
whether we can actually do it whether we
can first of all implement this remove
the telomerase genes from enough of
ourselves to make a difference and
secondly whether we can implement the
fixes to the various side effects on
stem cell dynamics that I mentioned
earlier let's do that second one first
well the thing is some of this is
actually already rather easy let's look
at the blood there are lots of diseases
of blood stem cell maintenance aplastic
anemia and dis keratosis congenita and
things like that and the treatments for
them are not exactly working perfectly
yet but they're getting their they're
not bad and those therapies simply
involve a bone marrow transplant it
involves replenishing stem cells with
new stem cells that are working better
and bone marrow transplants you know we
could we'd like to be able to do them
better than we can but we can now do
them pretty well so this is technology
that by the time we fixed all the other
really rather difficult aspects of what
I've been telling you we really ought
not to have a problem with now the blood
is not the only tissue that we need to
worry about here I mentioned earlier
that we need to worry about the gut the
lung and the skin as well that's
probably all incidentally but
nevertheless we do have to worry about
all of them it's been done in mice and
dogs already in the gut essentially
either using split forward surgical
techniques or using chemicals that
essentially strip away the gut lining
so that you can replace it with other
cells it's not been tried in humans it's
a little bit not-ready-for-prime-time
but progress is being made again in the
lung the same sort of problem exists
cystic fibrosis is a disease of the lung
which could in principle be treated by
stem cell replenishment and so that's
what being looked at and the skin
interestingly he's going very well this
way partly because of the medical
problem of treating burns fitting
serious burns and secondly because of
straightforward cosmetic surgery people
having skip chemical peels to rejuvenate
their skin this shows the sort of thing
that actually happens and why it's not
not too hard to replenish the stem cell
pools and skin the skin to a first
approximation has two layers the dermis
and the epidermis and it's under the
epidermis we need to worry about here
because the dermis have cells in it that
do not divide very often cells called
fibroblasts it's the epidermis that
matters and luckily it seems that the
dermis orchestrates the behavior of the
epidermis so this is a figure from a
paper in which a colleague of mine
removed the epidermis from some normal
hair forming skin in a mouse and
replaced it with some epidemics from the
cornea of the eye which is obviously a
very different sort of epidermis and
within no time at all like a matter of
days or a week or two anyway that
epidermal tissue had been reorganized
and reprogrammed by the underlying
dermis in such a way that it behaved
exactly like normal endogenous hair
forming epidermis just like this and has
were indeed formed and so on so this is
rather good news it basically means that
the stem cell maintained component of
the skin is so plastic that it can be
essentially directed to do the right
thing by cells that we do not have to
replace the gus is an interesting tissue
for one other reason namely that
according to what you might read in the
academic literature the stem cells in
the gut divide quite often a lot more
often than the stem cells in the skin or
the blood and that would be a problem
here it might mean that rather than
placing the stem cell pools every 10
years we might have to replace them
every let's say month and that would be
altogether more impractical however
there are some good reasons to believe
that this can't possibly be true
probably the best reasons come from
studies of mice whose telomerase genes
have indeed been removed not by gene
therapy but by germline manipulations in
their parents these mice do not get
problems in their gut any sooner than
they get problems in blood and the skin
and so on so this means that by one
mechanism or other their stem cells are
maintaining telomere length for the same
amount of time they have a same rate of
tilling their loss as other tissues one
interesting possibility is that they do
this not by having a slow rate of cell
division but by segregating the strands
of DNA appropriately so as to keep the
long strands in the stem cell this is a
model called the immortal strand
hypothesis that's had some very
interesting experimental support
recently we don't know but the thing is
we don't need to know we just know that
the gut does not have a problem that is
more serious than the blood or the skin
I mentioned earlier that some tissues
that get cancers are not maintained by
continuous division of stem cells muscle
brain fat and here we have this problem
of alts that we also have the problem
that we can't simply maintain these
tissues by changing the stem cells
outside the body we are going to have to
do somatic gene therapy and furthermore
it's harder than normal somatic gene
therapy where you just put a new gene
into the chromosome this is the case of
something where you want to change a
gene in fact in this case delete a gene
or two that are already present in the
chromosome that's the technology that
goes by the name of gene targeting and
there are two major ways to go about it
one is to exploit our own repair
machinery to basically trick our repair
machinery into incorporating changes
into the DNA when in fact it's trying to
incorporate restoration of of what it
perceived as damage and the second
approach is to use a very clever system
that bacterial viruses back
phages have evolved and I'll come to
that in a moment first of all homologous
teen therapy basically what happens if
you put in some DNA that looks like a
bit of damaged chromosome that the DNA
repair machinery recognizes or other
miss recognizes as a problem and what
happens is that by essentially a process
that's similar to what happens during
meiosis during cell division making
sperm and eggs you get the new DNA the
engineered DNA incorporated into the
chromosome in place of DNA to which it
is very similar in sequence in other
words homologous and this is a very cool
way of achieving these sorts of
approaches unfortunately but precisely
because it's a damage repair process
it's not very reliable this DNA will
preferentially go into the place it was
designed to go in because these green
bits on the engineer DNA are similar to
the green bits in the chromosome but
with an unacceptably high probability it
will also go in elsewhere or in multiple
copies or anything like that so I have
high hopes for an alternative approach
which is this bacterial virus media hit
approach but terior phages have special
sequences called a tractor sites that
allow them to integrate into the genome
of the bacteria that they have infected
and they do it not by hijacking the
machinery of the bacteria itself but
rather by carrying their own genes for
this genes called integrators integrate
these are very sequence-specific they
allow a recombination event a crossing
over event that incorporates these two
circles into one circle and because of
the way they work combining two
sequences that are not identical to each
other they create a situation here in
which the same enzyme does not do the
reverse reaction you need a different
enzyme called an Exeter neighs to do
that so this is a lovely way of
regulating the system but also because
the phage is a piece of circular DNA
rather than a linear piece of DNA like
on the previous slide the whole business
of adventitious unscheduled insertion of
this DNA into a
random wrong place in the genome it's
much much rarer it hardly ever happens
so this is a much more reliable and
controllable way of going about this
sort of thing and I have high hopes that
we may be able not only to insert but to
disrupt genes using this technology um
well I'm I suppose I have a couple of
minutes left but I really I wanted to
leave time for questions so but I'm
sorry to stop here and let people pipe
up thank you here's microphone give a
question okay
Aubrey as you know I agree with a lot of
what you have to say but you didn't talk
much about the fact that stem cells
rather than somatic cells or I think
emerging is the responsible for cancers
and also the role of telomerase is mulch
much more multi-varied than just the
lengthening of Tina Marie so obviously
if you get rid of it you're going to in
effect effect on awful lot of other
things Timmy I seem to have a slide on
this so well yes so certainly it seems
clear that stem cells are the origin of
a lot of cancers and this is really no
surprise especially for cancers that are
driven that are maintained by the
expression of telomerase because if a
cell has its telomerase genes really
really heavily completely turned off
then it's going to take a lot of
mutation and epping mutation to turn
that gene on again whereas if it's sort
of slightly on already because the stem
cell needs it to divide enough then it's
going to be easier it's going to take
less mutation to turn it on to a
sufficient extent to maintain the cancer
so this is the main reason why we think
that stem cells are largely the main
problem that caused cancer cancers have
well there's a concept that's very
popular these days called the cancer
stem cell which is a slightly different
thing this is within a mature cancer the
subset of themselves that seem to have a
lot of division potential but that's a
separate question that we really don't
know what that has to do with the cancer
we do know however that whether stem
cells are responsible for cancer or not
and whether stem cells exist already in
an amateur cancer they still have to
divide and therefore they still have the
end replication problem so it doesn't
really affect what I've been telling you
now what might very much effect will
have been telling you is that as Kevin
just mentioned the role of telomerase
may not be restricted to telomere
lengthening no I do want to say may
because actually it's very hard to
determine for sure whether a particular
phenotype is caused by telomere
shortening or by some other deficiency
of telomerase if you do an experiment in
a telomerase deficient
however a couple of questions that we
really need to ask in in determining
what impact that would have on worlds ah
these ones at the bottom first of all
telomerase is actually not just one
protein it's one protein plus one RNA
molecule over two encoded by a different
gene and the evidence that we have at
the moment that there may be roles for
telomerase outside the lengthening of
telomeres that evidence predominantly in
fact overwhelmingly relates to the
overexpression of the protein components
so we have the option in other words to
to knock off the RNA component and
achieve they wilt the wealth some goals
and leave the protein component alone to
do whatever it might do the second point
that I think really has to be drawn
attention to is that the protein
component which is the one that seems to
have some interesting roles in mice that
have been found in mice the protein boat
is the one that is suppressed in human
somatic cells in as much as possible the
RNA component is actually expressed
quite quite prolifically so it looks
very much as though whatever problems
mice may have that they solve by
expressing a lot of telomerase we have
already found evilution our evolution
has already found alternative solutions
such that not allowing cells to express
Angela Mraz at all would not have an
effect of course this is a relatively
weak argument we certainly need more
experimental data on this it could be
for example that stem cells do actually
need that trace amounts of telomerase
even though they're real traces but at
this point I would say things are
looking good so I've just been told by
our array vtec that he's graciously
allowing us to run over a bit so we're
not as compressed as we would have been
otherwise so feel free to use this time
and will feel more questions so yeah any
other questions on to Chris Phoenix here
so what percentage of cancers depend on
being death resistant and so if you cure
death resistance how much does that
solve the cancer problem
unfortunately not very much at all
cancers essentially aren't death
resistance at all cancers have a vast
amount of cell death all the time simply
because death resistance requires the
required particular pathways to be
working as well as particular pathways
not to be working but would be allow
them to be death sensitive and so
mutations are happening all the time
that just make a cell not work at all
and it may not die cleanly by apoptosis
the nice neat cell suicide mechanism it
may die just by running out of Stephen
and killing over in a rather dirty way
but all still die and the only reason
cancers are a problem is because cell
division is so much more potent than the
cell death so now it's really a very
separate problem so you mentioned Rick
I'll see you mention replacing stem
cells which is possible in some systems
more difficult others how about some
near-term applications like inhibit si
RNA or even till I'm race vaccines which
are closer to term clinically to
approach these sorts of issues in the
shorter term yeah I'm all for they they
extensive pursuit of therapies that are
easier to do than wilts and no one would
be happier than me if it turned out that
we could come up with a therapy that was
as effective as wilt could be but with
much easier to implement and much less
scary but at the moment I don't think
it's going to happen if we look at
specifically at ways of combating
telomerase expression then ultimately
they have the same problems as ways of
combating any other aspect of of cell
growth number one is that some cells
need their telomerase so you're going to
you've got a therapeutic index problem
if you did express too much inhibition
then it effective stem cells to number
two is that any small molecule that you
throw in any chemotherapeutic agent that
happens to specifically target to loma
raise can become batted in the same way
that other chemotherapeutic agents are
combating whether it be by breaking it
down or by excluding it or by
upregulating telomerase expression in
the first place to compensate you know
all the usual
things happen so I I'm really I'm really
pleased that work is going on in all of
these avenues and I very much support it
but I don't think we should better our
lives on it no questions chris is gone
so it sounds like cancer cells kind of
universally need Tom erase till I'm
right oh yes I need telomere maintenance
Mac and so I've been hearing about
antitumor therapies that for example
look for is it niacin receptors on the
cells and I'm wondering about the
possibility of detecting cancer cells
and piling into them with chemotherapy
drugs based on simply the fact that they
produce telomerase yep so Chris is an
extremely useful question which is can
we not simply identify cells expressing
really high levels of telomerase and use
that as a way of getting rid of them
rather than by reducing their ability to
express the llama race simply by killing
them as a result of the fact that they
express them and that's certainly
already being tried indeed it looks as
though the body probably tries itself to
do this because the immune system is an
extremely important component of our
built-in built anti-cancer therapies
that would be possible in principle and
if we could do it really well it might
even work because of course the reason
why to embrace vaccines for example
Ortolan with inhibitors might work is
that cancer cells are dividing so much
faster than stem cells that you know you
could get away with a longer treatments
and speak however the problem is that if
something is controlled by if it's in
expressing the right protein subject to
the presence of such a drug or whatever
the problem is that it could be Tate so
that it no longer is dependent on the
drug to express the protein and that's
exactly what you would expect to happen
unfortunately rather quickly you know
because the drug resistance sorry the
drug dependence sequence would be a
sequence that could simply just be
deleted or could be eliminated by a
translocation that put the telomerase
coding region under a different promoter
and these are all sorts of things that
happen all the time in cancers actually
the question is more along the lines of
suppose you insisted suppose your
alternate telomerase used a different
component to extend the DNA itself so so
there it's not a matter of regulating
the
expression of telomerase it's that you
have a telomerase that's using it
something something other than
conventional Isis tan extender I think
the same applies except that you have
the additional problem that the whole
telomere maintenance system driven by
Salaam arrays is actually a much more
complicated system that doesn't just
involve these two these two genes it
also involves a whole bunch of other
telomere associated proteins so for
example if you made that maybe if you
hadn't alternative version of telomerase
that put on a different sequence then
that would you know cause a load of
other problems for the chromosomes and
for cell division and so on let alone if
you've tried to put something other than
DNA on so yeah but over and above those
two things still the same thing applies
that the drug dependency of the
expression of the tilma maintenance
mechanism would still be something that
could mutate into no longer being
dependent and therefore you wouldn't
have your solution anymore you discussed
various biological approaches to
addressing the the telomerase issue and
cancer in general but I'm curious sell a
lot of these therapies may not be
available for decade or two maybe
several decades and I noticed that a lot
of progress has been made on the and the
BioMEMS front in terms of mechanical or
micromechanical ways to address some of
these issues particularly for example
there's artificial blood
blood replacements respira sites there's
a insulin generating micro machines that
you can insert and they've they've shown
quite a bit of promise i'm curious at
what what is your perspective on our
ability to address cancer and other
age-related issues with mechanical means
in the next couple decades i think we I
think the role of non biological
approaches to addressing biomedical
problems whether they be problems
associated with aging or any other
problems that the role of such things
will undoubtedly inexorably increase
over over time where I really have no
real feel is how fast it will go or
indeed whether it will be fast enough to
to outpace the more if you like
traditional biomedical but by
technological approaches therefore what
I think is it's a done good thing that
all of these approaches are being tried
because the more potent we try they'd
sooner one or other of them will
actually work if I understand right your
proposal requires that the stem cells
that have the telomerase gene have to be
killed by chemotherapy if you have a
tumor already started when you start
this therapy even if it's way too small
to see then that tumor could still kill
you so you have to apply this
proactively is that correct more or less
and if that about your question or is
that the preliminary to your question
well that that's the first half that it
has to be applied proactively the second
half is if I understand correctly this
would cause sterility and man is that
correct maybe okay I'll answer to a lot
about those questions let's do the
sterility one first well um it would
certainly cause problems with Norma's
the normal process of spermatogenesis in
the end but spermatogenesis of course
starts from spermatogonial stem cells
just the same as how much why AC starts
from blood stem cells and so on so again
it will be perfectly possible to
use spermatogonial stem cells that have
nice long telomeres even if they don't
have salami roast genes that wouldn't
work however because after fertilization
right the egg the fertilized egg has got
do an awful lot of cell division and it
went nearly do enough to get to you know
right through gestation with with with
no telomerase so in practice this is
something that would have to be done
somatically in other words we in order
for for men to have viable progeny that
would have to be done by introducing
that's temporarily so that did actually
have the telomerase gene again so the
whole thing could work or of course we
could just give up the natural
reproduction approaching just do it all
by cloning but you get the idea so back
to the question of whether it had to be
proactive it would certainly be better
if it was proactive and in the fullness
of time when these therapies if they get
developed properly and they become safe
I think that will certainly be the way
that it's done but in the short term
especially when the therapies are very
experimental I think the trade-off will
be such that it will be better to apply
them only to people who already have a
short-term problem namely they already
have cancer and the reason that could be
done is give me yeah so um it turns out
that you can engineer stem cells so that
they are unusually resistant to
particular types of chemotherapeutic
agent not sort of thing that you would
expect to be useful but it turns out it
really is useful I'm just going to show
you an example from this guy less
stubborn who's actually died a couple of
years ago but his work is still
continuing in England the enzyme well
not really an enzyme because it's not a
catalyst but it's a protein that repairs
a particular type of DNA damage called
alkylation alkylation of guanine and
it's possible to essentially saturate
the activity of this protein by giving
it a chemical that can basically that
the protein recognizes as the damage
base of the DNA and you put this
chemical in large amounts and it just
you know eats up all their stuff and
look and the cell can't make enough of
the protein to keep up
so that means a lot of this damage in
the real deal and it does happen so much
that the cancer cell dies okay and so
that's why it's a good good a good trick
unfortunately it's relatively important
but this not be happening to normal
cells and so the trick here is it turns
out that there are mutations in this
protein that mean that it still
recognizes normal DNA that been
alkylated just work before but no longer
recognizes this substrate this pseudo
substrate this chemical that you were
putting in to trick the enzyme so you
can make the stem cells with this
mutation and the stuff the sealer
substrate Oh six pencil guanine no
longer depletes the protein so the
protein can still carry on doing what
it's supposed to do to the DNA if your
stem cells have this mutation in their
in their version of this gene then they
can survive a much higher level of the
pseudo substrate van cancer would or van
a normal stem cell would so what you
would do if you first of all you to
introduce these stem cells which had
this mutation then you put in a boatload
of the sealer of the class amendatory of
the chemotherapeutic agent a it kills
the cancer at a more better than you
could survive with if you'd hadn't had
this stem cells that been engineered and
beep it nicely curls the stem cells that
have telomere eight the natural stem
cells that have telomerase so as to a
double whammy benefit from wilkes point
of view it gets rid of the stem cells
that you don't want it also gets rid of
the can see that one so sort of Roundup
Ready stem cells more or less but yeah
so this is a brilliant idea it's been
around for a little while of course
there are it turns out as with all
biology there are problems with it it's
not really quite ready for prime time
but it's nearly there and I definitely
want to this is definitely on my on my
hit list on my high on my list of things
that the mithila foundation needs to
fund a silly they possibly can any more
questions okay speaking of Methuselah
foundation and funding here's your
opportunity to pitch it fair enough so
yeah I mean I guess I pitched it at some
length in my talk a month ago which of
course is online already so I won't go
into too much detail now but essentially
the Methuselah foundation is focused on
voting and also sponsoring research to
make not only wills but also the other
aspects of the strategies for engineered
negligible senescence a reality a lot of
the work that needs to be done is
already being done especially in the
stem cell arena but a lot of it isn't
because it's generally considered to be
a bit too ambitious to be attractive for
normal funding from the government or
from industry so we're keen to support
this stuff ourselves and we are building
up as much of a donor base as we can of
course we're spending money as quickly
as we get it because the scientists who
really want to do all this work in these
various areas are definitely ready to go
they're ready to roll they just need the
funding that it takes to make these
things happen I have a list of well over
a dozen project that we really need to
fund and I know who to fund and so on
eventually when we get to a sufficiently
advanced and sighs we will become a more
traditional funding agency which
actually solicits grant applications
we're hoping to be able to do that
within a year or two but certainly the
faster we grow the feel of this work
will start being done and the sooner we
start the sooner we'll finish so I
obviously would very much welcome any
donations to the foundation which are
easy to make my website is very easy to
find em prob mithila foundation.org and
you can soften that thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
