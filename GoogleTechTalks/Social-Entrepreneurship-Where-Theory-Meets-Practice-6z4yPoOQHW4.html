pleased to welcome kavita Brom das and
the members of the stamp of the social
entrepreneurs in residence at Stanford
program the Sears program which is a
brand new program that Kavita started at
Stanford I've known Kavita for many
years mostly in her capacity former
capacity as the CEO of the Global Fund
for women I've been a supporter of that
wonderful organization for years and
kavita has moved on to this really
exciting new position at Stanford and
I'm going to let her introduce the Sears
and tell you all about the program and
then Kavita will be the moderator for a
group discussion thanks go ahead baby hi
everyone this is really cool to like be
doing you know presentation and knowing
that various other people are going to
be in different places we hope and if
not thank you for those of you who've
come it's really nice to see you Thank
You Shannon and Radhika for inviting us
to be here at Google and we really look
forward to being able to build stronger
ties between the ripples two waves
program on social entrepreneurship at
Stanford and Google I am really pleased
to be here with my three colleagues who
are the first group of visiting social
entrepreneurs at Stanford in this
program from my left Ramsey Jabbar from
Palestine tide ahorro savage from Bosnia
and Steve Williams from San Francisco
the program just got its was launched
this April and it essentially is a
program that tries to connect theory
with practice universities are places
where you study lots of phenomenal
things including latest buzz words like
social entrepreneurship but they are
rarely places where those who actually
do get to teach and the program of
social entrepreneurship is really a
program to bring activists and
practitioners from the ground into the
campus to have them be there for a whole
quarter and to be part of actually
teaching and leading a class so the
class that we are all a part of which is
a new class at Stanford is called
challenging the state
disco social entrepreneurs advancing
democracy development and justice and
it's been really a wonderful experiment
and I am really pleased to have the
three who are with us Ramsey Steve and
Tyler were selected from a wonderful
group of applicants and we're hopefully
going to try and share their stories
with you get a little bit of a sense of
what it is that motivates someone to be
a disrupter for social change I wanted
to begin as I think for many of us
social change begins from a place of
talking about our personal stories as
Sharon mentioned I spent 14 years at the
Global Fund for women and certainly my
own motivation for being as Gandhi said
the change I want to see in the world
came very young I started being
righteously angry I think at four or
five when people would keep looking at
the three of us we were three sisters we
are three sisters and saying oh what a
pity to my parents you only have three
daughters I decided that there were
seemed to be somehow a less than sign
hanging in front of my forehead that I
had somehow mistaken and it wasn't my
bindi either and I really wanted to do
something about that and although I
didn't know quite what i wanted to do
about that as a young woman growing up
in India I think almost everything I did
in the rest of my life was informed from
that space of challenging that status
quo and that reality in the same way
what I wanted to share with all of you
today and the audiences who will be
listening to this is a little bit of a
sense of the personal stories of each of
the spheres who's here you can see that
we're doing a little bit of a pun on the
word to be a seer is also to look into
the future is to have a vision of what
that future looks like so yes they are
social entrepreneurs and residents at
Stanford but also there are people who
have a real vision for what they want to
see for a fairer and want
first world so I'm going to begin with a
little bit of that request to say what
started you off on this journey of
trying to make a difference in the world
and if I can Steve I would really like
to begin with you and just get a sense
of why it is you do what you do um it's
a little weird to be talking on a
microphone to a smaller group but um you
know I think for me this question and I
think for all of us raises sort of the
issue that for in doing this work
there's sort of all of these different
influences in our lives that sort of
bring us to this work and I think
probably true for all of us but for me
the thing that sparked sort of the
initial desire to achieve full humanity
for people was when I was six when I was
six my family lived in Kalamazoo
Michigan and which is a predominantly
white community and my best friend was
this kid Jay who lived right next door
white kid he was six years older than me
and so Jay it actually had his bike way
longer than I had so for a long time I
would like run behind him as he was
riding his bicycle it was too big for me
so you know whatever but when I was six
I got my first bike with no training
wheels it was a huffy and you know
finally we were going to be able to go
off jumps together and sort of you know
do skid outs in the garage so I was very
excited um and on this particular day we
were setting up the the jump that we
were going to go over and another kid
from the neighborhood Robbie came over
Robbie was a little bit younger he
hadn't gotten his bike yet so he asked
to borrow it and so I said you know it's
fine but you know I want to be able to
go to the jump so I want it back
eventually was like okay it's fine so he
started riding around and eventually I
decided that his time was up it was now
my turn
and so I called out to him Robbie yeah I
want my bike back and Robbie said screw
off nigger and I don't know if you've
ever cut your finger like with a really
sharp knife there's that moment where it
hurts but it hasn't started bleeding yet
and like you can't quite place the pain
and I think for me that particular
moment like I didn't know what the word
nigger meant but there was a silence
between Jay and I that I knew meant that
something really grave had happened so I
didn't really know how to deal with it
so I picked up a rock and threw it at
Robbie it just so happened to hit him in
the back of the head and so Robbie
through the bike down went running off
to his house I ran out to the street
picked up the bike and Jay and I sort of
parted ways with without talking I put
the bike in the garage and I think I
went into the house crying not really
knowing what had happened and a few
moments later I heard a knock on the
door then my dad called me to the door
and Robbie and his dad were standing
there um and you know my dad asked me
whether I had thrown a rock at Robbie he
had a big welt on the back of his neck
so it seemed ludicrous to deny that I
had done it so I said that yes I had
done it but I explained why it is that i
thrown the rock and so my dad asked
Robbie whether that was true and why be
denied it so I immediately jumped into
sort of like pre legal mode of like you
know setting up my case and saying we
could go talk to Jay it's true I
wouldn't have thrown the rock otherwise
that it and so my dad then turned to
Robbie's dad and said well I'm going to
assume that that did in fact happen and
i'm going to assume that you're going to
talk to your son about why that was
inappropriate behavior and for now i'll
appreciate it if you
get off of our porch so my dad close the
door and he's a little bit of a
disciplinarian my dad so I was sure I
was getting in trouble I was going to be
in trouble for a long time and so he SAT
me down and he asked me whether or not I
knew what the word meant I told them
that I didn't he explained it to me but
then said that I shouldn't have thrown
the rock but he appreciated that I had
defended myself and I think that
particular moment and sort of how it is
that my dad decided to react to it was
really sort of what started me in
believing that oftentimes people's
humanity winds up being undermined and
not respected and it's easy to stand on
the sidelines and critique how it is
that people stand up for and defend
their own humanity but the important
thing is that we do that and so my dad I
think really sort of set in motion the
process for me of trying to build up the
capacity of folks who've been
marginalized exploited and oppressed to
be able to assert our humanity to then
be able to live in a better way thanks
Steve I I know that we've been talking a
lot in this program about you know being
able to connect our personal experience
with our commitment to doing our work in
the world and I think that it's
profoundly important to actually
understand that particularly in the
context of trying to move social change
forward it's hard to it's hard to turn
to you Ramsey given what day it is today
we were talking before this meeting and
romsey just reminded us that this is a
very special day in his family Ramsey's
Palestinian and I really want you to
share the story you shared with us this
morning about what
what it is that I'll give you this if
you know what it is that motivated you
to become somebody who was really an
activist for human rights and for social
change in Palestine and if you could
share that with us as deep as that would
be wonderful this very day on May
fifteenth 64 years ago my grandmother
was living in Jerusalem she was 14 that
day she lived in autumn own which was a
at the time of fancy part of Jerusalem
and that day she was forcibly expelled
her an entire family she was lucky she
end up in Jordan or Lebanon or Egypt she
actually went to Ramallah she was along
with eighty percent of the inhabitants
of Palestinians were who were expelled
that day actually one person sits in the
audience is actually his family as well
went to a refugee camp in next to Hebron
that day marks is a seminal point of all
Palestinians I didn't know this for a
long time growing up because uh my
parents wanted to just you know didn't
want to bring this across to me I don't
understand why my father when he was in
his master is here was doing his
master's in the u.s. actually sent me my
mom when she was pregnant with me to
Jerusalem to be born there and then go
back into her back so now i have no no
papers thanks to that but that was a
defining moment that we don't i live 15
minutes away from Jerusalem and Ramallah
it's been 12 years I haven't entered
because people from different color
ideas Palestinians are issued two
different color ideas blue green and
orange and depending on the color ID
they can go ahead and it's who you're
going to
you're born depends on one of the things
right now is that I went back to I i
lived in the diaspora and I went back to
Palestine when Ramallah 22 was was to
bring Ted I to to Palestine I organized
a TEDx conference there one of the
defining moments that made me just
realize the urgency of this and I
realize going from community community
and finding and I think this is true
wherever you find the girl in the world
whereas this great adversity you find
amazing inspiring people wherever this
in the world and I found inspiring
people from different parts of the
communities and that just inspired me to
stay for longer it took me what started
off as a small project took me over a
year and a half three years to to
organize and one of the defining moments
there was I was seeing somebody she was
great woman she's very driven very great
and it didn't work out and when the
reasons don't work out was because I had
a green ID green and she had a blue one
and in 2002 there's a marriage law that
that person's from different color ideas
can't live together and that was and
actually I had no idea that until that
moment how discriminatory this ID system
was and and then from then we started to
realize that if I didn't know this I was
born here and I didn't notice how come
most people don't and started a project
called visualizing Palestine where
create visual stories for social justice
it's based on info graphics information
design digital technology to to to
change that Thank You Ramsay
one of the challenges that we've had in
terms of bringing these different
stories into the spaces both at
University and at other places is how
distant these places seem from our own
experience and when romsey share this
today one of the things we realized is
that his grandmother was 14 years old
when she became a refugee and we were
sitting next to someone tidur who became
a refugee from her homeland in Bosnia
when she was 14 years old as well and I
wonder tighter if you'd be willing to
share a little bit about what made you
someone who became passionate about
making change in Bosnia sure well it's
an early memory of war for me and it
it's an experience that made the war
very real to me so when I was 13 the war
broke out in my homeland it's
ex-yugoslavia and today it's bosnia
herzegovina and many of you I'm sure
heard it's the bloodiest conflict in
Europe after World War Two and I was 13
so we I'm from Banja Luka which is the
northwestern city second biggest city in
the country and when the war started
there was a siege of Satya which is the
capital and the siege inside ever was
including the bombing
massacres and people being killed in
bread lines and we could all watch it on
TV everybody in the world watched it on
TV but in my hometown there was a
different kind of siege and ethnic
cleansing that was not something you
could watch on TV it was quiet it was
silence and people were disappearing in
the night people were trying to get out
of this whole area with humanitarian
convoys and there was also 10 p.m.
curfew that none of us kids really care
too much about and we would still hang
out in front of our building and my mom
would have to call to me from the
balcony to you know come back inside
which you know she would call to me for
a long time and I was not always
responsive when I think about it today
you know I'm sure she was terrified to
have to call out my name because my name
is actually Muslim and even though I'm
not religious people were exiled from
this region because they're Muslim
because they're non Serb actually so
they were also Roman Catholics and there
was a Bosnian Serb army that was sort of
leading the war basically in the
genocide in our country so two of my
best friends were at that time living on
the 6th floor and I was living on the
seventh floor and they were Tata and
Jonna still are to my knowledge and I
remember we had said we had some kind of
a dispute some kind of quarrel about
something I have no idea what it was and
I remember she turned to me she said
what do you know you don't know anything
I'm going to tell my dad to kill all
those people in my nature and monitor is
a mountain close to the hometown where
we would go sledding and skiing in the
winter and we learned that the people
that were disappearing in the night were
put in this concentration camp up on
that mountain and I just remember my
head being in my mind going completely
like it was on fire like I had no idea
you know what to do in that situation I
just wanted to get out of that situation
and I wanted to kind of sound strong and
smart and I said something like
you don't have that power and I just try
to go home and and and and get get out
of the situation and I remember talking
to my mom and dad and you know saying oh
my gosh and I was terrified that these
people are actually going to be killed
because of me because she got mad and
her dad was in the Army and had a gun
and it just made me realize that the
ward that i was watching on TV is
actually right there at my doorstep and
i feel like that event kind of ended my
childhood at that age and I just feel
like I had to grow up so quickly and I
started being much more careful just
about the decisions I was making being a
teenager or adolescent at that time so
what it made me realize is that you know
today twenty years later because it's 20
years since the war started this year is
that you know war scars you forever but
if you are lucky to survive to live
through it then you can be a survivor
and you can actually learn from that
experience and choose not to be a victim
which i think is very important because
it made me realize that every day we
wake up and we make a decision to live a
violence-free life so it's an ongoing
daily decision or sometimes a challenge
even but every day we wake up and we
choose to live a violence-free life and
and it's something that's really really
important and so in my work I create
spaces where we can have a dialogue and
act to ensure that we choose a
violence-free life so that's I think
very very empowering decision that we
get to make every day Thank You data
from Z I want to come back to something
you said because you talked about the
fact that this personal experience of
the sense of being in exile and then
this pain of not being able to be with
the person you loved was sort of a point
in which it also influenced what you
cided to do you had be in your a
structural engineer you should be
sitting in the audience with these guys
right this is this is your this is your
space more prison break but maybe you
could tell us a little bit about what it
is you did choose what it is you choose
to do and what you're doing now and how
that led you you know if you can share
that a little bit and you know how that
may have led you to being a part of this
program on social entrepreneurship so
what I as I was living in the West Bank
in the territories I realized that one
of the major there's a lot amazing
people working on the ground anybody who
wants to do anything else you know
coding they be here but people who are
on the ground were actually working to
impact the lives of their community for
the better and at the time that was
until now is it's it's it's the
occupation one of the things that that
really was very necessary and if we
actually saw this yesterday was for
people to care and right now for example
yesterday over a thousand five hundred
Palestinian prisoners would just ended
their hunger strike some of them have
been not eating food for 77 days the
last time that's happened well not the
last time one of the times it happens in
1989 South Africa eight hundred
prisoners were on hunger strike
Guantanamo really two hundred prisoners
what ultimately led to the to the end of
this hunger strike and for the
concessions was the world to care there
isn't there there are hundreds and maybe
upon thousands of people who are held
without charge or trial so one of the
things is that what we're trying to what
I'm trying to do is use digital
technology and in visual information to
allow people to know and to care and and
and to live in a world where we're all
equal or where we have we're not
discriminated by
a city or religion or color Ramsey
visualizing Palestine has a website it
just launched I know you have worried
about not being able to share some of
those images because i think you know
when you are using visual technology and
graphics to tell a story and then you're
actually hampered by the old-fashioned
use of words and actually talking to
people would you want to share that with
the with our audience at Google and also
tell a little bit about you know why did
you decide that it was a good moment to
come to Stanford and spend some time in
a program where you'd be able to maybe
share what you've been doing so the
first visual recreated was what's the
physiological effects of total volunteer
fast so what do people go through when
they are on hunger strike and it's a
very moving image because how how much
injustice must occur for went to do that
so the the the reason that I accept the
coming here even though I'm in the
middle of a huge endeavor was that was
that Stanford and Silicon Valley is in
the heart of digital technology visual
information visual design and that there
are a lot of people here that are
storytellers I think on the best
storytellers in the world currently is
here and and I'm receiving a lot of you
know for example working with faculty
there some of them a really receptive
such the d.school one maybe do something
around social impact using this kind of
technique so that that's one of the main
reasons that the Kommandant and it's
been very very enriching find more
information for issues arising palestine
dot org that's the web so we just
launched it and we'll start releasing
them periodically tyda you are at a
different moment you talked about what
made you a passionate advocate for peace
and the organization that you founded in
Bosnia was one that was particularly our
raised by the lack of violence free life
not just for all Bosnians but in
particular for women and I know the
Global Fund for women was a proud seed
investor in the work of Sue ray would
you share a little bit about what the
organization you led does and did in
Bosnia and you know what you were hoping
to get from this program at Stanford
sure yeah so cure foundation a cure it's
spelled cure it's bilingual in Bosnia
and it means girls or young women and in
English it means feminism's can cure our
communities and we started that in 2004
with the idea to use media and take back
public spaces to transform gender
stereotypes to display and talk about
the realities of women that are existent
and not very well represented through
arts or media for that matter and so we
work through education culture and arts
we started the festival called pitch
wise it means havoc or creative chaos in
our minds in Bosnian and an English it
could mean pitch wisely I guess choose
to do things that have a positive social
change or have a good impact as opposed
to a destructive one in the world and
it's still the only festival of women
arts in our country running for seven
years so I'm very very happy about that
and the organization has done a lot to
revive the women's movement that existed
before the war and the movement is not
just an immense amount of nonprofit
organizations that are registered a
movement is a people different diverse
people who are from all walks of life
who are journalists and architects and
educators and mothers and and so on so
our idea is to bring everybody together
to work on this very urgent
which is number one health issue in our
country and its violence against women
women are not only the majority
population in my country their majority
population in the world just like we
live on a planet that is predominantly
made of water so you know just think
about how we cannot live without water
so we you know should think about how
women make up more than half the
population in the world and how that is
a huge potential that is still not being
on an equal level meaning having access
to education having access to economic
development and so on so I did I'm very
proud that we have a new generation of
young women running sue day or cure and
I was doing a lot of ad hoc activism
which is sometimes very draining and you
don't really get to reflect on the
process and what's happening to you
personally because there's so many
pressing issues and situations to
respond to and my plan was to only do it
for a little bit and i ended up staying
for 7 for 10 years but for seven years i
worked at twitter which is great i would
not change a thing and I needed to
reassess what's going on with my own
life and what I want to do next so I am
I formally stepped out end of last year
and thankfully we have fabulous women
you know leading the way so this
opportunity at Stanford it was really
sort of at this ideal time for me to be
able to reflect on some of the work and
to see where I can be effective next so
very appreciative of a very dynamic
environment at Stanford with the
students and I found that a lot of
people are still raising eyebrows to the
term feminism and why do we need
feminism and you know we're so over
feminism and can't we just use another
word like equal ism and so then we get
into a conversation about how it's not
just the one feminism there
feminism's and what are they all and
what do they represent and not so long
ago women were not able to vote or you
know there's still places where they
can't drive or vote or have access to
property ownership and so on so I think
it's for me it was very interesting to
talk to students at Stanford about some
of these issues and gender equality as a
great potential to transform our society
and bring equality for everyone and it's
something that I'm really still very
passionate about thanks data Steve you
share something with tighter and that
you do this last year stepped down from
having led an organization that you were
a founder of and you have something else
which is the strange which is that you
actually left Stanford as a
undergraduate and went to San Francisco
to get involved with social change work
with very low income people if you
wouldn't mind sharing a little bit with
us about what the work of power was and
where it is you know again like tide of
what it was that inspired you to come be
a part of ripples two waves yes so for
the last 15 years I've had the good
fortune of working at this
community-based organization in San
Francisco the home of the 2010 World
Series champion San Francisco Giants and
I think similar to what tie the and
Ramsey mentioned like I sort of went
into the work thinking that it was going
to be a short term gig like I was going
to be there for a couple years and then
I was going to go to law school and 20
years later my mom still asking me when
I'm going to get a real job but I think
similar to what romsey mentioned like in
situations of incredible adversity like
you find these amazing people and when i
was in school i remember reading a lot
about social problems and one of the
threads that I think connected all of
the theories and articles and books that
I read was this notion that in some ways
poor people
were responsible for their poverty that
there was something deficient in their
ability to be able to navigate the world
that then ultimately resulted in their
inability to be able to make ends meet
and my experience in San Francisco
couldn't have been more opposite than
that like I met the most courageous
brave intelligent people that I've ever
met and I think through the process of
being at power which started in nineteen
nineteen ninety-seven with a commitment
to eradicate any and oppression once and
for all so it's a small ambitious
organization and I think for us we saw
that there were particular changes that
were happening in the economy that were
not just impacting women people of color
folks who'd been marginalized for
generations but there were changes
happening in the economy that were
ultimately going to wind up impacting
millions of people and then the question
of well what does economic justice look
like how is it that we're able to
reorganize the economy such that it
meets the basic needs of everybody
becomes the central question not just
for a small percentage of the population
but for the 99 percent or for the
hundred percent and so for me you know
the the work that power is done most
recently has been fighting for free
transportation for all young people I
know that Google actually provides
transportation for its employees to be
able to get to work because it's an
important thing to come to work it's
also relatively important to come to
school but the San Francisco school
district because of budget cuts has been
forced to eliminate yellow school bus
service so kids are then responsible for
getting to and from school on their own
in the last three years the cost of
riding muni in San Francisco has more
than doubled
and at the same time San Francisco has
put police officers on the buses to
write tickets to kids and adults who
haven't paid their fair and so you know
it's a particular problem for everybody
it's an especially pointed problem as
for undocumented immigrants and so the
members of power ultimately took up a
campaign to win free public
transportation for all low-income or for
all young people in San Francisco and we
well they won just two weeks ago after I
had stepped down so the organization is
continuing I think some of the most
important work in the city but the
decision ultimately is going to be made
by the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission so there's opportunities for
folks to lobby the members of the MTC
and you can google that to find out all
of their contact information but for me
I guess the the reason I decided to
leave power was because it the
organization has this mission of
eradicating poverty and it's clear that
we're doing some very important work and
developing leaders who I think will
ultimately guide a social movement to
create economic justice but we're in a
situation where we need more than what
it is that we've been doing for the last
few years where six million people
across the country have had their homes
foreclosed upon more than 11 million
people are underwater with their housing
i mean i think the advent of the Occupy
movement really touches on sort of real
frustration with the way that things are
moving and I think in my mind there has
been a lack of rigor in trying to
understand social problems in order to
then try to figure out solutions and to
me the exciting thing of being able to
go back to Stanford like having gone to
this working-class high school where I
sort of like Ferris Bueller my way
through like going to Stanford and
getting my butt kicked for the first
quarter and learning what it meant to
really study I think I brought a lot of
that rigor into my work to win economic
justice but I think that there are some
massive questions that are facing all of
us and so I wanted to take some time to
then be able to reflect on that and to
me having the opportunity to sort of go
full circle and grapple with these
questions with professors with students
was this incredibly unique opportunity
that I was excited to take advantage of
thank you I've mindful of the fact that
I want to have at least with our small
group of people who are still here time
for some questions as well so I'm just
going to ask each of you to sort of you
you all have sort of a vision coming
back to the notion of being seers of you
know what it is you want to see and you
know where it is you kind of want to
take sort of your next step so I was
wondering if maybe we could finish with
you know whoever wants to go on that you
know on that topic just you know a
sentence about sort of what your what
your vision is and then what you really
need to be able to kind of make that
drill and Ramsey I think you began to
touch on it by saying you know a little
bit about the kinds of skills that
visualizing Palestine is going to
require but a few if I could ask each of
you to do that and then we'll throw it
open for questions so I've come to the
realization that the only there's
immense amount of injustice and the only
thing that will actually help solve it
is collective committee action that's
that's it and how some so its
communities coming together like what
happened in here and and off all
ethnicities and all religions coming
together for universal values so what
I'm looking for is how do we help do
that how do we help how to eat howdy
harness the powers of digital technology
of visual storytelling information is
that all these different disciplines for
that and
to come together and believe in a just
world so one of the things that I'd love
to help is is is we are looking for
designers and and information architects
and things if those are people who I
know the valley is definite something
extremely difficult to do it yeah but
but yeah so I'm not even looking this
inner thanks Jonesy I'd have to like
circle back to you and have you finished
that port but I think for me the vision
is certainly I've learned a lot about
how being an activist and working this
to respond to these ad hoc situations
can be it's not sustainable it's not a
really sustainable way to live so to me
I think it's very important to look at
where I'm going to be able to be
effective next to look at a model of
work that is like similar to the Global
Fund for women but for the Balkans so
I'd be very interested to look at
different funds that give for women
human rights that are flexible and not
necessarily where you have to be a
nonprofit organization that is
registered and you know sometimes you
have a good idea and you shouldn't have
to wait three years to prove yourself
and be credible you know to to receive
support to do something or if you are an
artist and you want to do an exhibition
in three months you should get support
to do that so I know how much that meant
to our organization starting different
artistic events and
giving free services for youth to talk
about gender relations and to talk about
identity and to talk about social
justice that is not in the textbooks
that is not included in the classroom so
I would be very interested in that and I
think also for specifically for women
Economic Security or having an
opportunity to have a job and to be paid
for that job is is a platform that
really allows for a person to make
decisions about their own life so I
would for sure be very interested to
look at ways to contribute to job
creation for youth in bosnia-herzegovina
and for women specifically but also in
the Balkans and and globally I have to
say you know my home country is Bosnian
I love it and I'm very passionate about
issues that I feel are burning issues
but I recognized about you know
obviously these are globally global
issues that were facing every day nida
activists in New York are pushing to
create an ordinance a living wage
ordinance that would essentially ensure
that any private firm that has a
contract with the city is then required
to pay a living wage to its employees
the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg
said that it was socialism and it seems
to me that we are at two important of a
juncture in human history to be able to
not rigorously and with a real
seriousness address the problems of the
economy between the economic problems
and the ecological problems to dismiss
sort of ideas of of working people
actually being paid a living wage as
socialism which I'm assuming Michael
Bloomberg means is a bad thing means
that we're not stepping up to the task
that's in front of us and I think that
both with the Occupy movement but then
also there are organizations like power
all across the country and I want to try
to facilitate building a movement where
those organizations are able to connect
with one another to lead in a serious
conversation about what does it mean to
reorganize the economy such that it
meets the needs of people and the planet
and the difficulty is that a lot of
those organizations are under-resourced
and disconnected and so in my mind one
of the things that I'm really hopeful
about is with the advent of Technology
and particularly things that are being
developed at Google that that can serve
a purpose of connecting organizations to
then be able to share stories share
strategies and really begin to develop a
vision of an economy from the bottom up
and so if there are people who are
interested and have ideas about those
level of technological innovation it'd
be great to have conversation about them
that was great I just want to add when
he was going there was an employee from
google and a plea from Twitter teamed up
and because square in the uprising and
18 days where millions of people pouring
into square the government was beginning
you know set panic they shut down
internet people couldn't communicate
anymore people couldn't come together
anymore so one person from google one
employee from Twitter came together and
said okay there's a problem how do we
fix this and they fixed it by or one way
to attempt to fix it is that they given
ability for people in Egypt in Cairo to
call a number and it would automatically
tweet there are the analysis and I was
with it without even the management of
Twitter and Google without them knowing
haha and but this is just the pure
innovation pure you know when people are
coming together just knowing that
there's something coming in and using
technology using the design to do
something that I think there's a huge
potential for for tech companies design
firms all
to harness it for so I'm going to open
it up to any of you I want to thank each
of the three of you and I want to say
that my vision for ripples two waves on
the program at Stanford is that we can
continue to have these kinds of voices I
think you can have a sense of how
different it is to have these kinds of
voices inside a classroom where people
are used to hearing sort of a very you
know so we've had this really
interesting momentum of like academics
coming in and talking about democracy
and then rumsey saying yeah well we
tried democracy and what it got us was
you know this or tidur saying yeah well
there's democracy allegedly after the
Dayton Accords in Bosnia and women still
get treated like this or see if being
able to say and by the way this is not
just some stuff that happens in those
developing countries out there but this
is actually real and alive and it's
right here in our backyard it's in East
Palo Alto it's in Oakland it's in san
francisco and i think you know my hope
for the program is that we get it to a
place where it's really you know when I
first old drums you about this idea he
said oh but doesn't a program like that
already exist in every University that
you would bring activists to campus and
they would be part of the teaching and I
was like ah no actually it doesn't this
is the first pilot that we're doing but
I my vision is really that we will be in
a world five years from now 10 years
from now where whether it's through
technology or whether it's the physical
presence that you know we will have a
world in which the knowledge and
experience of activists on the ground
social entrepreneurs are making a
difference will actually be available to
those of us who are learning about
making a difference early as early as
possible and as often as possible so
thank you very much and we're open to
questions so
does anybody have any comments or
remarks so anything you want to know
more about something that you so if you
want to ask a question also we should
get it use the mic I don't know can we
take questions from remote sites I don't
know if we can take questions from the
remote sites if they if they can talk to
us again okay I heard I hear that they
can so if you're at a remote site you
want to ask a question just speak up so
I was asking cuz out earlier and say the
same thing I feel like there's a lot of
people want to get involved and they
agree to the idea of it but you kind of
want to learn more about doing it
without disrupting you know everything
you're doing currently and so just going
off that I think there's tremendous
opportunity for Googlers are pretty much
anyone to learn through a program like
this and what it does and CEO maybe take
the ideas back in some form to you know
later on in your life or late to your
home countries like India for me and so
going off that I was just wondering if
there's ways to get involved with a
serious program and do it more if as a
part-time opportunity that's a great
question so one thing is to check out
our website which is HTTP not PSC dot
stanford.edu it's easy to remember but
program on social entrepreneurship pse
at stanford.edu and the the
opportunities i think to be engaged are
both to be engaged with particular
projects that come up through the seers
who have it who are visiting and so you
know you might say well what I'd really
like to do is I'm a graphic designer and
I'd really like to be able to be
connected to what Ramsay is doing we
will have profiles of each of the we
actually already have profiles of each
of the visiting social entrepreneurs on
our website and then hopefully
eventually we will have a place where
people can actually say
you know this is how you can contact
this person if that's something you want
to do we also are a very lean
organization right now with just one
staff person myself and a part-time
administrative assistant so any kind of
volunteer support in terms of logistics
in terms of being able to get in front
of I think the three things we need most
is to spread the word about the
organization we need to be able to make
connections to like-minded organizations
either fantastic people who you think
could really use a quarter on stanford's
campus and whose stories should be told
and who need to be more visible in terms
of their work or connections to
organizations that can help either the
seers themselves or the program ripples
two waves and then finally we need
investors it would be great to have
support from both corporate and
individuals we've already raised over a
program like this costs about seventeen
thousand dollars per visiting social
entrepreneur and we are trying to bring
eight of them to campus in a year so in
two cohorts four and four but overall
the program costs including staffing and
travel and you know conference was it
costs a little under four hundred
thousand dollars a year and so we're
always also trying to raise resources
for that so those are some of the things
we could use help with and you know
again we really look forward to being
able to you know hear more from any of
you I don't know if any of you want to
add anything on particular
if if there are people who want to do
maybe I wanna talk or have a workshop or
discuss ideas or brain some ideas maybe
that's something they can just you know
feel free to come and sit down and maybe
with the group and say you know
understand i think that's that's the i
was i was just as I would echo that you
know many different workshops on a
variety of topics and issues to be
addressed and you know I know I would
love to talk about some of the
initiatives that have involved with and
that I'm interested in and i'm confident
i have a lot to learn from you girls and
guys any other questions well so yeah I
think we can go ahead and wrap it up
thank you so much for coming long as
daily interested thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
