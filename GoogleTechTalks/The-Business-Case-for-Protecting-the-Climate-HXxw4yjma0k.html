there I met a guy michael myers whose
business card said planetary protection
officer and i thought that was the
coolest title that anybody could ever
have but hunter lovins has beat even
that out by winning from Time magazine
the hero of the planet award so Google
is happy to welcome here today Hunter
lovins superhero entrepreneur founder of
companies author lawyer sociologist and
riding and roping cowgirl I'd relevant
thanks it's it's an honor to be here at
a company whose product I use on a multi
time of day basis how many of you have
read this book peter has course number
one best-selling book on amazon.com for
all of 2007 suggest if you're interested
in this this field you read it what
Nassim Taleb pointed out is starts with
the story of in the olden days in
England where swans were white until
some fool bumped into Australia at which
point they found these very large birds
that were well black so they said well
they're not Swan swans are by definition
white until the ornithologist said
actually they are swans at which point
they said oh yeah we knew that talib
suggests that everything that matters in
your life in business in history in
innovation is a black swan you didn't
predict it until it happened at which
point you explained it as if you knew it
out of the knowledge that you used to
have and unlike the bird it will change
everything he suggests that black swans
are accelerating so what are the
predictable surprises in your business
those of us who work in energy policy o
our careers to a single surprise in 1973
the Arab oil embargo and we go on to
assume a surprise free future I think
one of the things we know is it isn't
going to be
like that my favorite Black Swan hunter
is John Peterson of the Arlington
Institute and he puts out a free
newsletter called the future at
Arlington institute org you might want
to subscribe to it and in the first
couple of issues you'll say to yourself
well how does this relate to that it
doesn't necessarily until you begin to
see everything that's happening on earth
as interconnected bits of the future
that's coming at us talib says that
society's winners will be those who are
prepared to face black swans to accept
the notion that they exist that you
can't predict the future and you're
going to be hit by surprises to know it
when it sticks its little head up and
you're able to say oh Black Swan and
then to exploit them so how many of you
would have invested in these guys
particularly the thirteen-year-old in
the corner we're facing some fairly
formidable potential black swans in a
sense they're not black swans because we
can see them but when each of these
happens it's going to take most of
society by surprise we're losing every
major ecosystem on the planet we live in
a carbon constrained world if not a
global climate crisis we get 10,000 more
people arriving on earth every hour we
have high probably durably high and
rising energy prices if not peak oil
every bit of our infrastructure is
vulnerable chintia China and India are
in the world market for essentially
everything there's a new book out called
peak everything water two-thirds of the
world doesn't have access to clean
drinking water food we now have food
riots on three continents and then what
I call the sustainability imperative and
this really is a Black Swan this
explains for example why Walmart is
going green and why businesses that
don't go green won't be around because
of these drivers we're going to change
everything about how we do business
about how governments run their
operations civil society we're going to
reinvent every institution on the planet
because we're in trouble we're losing
every major ecosystem you don't have to
take my word for it the UN millennium
assessment science by a lot of folks
from most of the world's countries said
we've polluted or overexploited
two-thirds of the ecosystems upon which
life depends to the point that the
ability of these ecosystems to sustain
future generations can no longer be
taken for granted Kofi Annan said the
very basis for life on Earth is
declining at an alarming rate that's
sobering my friend the business leader
ray anderson put it a little more simply
what's the business case for ending life
on earth bill becker who runs the
presidential Climate Action project said
if we insist on ruining the planet we're
going to have to stop claiming we're a
superior species climate change that's
very much for real the science is
uncertain sure you can argue about how
bad it's going to be and how soon this
is the science I like and the science
doesn't matter now I say that with all
due deference to the great scientists
who are spending their lives trying to
get the models to catch up to observed
reality because the changes are
happening faster than even the models
predicted that they would but let's
assume that the climate skeptics are
right frankly don't go to the casino on
those odds but if all you care about is
being a profit maximizing capitalist
you'll do exactly the same thing you
would do if you were scared to death
about climate change because we know how
to protect the climate at a profit and
the best companies are starting to do
this DuPont some years ago announced
they were going to cut their emissions
of greenhouse gases globally sixty-five
percent by 2010 below their 1990 levels
and get ten percent of their energy and
a quarter of their feedstocks from
renewables has DuPont join Greenpeace
they made this announcement in the name
of increasing shareholder value and
they've done rather well between
2000-2005 they've saved about three
billion dollars they've already hit
their targets and well exceeded them
stmicroelectronics zero net co2
emissions with a 40-fold growth in
production there
maker when they made this announcement
they had no earthly idea how to achieve
it but figuring it out has driven their
corporate innovation taking them from
the number 12 chip maker in the world to
the number 6 they're gaining market
share so they've set more ambitious
renewables goals they're winning awards
they reckon by the time they're carbon
neutral they will have saved about a
billion dollars the CEO of Tesco I'm not
a scientist but I listen when the
scientists say that if we fail to
mitigate climate change the economic
social environmental consequences will
be stark and severe I am determined that
tesco be a leader in helping to create a
low-carbon economy and it goes on to say
this is a monumental challenge it
requires a revolution in technology and
a revolution in thinking we're going to
have to rethink the way we live and work
it's a CEO of a major corporation that
has committed to cut its energy use in
half by 2010 label its products as to
what's being transported by air and
start being transparent about the carbon
footprint of everything that it sells in
part because they're starting to get
pressure from the financial community
and especially the insurance industry
swiss re the big european reinsurer
recently said to its major customers if
you don't take your carbon footprint
seriously maybe we don't want to ensure
you or your officers and directors
imagine doing business without dno
insurance the banks are starting to
index bond issuances based on a
company's carbon footprint this little
outfit a group from the United Kingdom
group of young people who said well
let's send a survey out to the Financial
Times 500 500 biggest companies on earth
asking them what their carbon footprint
is for the first couple of years they
were roundly ignored about three years
ago sixty percent of the biggest
companies on earth answered their survey
two years ago seventy percent last year
seventy-seven percent why because they
represent institutional investors with a
boat
load of money and increasing every day
and under sarbanes-oxley the court US
corporate ethics law that says if as a
manager you fail to disclose to
shareholders information that can
materially affect the value of stock you
can be personally criminally liable so
what's your carbon footprint this may
have been the tipping point who would
have thought the Republican Governator
of California announcing a cap on carbon
within a year the western states have
signed on to a carbon management regime
New England adopted a wholly separate
regime so now companies are saying to
the feds can we please have a national
standard so we don't have to deal with
all of these different standards around
the country I said we're inventing new
institutions Chicago climate exchange
didn't exist 10 years ago it now has
members representing twenty percent of
the Dow Jones Industrials all trading
carbon in a country where there's no law
that says you have to because they're
finding that as they cut their carbon
emissions they're not burning as much
energy they're making money and then
people like me I work for a little
nonprofit we fly around the planet so
we're members of Chicago climate
exchange we pay CCX to offset our flying
and they then give that to the companies
that are cutting their carbon emissions
so the companies are benefiting twice
and there's an enormous scope for
squeezing waste out of our system we
waste at least 300 billion dollars a
year buying and burning energy we don't
need to deliver the services that we do
want and we've done this before after
the 79 oil shock we cut oil use in this
country fifteen percent while we grew
the economy sixteen percent just through
greater efficiency if we do this we will
have healthier communities a typical
community now is bleeding to death
trying to buy energy twenty percent of
gross income in a community goes to pay
for energy and eighty percent of those
dollars leave the United States is now
borrowing a billion dollars a day to buy
oil from the Middle East
we're mostly borrowing it from the
Chinese and we wonder that we have some
economic challenges again the answer is
efficiency first step this man West
Birdsall was the general manager of the
osage iowa municipal utility what he did
was to step across the meter to his
customers side to say I'm going to help
you use less of my product that's an odd
business model until you realize that
customers don't want kilowatt hours of
electricity they want the services
comfort in a building cold beer hot
showers that electricity can give to you
and if he can deliver those services
cheaper through efficiency than through
building a new coal plant in his case
it's a better business to be in he wound
up saving a million dollars a year in
this small rural town cut energy bills
to half that of the state average
unemployment to have that of the
national average because with the lower
bills more factories came to town every
community in the country can do this per
megawatt saved you're going to get over
two million dollars in increased
economic output over half a million
dollars in increased wages and more jobs
as a result mayor's are getting involved
now in implementing climate protection
I'm sure this is an old number because
this is at least a month old I haven't
checked but every time I checked it's
jumped by another 20 or 50 mayor's who
have signed on to abide by the Kyoto
Protocol which our government the US
government says would bankrupt the
economy if we abided by so why are the
mayor's doing it because they're
recognizing that energy efficiency
coupled with renewable energy is
actually an economic development program
and it's been shown up in Sacramento
some years back the people voted to shut
down the badly operating nuclear plant
rancho seco the utility lost a thousand
megawatts all at once but rather than
invest in coal plant or a gas plant they
invested first of all inefficiency and
then in
distributed renewable generation on
roofs spread around the city now more
than 15 years later the numbers are in
the entire region is economically
healthier than had they just kept
running the old plant at the plant run
rates were projected to go up eighty
percent the held rates level over a
decade this kept in place two thousand
jobs and companies that said if the
prices go up we're leaving they created
880 new jobs in the utility paid off its
debt across the bay in Berkeley a city
clerk realized that you can create a
special assessment taxing district for
essentially anything typically done to
underground wires or clean up an
alleyway they said why don't we create
an energy special assessment district
Berkeley is now the first city to do it
in which you can simply go to the city
and get the money to put solar on your
roof or implement efficiency in your
house it gets paid back as an increase
in your property tax not your neighbor
if he or she doesn't participate so that
if you sell your house the bill stays
with the house which is where it belongs
this financing mechanism is now going
into place in cities across the country
fan Jones from Oakland is showing how we
can turn the economy around by creating
green color jobs high quality
manufacturing jobs here in the United
States fixing up homes fixing up our
businesses building renewable energy my
home state of Colorado has turned itself
around even though we had more home
foreclosures than any other state
because we have been attracting
renewable energy companies to come and
locate in Colorado and set up
manufacturing we can unleash this new
energy economy or we can face the
greatest market failure in history which
is our failure to implement climate
mitigation measures study after study
after study has shown that we can
decarbonize the economy
at least eighty percent which is what
the scientists are saying will be
necessary to get a handle on climate
change and do it profitably just using
efficiency and renewables Mackenzie
borrowed some work that a number of us
did about 10 years ago to show that many
of these measures are so cost-effective
they save you money that they will pay
for the more expensive measures so
what's below the line is savings what's
above the line are the various
decarbonisation measures we can do this
we have the technologies it's simply a
question of political will so where do
we start buildings very good place most
of us spend most of our time inside of
them they are responsible for a third of
total energy use two-thirds of
electricity and a lot of other waste and
yet we know how to make any existing
building three to four fold more
efficient new ones ten times as
efficient even in a good building like
this listen if you can hear the HVAC
system those are dollars leaving the
building if you put good green features
like day lighting in to say schools you
will get higher test scores they put
them into a Walmart and got higher
retail sales you can get increases in
labor productivity of six to sixteen
percent by bringing good green features
into a building and that pays for the
measures it's the energy-saving measures
that enable you to get it but there it's
worth doing it even if energy costs
nothing simply because of increased
labor productivity we could avoid 58
billion in sick time if we had cleaner
green buildings and gained 200 billion
for the economy in increased worker
productivity to the point where even
harvard business review is now saying
that owners of standard buildings face
massive obsolescence as building owners
are realizing there's this dramatically
growing demand for green buildings
netzero homes are popping up all over
the place these are buildings that
produce their own electricity and are
efficient enough that they don't need to
produce that much or they can sell
electricity back to the grid office
buildings the new PUC building will be a
NetZero building when the winds blowing
you again you start out with super
efficiency and then add in the various
renewable features and this is not a new
thing to do for Times Square has been
operating for almost a decade in New
York City uses half the energy of a
normal building although it costs the
same to build gets most of its energy
from building integrated photovoltaics
what looked like windows are actually
solar cells generating electricity on
the south and west facade fuel cell in
the basement so this is a building that
can never be turned off you want to run
your computer's 24 7 step right up and
then the 2003 northeast blackout it was
the only building around with light
people came from blocks around to camp
out underneath it now this is genuine
Homeland Security you think taking your
shoes off going through an airport is
going to make you more secure this is
the u.s. at night the tenth of August
1996 and 35 seconds later when a tree
fell across a power line out in Oregon
check it out that's nine western states
and millions of people terrorists are a
little smarter than tree limbs if we
care about national security we will
implement energy efficiency and
renewable energy as a security measure
instead our government tells us that the
cornerstone of Homeland Security is to
drill in the Arctic and assuming they
find any oil under the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge ship it all south
through the pipeline well this is the
trans-alaska pipeline when a drunk got
after it with a deer rifle he didn't
mean any harm had he been one of the
competent bad guys and blown one of the
pumping stations lifting the oil over
the brooks range and done it in winter
when you can't get at it to fix it you'd
had 800 miles of
oil congealing into the world's largest
chapstick homeland security even if we
don't care about saving money or about
security we ought to be mindful of
security of supply Matt Simmons the
Houston oil banker points out that the
production history of the supergiant oil
fields looks very like a theory put
forth by a man named M king Hubbert who
in the 1950s pointed out that if you
have exponential demand you get a curve
like this when you've extracted half of
a resource you fall off the production
curve as steeply as you went up it was
called Hubbert's needle or peak hence
the phrase peak oil well we surely have
exponential demand ninety percent of the
oil ever used has been used since 58
half of it since 84 and demand with
India and China is going up so are we
there yet we know that the u.s. uses a
quarter of the world's oil we own three
percent of the reserves so we import
sixty percent of it and have our young
men and women in harm's way protecting
access to what we like to think of as
our oil in the words of Jim Woolsey you
used to run the CIA we're funding both
sides of the war on terror we're paying
for our guys we buy oil from the guys
who are paying for the other guys this
is daft and here's where we are now
whether we are at peak oil or nearing it
what you have are these fluctuations of
price run-up and as the price runs up
people start buying efficiency so demand
slack so price slacks we've had four of
these oscillations since the 73 oil
shock they're not very good for business
they're not very good for the economy
and they're not necessary if we want to
get off oil the answer is cars vehicles
transportation we don't have to have
cars there are parts of the world that
get around just fine with trolley
or Amsterdam with bicycles pedicabs or
high-speed trains good public transit is
something that we ought as citizens of
supposedly a modern nation we ought to
be demanding but if you still want to
drive your car we know how to build them
so that they get dramatically higher
fuel mileage than most of what we drive
around today and indeed the car
companies are finally starting to move
in this direction but they can go a
great deal further we can also fuel them
differently I was on the podium with
Branson and Clinton when Branson said
he's putting the profits of the Virgin
Group for the next ten years into carbon
neutral fuels the media came running up
and said why'd he said I run an airline
I'm gonna need fuel and he has already
flown a jet from Heathrow to ship hole
in the Netherlands on a quarter
biodiesel biodiesel is pretty cool stuff
you can make it yourself just go down to
the local McDonald's get their fry oil
and refine it in a homemade still like
the picture on top you can do it
industrially production is rising
significantly it's real important though
with biodiesel with ethanol with any of
these alternative fuels that we source
the feedstocks sustainably unlike what
we have been doing which is simply
grabbing as much agricultural production
as we can and pouring it into
inefficient cars this now is part of
what's contributing to food riots on
three continents corn is not the only
source corn soybean the other edibles
lipid algie's are one of my favorite
sources these things produce more oil
per volume than corn does and if you
locate lipid algae plants next to coal
plants you run the co2 through them the
algae grows like crazy you're still
emitting co2 when you burn the biofuel
from the algae but at least you're using
it a couple times before it goes off
into the atmosphere and ultimately you
shut down the coal plant as I said we
have the technologies these are the only
options that make any sense for the rest
of the world which cannot afford to
develop in the old inefficient
way that we did and it will give us much
more livable communities and surprise
it's happening we brought on in the
United States last year 15 gigawatts of
new wind power a gigawatts roughly a
nuclear sized chunk of electricity
Jeannot t'as if we to built 15 nukes you
would have noticed across the bay they
built a 250 2.3 megawatt power plant on
rubes spread throughout the county the
utility paid for half of it it will cut
the county's bill 700,000 a year Down
South they're building a megawatt a week
Southern California Edison is putting in
a 250 megawatt solar array on roofs
around the county that is very near the
price point of building a 250 megawatt
coal plant we're we're nearing grid
parity the point at which solar is as
cheap as coal and you probably saw in
the last week the announcement of the
two companies here in California putting
in collectively 800 megawatts check out
China this is a megawatt grid integrated
on a roof in China now this is a very
good thing China has declared that it is
going to move to the middle class
nothing wrong with that except that the
consequences of it doing it are
staggering and China with India right
behind it are in the world market for
coal oil concrete everything you
remember the old book limits to growth
the business community used to say oh no
that's not real last March the Wall
Street Journal came out and admitted
maybe we do have actual constraints on
the amount of resources that we can take
from the earth maybe limits to growth is
real and as a result we're seeing these
record prices and we haven't seen
anything yet Lester Brown points out if
China
continues to grow at the rate that it
has economically and uses resources as
in efficiently as we do by 2030 it's
going to want more oil than the world
now lifts or can ever lift and more cars
and cotton and coal and concrete at that
point you kind of gotta smack up against
this the future is not possible and at
that point there becomes a role for
government I've talked a lot about what
companies can do and why there is a
business case for companies becoming
more sustainable but there's also a role
for government because it's almost like
a bad light bulb joke how many
economists does it take to screw in a
light bulb none the free market will do
it if you go back and read Adam Smith
all markets were ever intended to do is
allocate scarce resources efficiently in
the short term markets make a lousy
religion and they were never intended to
take care of grandchildren that's our
job that's the job of free people coming
together in a democracy and saying what
kind of a future do we want it's also
the job of Education I'm now a professor
of a discipline that didn't exist when I
went to college the word sustainability
entered the english language the year I
graduated from college and a group of us
got together up in San Francisco and
created a school called Presidio School
of Management it's an MBA program Brian
Shannon our students there in which we
weave sustainability throughout the
entire curriculum every class is taught
from the standpoint of sustainability
because you've heard this line yeah
don't take a risk the second Mouse gets
the cheese we need to be like this
little guy let's strap on a helmet and
go for it and then you get the
inevitable question yes but is there a
business case well as a matter of fact
you ignore it at your peril study after
study is now showing that if customers
don't like what you do is a bit
business they will choose not to
purchase from you we need now a better
way of communicating this a man named
Bob Willard was an IBM executives
written these two books laying out this
approach and pointing out that this is
what people that this is the business
reality today it's not the way we think
about businesses we think about
businesses like this or we used to that
a business consists of what's tangible
its assets the intangibles are just a
tiny part of it you guys should know
more than anybody else this is a
business that's built upon intangibles
and that it is the real worth of a
company that worth is threatened by all
these drivers of change by an increasing
awareness on the part of the public of
all of these issues we used to look at
sustainability this way the triple
bottom line but that asks business to
bolt on to profit protection of people
and protection of planet as cost centers
I think that's a dead end way of looking
at it we use instead of phrase we call
the integrated bottom line which asks if
what business is in business to do is
generate profit the milton friedman
chicago school view of business some of
us may disagree that's the only reason
to be in business but let's assume
Friedman's right what is value to owner
what constitutes shareholder value that
you're supposed to be enhancing
obviously cutting your costs but you do
that through cutting out waste most
effectively driving innovation that's
what you guys do driving top-line
revenues by innovating so then you look
at what st did by setting a be hag a big
hairy audacious goal of being carbon
neutral driving its innovation cutting
its risk remember if the insurance
companies aren't going to ensure you if
you have a ginormous carbon footprint
it's worth cutting
at risk how do you get the best people
you become the kind of company that they
want to come and work at this company
more than any gets that you enhance
labor productivity once you have these
people through building good green
buildings and treating people well you
drive market share and differentiate
your brand by making a public commitment
to behaving in sustainable ways doing
this enables you to better manage your
supply chain this is in part why Walmart
is doing this as I said walmart has
90,000 suppliers but this is the real
reason walmart acted they got run out of
Germany not because somebody passed a
law but because citizens didn't shop
there Walmart is announcing its green
initiatives to give it time to figure
out what to do on the social side
because they were losing business share
in the four years running up to
Walmart's announcement they had had a
30-percent dissolution of share value in
the last year they've had a seventeen
percent increase the companies that get
it right will be first to the future
we're talking about the billionaires of
tomorrow and you can start to attach
real numbers to the value of each of
these enhanced national security getting
and keeping the best people carbon
trading the carbon market is already a
79 billion dollar market in London on
its way to being a trillion and
maintaining your franchise to operate
staying in business by being able to
meet laws like sarbanes-oxley Willard
has stuck some numbers on what you gain
by cutting your recruiting costs
reducing your attrition increasing labor
productivity and notice his number is
ten percent that's kind of midway
between the six and sixteen percent
these are conservative numbers for an
increased profitability of thirty-eight
percent through a corporate commitment
to sustainability
think about it go back to the first
Industrial Revolution when we invented
commerce using water power to make iron
and textiles and then moved on to steam
power and trains and then electricity
and chemicals and cars and then
petrochemicals and in the space race the
last wave of innovation is where you
guys come in what's next what is the
American population going to be burger
flippers I think if we're going to have
a dynamic growing industrial economy in
the United States it is going to be
based on this new energy economy on
unleashing sustainability on green
chemistry and energy efficiency and
renewable energy and interestingly the
companies that are leading in this
sector are outperforming the general
market about a year ago Goldman Sachs
came out with a report showing that the
leaders have twenty-five percent higher
stock value than their competitors the
economist intelligence unit last
februari showed that again the leaders
have the highest share price growth
conversely the companies that are the
worst performing and the economy are
most likely to have nobody in charge of
sustainability the Carbon Disclosure
Project that I mentioned if you don't
manage your carbon footprint
manufacturers could lose 40 percent of
their market value banks twenty-nine
percent this is this is the
sustainability imperative companies
don't have a choice and not surprisingly
companies issuing corporate
sustainability reports are coming up
like mushrooms after a rainstorm it's
getting to be a who's who of the
corporate world Yale Dan st and Andrew
Winston pointed out that there are
strategies that companies can implement
one of the best way
to do it is to set a vision that is
clear in the marketplace and they point
to Toyota which has set the goal of
coast coast on a tank of gas now they're
not there yet but compare them to GM you
barely get out of your driveway is it
any surprise that the losses that Ford
suffered is essentially identical to the
profits that Toyota made the money came
out of one pocket and went into another
based winston and SD argue on Toyotas
having set a clearly defined corporate
goal that people could understand
Willard points out a 5-step journey pre
compliance you don't want to be there
that's where your illegal compliance
that's where most companies are beyond
compliance okay you're squeezing out
some waste implementing some
eco-efficiency and then the integrated
strategy we used to think that that's
that was the sweet spot and
sustainability Willard says no the sweet
spot is where you have a leadership team
that is clear on the value that
sustainability will deliver to your
company where it is truly the passion of
the company we use a tool we call the
helix of managing a sustainable
organization to help companies
understand where they are in this people
say we're going to drive sustainability
into the DNA of a company well what is
the DNA of a company so we took a look
at said well first of all what's DNA we
do a little helix like oh okay it has
two rails and a bunch of cross hatching
threads so suppose one rail is the job
of the CEO one rail is the job of the
CFO and then the cross-hatching threads
are the business activity streams HeLa
sees twist at each twist you have the
opportunity to take a different
perspective on how you're managing the
company we arbitrarily picked four of
these from a stage of exploration to
implementing some of it
echo efficiency to making sustainability
coherent throughout the organization to
becoming the kind of company in which
everything you do is restorative of
human and natural capital the forms of
capital that we're losing in today's
world so let's lay this out the way an
engineer might with the mission vision
values across the top the metrics the
accounting the profitability across the
bottom and the various business activity
threads and take a look at a company
General Electric ecomagination Jeff
Immelt who once said the only green bone
in his body was the one on the golf
course suddenly jumps out and announces
ecomagination if you will he's taken a
leadership role in marketing and
communications the enviro zhem ETA said
greenwashing because all he did was
badges green products he was already
making so he's back here at a stage one
in running his operations in his
facilities this enables this tool
enables a company to say oh we have some
work to do and to systematically examine
where the opportunities are for your
company throughout all of the business
activity streams as you move through
these stages toward becoming a truly
restorative company we think these
principles of what we call natural
capitalism are the basis of durable
competitive advantage starting by using
efficiency because it's profitable and
because it solves many of the scarier
problems facing us like climate change
and then redesigning how we make
everything using approaches like Janine
Ben uses biomimicry or styles cradle to
cradle or mcdonough's cradle to cradle
and then managing all institutions to be
restorative of human and natural capital
but it's important to have that vision
my old boss Dave Brower used to say what
do we want the earth to be like 50
years from now let's do a little
dreaming aim high he said navigators
have aimed at the Stars for centuries
they haven't hit one yet but because
they aimed high they found their way
clearly we need a new form of leadership
and I rather like this line from Lord of
the Rings where Gandalf said the rule of
no realm is mine but all worthy things
that are in peril as the world now
stands those are my care and for my part
I shall not wholly fail if anything
passes through this night that can still
grow fair and bear fruit and flower
again in the days to come for I too am a
steward did you not know not a bad Maxim
it doesn't matter if your lease got the
head of Walmart or the President of the
United States of the Governor of
California because remember in the end
it was these two it was the fun-loving
unassuming hobbits who took on their
shoulders this awesome task and they
were scared and they didn't know where
they were going but in the end all the
kings and warriors and wizards could
just stand by as the little people saved
the world I think real leadership is
extraordinary courage by ordinary people
thanks for caring and if any of you have
any questions about any of the numbers
or arguments it's all on the website we
make essentially all of our material
downloadable for free from the website
including the entire text of the book
natural capitalism if you're really
beady-eyed and recreationally challenged
and if any of you have any questions
comments I'd be happy to chat with you
there's a microphone there if you speak
into the microphone then the recording
will hear what you say and he's got a
handheld well first of all that was a
fantastic presentation so thank you for
sharing with it and I like your emphasis
son saying the business of business is
making profit and they know how to do
that so they should keep doing it we
just have to tweak it a little and you
know and you certainly talked about the
role of the vision for the CEO I can see
that's important in the role of the
pressure of the consumers to help push
the business in the right direction and
you talked a little bit about
government's role and wondered if you
could say some more about that you know
it seems to me that there's a couple
things that government can do one of
them is yes you're trying to maximize
profit but over what time frame and
through tax policies and various other
things the government can influence
businesses to change their time horizon
and then the other thing is this idea of
externalities where governments are you
know businesses get a free ride if they
don't have to pay for certain
externalities that they're essentially
getting for free and governments can
change that so so what should the
government's be doing maybe the big
question particularly now as we go into
an election round there are very
different visions of the role of
government from all business wanza's
government off its back to the more
socialistic European
approach of business should set all the
rules and then companies can compete
within that fairly tightly bounded space
I tend to believe that the role of
government is to steer not row that
government should bring people together
to set the vision of where it is that we
want to get to well enough into the
future that we have the time to plan and
get their governments of late have been
responsive they look at our government
right now in reaction to what happened
in Georgia we were caught absolutely
flat footed what is national security
what on American national security
policy be and for all the hand waving
about it we really don't have a national
security policy we certainly don't have
an energy policy we don't have an
environmental policy and we don't even
have a conversation going on in the
country about what these ought to be
what we have are battling sound bites
now you mention externalities fair
enough we all of us will shed whatever
costs we can and if you can throw things
away for free why on earth should you
pay for it so we have a nuclear industry
that for example is being subsidized to
have its waste taken away but every
other industry has to pay for that we
have a incumbent energy technologies
cold nuclear the various forms of
electrification getting depending on how
you count it 36 billion a year 80
billion a year 200 billion a year in
subsidies from your in my tax dollars
and all forms of efficiency and
renewable getting to 25 billion
depending on what you're counting what
we clearly don't have in government now
is honesty or indeed in economics we
don't have honest accounting we don't
have transparent accounting and I think
the first thing government ought to do
is it particularly if governments
believe in markets markets don't fun
without information so provide
information to people on what and as an
honest broker not trying to hide numbers
or cook numbers but provide honest
information on what is it what are all
these different options cost and then
let's have a debate about which ones do
you prefer governments can get barriers
identified and cleared markets if you go
back and read Adam Smith markets presume
that there are no real barriers and in
fact Joe Stiglitz won a Nobel not too
long ago for pointing out that well
actually there are a lot of barriers to
the market working perfectly so if we
believe in markets and there are
barriers let's identify and clear the
barriers what's a barrier well for
example if you want to put solar on your
roof you're going to pay typically
MasterCard interest rates but if a
utility wants to build a coal plant they
can get very cheap federal money that's
a barrier that's a financial barrier if
you want to put a windmill up in your
backyard there's likely to be a local
law against it now you know maybe height
ordinances and view scape ordinances are
a good thing but a lot of good renewable
energy technologies are being held up
because of obsolete laws in many
communities if you want to put up a
clothesline it's illegal so that's a
barrier that should be identified and
cleared and here in California there's
been a lot of work of late in redoing
the building code and there's a new
building code coming out that's going to
dramatically increase efficiency
standards and begin to clear some of
these barriers so that's it I think
that's another very important role for
government setting long term vision so
that we can set policy making sure that
all actors in the market have access to
information identifying and clearing
barriers and then what you know why does
Silicon Valley exist
innovation is the usual answer but
actually it's because the federal
government one president in particular
said we're gone to the moon and the the
spread of what happened in Silicon
Valley the computer industry was very
heavily government-funded on space
contracts trying to figure out ways to
get us to the moon in ten years so there
are a group of people calling for an
Apollo like project in fact it's called
the Apollo project to promote renewable
energy now personally I think that it's
far better to set performance standards
and let companies innovate and I think
we've learned that in how much money was
wasted on a lot of very silly things in
going to the moon and that we're well
enough along and renewable energy that
if you put in place financing mechanisms
like the Berkeley program set national
goals and give companies very clear
signals like a multi-year investment
regime for the the tax credits wind for
instance solar the the tax credits roll
over on an annual basis if you're an
industrialist looking at making a
multi-billion dollar investment and you
have a one year planning horizon yeah
that's a little sketchy I'm actually
completely surprised that the guys at
opti solar and the other solar
industries are making these kinds of
investments given that kind of climate I
think these are truly visionary leaders
but you better believe the coal and
nuclear boys don't want that kind of a
planning horizon it was at a meeting
recently where they were there in force
to try to get federal policies set to be
500 billion a year for nuclear and 200
billion a year for clean coal it'd be
nice if we had those kind of numbers for
the the renewables industry or at least
take off the competing subsidies so a a
stable investment environment and
information and clearing barriers and
the government will have done a very
nice piece of
then we can get out of the way and let
entrepreneurs innovate sort of on a
smaller scale I once was trying to
compare things on carbon footprints of
various products and it's next to
impossible to try and track this down it
all sort of turns into this diaper
argument you know whether you want to do
paper diapers or you wash them yourself
kind of thing and whatever how do you
know we as individuals start making
these decisions and get the information
we need I think the best way to make
individual decisions is to look at the
relative the order of magnitude
calculations about the size of your
footprint what is the the preponderance
of your footprint it's going to be your
energy use it's not going to be your
diapers or whether you have paper or
plastic bags at the grocery store there
may be other reasons to get rid of
plastic bags but in terms of footprint
and carbon footprint that's a very small
piece of it there are a growing number
of organizations that will make those
calculations for you and if you google
carbon footprint you will find at least
a dozen calculators I have my students
do this every year and Brian how many do
you do and where the answer is the same
yeah
travel
yeah you have a fairly low footprint
some of our students find that the
answers are wildly divergent depending
on the calculator that they use and so
they say well what do we do I said well
have reached them that's at least we'll
get you in the ballpark if you want to
get really persnickety about every
single bit of your carbon footprint then
you you really have to sit down and
start sharpening a pencil and and and
thinking about it but if all of us say
didn't travel one day a week
telecommuting that's going to be a big
chunk out of your footprint I don't have
to do any math to know that if all of us
joined an organization like live neutral
live neutral org will offset the carbon
footprint of anything that you do home
flying driving party they use Chicago
climate exchange and you will have made
a contribution to cutting carbon
footprint so what I say is just take the
big chunk items of what you're doing
your energy use in your home your energy
use in your transport are going to be
the biggest part of your footprint then
start looking at what enhances your
quality of life to me shopping at a
farmers market gives me much tastier
vegetables than a tomato that's come
from 2,500 miles away I will enhance my
quality of life by taking a little bit
of time on a Saturday morning and going
down to the farmers market buying local
buying within a hundred miles and
looking around at everything that I use
so for example earlier I declined a
bottled water because tap water is just
fine thank you and just thinking
systematically about how do I live my
life and how can I start reducing that
footprint in ways that enhance my
quality of life because if this stuff is
hair shirt it's not going to last we
need ways of living better more lightly
on the earth that are delightful
just building on the question that Steve
asked there are there are just two ways
to look at companies and one is eco unit
org or equal unit calm looking at
companies and also Jessica's company the
sustainable business institute they have
a seal of sustainability so that you can
look at companies and as more companies
join you can say who is committed to
sustainability I had two quick question
and also a request one question is
Congress recently did not pass the tax
incentives for renewable energies is
there an opportunity for that to be
undone yes sure Congress will come back
into session and this is one of those
times when writing your congressperson
and writing other Congress people and
saying look we want renewable energy
please pass these things is very helpful
good great another one I was wondering
if you could talk a little bit about
biomimicry because you alluded to it and
i'm not sure if everyone knows it if you
could just tell a couple of success
stories just about that and maybe some
other success stories to make sure
biomimicry is a marvelous concept it
asks the simple question how does nature
do business nature makes a wide array of
products and services very differently
than we do nature for example does not
use big flows of fossil energy it runs
on sunlight nature doesn't make anything
that's persistently toxic it makes
dangerous things if you ever been in the
proximity of a black widow spider or
rattlesnake but the toxin doesn't hang
around for hundreds of thousands of
years like nuclear power waste does
nature makes everything at ambient
temperature near to something that's
alive the output of any process in
nature is food for some other nature
shops locally and nature is beautiful
they're about 12 principles of
biomimicry that are laid out in a book
by that title biomimicry by Jeanine
beignets and it is now being picked up
by industry as a basis for innovation
for solving problems for example do you
know what color a peacock is it's not
blue and purple it's brown if you take
the pigment in a peacock it's brown all
that iridescent is structural it's the
light hitting the way in which the
feathers are structured so there's a
company in Japan that's making
billboards based on the same concept how
does the Lotus clean itself the Lotus is
the symbol of purity in Asia it comes up
out of the muck and yet it's always
clean turns out its structural again
their little bump yewll's on lotus
petals and leaves that when water hits
it the water beads up in such a way that
it carries the dirt away so a company
called Lotus San now has a surface
covering for buildings so that when it
rains the building cleans itself the
paint industry is actually very worried
about this they call it the Lotus effect
the if you go into nature and say how is
nature doing this color or form or
structure or system and bring biologists
to the design table so that you you have
somebody around who actually knows how
it is that nature is doing this you can
find ways of making industrial products
that are dramatically cheaper lower
energy lower impact and deliver a
superior product I was with interface
are these interface these are carpet
tiles what we're standing on typical
carpet in most industry is broadloom so
you lay it out in say in office and
twenty percent of it gets eighty percent
of the wear because that's where people
walk so you tear the whole thing up
throw it away in landfill it lasts for
twenty thousand years
this is daft man named Ray Anderson had
an epiphany that nothing about his
carpet company was sustainable and he
said I'm going to be the first company
of the next Industrial Revolution we are
going to be sustainable interface by the
way is eighty-two percent of the way of
completely decarbonizing with doubled
profits increased sales volume they did
it in part by hiring Janine beignets to
come and work with their designer and
they went out into nature and they
started looking at how nature does
carpet or floor covering surface
covering ray anderson said to the
designer david okie i want carpet like
nature that is recycled and recyclable
and okie said Bossa didn't possible we
know how to chop it up and make it into
something else but we don't know how to
take the nylon in the face and the PVC
in the backing and separate them because
they're bonded together and I was there
when David said that and I was there
when he came back with the first version
of interfaces new product and his eyes
were this big he said God must be an
environmentalist I said it wasn't
possible and when we figured it out we
had a product that costs less that was
better for the customer that was simply
better all the way around and interface
now as a company has a corporate
commitment to implementing
sustainability throughout all of its
operations and rages told me a story
interfaces started a consulting group
called interface raised to help other
companies do what they've done and in
one of their first meetings they had a
group of people from a multinational
food company and they said there was one
gal who really didn't want to be there
and she was really upset to have to be
in this meeting and was you just see it
all over her face and on break she went
to the ladies room and to get there you
had to cross the shop floor and she went
up to one guy who was working moving big
rolls of carpets and she said why are
you here and he said ma'am I come to
work every day because I'm saving the
earth and she said when
and he started explaining what interface
is doing and how its it cut its waste
thirty percent of its operating profits
come from eliminating waste and all of
the things that interface was doing and
then he said ma'am I'd love to talk to
you but frankly if I don't get this
carpet moved the whole operation is
going to shut down and that's going to
result in waste and our waste metrics
will go off the scale and I just can't
do that I have to get back to work and
she came back into the room visibly
changed and for the first few minutes
she was challenging her colleagues why
aren't we being more sustainable and
somebody said pointed out and you seemed
to have a different attitude and she
told the story on herself she said I
have never seen a company with such
alignment from the CEO to the shop floor
and that's really what happens when you
bring this all together within a company
you get the kind of alignment that high
performance companies simply have to
have other thoughts or y'all want to get
back to work thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
