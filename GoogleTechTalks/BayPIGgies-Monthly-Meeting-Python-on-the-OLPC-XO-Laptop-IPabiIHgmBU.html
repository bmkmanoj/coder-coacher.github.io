represents and hacking because that's a
lot of fun and I'm going to start off
and really just sort of chat about the
hope of the XO this is a piece of
technology about children and it's a
piece of technology about education
because the biggest thing that we can do
in our lives is to figure out how to
educate all the children now right now
education is something that is a little
hard to get ahold of we keep thinking
that we need large presentation systems
and we need AV systems in schools but
our technology has progressed far enough
that we can do it with a laptop and
these gains keep coming on a personal
side when I was about three or four I
lived in kanpur India that my father was
one of the first professors to go over
and start up but at that time I think
was the fourth IIT University and they
just moved over there and he would took
a move that was not so conducive to good
careers but he felt it was important and
he ran over to India and started
teaching classes and they'd come in and
it was a madhouse they'd say you know
well we have somebody wants to meddle in
metallurgy they want a major in
metallurgy we need some classes we need
a course description for the classes and
we need to know what they need to have
to graduate because that's what they
were doing they came over and they
started it up and now IIT has become a
major university and what happened is
the people that went there were able to
generate enough wealth that india became
a much greater country than it had been
at the time they went in this case this
is the XO so it's going to be going in
and it's going to be taking what is an
expensive piece of technology for the
area and dropping it in two different
places mostly fairly poor
India Bangladesh New Orleans and going
and the thing is this is most of what
you need now for a good education this
is a different type of computer it's
designed really for collaboration at its
heart as a window into the world that
you can play with and right now you've
got kids picking it up and going we know
that if you give kids laptops they
figure it out and this is a very well
dismiss designed laptop what you'll also
see is that those children will go
beyond what you expect them to do and
they will make new products and they
will go out and they will make some
money and bring it back and at first it
doesn't look like much I mean right now
you've seen deployments of oh we dropped
a thousand laptops here or 10,000
laptops there into some country and it's
not the millions that you thought but
never forget exponential growth has a
way of sneaking up on you so that's
about the dream that they're selling and
references for those who are watching
carefully and this is about the reality
so you want to go hack on this beautiful
piece of machine it's a beautiful
machine if you look at the hardware it's
probably some of the sweetest hardware
that's come out in a while everything
from oh yes if you disassemble it they
have spare screws in the handle in case
you lose a few to the fact that you
don't get dust in it or they took what
his was the radical approach one will
probably be the standard approach in
four months of just mounting the whole
thing on the back of the display so it's
a beautiful piece of hardware and you
could have a whole harder a talk about
it and the hardware is very is actually
very nicely stable the full hardware the
firmware is pretty stable the OS is a
modified fedora core so it's a basic red
hat linux and you have access to all of
the the shells and Linux can
if you want them that's that's changing
a little for example that these do not
take full advantage of the hardware a
lot of the power saving systems have
been turned off this does not hibernate
right now it does not turn off the cpu
when the cpu is not being used it
there's a lot of power saving tricks
that are accessible at the hardware
level some of which is accessible at the
firmware level less of it is accessible
from the OS and from on top of the OS
you're basically programming in a
variety of languages with things that
you you know gstreamer and PI GDK all of
the libraries you know and love but it's
a brand new machine most people who have
it in this room have had it less than a
month a lot of the information for it is
is kind of squishy and so I you know you
hang out on chat rooms and try to find
things out that's moving from kind of
bleeding edge dangerous technology the
leading edge technology is where it is
now if you want to go through and
actually start hacking on it very first
thing to do is just get comfortable with
the thing it's going to be a bit
different than you expect they run
underneath a shell the sugarcrm shell
sorry the sugar shell not to be confused
with the sugar crm system but it runs
underneath the sugar shell you don't see
a file system as a user you you don't
every now and then you'll be playing
with it and say oh well you don't see
passwords and then a day will go by what
I noticed just it is I never clicked
through a license agreement there are
just no license agreements there no
modal dialogues there are no dialogues
it's so the interface is a little
different you're going to have to go get
comfortable with it my checklist for
getting comfortable with the system so i
suggest you you sit down you play with
it and you run through the applications
you'll find that it has a nice
programming environment for turtle art
basically a stripped-down logo for
turtle graphics go write a spirograph in
it
go play with their et toi squeak
implementation that's also a
drag-and-drop pieces around or change a
few items around run through its
tutorials then you're going to find that
just like the whole machine setup for
collaboration a lot of the things you
want to get comfortable with require you
to find a couple more people with them
you want to set up a mesh and you want
to do these interactive two-person
editing the documents or you want to do
the things that we physically require
two laptops like there's a acoustical we
send a noise we listen to it on the
other end we tell you how far away you
must be these things take a little while
you're going to find a lot of things
where you get stuck if you get stuck ask
a seven-year-old now we are young and
curious at heart they're young and
curious and don't expect things to be
wrong we'll go hunting around for the
power cord they'll pick it up and it'll
be the first place they push so go
through there's some reading you should
do you should read the basic little gain
started manuals learn the cheek keys
because you'll need them and go ahead
and you know flash the firmware the
firmware you can download an upgrade
there's always something that changed
upgrade the operating system once once
you start getting comfortable with the
system then you should probably start
going in and writing your code oh and
getting a developer developers key you
don't need it to actually program
developed getting a developer's key
involves going to a web page from the XO
and say give me a developer's ski and it
says great come back tomorrow and you'll
have it it's not a big deal but it's the
only way to change the firmware that you
have on your system to something that
they haven't signed and you're going to
have to hang out on a chat room that's
just kind of what you're going to end up
doing at the beginning to to
troubleshoot things these are some of
the links to the best places to start
and the best chat chat room to hang out
on and a few other links this entire
talk will be up on the bay piggy site
probably tonight or tomorrow or I'll put
it up on my site tonight once you
develop Python code if you go to the
wiki you'll see all of this stuff about
Oh build a couple of virtual machines
run
in your virtual machine that was for
when we didn't actually have the EXO's
go develop your Python code on the XO at
least as you're getting started now
eventually as you start having serious
test Suites and you and you're starting
to sort of move from trying to hack at
it and figure out what you can do to
building something a little more
production then you're probably going to
want to build those in an emulator now
remember this is a unix box you can SH
out you can ssh out to it you can what i
find is useful is you can just you can
move around flash drives but you can SCP
whatever files you need and just so you
can work on your big machine get a USB
keyboard and mouse or you'll slowly but
surely go and say yeah small fingers man
and sharing your ex session on it you
can do if you really need a big monitor
but it's slow so I suggest you just sort
of smile and and use the small monitor
or do most of your your work on a laptop
and then once you think you have
something that you should run move it
over there's going to be a lot of cut
and paste this is true how many people
here programmed in like the early
windows stuff like early microsoft
windows 30 or before you remember how
all the examples were this works this is
the documentation as you start with
something like this and you copy these
files and you put them in the right
place and then you add your changes here
a lot of the XO programming is going to
be like that right now so you're going
to find spots where i'll say there's
this recipe you copy all of these files
over you tweak these two numbers and
then you go and you write your code i'm
not going to talk much about koto it's
only supposed to talk for a grand total
of about five minutes Oh 5000k yes sir I
think the best overview of developing
applications is is on the wiki page
called hacking sugar which you'll find
is that the as i said the docking
is still very amorphous and there'll be
four or five places that try to tell you
the same thing of which two or right and
one is better and you can get all the
source code for everything that comes on
the XO and all of the other projects
that people are putting on there on a
standard trac database so you can go
check out your RCS or just view the
source online I found just looking
through things in a browser will often
clear up a lot of questions but none of
us have that much experience on it yet
yes have no idea okay now we get down to
the nuts and bolts I was you know
covering up to what does it really mean
to make a small application on this well
we call the applications activities and
when you move them over on you know you
can't go off and you can program in the
built-in stuff you can play around and
pippi is a interactive interpreter
there's going to be a time that gets a
lot better but for the current release
its lets you just sort of play around
with stuff and it's got a full shell so
you can run that but most of the time
you're going to be wanting to make one
of these applications that shows up on
the XO's list of nice little icons to
launch you put together a bunch of
standard things you got a manifest you
put them all into a magic file and you
tell it that hey there's this magic file
out there go rent it when you do that
one of the the gotchas is make sure
you're renting your actual current
version because under certain
circumstances especially the first time
that you're between the first and second
times that you edit your version it will
actually run the old version so I find
putting a printf statement or something
saying you know built at such and such a
time is worthwhile you package this all
up and then you override the activity
class that you inherit from because it's
a GUI and like most gooeys you're going
in and you insinuating yourself in some
sort of an
loop usually you put together a basic
thing in an in it and put together some
buttons and then program most of you
interesting stuff via callbacks so it's
going to be a model view controller
style system most of the work that
you're going to do is in PI gtk they
actually recommend that you use squeak
if you're trying to do sort of weird
full screen video games or you use PI
game but there's a Pengo which is
internationalization text is fine on it
gstreamer is how you get to the camera
and the built-in camera on the system
it's also how you handle video on an
office you'll find that you keep
reaching for video as a tool in this
system just because kids love it you
know it's just it's great it works d bus
with in telepathy or how you talk to
each other through the mesh network and
if it seems like a lot of buzz words
well the best walkthrough or the best XO
buzz word definitions file is there I've
seen and Christ just it'll walk you
through what's in the software stack and
so that you don't like run through all
of the buzzwords getting through the
mesh networking is its own piece and
it's promised there's a little bit of
Python code at the bottom this is your
basic hello world application there will
be one more slide after this what we're
doing is we're you'll notice that we are
subclassing from some a sugar class
sugar being this shell so everything
that we do is going to be running under
the shell the shell itself doesn't
change it just picks this activity up
and manages it so you're kind of at the
mercy of the shell for starting you up
you import gtk a standard thing in this
one little two line def hello world
logging in for hello world is where
actual payload of all of this is going
to be but and what you this is going to
do so log something you'll be able to
view it in the system logs you'll be
able to view it in the journal
how many people have even seen in EXO am
I talking to the wrong crowd yeah this
is it great okay so yeah it'll be in the
journal and this this is straight off of
the wiki this is your kind of how most
of this works if you've never done GUI
programming it's always sort of
backwards you build things up and and
first you say okay let me register
myself with with with the GUI itself in
this case with sugar let me build up my
whole that application toolbar that's
going to be on top and then let me add
in some buttons and connect that to my
actual feature and then push it all
together yes what absolutely and you'll
find that there's a tutorial walkthrough
on the wiki for it if you use blade how
do you do it instead of using hand coded
but it's really the same case of you
just sort of connecting the payload
through and this makes it look all so
easy of course this is one button taking
up the whole screen you're not worrying
about layouts you're not worrying about
well how am I going to collaborate a lot
of times you're going to find at least
people tell me I haven't gotten this
part in it that you get about halfway
through the program realize your
collaboration doesn't work the way you
thought it was and have to be organized
everything so this is basically
programming a bit you know this is the
OLPC and hacking on it it's probably the
most important thing that's going to
come out in the last ten years when you
look back you'll say oh yes the wii was
nice the ipod was nice this probably
changed the world it's a very simple
solid machine you can still get them on
ebay but to we'll see if they ever have
a gift to get one program or something
are there any questions well somebody
else it's up
what percentage of it is different than
I gtk like how much extra stuff oh I
need to learn the stuff that you want to
find yourself learning will be mostly if
you haven't used d-bus and even if you
have there'll be a lot of of how to get
messages around the mesh network but
what you have should work you'll find
that you learn some pieces that are
specific to the XO but not as much also
since it's a monolithic machine I mean
everybody out there has the same screen
size and thanks you'll find yourself
cheating and saying I just put it at
these pixel locations you know never
mind this layout stuff yes
they hope to bring it down right now
it's it's all the way up at about 185
dollars and they're putting them into
places including spots where that's
about the annual income they have a lot
of fail-safes on them that make them
call home to the school server or I'll
stay they brick they turn into an
unusable lump that is not true with the
ones that are in this room of anything
that people bought through the US
distribution or got through the
developers programs are not locked to
any school server but yeah one hundred
eighty five they hope to get it down
okay oh yeah taking apart is great one
of the links i really should have added
is the person who did chumby took one
apart and talked about wow you know
seven year olds can take it apart it's
an old Volkswagen last question and then
yep so you fixed it an hour and a half
two hours the worst case is it's a kid
who doesn't know anything and it takes
four hours life is so rough absolutely
it's just it's it's the VOC the
Volkswagen Beetle of computers will hold
other questions until other speakers
have finished I think is the best story
sorry thanks thanks
Charles my name is Aaron what I'd like
to tell you about now is how networking
works on the children's laptop and it
uses an architecture called mesh
networking and it's an interesting and
networking protocol and it's fairly
low-level most the action happens at the
data link level so it's not the kind of
thing you'd be able to implement and
twisted for example that kind of thing
so but so even though I won't be talking
about Python very much right here I
think you'll find it really interesting
still so what is a mesh network
basically in a mesh network every node
in the network acts as a relay to
connect other nodes to network as well
so every device in the network is also a
router essentially so and the reason was
this was a chosen for the oil pc laptop
is that it solves a lot of technical
problems said um that that need that are
being faced in the environments that's
being sent to so the idea of a mesh
network is pretty well developed both
practically and theoretically there's an
eye tree I Triple E standard for it
already 802 11 s oh wow ok interesting
yeah I know that so there there are
pluses and minuses to using a mesh
networking architecture to the big ones
and I think where the big factors are to
the biggest factors in being chosen for
this are it some are the range extension
and the power efficiency so in the as
I'll talk about one of the good things
that come out on mesh network is that it
can extend the range of a wireless
network quite a bit and that's really
important in the areas where unlike here
we don't have a you know here pretty
much everywhere you go and in this area
you're going to have a wireless
connection there's also some potential
powerful power efficiencies in it which
is another really important
consideration again here we have a
electrical outlets anywhere and we kind
of hard to imagine running out of power
but
it's not always true in some places and
another thing is that the network is
mesh network is pretty robust in the
sense that as things change it can be
made to adapt automatically and be
self-healing so you can imagine a
location where this is being deployed
you're going to have kids running around
with their laptops a lot batteries are
going to die kids or new laptops are
going to come into the area so the
network topology the is going to be
changing a whole lot and a mission of
where can be me too its robust with
respect to that there are some downsides
as well when one challenge you have is
keeping the the bandwidth and the
throughput up because usually I'll talk
a little bit more about that but usually
you just have a few of the nodes have a
direct connection to the network and
that has to be spread out to the others
there's also a greater complexity both
in the hardware and software because
think of all all of us have devices
connected to the wireless internet right
now most of us some of us have probably
like four or five and each one of those
is just has a centralized connection in
the sense that your device does not act
as a transmitter or router for other
devices around you whereas um so that's
you know just it's there's more that has
to be done at hardware and software
levels and there's also security
challenges with mesh networks as you
might imagine because you know basically
the different nodes which would be the
laptops they have to be talking to each
other almost constantly and so to allow
that to happen and everything that's
needed there for the network to work
well and protect privacy and everything
that's you know it's it's there's some
work to be done with that to make that
work well so so once the decision was
made to use the mesh network there are a
few other requirements that were taken
to account the power needs I mentioned
that was something a lot of attention
was given to making the best use of the
power available also
in terms of designing things in such a
way that it's easy to update and can be
updated software wise like Charles
mentioned a number of features aren't
there yet because they are planned for
the future so there's a lot of plans in
terms of functionality and standards
adhere it's the 802 11 s standard is in
progress still so that's deliberately
planned it's one interesting thing even
though that feature is not fully in
place yes there's a well actually I'm
not sure about that but there's a
feature that's either in place or will
be soon in which the laptop can even if
it's hibernating it can act as or it can
participate in the mesh network and one
thing I won't really have time to go
into is that the physical density of the
laptops in an area makes a big
difference in terms of just the
effectiveness of the network in terms of
power efficiency and bandwidth and
throughput so if you can have a laptop
that's high burn that's you know pulling
its weight and supporting the network
even though it's hibernating that helps
out a lot okay i just want to mention a
little bit about the networking hardware
as i was as i understand it when the
hardware was being decided on for the
like what how how to actually make this
thing how to how to put it together
there was a survey was made of given the
constraints of what it needs to do in
the cost turned out there were a couple
of wireless networking chips that Marvel
had that turned out to be the really
kind of only really good choice at the
time and there's a in marbella did quite
a I think they deserve some credit for
the work they did to help make this
happen they worked and donated some
software and work to make it integrate
it in with the hardware and everything
there's a lot of you know or I've heard
the olpc project has a goal of using
open source software as much as possible
in there in the lab
and for the most part that's that's the
case it's almost all software is open
source and the wireless networking
driver is an area where it's not
completely open source right now the
driver was based on a proprietary
microkernel that marvel didn't have the
rights to give away to they gave away
some other code to a under an open
source license so they didn't have the
rights to that so there's a some
interest in porting that driver to a
free microkernel so if someone is
looking for a way to contribute to the
olpc project if you're looking for an
open source project this is an
opportunity where you can help out and
it's referenced at this this this URL
here with this ticket is where you want
to go and you can get that URL from you
later if you're interested yes yeah yeah
so so i'll tell you about about the
little about the the standard that the
networking mesh networking in the
children's laptop is based on there are
a couple of concepts in it there's the
concept of a mesh point and a mesh point
is just a node a laptop that
participates in the mesh network and by
definition is also going to be a router
as well that can connect other nodes to
other mesh points to the network the
other concept is you have something
called a mesh portal which is basically
a mesh point that happens to have a
direct connection to the external
internet so for a lot of things that
need to be done with a mesh network a
kind of a fundamental problem is that
needs to be solved is you have two mesh
points two laptops that need to find a
route through the mesh network so they
can communicate with each other and the
way that's in them and that's that route
is determined through a routing protocol
and there are many possible routing
protocols the standard talks about them
very treats them well there's a there's
one defined in the standard Harless
wireless i'm sorry hybrid wireless
protocol that at the stand that the
laptop is modifies and uses and so
basically how it does is uses a request
and reply cycle yeah so so there's what
happens is first the mesh point it knows
it needs to find somewhere out to
another particular mesh point it'll send
a request packet in this request packet
let me give you a little refresh your
memory or tell you a little bit about
the some networking terminology is in
the 802 dot11 standards there's the idea
of frames which are basically packets
and there's a kind of frame called a
management frame which is a packet
that's used specifically for determining
network pass and network maintenance you
can contrast this with a data frame
which is used to deliver data and like
it will have a payload so a request
packet here is a management frame and it
is sent out as broadcast because it
doesn't know the path yet and so it'll
start with the that that request will
start with the neighboring nodes and
expand out and an interesting thing
happens as it is propagated when a node
receives this request packet assuming
that it itself is not the destination
node then it'll pass it along but before
it does that it require it self and
insert sidious routing table and
remembers that it and then eventually
the the request will recess destination
that destination will send a unicast
reply packet directly back or back to
the source and again that reply packet
will propagate over a number of nodes
and each one of those will get the
information about the route from the
source to the destination insert that in
its routing table so you can kind of
imagine pretty quickly as the request
and replies go around pretty quickly a
lot of the mesh nodes will get a get a
kind of almost a complete you can
imagine they can get a complete picture
the network topology just by storing the
information making good use of this
information that's available yeah yeah
um it's it depends it can be it's um
it's there's the the one I just
described as if it knows a specific
destination there's a also discovery
protocol to him so so this is this
graphic here just shows you so
everything I've just told you about that
kind of doesn't um that's just a group
of laptops connecting in a local mesh
network it doesn't have anything to do
with connecting to the external network
so and that would be in this area here
on the right just establishing
connections there and finding routes
there so if the and that works fine even
if no connection to the internet is
available then you can do a lot of
activities and do a lot of things with
that like the chat program and things
like that so I'm sorry okay question is
what happens that people move around
well then the network topology changes
and if basically if there's some sign
that something that the picture of the
network topology is not working then
then it will look for a new route so I'm
sorry you know i'm not sure that the
question is if they have a fixed time
out I'm sure they do I don't know what
it is and also i think the algorithm
that decides that is something that's
going to change I don't know real
precise I don't know where precisely
what it is right now yeah yeah so
basically so then another so there's a
question of how do you if you're in a
mesh network you yourself do not have a
direct connection to the external
network how do you get that connection
so what you need to do then is find a
route to a mesh mesh portal so you're a
mesh point which means you're a laptop
this and you're not connected to the net
and how do you find a route to a messy
portal that is connected so you can make
use of that external connection well
they there's a actually it's kind of a
clever I think the way they did it
basically a request frame is sent out
and it's a it's sent out any cast and
it's set to respond to a special
specific MAC address which it's a
specific number I'm I didn't write it
down there but it's um in this this MAC
address is special because every mesh
portal is programmed to claim it as
their own respond to it so the mesh mesh
point will send out this anycast request
and zero or more mesh portals will
oversee that eventually and say yes this
is my mac address and send a unicast
reply back to it so so this is a so well
then basically their source lap the
source laptop will get hopefully at
least one responding portal and then it
will make a choice as to which one is
the best which one it wants to use and
that's actually kind of a there's a it's
actually an important choice and there's
several ways to optimize that choice
which how do you judge which portal use
is better the algorithm that's used
right now is to ask what's the what's
the path that will minimize the power
requirements to send data frames that's
my understanding is that's the one
that's in the laptops that are deployed
right now one optimization is planned
for the future is to also take into
account the remaining battery power of
intermediate laptops yes how is it
determined okay the question is how does
it determine the necessary power well
the topology makes a big difference so
you know the power required to transmit
a radio signal to a specific distance
with a specific
city at that spot goes as the square of
you know the distance right so that's
you know that's that's the biggest
factor yeah so um yeah that's a good are
okay so you transmit at full power I got
that cleared and based on the amount of
noise yeah yeah the so the question is
about how you know how you judge the
distance is how you evaluate what the
power is the of a path is and and I
don't know the exact array use but you
know there was new heuristics for it so
yeah so um see that's basically what I
had to tell you about for the networking
just so I want to close with a little
bit more pointers just more information
first of all I put up the this PDF and
all the information I'm about to tell
you on this red site so at red symbol
net / talks there's a prominent link to
a page for this talk you can look at the
there's an interesting book on this
general topic called wireless develop
I'm sorry wireless networking in the
developing world and it's basically put
together by a group of people that as
far as I can tell they have no
affiliation with the olpc project but
they're interested in bringing a
wireless net access to areas where it's
very challenging to do right now and as
they wrote this book it's you can
download as a free PDF it's about 250
pages it talks about everything from the
physics of radio transmission to you
know the details of networking protocols
including the mesh networks and also i
just want to mention if you want a
longer and deeper version of this talk I
just
our this segment about just on the
networking itself a company called cozy
bit was basically implemented the
hardware to make the networking work and
one of the cofounders of cozy bit Javier
Cardona Kaiba has a white paper and give
a talk on it so it's at that link right
there and if you have any questions that
we're not able to get to today then you
can email me it there or you can post on
the baby piggies a mailing list and I'll
see you Nell reply so I think I'm thanks
so I think I can take a few questions
while it gets ready yes the question is
how do the devices pick a channel for
the mesh that's one of the things that
so there's a way it's done now and
there's the changed ways that its plan
to do in the future and so basically i
believe right now what it does is it
uses a specific go see him over there it
goes to a specific it uses a specific
channel honestly i don't remember i want
to see it uses a specific channel it
yeah yeah that's right yeah 16 and 11
it's it yeah it's you know he's right
yet it's yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's
yeah that's right yeah I uses those
three channels right now and that may
change going forward so oh okay okay
yeah yeah
um let's see I guess you know I've you
know none of us of the head or few of us
have had a laptop for very long I got
mine I think about it like listen two
weeks ago so so far I've just had
trouble connecting with one with a just
forming a simple mesh of two nodes and
they were right by each other I was able
to overcome that and the most part I
haven't had any problems beyond that one
weird thing but what's that one of them
was able to see the other invite as a
friend and the other could not so so
yeah I can't really speak to that
because I I didn't have like a problem
besides that because I that I suspect
that was just like his some artifact you
know and I wasn't in a challenging
terrain I was you know I wasn't doing it
outdoors or something so with large
distances so you have any experience
with that sometimes they can be unkind
no i don't there's yeah they have a you
know a certain you know the server is a
whole different you know that's a school
server and that's a different topic
so please bear with us just a moment
where you get the next one set up you
know it rejected mine as well we're able
to get this what were ya while we're
waiting on that for either myself or for
charge Charles so the question is when
if and when this battery runs out of
juice how easy is it to get a new one
and the answer is it's it's really easy
it's cheap they're like ten dollars I
think that's is that the price yeah
thnkx our price and are you asking
specifically about us in the Western
world as opposed to the children of the
target areas Yeah Yeah right there's a
support system to make sure the kids in
the schools are receiving it will have
it and doesn't you know I I don't
actually yeah I mean I can't imagine
them not making it available to us I
mean if we buy them so and also affected
by the time that becomes an issue I
think like a lot of things that by the
time it becomes an issue they'll have a
solution but before that they just won't
bother I also expect there'll be interim
solutions of people who have in
developing countries four or five
batteries that they swap through for
places that have do not have sufficient
power at the school yap atento
we can we can we can do that or from FLL
spells yes I think you did Charles
didn't you we collaborated I think on a
paint we were playing around with it
right so far we've had intermittent
success with doing collaborations and
sometimes they work and sometimes there
was hunting around frantically for 7
year olds who teaches what to do
yes yeah with somebody like to chat yeah
I think this is a good place for that
so how many people in here have a laptop
children's laptop looks like a pretty
good fraction
yeah yeah yeahs one of the things I'm
kind of surprised doesn't show up in the
press is that it makes a great ebook
reader and it's on par with Amazon's now
look it's a brand new e-book reader well
this works great you turn the display
around and use it as an e-book reader
tends to come with right now the free
access to every Starbucks so I'm not
quite sure why people don't talk about
using it as an e-book reader more and oh
by the way it does something else that's
cool any other questions yep well
basically they're all shipping as wall
plugs to finding that there's power
someplace that the big issue is that a
lot of these schools are wired for one
light per classroom so they'll be sort
of that at lunch everybody has to plug
in their laptop type problem that's
where I think that they will come with
people will start having a couple of
racks of spare batteries to get through
the school day yeah Colin well I haven't
been able to actually purchase it from
its collin de Patinkin something like it
yep putting into it or such you started
a separate company so
oh there's a string it's supposed hmm
okay yeah the wiki says otherwise but
the wiki is frequently wrong let's see
last time I looked it was 10 to 15 to
run and a wider range to charge but I'm
sure it's been changing so anyway power
I'm going to I'm going to tell you what
I know about power and then we'll go to
sugar the the basic design idea for the
laptop besides trying to get it two
hundred dollars which we'll see about in
the next few years is that the poor of
the world have very stringent design
requirements including not depending on
a electric power system being usable by
illiterate people and there are a number
of others that I've written about in
other places and I don't want to take
too much time the point about power is
that you can use essentially any power
source that's capable of charging a
12-volt car battery the standard the
standard storage for most renewable
power systems in the developing world so
that would mean solar wind water ethanol
biodiesel animal power or child power we
would like it to be renewable because we
don't really want to get another billion
people burning coal so now for a
spoonful of sugar which is the whole
idea here that a spoonful of sugar makes
the educate
can go down very smoothly that's me any
particular preference I can be ma
quraían Japanese or Munna in Korean or
mole I in Chinese my Buddhist name and
also the name I use on the wiki which is
why I I put it in this is where we came
from you may remember the hand crank
that unfortunately broke off in a demo
the separate handle us be in the front
speaker arrangement different control
arrangement different a more
conventional keyboard that unfortunately
water and dirt and sand and things could
get into so almost every piece of this
has been changed but the concept is the
same and the one thing about this
picture that is absolutely the same is
the smiles on the faces of those
children Nicholas Negroponte a likes to
say that this is not a laptop project
it's an education project and I think he
would have been done well to call it one
education per child therefore and not
have people keep coming back but you
call it the laptop project the idea is
an educational philosophy of learning by
doing of collaborative discovery that's
called constructivism which I don't
understand where that name comes from
but I don't care it's just a name with
free software free textbooks free
content and i want to emphasize this
you've already seen a little bit in the
mesh networking in the user interface
everything is set up for children to be
able to discover it now there are a few
bits and pieces that you can't there's
certain key combinations that are not at
all obvious that you know maybe a few
hundred or thousand children one would
discover and tell the others but it's
not some but almost everything on this
computer we already have
cases of eight-year-olds nine-year-olds
10 year olds getting hold of one of
these either in country or in give one
get one or somebody bringing one back
from Nigeria cases reported on the
internet cases reported in the press
where you give a child the computer the
child goes away and comes back knowing
how everything works all the programs
not every button but pretty much how it
all works including all the language
lessons that we're going to come to and
when you have multiple laptops
especially when you have one per child
it means that children can work together
at all times they can draw together they
can write together they can browse the
web together there was a question
earlier about the efficiency of mesh
networking when you're browsing the net
together and one laptop can download a
web page and feed it to all the others
in the group this is way more efficient
than if you're trying to download that
many copies of the page through the
bottleneck at the server so there are
some places where this is less efficient
than a conventional network and places
where it's much more efficient we'll
we'll see how that works out but I can't
tell you enough how important it is that
this is about collaborative discovery
and I mean that literally I cannot tell
you enough I'm going to tell you just a
little bit and then we're going to go
take a look at some of it this is an
example of the collaboration where you
see in the upper right what is that 16
children or so clustered around a web
browser and as I say the idea is that
you can download a page once and feed it
to everybody and not download it yay
many times at the same altogether there
are seven or eight children painting
together there's another browser session
with five kids another with two there's
a kid who's writing something and has
opened up to collaboration but nobody's
joined him yet this is the idea of what
we're doing here so
collaboration unfortunately in many
education systems is defined as cheating
and this means really rethinking the
whole way we do education but it's worth
it some of these ideas some of
constructivism and some of the software
come from Alan Kay with the dynabook
concept from the 1970s literally more
than 30 years old now devised at a time
when it costs more than thirty thousand
dollars per seat to do this kind of
computing but the very first personal
computers with the graphical user
interface with the small talk
programming language with
object-oriented programming from xerox
in the mid to late 1970s licensed to the
rest of the world in 81 the best way to
predict the future is to invent it and
I'm with him a hundred percent on that
he also says the best way to predict the
future is to prevent it and that applies
particularly the questions of poverty
Jerome Bruner is one of the intellectual
parents of this project I could go on
for an entire evening just on this one
line but people like Richard Feynman
Nobel laureate in physics who have
gotten on textbook committees for large
school districts people who know
anything about math or physics are
absolutely appalled when when they have
to read these elementary school
textbooks at the number of flat out
mistakes and the number of what can only
be described as lies my favorite lie is
the definition of a variable is a number
that changes numbers don't change the
kids kids cannot wrap their mind you
know I mean some of them will just you
okay yeah we don't care about that we do
the question is what can you do with
them
but some kids get put off and I know
people who were unable to learn algebra
in school for decades they could not
they thought they couldn't do algebra
and when it was explained to them no
that's not what a variable is a variable
basically is a pronoun it can refer to a
different number at different times
we're able to go away and realize that
now now they actually understood all
that stuff they'd been taught and could
do it so that's intellectually honest
and any stage of development Allan K has
examples i can give you many more
examples i can cite all kinds of
educational software and experiments and
stuff about two year olds being taught
to read on a computer about kindergarten
calculus about whatever Bruner is
absolutely correct and I don't have time
to go into it sorry and here's seymour
papert of course we have a subset of
logo called turtle art the book
mindstorms was really one of the first
but it was the first book to explain a
model of teaching computers in the
schools other than like just computer
literacy basic okay I don't have time
for this quote either but it's a good
one this is what we're getting to this
is going to disrupt all the education
systems of all the world this is going
to disrupt all the economies of all the
world this is going to disrupt all the
social orders of all the world there has
never been a technology that promised to
do this for this many billion people
that is to say six and something all of
them there's nothing to compare it with
again I don't have time
yes okay I don't have time for any of
those either now let's see if we can get
this oh if we can get this Mac up here
on the video oh well okay you you work
on that and i'll see about getting out
of here and and over to okay would you
would you help me with a browser or do i
need do I know oh there we go yeah I'm
in windows I've been in windows firefox
all right
host not accessible do we need we need
you need ethernet okay and then we're
going to open a file and then we should
be fun
isn't this fun oh there we go good
that'll be up in a woman let's take a
look this is this set of bookmarks that
you just saw I'm going to hand over and
make available this is 20 some of the
major entry points into the laptop wiki
and dev laptop org for people who want
to understand how sugar works and how
the development process works and where
you can find all the information you
need to get started can you read that
okay good we saw an example of the code
for hello world creates a toolbar finds
it shows it creates a button binds it
shows it okay and since the predefined
class for doing sugar activities already
knows what a toolbar is supposed to do
you get a default toolbar that does
what's expected so you don't have to
know all that fine now you've written
those six lines of code and and the
other bits to import whatever in you
yeah you know all that good now what
well this is where you come to the
activity tutorial which says these are
all the steps that you're going to want
to take I'm not going to tell you all of
them but basically you create certain
directories you create certain files you
refer to some files in other files you
make everything and then you then turn
this into a dot XL bundle which is
basically a zip type file and if you've
done it all right then you'll actually
be able to install this and it'll run as
an activity which means it'll have a
proper toolbar on the screen which means
it'll appear in the donut on the the
watch the desktop for lack of a better
word the icon will display correctly the
menu will appear that that says if you
want to resume or
shut down the program all the things
that are supposed to happen will happen
and then inside it does whatever you
want right so this is straight forward
now Albert colin is working on a sugar
izing system which will take a non
Python program and do much the same to
it that will take care of all the
external linkages all the details of how
to pass command line arguments into the
cup into sugar the way Python expects to
see things ok thank you and in just a
moment we're going to be able to take a
look at some of these things again so so
what oops so the question then is what
would people like to see you can see
pretty much what we have here you know
that's it so I don't want to tell you
what I think you should know I want you
to tell me what do you want what do you
actually want to know any of these
things you want to see or now I'm ready
for questions because basically you've
seen how to write the simplest possible
sugar program and you've seen that there
is a straightforward procedure for
turning it into an XO activity okay you
guys should be ready to roll question
the sugar you're talking about getting
into the code of sugar itself yeah oh
yeah well good good
everything on the XO is clearly a work
in progress and I have to say that I
have to say that I have never been
involved with a project nearly this
productive in either hardware or
software but this is not industrial
development and there are places where
it's it's still a bit rough it also
shows if you look in the bug tracking
system but but it works mostly let's see
oh and we're actually we're actually
setting up to do somebody is setting up
to do automated pie doc builds to go
with the daily builds of the software so
you get a set of documentation that
actually relates to the software you're
running we hope I mean to the extent
that the doc the doc strings are when
you see the problem we have right now
yeah oh yeah but but the source code no
I'm not recommending that anybody reads
the sugar source code unless you want to
help develop sugar but the source code
for the activities like the calculator
is not too dreadful that's it's all it's
all there you know and so you can look
at the entire activity bundle and you
can look at the source code and see what
kind of widgets it needs and what does
what where and how all the Earthman
tickets put together in a calculator
very good right the the problem we have
right now is that development is all
being done by wizards and wizards don't
like to write documentation and there
are people like my limit I'm a I'm a
tech writer and there are a bunch of us
trying to get hold of these people and
trying to get hold of this stuff and
nail it down long enough to actually
write something that would be useful so
these things are on these things are
coming and if anybody is or knows some
good writers send them our way Oh see
next to see the how do you mean you oh
ok I'm going to come back to that this
is a live CD of OLPC software currently
running on an x86 Mac ok so doesn't boot
on everything doesn't boot on my
particular linux computer but it boots
pretty widely
we can be whoever we like so when a when
the laptop boots up the first time first
thing a child sees is enter your name
and of course if this is in first grade
or kindergarten they can't read and
write yet the teacher has to help out a
little second thing is do we like those
colors I don't know do we like those
colors those colors and well lets you
know pick some colors everybody you know
it's up to you I mean no matter what you
do you're going to get some fairly
ghastly colors I have no idea what the
cultural implication of that is but
anyway there we are so that's us so now
is anybody actually not seen the sugar
you I oh well let's do it okay you see
the frame all around everything here and
supposedly we can get rid of this frame
but it's not going away oh there we go
okay here i'm showing you the wireless
neighborhood of this mac which doesn't
have mesh networking hardware and
therefore is all on its lonesome if
anybody would care to look at any of the
other EXO's the actual XO is hanging
about the place you'll see a whole bunch
of google access points you'll see mesh
networking access points you'll see
individual computers all over the room
and you can you know you can experiment
you can come up here and say make
friends with whoever you know mee mo
karai dito whoever is in the room
that means that you would have a
connection that would resume every time
you're both on and yeah I was about to
say that connection then shows up in
other parts of the UI and you can make
use of it so that the people you have
made friends with will appear just those
on the next screen and then it's very
easy to invite them into activities so
again you can't see it right all you
know is that the my icon change size but
my friends would show up here oh they
have to accept it in order for it to be
active yeah I have well it's supposed
it's supposed to be that you you get
prompted somewhere I don't know haven't
been on haven't been on in the presence
of enough other users at the same time
to work out all these details I'm sorry
but anyway so this okay so we have the
the main wireless network off the screen
the local your friends network the
desktop here with the donut that shows
which programs are active and the
journal is always active and finally the
button that's that goes to whatever
program is actually running now if I
come back here and I bring up the the
frame on the bottom then you see all
these activities so now you'll notice
that's the first word you've seen in
this demo well the sea is off the screen
okay
sorry will give you something a little
more usable okay so browse right record
that's a still camera and a video camera
it's built in you can see the little
hole on the side in the white plastic
and paint and various music programming
etoys is squeak which is small talk
turtle art is a subset of logo we have
Pippi so now we have a problem again
because all the text is off the screen
well well we'll still manage okay so I
pick a pic a program you can't see what
I'm doing right and we get code and
unfortunately you can only see a little
bit of it so magic oh well
at any rate we can bring up various
elementary samples of Python code we can
run them in the pain below we can edit
them and run them again kids get to
learn the starting in third grade you
can show them how to change values of
variables by fourth grade you can show
them how to change a little bit of
structure and logic by fifth and sixth
grade they're writing their own this has
been tested out in a number of languages
it's been done in Python in Lisp in logo
in APL and probably even in basic but I
don't have a citation for that the
others I actually know who did it so
this is not the greatest way to
demonstrate all this is it oh well here
this is actually more interesting so now
we have a full multitrack MIDI editor
with a selection of I think 128
instruments I haven't actually counted
them but that's the usual set
instruments from all over the world not
just these Western instruments but a
koto and a didgeridoo in a gamelan and
so forth in another piece of this music
software which they separated out
there's a software synthesizer so you
can make your own instruments and
there's several other functions and
features with this multi track editor
you can for example compose or record a
piece and then turn off one track and
practice just that one line with all the
others playing you can slow it down to
play with it you can transpose it
automatically if you want to play with
an instrument that has a different
natural key you know if you if you
started with flute for example and you
want to play with a b-flat clarinet and
you just drop it down to so all kinds of
goodies and in addition when you're
collaborating each child can have an
instrument that they can play two
octaves on the computer keyboard and
they all here each other
yeah yeah yeah so very low storage
requirement we're not attempting to do
mp3s and Middies are in fact way more
editable and you can change instruments
you can change pitch you can do all
kinds of things with them so it's quite
appropriate now of course as we go on
we're going to see a lot of other stuff
oh yeah and then different international
drum kits right so you know in a few
years we're going to either see the
hundred-dollar computer the $80 computer
the fifty-dollar computer or we're going
to see systems coming out with however
much more power that is per year
something on the the usual order of
thirty five percent or more improvement
every year so let's see calculator no
rpn I was disappointed but that'll come
so sorry sure
so let's see how much well hahaha the
same problem but you can see algebra
trigonometry boolean constants that's PI
an e2 however many digits it supports so
it's an algebraic calculator what am I
looking at and why isn't oh there it is
okay so i click on pie and i say return
and yep there's a valium so uh for for
calculation up through the usual high
school stuff not for algebra and
calculus not for geometry but for all
the ordinary math and the transcendental
functions and anything you would need in
in elementary physics this will do do
the job for you not programmable but yes
okay and an RSS feed and some games and
my favorite the measure activity which
is that you can run a lectric alegna Lin
to the sound port anything that stays
between 0 and 1 volt and you can get a
time domain record of that signal at
audio data sampling rate which i think
is 44,000 something on here so it's a
digital oscilloscope but then you can
also tell it you want to see frequency
domain and it does a fast fourier
transform and there it is and even on
this this TG little slow computer you
really can't see it thinking it just
pops up so um so those are those are the
main pieces of software now i pointed
out that there's very little text in
most of these for
a small talk is an exception it has
something on the order of 20 thousand
strings in in the localization server
for just for small talk which is more
than everything else put together
because there's so much program text
because this is the entire small talk
language the entire IDE and all the
activities that anybody has put together
for education on this computer so yeah
just a moment sorry well let's see you
mean this mini tam-tam jam music
software synthesizer games this is a
memory concentration and this is a four
in a row game okay
wait there was a previous question
whether etoys is small talk yes right go
ahead well how do you like that this
kids good
sorry when I was seeing you have a
physically a patented project and you're
sending this laptop to Nigerian India
help icon is in English and so purely
well you mean Python no putt it depends
what you're talking about Python source
code is going to be largely in a ski but
python is capable of handling Unicode so
we can write these programs to present
the user interface in any language
traditional Chinese CH pie oh yeah
consider well there have been proposals
for full Unicode programming languages
allowing all variables all function
names and all whatever to be arbitrary
Unicode text well the question is the
question is do you want to keep the
reserved words fixed so that you don't
have a problem going from one version to
another and you are not going to run
into any kind of collisions where
somebody who's doing chinese python
decided to use something in English that
they're not going to be allowed to if
the program gets converted do you want
all that purity or do you want the kids
to be able to hack at the pleasure and
deal with the problems as they arise so
yeah there should be there should be
multiple versions there should be a full
Unicode Python that's my point of view
there's plenty of yeah there's plenty of
precedent for this Russian COBOL in the
60s allowed Russian variable names but
used English keywords
excellent I wonder when we can get it on
the laptop haha thank you I walked into
that one next year very good yeah what
else we got Oh turtles boo it's Turtles
all the way up forward right forward huh
yeah yeah sure you go yeah so in fact it
goes forward 200 yeah so okay but the
side of the square is 200 because it's
in two segments of 100 each and your
circle and blah blah and okay spirograph
do a spirograph come on yeah
well you don't get tabs and that sort of
thing it's based on zool runner which
means it's like Mozilla and since you
don't have tabs I suggest opening
multiple instances but unfortunately the
the user interface doesn't tell you what
page it's on when you're in the donut so
it's very difficult to keep track of
your different pages oh yeah oh yeah we
run them my stick is over there we run
tiddlywiki which is entirely JavaScript
yeah there's some there was a discussion
on flash today and the claim is that the
Nash people have broken the last of the
secrets for the Codex this only leaves
patent issues remaining so we'll see I'm
glad you asked that
yes there there are issues take a look
at the track system go to dev laptop org
I'm interested in bug number 40 so very
nice i'm interested in bug number 46 the
one about the Marvel firmware because I
talked to Stallman at the Linux kebab
and he says that's the only impediment
to him fully supporting the project
which I'm you know that's Stallman and
but but he would go around the world and
tell countries to buy this if only we
got rid of that Marvel microkernel sorry
he he has had in he has had an
interesting impact in some countries by
going and telling the whole country that
the government should be using only free
software for reasons of freedom and
security and I don't know how many
countries you know how far he's changed
minds and policies but it it's out there
along with for example the famous
senators letter from Peru to Microsoft
about people know this story no oh yeah
well it's one of those famous stories
unfortunately i can't i can't think of
exactly how you would google it but i
think if you do senator Peru Microsoft
free software it'll come up reasonably
high it's all about how he thought the
country should go to free software again
for reasons of cost freedom and security
because Windows is horribly insecure to
begin with and your data is then locked
up in proprietary formats and you may
never see it again
and the idea of wanting to extract that
much money from your population is
viewed as hostility by a number of
governments yeah yeah you want to get on
the library mailing list oh we already
know there-there's hugely interesting
things you could do which we don't have
enough brainpower and time to do
everything we even know now we need to
do we've got to get the kids on this
we've got to get you know in a year
there will be children who can tell us
really what we should be doing for them
in two or three years there will be
children helping with the open-source
development we already have children
writing their own games educational
games yeah the idea here is to have all
free textbooks all written by the
community yes there's a library can you
go to the browser and get the library up
there's a library of children's picture
books science books literature various
stuff currently available a small
selection built in plus I recommend that
you go to librarian chick org and check
out all the free textbooks there yeah
well we we started with a small
selection and then the question is okay
what textbooks for what subjects in what
languages and so now governments are
talking to their textbook publishers
okay can we have an electronic version
of that book now for these kids
and as far as possible we want to see
free electronic textbooks and then the
step after that is not just the textbook
that exists not just the words and
pictures but a text book that calls on
all the software that's built into the
XO to do your simulations your
demonstrations your animations your
interactive explorations everything we
can think of in that vein yes just open
a fresh browser it's supposed to open at
the library sorry Yvonne kirsta ch yeah
in order of ye up wicked laptop and
talked about the filtering software that
ship with an open source filtering
product basically left up to the local
services decide how
yeah and whether they're happy with the
the open source package or they want to
get their own or whatever they want to
do yeah the there was a lot of fuss from
Nigeria well it's just that it was
reported in the press that some school
children had found pornography on the
web so you know there was a call for
there was a call for filtering and so Oh
starting who's read who's read ender's
game it's disruptive yes
just a sec I couldn't hear you clearly
oh you mean the government's think it's
windows that depends on that depends on
the environment in your country because
if if you put linux in the schools then
the environment in your country will be
Linux yes not not from one laptop per
child but I could point you to several
dozen companies that make other small
laptops or brick computers or embedded
systems of various kinds using linux or
windows ce e or a half dozen other major
small system embedded operating systems
yes the the existence of these markets
is is well known to many and there are a
lot of people who are in a lot of big
companies who are paid to think about
their emerging markets strategy oh yeah
Intel Cisco absolutely Microsoft but but
also cash register companies and
companies what people doing wimax people
doing is peak it's the everybody
everything you can think of that you can
you that you can imagine somebody would
need in a developing country there is
somebody working on a product in a
distribution method to get that out and
in some cases with Wow with insufficient
imagination so there's still a lot of
openings but but yes this is happening
this is this is going to be the the
economic story of the next generation is
these markets growing up at a fantastic
rate
well Microsoft announced something like
a year ago that they were going to put
windows on the machine they announced
over a month ago that they were within
three months of getting XP to boot if
you provided an extra 2g and and
Nicholas Negroponte ease official
expressed attitude to Microsoft is good
luck to him sure the more the merrier he
says you know except when it's Intel
because that they had an agreement that
one laptop per child would get primary
education Intel would go through
secondary and in fact Intel's people
kept trying to sell into primary even in
cases where one laptop per child already
had the contract so that's where all
this fuss that you've heard of about
them breaking up came from of course I
don't know what they thought of well i
guess i dunno i have a vague idea what
they were thinking of they were thinking
of John Negroponte a bringing them
together yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's it's
definitely going to happen no you know
that there's no question that much of
the time you want the children in a
school to be able to connect with the
children in that school when they're in
class when they're doing homework that's
the first line then you need to provide
some way of getting outside your own
school so that schools can collaborate
all over the world preferably
and everybody who is in a position of
authority over children apparently
agrees that you have to control access
in both directions you have to prevent
people getting at the kids you have to
prevent getting the kids getting at
certain kinds of stuff which I don't
agree with that much but really okay but
but it's it's certainly a fact of
existence in this world yeah there's a
lot of thought about this sort of thing
the problem is that that's a developer
issue and not a student issue because
because we can't put the entire source
code on the laptop therefore we we can't
in 1g well and also small talk and also
I don't know what else is on here but
but pretty soon we're going to have sim
city and and pretty soon we're going to
have a sugar izing factory so that any
piece of software that you can get the
rights to you can rap in Python and run
you've heard the term script kiddie
right okay these kids are going to wrap
everything they want in Python and run
it with or without the help of these
advanced tools now what's basically
what's going to happen is the kids are
going to discover the command line
they're going to discover get and
they're going to get their copies of the
of the source to whatever in the usual
way
now as far as forking that the question
is do you want an official fork in a
repository or do you just want something
you can work on okay right well so
you've seen hello world so now if you
can imagine a program that has one
button that says view source but it also
has a little menu that says all the
different programs that are currently
installed which you can ask him about
right so this is not a this is not a
difficult Python programming task and
away you go do it the kids will thank
you yeah we have we have text to speech
there's some applications being written
right now to make use of it most of the
most of the Linux accessibility software
can be can be installed with yum in the
normal manner and I don't know the
details I'm sorry it is possible to turn
this into a blind persons programming
system it is possible to set up sticky
keys and let people type with a mouth
stick if they can't use their hands
normally or don't have hands and and
many other of the usual possibilities
are all there yes there's a whole page
of sugar on different distributions
there or is it there's there's two usual
methods of doing this one is to get an
emulator like Q mu or VMware which is
which is 189 dollars vmware oh you can
set it up in a free player oh goody well
see I didn't know about that okay yeah
VMware they tell me is considerably
easier and more reliable than than
fighting qemu but but it has been done
and the other method is to is to build
sugar on your system which is easy to do
in Red Hat derived systems and difficult
to do in debian derived systems but you
can go look on the wiki and you'll see
that debian and ubuntu and several
others have been done good luck because
your system is a turd and and let's see
oh and the very first encounter I had
with all of this was was with Guido on
the devel list saying that he was
building sugar on on debian at that time
and then a bunch of other people came in
and built on a bun too and so forth ah
yeah well neither did I at the time but
I think we both learned a lot
yeah yeah now I'll go back to what I
said before this stuff is being built by
Wizards who feel that they're in too
much of a hurry to build tools to build
the program's than their and they're
concentrating on building programs we
need the tool builders I generally
consider that being in too much of a
hurry to build tools is a mistake but
that would be an argument for a
different night okay what I can't have
answered all your questions okay so
these are all the current current
questions here's I yes very nice one of
the small talk tutorials what the etoys
tutorials where to start you just you
know you click the door and then you
move the key to the keyhole and now you
can click the door yeah it comes and
goes isn't that nice and and then oh
yeah you have to learn to use the mouse
type buttons what what I think it's it's
option or command click or something
like that try command apple click there
you go you got it you hey it went away
there no press again okay anyway yeah it
can be done even on a Mac but anyway the
point is it's going to teach you all the
handles around small talk type objects
not all of them but it's going to teach
you the resize and the rotate a little
bit and and we all know that there's
also a handle that opens a code viewer
and then you can change the code or
clone it and make a new object and
whatever you like so this is a
is a very powerful environment yet here
you have to make a copy of your key and
so forth and so forth so this is a very
powerful environment pippi for python is
a very mild set of lessons it's just
very simple programs that you can run
and change the text of whereas here
you're actually doing you're doing
objects from the beginning so if anybody
feels like building us a nice python
environment for this sort of thing in
which we can do something like that the
kids well thank you there was a question
earlier about what else is needed and I
can give you a short answer everything
but if you have any more specific
questions about what's needed I'd be
happy to help you with that too you know
we obviously need the usual school
subject so we need math and science and
languages and history and geography I
can't tell you how happy I am at the
thought of something like Google Earth
becoming available to all the school
children of the world where you can zoom
down you know and see the pyramids and
the Sphinx from above or you can go over
to whatever wherever you name it your
favorite part of the world that nobody
else knows about and then you tell them
and then we need we need ideas that
haven't been had yet because we don't
know all the ways that we could make
make standard subjects interactive or
introduce new subjects some of us are
thinking about getting kids together to
plug weather stations into the measure
activity air and water quality type in
Health Statistics I don't know aggregate
this stuff all over all over countries
wherever the laptops are deployed and
send it to professional geography
ographers for cleaning and analysis and
publication back to the country so that
everyone can use
them and we already know the value was
it in the 17th century a statistician
mapped the incidence of cholera in
London and founded it clustered around
one well and when they shut down that
well the epidemic stopped the same kind
of thing can be done with diseases like
malaria and river blindness and AIDS and
what have you that we can find the focal
centers of a lot of these things and
prevent them which is way cheaper than
curing them we can we can find health
problems in rivers and in air pollution
and go back and find the sources and
depending on the political climate we
may or may not be able to do anything
about that in a particular country but
if you have the information you're
better off than if you don't so when I
say everything the the question I I
always like to put two people is what do
you know that the children should know
but don't that their teachers also don't
know please come and tell us about it on
the wiki and and think about how you can
put it into software or text books or
whatever the case might be or just hand
your idea over to someone else who can
run with it ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
