from louie air technology is going to
describe their work in advance
digitization of fine art thank you God
psychotropic my name is Robin eco i am
the CEO of linear technology we are
originally manufacturer of a RGB and G's
high-definition scanning systems and we
sell cameras with a resolution at 240
million pixels and with the geometry
certification of 12 microns for large
format for digitizing archive that was
our former business and we have
customers as the Western Michigan
University is a French lung calistri
cadastre authority or for argv we have
the Library of Congress II when she in
turn the Western Washington State
Archives in Olympia and we deliver some
machines in museums and some newspaper
too and prestigious institution as also
the library of gold the archival canada
in all ottawa and the canto de genève
in Geneva so we sell now service with
totally different over a new technology
with multispectral scania so we scan in
public and private collection with the
highest definition never obtained before
240 million true pixels an accuracy
never obtained never never before with a
special technique
digital public and private collections
with the highest resolution so we come
to museums and wince can with this jumbo
Dukes and jumbo like patented system
camera digital artwork this is the scan
of the la Vida Picasso to the cleveland
museum of art and uses a white true ray
with passing searching time of the
canvas and we share the the light and
the answer of the pigment from UV to
infrared at this definition so we obtain
certain files and that give us by your
construction and resizing and amazing
images with 1.6 gigabytes of data and we
obtain this one with this definition and
because we have measurements and not
just a representation we have also
behind this image the knowledge of this
image with infrared with the same
definition and the state of art or for
the restoration and the cracks and the
varnish and the pigment analyze etc so
this is the most powerful tool for
steady story of art so we can also
browse this kind of images online so i
want to show you know how we made with
bananas are
so we obtained with this camera certain
pictures from UV to infrared sharing the
right all the 40 nanometers we have UV
it is in the invisible here and you have
the infrared here who are also invisible
and we will construct after that the
images to give you the perfect color of
the painting that give you this
resolution so that was the digital scan
of Mona Lisa in the Louvre two years ago
with a research laboratory of French
Musial's and so you have the ability to
see each details and in each pixel's you
have the spectrum of the pigment of the
bind and of the varnish news by the
painter so it is an incredible tool for
knowledge studying reproduction curating
and as you want and it is a measurement
so we can follow the evolution for a
very long time of all the screens and
the print printing process in papers etc
to obtain the graphic gamut the gambit
is a memory you have in your mind of the
perception of the color and we cover
ninety-seven percent of the gamut as lgb
55 lgb is just a representation because
when you digitize something with RGB on
Photoshop after that you ingest the
digitization as you feel at this time
with our measurement never we correct
it's always a scientific measure measure
and we can compare on some basis
paintings so this is Mona Lisa as you
can see her actually in
in behind the glass in the Louvre but
also we have the knowledge of this
painting with all is a rest its
restoration and you can see by this
infrared false color process totally
automatically generated when we
construct the the painting you have the
exact abilities to see the differences
of the pigment this is here as right and
here is lapis lazuli you can see with a
very good precision all the cracks and
all the restoration in in violet you can
see also the underlying under the
infrared here you she has moved her hand
and you can see also a cover apphia
cover she has on her knee I'm sorry I am
unable as the Canadian explained to us I
am unable to tell you that she was
pregnant I don't know it's impossible
for me to give you this information but
why can I what can I do is to to give
you another information very interesting
the true color of malala's are we have
removed the varnish and I will show you
now how from this information we have
removed the varnish from totally
virtually from the painting like that
sorry I have to to find
so the pixel give us on the entire
surface the pics the pigment the bind
and the varnish and we have that on the
entire set of the painting so for this
painting we have 87 million pixels and
in each pixel's we have certain
information we give you the exact
spectrum definition of of the varnish of
the of the painting and the varnish so
we have decided to remove virtually the
varnish by first an aging process with
equivalent varnish used by Leonardo da
Vinci so we age it for 500 century by
you no special treatment and we make
after that with the spectrum of each in
each pixel this is the blue one and the
spectrum of the varnish is a pink one so
we subtract the pink one from the yellow
one mathematically it's not exactly a
simple but you know we obtain the result
of the yellow one and we we verify on
with the spectra the pigment pure
pigment here on the blue light one and
the average of that give you this
information from the original color to
the virtual restoration of Mona Lisa so
what is totally new is that we can make
that for any paintings we have digitized
and this is ultimate the ultimat digital
capture systems for fine arts so now we
can we can see on so expert and actually
the
first report on the news magazine in
France explain to people that now we
have the DNA of any painting we digitize
so here you see we have 18 million
pixels of these informations and each
pixel as this curve and this curve give
you the exact measurement of a painting
for ever so now we we are coming to see
more more paintings this one is from
John James Audubon is from John James
Audubon at the New York Historical
Society so you can see with all the
details of the rail Eagle of the
watercolor acquirers from the John James
Audubon and from with details very
interesting details you know here with
drawing etc so what is able know that we
can browse inside the painting and
online so I can show you more the great
a great from also the New York
Historical Society
I can show you also the famous pink
flamingos at every US family as in at
home I think but this e sorry yeah what
is interesting that we have the true
color and I have never seen in the shop
as a true color and so you you can see
lots of details I can show you now this
one with minardi that gives you lots of
information of a technique with the
verdad show so you can see with this
precision our a stroked with pink
and green you can see also lots of
details in this canvas oil pan de pins
it is a panel it was a little guy here
or some ghosts here both here and you
have also wonderful red and gold details
very difficult to obtain by a simple
argb we can see also this interesting
jour de Latour and what we see from this
painting from the museum of shabu that
we discover with our system some little
mushrooms you know but see
behind the pizza bind and the warnach
was very damaged for the painting so
that was very easy to find and if one
goes yes yes yes this is a luna from
private collection and we can see also
more from here with details this is a
panel from my collection quattrocento
periods of the same age as Mona Lisa and
we can see the first color so all the
restoration and the state of these
paintings painting and also as infrared
in black and white but you know first
caller give you more information because
that give you discrimination so I can
show you also how we unvarnished
painting so this is a panel from a Dutch
painter Islam is a van Dellen and you
have the first color infrared will give
you details of the correction the
paintings at the same time and also we
can simulate the unvarnished painting
before restoration to just evaluate the
restoration and what the work you have
to do to make but you know if you just
see the underdrawing you see details
from the original
I can show you now fragonard this frog
honor is in a family collection in Paris
before to be donated to the Louvre and I
was infrared to I love this painting
because I hid in front of 1800 time in
my life and I've never seen as I so now
I see now you know we've detailed like
here you know the little Neuros of red
here and also details of the on the end
so this is the new way for studying art
we can see modern modern as another one
here with my aunt winnett this is
interesting pastel and the study of this
pastel weaves infrared give you details
of the origin of this pastel and confirm
that from the UV and infrared you have a
difference and the difference reveals
that was the first pastor never made by
decree as the Austrian Court and we know
that the mother of infant Marie
Antoinette are refused the first one
because she considers the first one was
too young so it was not the idea of
fiance that she want good she wanted to
give to the old King of France so the in
fact give you this information you know
you've compared it is not the same
portrait so as I give you all the
identification of the painting and we
have also some interesting discovery a
guy who came with this nice Andre wisdom
EJ in consider after a little study it
was a plumber in the South of France and
loving heart as you and me and I bought
that for I seen 20 or 40 bucks and in
his mind he said perks it is a nice copy
of
Mia who has copied me a and Van Gogh was
on the top list so it's aunt and this
picture a picture to the van Gogh Museum
and of course the van Gogh mizu the Amon
sir no so he came to visitors you said
could you please can this nice painting
because I am sure that times we are we
will discover something so details of
this painting give us some answer here
you have something like me a and if we
have the first color that give you that
creamy yay and the debris Mia is exact
the exact scripture a shin of al gore
and we know that he made this painting
and in the literary mansion that he made
it so the guy now is coming to the van
gogh museum with a perfect file we we
made for him with his brother inside and
with a nice copy printed copy and with
lots of information about the pigment
definition of the painting and of the
varnish so for expertise it is an
incomparable tool lots of nice things I
can show you this one too is supposed to
be one war it was from Van Gogh Joanna's
sister van Gogh sister Joanna collection
but once an expert told the signature
was not from van Gogh so this painting
was sold for over 100 bucks I don't know
where in the in nederland and we we scan
it and the details it's totally
incredible here you know this is a Glenn
knows I don't know the name of a woman
who within the in the country for that
but you know look the detail
also we can scan just a cuales or gosh
this is a Picasso and you have a UV and
infrared with the same the same
knowledge and I can show you more
difficult difficult little panel to to
see it is painting over another painting
with over the other one it's difficult
just by your eye and you can grow inside
this panel and you have the first color
will reveal that the portrait of the
woman is upper the little man and
infrared will give you more information
for the underdrawing and how he made
this painting it is perhaps a Picasso
from the very early period in the Battle
avoir and it is perhaps the sister of
Picasso we can see this amazing chegar
the most difficulty for us is to is to
to scan red because you know towards
could give you the nose of red it is the
main difficulties for photographs and so
here you can see here all the amazing
neurons that this prince of color was
Shagal male and we have also behind that
all the infrared and also study of the
painting
and just for finish
this is a nice konwar you can far will
see to the busy of the orangery and you
have also the first color will give you
lots of information another big one
Anwar where is it
ok
so we are on line two so it is a totally
new because we can share this
information with everybody online and
it's the reason why i'm i'm here because
now now we can have this kind of visit
of museums with this same equity and the
same accuracy and the same definition so
the main difficulties for us is to come
in in museums for digitization and we
have now online from our our website
linear technology cap abilities to go
and two bros exactly with the same
definition that two minutes before and
on my computer so it's very easy it is
actually just for pc and with explorer
and but inside this nice painting you
have details as this signature inside
the body of the central a detail of the
painting so so you can see and consider
that on the world website for us the
analogy with Google Earth is evident we
use the same sensor to capture the image
from the satellite we have the same
approach times the same so that the team
we visited in purdue university we
invented the multispectral scan for just
to see the state of art of the growth a
culture of corn paid and spotted by
Kellogg's so we made them and there was
totally amazed by the results is 0 and
does a they made lots of verification
and to say the you are at the top of
your technology to in front of a canvas
I was last week in Pasadena
of conference of the museum computer
network and I met around 14 museums I
came also to the getty and the studio
department last Monday with the top as a
technique of the technique of
digitization and what they saw and what
you see now has changed our mind now we
have to communism to digitize their
entire collections hanged and stored or
more or less or long period the
difference of the time of the museum and
the time of a museum is not our time
here on our business company the most
difficult difficulties is to take a
painting to n frame it to put it on a
roll and to bring it in front of the
scanner so we want to install in museums
multispectral rooms and in 20 to 40
minutes we will digitize the painting
and we have the equivalent I'm Torah
constrict on our quad computers and we
deliver at the same time this result on
any illuminant you want because the
beauty of that that we have achieved the
dream of Bill Gates we have now the
abilities to put on your wall the exact
color of a painting in under an
illuminant you wish if you want the
illuminant of the of the condo light as
you wanna do so is the painting in this
room or if you want to see that because
you are on bleep and you have trouble
for red and one and and and and green we
can give you this information and give
this informational screen as we want so
the data are store on our server in the
museum for studying with equivalence
with our pigment databases because we
made also lots of research is about
pigments and also to keep the data to be
sure that the data will kept safely and
with always a some scientific protocols
the same scientific protocol so when we
talk with museum or then all explained
to us at the
want to be to make as they did and they
made with Corvus five of six years ago
because quarries were funded by Bill
Gates or just in this goal to put on the
walls a masterpieces of art they want to
keep the copyright of the image and I
understand and he sits to the its I
agree for that because the knowledge of
this image we only we just have this
knowledge not the museum because we have
the equivalence with the pigment
databases so what is important now is
not the image with the knowledge of the
image and we can provide for comparison
studying or producing with the best
quality this image and this that are no
bodies except us can create value from
them what we want to do is to create a
worldwide databases of pigments of the
digital palette of painter around the
world by period will be blue one the
yellow pink one for Picasso etc etc and
we think we can make that in less than
three years after that we will have such
information that six next 20 years will
not suffer to study we for the art
department in universities yes I mean
surely copyright so many things all in
all a woman's my cornea I'm ki explained
for the copyright after you know in fact
actually we have no legal status for
pixel and the knowledge of the pixel we
know for the image but we don't know
behind the image so it's empty we have
to we have to create this new product
for legacy in the end copyright where
you are
we know it like what we want we want to
create a network printer museums to
follow this knowledge and to share this
knowledge with the museum we have in
each painting the DNA of the painting we
have the true of the painting so we can
make lots of profits from this knowledge
and the foreign products from this image
but also from something windows and
exists now identification comparison
epublishing posters insurance
certification ratings for sales etc we
can create first pay-per-view the
perfect pay-per-view system for the
digital image as this definition to
visit virtual exhibition after an event
around the tomorrow new painter you know
you have actually exhibition around the
world three months in Chicago three
months in London three months in Madrid
or in Ottawa and after that you just
have a dirty book with dirty colors to
remember this amazing exhibition imaging
the second life for this exhibition
online with this accuracy paper viewed
you just have to pay and you can go in
the amazing teach a new exhibition da
Vinci exhibition and we can create this
memory we can also from this exact I'll
exhibition create lots of derivate
product posters etc with crematory
certification as the best printed
posters and you can order that on the
illuminant you want it is an occasion to
open the value of such exhibition for
people who can't travel at this time and
we'd appreciate to visit it instead to
other 300 visitors imagine the audience
on the web unknown
for 23 years from china from africa
india or here America for people who
never will go in Chicago encouraged to
visit an exhibition such digitization
should be also decreasing the insurance
rates from shipping be buying better
knowledge of the state of the paintings
I think the main the main the master
word for this knowledge economy is
sharing we have to share we have to
share we have to share and we can
reinvent a new access of for fine arts
and a new way for also sponsoring
exhibition and it's not here i am in the
mecca of the profit by advertising and
is that you i have to explain you that
but imagine a visit of your museum with
all the paintings like like that and
with local advert and you know
publishing advert etc so and we can also
we can also change the manner of
patrolling and exhibition for google it
will be the fair manner to patron i
think a new way for digital arts and for
the knowledge about Fine Arts given
another impression that than you are in
Europe and I think everywhere as a
crypto our predator sometimes sorry if
you listen just the reaction of the
local chairman of the French library etc
uuuu you see that it's very difficult
for them to understand in fact amazing
work you do last week at the MCN
conference you had a session about
Google and the some nails issued from
the museum's collection what a pity to
start to see such distinguished person
arguing on the intellectual property of
a vignette just because they don't
evaluate the share revenues they could
expect it from google
of such as age so I have a dream perhaps
we can create together google art in
three years to sponsor the digitization
of all so much of masterpieces of art in
the storage and on the world of museums
i think is concerned 100 museums and the
price of that the budget of that could
be around 35 to 40 million dollars it is
the price of so very bad Picasso but
from that you could encourage this
innovating vision of studying a picture
of artworks and it is a very profitable
call at term around all derivate
products we don't exist yet but which
will generate revenues and income if you
think to apply the Gold Room the gold
rule in this matter sharing sharing
sharing with all people institutions
museum estate involved in or by the
diffusion of the image and the knowledge
around them it is a reason why all this
legacy problem will be resort because if
you pay if you share you can you can
make large consensus of the diffusion of
the image with lots of security systems
what are marked etc etc we are sharing
the user majority yeah but users income
will be shared
for I resolution if you want to follow
if you want to to use these images for a
university for a peach conference etc
you can pay ten bucks or twenty bucks
for that it is easy and also you can
enter in this knowledge with lots of
adverbs around this event or run this
museum etc you know what is the value
gesture I just want to to open your mind
of some of some new new business
possible look this is a fraggin are what
is the value of the neurons of this
painting for a woman we want to change
our decoration in a flat from this
portrait of fraggin are the yellow for
the chairs the grave of the carpets the
rate from the curtains by just giving to
the veins maker the guy who made the
painting the idea of the nose and on in
lebanon she wish because in fact she
wants this yellow but in the dark room
you know without windows so without her
windows without daylight so she wants
the same neurons with an illusion nom
she will obtain a perfect restitution of
your son Sybil perception of this
artwork and she can pay 50 bucks for
that and it is pure margin what is the
value of the ads around the advert on
this painting or search is automatically
generated by amazon on treating fine
arts or last minute who wants to to
propose the trip to the museum with lots
of Ragnar what is the value of the the
new box like to get ebooks I explain
that to the getty line ice cube eyes
again you can see in the getty you go
inside this little cube and you have a
relaxing massage armchair an ice cream
and you can grow and inside the painting
listening because it is one where the
music of fourier or hovel and have lots
of fun and
and and you know enjoyment just to see
what you have seen in the reality and
you can pay for that five bucks I know
or you can have some more advert around
this consultation yeah yeah what is the
value of a digital station pay-per-view
for our department of library of the
University last year I came to visit the
art department of Stanford and they
explained to me is it was not for for
them just to pay ten thousand dollars
each year to have access to 18th century
painting data banks with such resolution
is not is not wrong for themselves they
think it is interesting to pay for for
this such access of such quality what is
the value of a movie making from one we
can from this data is making one movie
for four with frog about Laguna with two
or three experts every image from this
multispectral scan as a value a
certification a usage to generate income
and pleasure so to build this amazing
project we need a strong partnership the
reason why I'm here is to tell you that
we can together make the best largest
and revolutionary search image portal
for museums collections about ancient
and contemporary artists to become the
real leading basement of history of arts
studies once we will have digitized I've
seen 10,000 paintings it will be very
profitable with your patronage Google
hearts as a veto made that for the big
exhibition in Chicago in Paris but here
on the web it would be very easier and
acceptable by the majority of museums it
would be a perfect answer to those who
claim against Google showing also your
ability to encourage and patron hearts
researches be on image to manage the
knowledge of paintings of their history
to open the mind of people always
constraint actually by poor reproduction
so far from the reality it is now I
think
in the digital age and knowledge economy
absolutely unacceptable the reason why
I'm here also is to find investors so
it's a reason why I come in in the
valley who could easily understand the
development of our project from
acquisition to research is from decision
to creation of value from promotion of a
norm as Dolby for the sound but here we
have thought before the color and we can
make the standard for printing and for
researches and we have the perfect tool
for that and we can also give the rules
for the best definition for screens from
printing and for choosing hings we have
next year order on printing machines
with 4224 ink inject specification to
obtain the best printed and the best
commute the best definition of colors of
the reality we have the supplied the
best digital capture system in the world
of art and for a long time as
measurements we have supplied the
smartest browser on pc for a museum to
communicate merging documents MPEG
pictures like that you know you can put
beside any painting a video very easily
and so we can explain karati I can
explain is a painting just beside the
painting we can merge into this document
with been paying with flings with
comments sounds etc an advert at the
highest definition possible and behind
the painting giving you the invisible
and that is really impressive and this
knowledge passionate people who love her
too just to see behind the painting I
was the painting etc so we have proven
our abilities and we have to deploy our
service
of course we will have new legal statues
of the pixel to argue copyrights are no
not sufficient at the famous picture
agency visited last year in Seattle who
told me corbis sure you change our
business model I answered no I go
further in the limited way of digital
knowledge on scientific basis it is time
to share knowledge outside laboratories
and publication letting ignorant nice
people discovering item or on the fair
market wonderful masterpieces of art as
I shown you two minutes before
it is each week we have requests about
about people and such painting supposed
to be a van Gogh or Picasso showgirl
always recused on the little pictures
without any element of comparison just
by mail to say now no and you have seen
the result we don't want to be expert we
want to deliver the most complete files
to experts increasing their expertise it
is time also online to build the bureau
veritas for picture our artwork you know
the bureau veritas as also the ship
around the world and the boat and they
have a central authorities for that and
insurance company will be very
interested by collecting this
information to with all securities and
confidentially process of course it is
time to to give to our children and
students the exact reason why Renoir
painting without dark and black you know
you don't have dark any dark in this
painting only with blue by letting our
children discovering by themselves this
a new new matter of about Impressionism
they will enjoy in these three
dimensions this incomparable movement of
art in energy story we can now study as
never browsing inside the image and
enjoy with unique pleasure how this
painting was made strokes color palette
of the painter etc on-site and online so
I think after seeing this kind of
painting online you change your mind
when you are entering the new moon in
the museum it is another way for 444 for
understanding and your net physics in
the museum will be more enjoyable
because you will also share this
pleasure with people around you and you
know I think if we we succeed we will
have made something with four Oscars you
know and this is reason why i am happy
to to work in this company what I know
that I will make it I don't know with
authorities or patron but I will make it
and I wish to to create a strong
partnership perhaps with you i hope so
to create this google heart vision from
europe to New York and here to build
something further me further as in the
universal peace full domain beyond all
our difference art so that was that I
wanted to to tell you this morning I'm
sorry because it is not in the group to
French in a good english because i am
french and that's got a way all the time
easy but just a detail this is mona lisa
and we have this problem just by our
software that here
here
this is indeed a you have a minion drop
in your misery giggles ooh orange modern
pigment that you put under the Heron to
avoid the oxy autoxidation okay perhaps
it is a guy the guy was torrents is
painting in 1911 it was a painter and I
think we think that taking the painting
in his heart he had some you know minium
on his coat everything like that so we
have discovered that but you it's
passionate for for for people you know
Mona Lisa is like a goodness in Japan so
imagine the day we will open a website
with bananas are with the Louvre on
pay-per-view we will have great success
so
and also expect importances in this
matter of Mona Lisa are at stake center
Italian from Firenze you feel extra are
