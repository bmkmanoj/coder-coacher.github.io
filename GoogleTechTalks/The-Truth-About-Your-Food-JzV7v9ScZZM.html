dr. T I've met dr. t3 around three
months ago when he came in Palo Alto to
give a talk about nutrition and
functional medicine and other exciting
topics and since then I it helped me to
understand what's happening when eating
all kinds of different foods and helped
me change my diet for the better dr. T
is a board certified nutritionist
nutritionist board-certified in
functional medicine professor of
functional medicine and nutritional
sciences at the university of natural
science natural medicine today he will
help us clear some of the myths about
nutrition so in the first part of the
talk we'll give a general overview and
afterwards we'll have lots of time for
questions dr. T my pleasure to be at the
epicenter of the world as I know it
interesting to see what people here are
using almost everybody uses mcintoshes
so I'm learning from that I know what I
should use are now the topic is
obviously very broad so we will just
give you a few tidbits here and there
tips of the iceberg so that you have
enough time to ask questions the most
important thing is to redefine what
nature is because everybody is trying to
sell your products the products always
have some name attached to them like
natural organic good for you healthy
healthy snacks high protein bars high
protein powders we all want to buy
products that we have been educated or
maybe more accurately brainwashed to
think are good for us and sometimes the
products are nothing more than a
by-product of a different process in the
agribusiness
and commercial food manufacturing
industry they simply try to use things
that are not so good for us give them a
different name or euphemism so that we
will start using them and feel good
about ourselves while enriching their
bank accounts we have to always be
cautious when we hear the word natural
let's analyze what is natural how do we
know when something is natural has
anybody here been foraging out in the
great parts of this city or just going
somewhere in nature and it's something
that grows naturally in the wild some of
you have that's wonderful so you are
beginning to know what natural really
means I'm not saying that all of us
should go there right now and stop
eating at the Google cafeteria
necessarily I'm saying that we should
just be honest with ourselves what does
it really mean to be natural is going to
the cafeteria or to the supermarket or
even to Whole Foods or to an organic
food co-op necessarily a natural
experience let's take for example the
food that are considered truly natural
in the produce department you buy a
cabbage must be really good for us right
or broccoli or cauliflower these are
really good cruciferous vegetables they
contain all type of phytonutrients that
have been proven to help us fend off
cancer and liver conditions and
eliminate toxins and inhibit virus
replication in our body but are they
really natural the way we buy them today
unfortunately they have been hybridized
so much that many of their nutrients are
lacking and we want to believe that they
are good for us and indeed they are they
are among the best that we can find but
even the best
has been adulterated by technology
technology is wonderful on one hand who
better than Google employees would know
that technology is great it communicates
for us it makes a global village and
it's a great way to get information to
the public but information can go both
ways for the better and for the worse
and anybody who wants to sell a product
or service will use this some time it
will be to sell things that are not so
good
but if we look at the best foods like
the cauliflower and the cabbage and we
said even they are lacking in a nutrient
called I 3c indole-3-carbinol a nutrient
that was very very easily found in in
those cruciferous vegetables in the past
but now we can barely find it anymore
and as a result we are susceptible to
various conditions that we were not
susceptible to just 50 years ago or 100
years ago we wonder why we have an
epidemic of cancer of diabetes
cardiovascular disease especially mental
and neurological disorders we have more
Parkinson more Alzheimer emotional
dementia more mood disorders more
schizophrenia bipolar disorders more
people than ever are using antipsychotic
drugs and mood-altering drugs and
learning disorder oriented drugs all of
which have been proven to be
cumulatively toxic to the nervous system
to deliver to the kidneys to our
digestive tract to our immune system yet
we feel like there is no other choice
nobody is telling us that we have other
options the best option is obviously not
to get to that point but to learn what
nature really is what food should really
be like in nature to give us the
necessary nutrients and to avoid giving
ourselves the commonly available or
commonly present toxins
we don't start diverting from Health
deviating from health and going
gradually and slowly and surely towards
disease there are thousands of
scientific articles published about
toxicology about chemistry nobody can
refute that science we won't get into
all the details right now but so many
chemicals so many toxins that accumulate
in our tissues ultimately have an effect
all the heavy metals that we are exposed
to from the environment and from our
food ultimately have an effect on our
neurons they are neurotoxic there are
mutagenic carcinogenic we need to be
aware of this rather than shut up our
own brain and tell ourselves we should
not worry about this because it's too
much to worry about
it is not too much to worry about you
can learn step by step how to avoid most
of the common exposure stress factors
stress factors that alter your
physiology for the worse tonight we will
have a lecture in a smart life forum
where we go in greater depth into some
of those factors that we can modify
fairly easily in our environment and
when I say environment I don't just
refer to pollution of the air and water
and food I'm talking also about the
internal environment of the body the
ecosystem we have within us with our
digestive tract with our brain with our
hormones all of those can be modified
modulated and improved to a more natural
state simply by following some of the
rules of nature and isn't it wonderful
that nature truly has no rules unless we
break them until you start breaking
nature's rule you don't have to know
anything about them he don't need
credentials you don't need to have an MD
DC the ACB and the FBM you don't need to
have all of those credentials behind
your name
all you need to know is is this from
nature is this coming to our mouth to
our nose through our skin in its natural
state if it is and if it's not modified
adulterated emulsified hydrogenated
stored transported hybridized
genetically modified all of those
alteration that are done for the food
industry to extend shelf life if we
understand how those processes alter our
food change our exposure level to
various environmental stress factors as
well and understand how our emotions our
mind affects our hormones and affect how
we interact with the environment with
other people with ourselves and how it
changes our physiology and how our
activities where they are having good
social life good love life having
exposure to the Sun walking a little bit
every day how do those things that in
nature would be taken for granted how
would those things affect your body for
the better
how does elimination of environmental
toxins both from your environment and
from inside your tissues where they have
accumulated for so many years how are
those going to change your health for
the better in a measurable reproducible
fashion guaranteed this is not regular
medicine where you have to tell people
we can't guarantee anything with this
approach of functional medicine which is
based upon thousands of scientifically
published studies and based upon the
textbooks of medical pathology
physiology and biochemistry when you
understand how this is built upon the
rules of nature then you
how easy it is to improve our health
both emotionally physically and socially
and have a better life when I come to
places like this and I travel around the
world lecturing usually we have a lot
more time to get in-depth into various
topics and there are 150 topics we can
lecture about covering every aspect of
health care medicine nutrition when we
do that we try to come together as a
community and give people an opportunity
to have support groups when they change
their lifestyle for the better and
suddenly we see people who never had
energy who couldn't focus and learn and
concentrate who had brain fog regularly
with suddenly see people changing right
in front of us within a matter of days
or weeks when people change the
molecular input into their body their
biochemistry improve improves
drastically and suddenly they have a
reason to smile again I come from
Jerusalem Israel where I had my share of
traumas I've seen a lot of things that
affect a person's health from the
emotional perspective if nothing else of
course also from the physiological and I
saw that people are losing hope they
cannot have peace they cannot have clean
air or clean water and they simply give
up I don't think that this is a wise
eventualities
we don't want to give up many of us are
still young and we want to live life to
full vitality and longevity some of us
have children we want to see them go
grow up healthy we don't want to see the
statistics which say that right now
every child that is born has a 50%
chance of getting cancer within their
lifetime many of them even before they
reach age 20 or 25 many of our
environmental conditions have simply
reached a point of an inevitable
threshold we cross the threshold where
our overall exposure to environmental
stressors like electromagnetic fields
electromagnetic radiation which are
physics related and the solutions come
from physics from science based electric
engineers they come up with the
solutions I have a whole CD on a topic
that explains for two hours some of the
simple one-dollar solutions so that you
can reduce some of your exposure to some
of these electromagnetic phenomena which
have been shown to increase the risk of
various cancers and affect our sleep
capability our overall energy production
our leakiness our tissues become
retaining water fluid because we become
leaky our brain allows toxins to come in
because a blood-brain barrier is also
becoming permeable as a result of these
exposures of course exported to other
types of stress and I know that here
people who work at Google don't have
that much stress in their life you have
a lot of things that are reducing your
stress some of you are smirking don't
really agree with me I guess but I don't
know why it seems like you have a really
nice place here good work environment
but even this work environment might
cause some stress the carpets probably
have some type of chemicals in them that
are coming into the air that you inhale
maybe some formaldehyde some polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and other thing
that are stress factors let's face it we
are exposed but if you give your body a
chance just give you about it 30 hours
every week just when you sleep give your
body a chance to recuperate clean the
air at least in your bedroom eliminate
molds
at least in your home change your diet
at least when you do have control over
it then you go below the threshold again
and you can tolerate a lot more of the
environmental stress that we exposed to
it's not so bad anymore it allows you
some more flexibility and this is a step
by step process it does not have to be
all at once unless you want to you have
support
we have various wellness cheffing
classes we have free teleseminars online
if you go to the truth about your food
calm easy to remember the truth about
your food not my food your food that's
how you remember it the truth about your
food calm there are six teleseminar that
are free to the public
each one is an hour and a half to two
hours covering everything you really
need to know about fats proteins
carbohydrates and sugars processed foods
in great detail that you'd never heard
before I assure you
about supplements the good the bad bad
the ugly about food that you should be
eating what are the top foods to eat
every day every week so that you can
assure yourself of better health when
you address these issues you are
guaranteed improved health I cannot
guarantee that one specific symptom
would go away because that has to be
addressed individually but I can
guarantee that if you do all those
things you will be healthier generally
and you will feel the difference because
nobody will eliminate toxins from his or
her brain and feel worse everybody feels
better when they become cleaner no if
and buts about it
clinically verified proven a hundred
percent of the time take the toxins out
meaningfully in January we will have our
session
a work session like a seminar of four
hours that is dedicated just to how the
body detoxifies the scientific approach
what it really happened in the body and
how we can prepare it for a meaningful
detoxification proactive detoxification
and how we can do this in a period of
about 90 days it takes a long time for
the BI to detoxify a lot of myths about
about detox lots of popular books and
popular website detox in seven days
detox in one day they talked in a month
in six weeks it's not possible those are
all subterfuge designed to sell you
cheap products under the guise of real
detoxification if you understand the
physiology of detoxification you'll see
it cannot happen overnight I think that
accumulating our tissues for years and
years and years cannot be eradicated so
quickly without damaging ourselves the
holistic health movement is sometimes
risky because a lot of holistic
practitioners simply believe everything
they hear that sounds holistic and adopt
it as if it's not evident truth when it
has zero validity on a physiological
basis you have to be careful you have to
be healthy and smart consumers of
holistic medicine just like you are
trying to be smart consumers of
allopathic or drug oriented medicine you
owe it to yourself because today with
the internet anybody can say anything
products can make claims and people can
get away with it but if he does not
stand the test of biochemistry and
physiology it should be suspect because
if somebody makes a claim they'd better
be able to prove it they better be able
to support it with something
not just with one or two stories of
success we all have success stories we
need to have a system that is based on
natural scientific principles that
guarantees a hundred percent of the
people to be improved like I said before
it is not about chasing symptoms it's
about looking for causes for disease the
causes are revealed to us we are the
journals of toxicology of Clinical
Nutrition peer-reviewed scientific
objective studies that are not trying to
sell you anything except for knowledge
information once you have that on your
court on your back yard
nobody could refute anything nobody
could dissuade you to buy something just
because it sounds holistic and many many
holistic health practitioners are at
fault for catering towards this popular
belief that anything that is not drugs
and not surgery is necessarily panacea
it's not true we have even greater
responsibility in holistic medicine to
do good science why when you go to have
a drug therapy you know it's a toxic
chemical when you're going to have
surgery you know how traumatizing it is
for your tissues why would you do that
unless you really are suffering a lot
however when you go to a holistic
practitioner you're looking for wellness
you're looking for improvement of health
you're not always as desperate
that's where damage can be done because
sometimes the treatment is going to
cause more damage than the condition
that you're treating you don't want to
interfere with people's health unless
you can be
sure or certain that you're helping them
whereas if they already suffer a lot you
can justify something aggressive toxic
poisonous and surgical it's justified
it's okay to do that because otherwise
the patient might die or suffer
incredibly then it's okay to poison them
it might save their life but with
holistic medicine you don't have that
leeway you must guarantee that what
you're doing is scientifically proven to
get people's and health on the right
path so they can move them towards
optimal health and wellness and that
means you have to prove that that
therapy is not causing any long-term
damage you can go to a chiropractor two
times a week for the rest of your life
and some chiropractor who is a holistic
practitioner will tell you that by going
twice a week you will improve your
wellness is it really proven no it isn't
there's never been any scientific proof
that having a chiropractic treatment
twice a week for the rest of your life
will do you any good therefore the claim
cannot be made they have been some
scientific studies showing that if you
have an acute trauma and injury Cal Poly
could help for a couple of weeks three
weeks but everybody must make a living
everybody must tell you that you have to
come for more or else they won't be able
to survive that's true for every
profession they are necessary five
percent of the time but they try to take
over the remaining ninety five percent
so they can have livelihood it's typical
for every profession not just for
chiropractic carpenters do a good job
but often time it has to be narrowed
limited this is just an example of how
people make claims about long-term
improvement when they can't make those
claims because there is no science to
prove them
but what if it causes damage what if you
get unstable spinal joints over a long
period of time that means that you
actually have been harmed in the name of
wellness and this is not to be accepted
that's why we need good science to prove
what something is doing or that the
claims are worthwhile in the long run
because we all are searching for health
and wellness long term not just for
removing symptoms today tonight the
smart life forum is at 7 o'clock I
believe if you're interested in knowing
anything about tonight's lecture which
will cover more in-depth functional
medicine and some of the innovations and
lab tests and science that comes with it
combining holistic thinking with
scientific thinking that is the medicine
of the future thousands of doctors are
starting to dabble at it to get involved
with it because it speaks the language
of chemistry and physiology they're
interested in that they want to help
people then sick and tired of seeing the
epidemics of chronic disease increasing
like they have been under the guise of
the healthcare system that is so broken
in our country where medicine is the
most expensive in in this country per
capita than any other country in the
world that we are at the last place in
outcome of all Western modern countries
we spend so much and all that money is
wasted we only get worse we need a
change a real change not just a
make-believe change if you want to have
details about tonight's talk you can ask
Anna who just raised her hand and or you
can go to the website smart life forum
that org and Anna would also be able to
tell you about the detoxification
workshop that we will have in January
when you want to start your
year in a healthy manner clean up clean
up everything that you've done in the
holiday season and don't forget the
truth about your food dot-com and you
can also look at the website eco
pollutant dot-com is in ecological
metropolitan ecological solutions from
metropolitan living right eco pollutant
calm has a lot of information and you
could then see some of the activities
and hopefully become a part of this
health and wellness community that we're
trying to grow around the country and in
other countries as well I will now take
some of your questions because our time
is short any questions
so you you've mentioned that everything
needs to be proven you want to have
scientific backing for everything which
is is great because it's very difficult
to separate the wheat from the chaff in
this area are there scientific measures
of wellness and healthiness that you
refer to as you know benchmarks where
you can say yes we are actually getting
healthier if you follow this and could
you talk a little bit about that yes
very good question there are scientific
measures and they are included in the
array of lab tests available through
functional medicine we can test the
chemistry of your body the metabolic
pathways and products that come out
through the urine in the stool the
microbial environment in your
gastrointestinal tract the level of
heavy metals accumulating in your
tissues etc all those could be
quantified objectified andrey measures
and they are reproducible tests approved
by the American College of pathologists
they're science-based although I have to
also modify your question and say not
everything has to be proven by science
but everything that has a claim attached
to it should many things don't need
claims and science is not everything and
science evolves but if we are making
claims that are going to change people's
behavior lifestyle activity and
nutrition we should provide them with
some scientifically measurable criteria
even if we don't always test for those
things which I mentioned earlier we can
do questionnaires about your symptoms
symptoms surveys they are called they
are commonly used in the scientific
literature how do people feel you think
that it is even one scientific test to
show how people's mood is changing
objectively they don't they only ask
people how do you feel and based on that
let's modify the doors there is not
science there whatsoever
sometimes we have to use these criteria
of how do you feel but if a person who
has been depressed for 20 years and
Stanley is no longer depressed they know
it they don't need scientific proof and
that's fine if we have 20 people like
that out of 20 that is a good outcome
and we can then publish it or simply
discuss it
explore it share it among practitioners
and with the public so people know that
they don't have to be depressed for life
they don't have to have anxiety there
are reasons if you are magnesium
deficient you are inevitably going to
gradually develop anxiety attack panic
attack palpitation why not just take
magnesium which you are deficient in and
suddenly the symptoms disappear how
scientific is that we can make it so or
we don't have to if the person feels
significantly better and if it's
reproducible the important thing is if
you are deficient and most of us are
deficient in magnesium to some extent
what damage have you experienced your
pocket has suffered the loss of a few
dollars because you bought a magnesium
supplement that's it the rest of it is
improved health because you overcome a
deficiency state and magnesium is
important for hundreds of metabolic
pathways and energy production pathways
in ourselves that's based on science
even if it's not clinically proven
necessarily in large double-blind
placebo-controlled randomized studies
but is still science-based because it's
based on biochemistry and physiology
which are irrefutable and it's based on
toxicology which is irrefutable if you
look at the EPA website look at any
website of toxicology environmental
protection companies and so on and to
toxicology journals you see how each and
every one of those toxins is
scientifically proven to be correlated
where their weak correlation or strong
correlation
with numerous chronic disease this
numerous chronic diseases and therefore
eliminating those toxins is a no-brainer
you need to do it even if we can't prove
it your specific symptom comes from that
specific toxin you need to eliminate the
toxin as a side effect you feel better
it's not a great side effect that's what
we should be looking for great healthy
side effect not poisonous effects hi
thanks for coming before you mentioned
that there's some fundamental laws of
nature that we're breaking and that's
ultimately what's causing all this harm
and I know it's a huge topic but without
going into too much detail can you just
name some top laws that we can kind of
walk away with and think about pop laws
of nature first of all I'm just a human
being
Who am I to say what are the top laws of
nature right I can only give you some
ideas based on my experience and my
foraging trips that have done so many
already to find out about nature and
I've studied anthropology quite a lot
especially paleoanthropology to truly
learn what our physiology requires for
health what have we been exposed to as
we have evolved within our given
environment which also mean that our
chemistry and physiology is based on
some common ground those common grounds
are eat unprocessed food for one what is
processed food with a two-hour seminar
what it is but even transportation of
food is processing storage of food is
processing increasing its shelf life and
wrapping it is processing and the
further away it is from its natural
state natural wild state the less
nutrition it provides meaning it is less
nutrient dense and it is potentially
more toxic potentially
so you need to get as close as possible
to the Foods natural look and feel and
as close as possible to where it was
picked from the earth and in its wildest
form the more you go in that direction
the closer you are molecularly
to the number one rule of nature
number two is to arrange your life in a
way that gives you satisfaction identity
and emotional bliss without drugs
without artificial stimulants and other
such street elements that people use
because they are lacking the bliss if
you make the appropriate modification in
your emotional state by processing all
traumas so that you can handle your life
today without guilt and inferiority and
other negative emotions that goes a long
way towards the rules of nature which
include having family units social units
that were intact multi generationally in
one place none of that fragmented family
unit that we have today so that's the
second important rule of nature the
third rule is movement in nature we
would be moving all the time in a
healthy way therefore our joints and
muscles ligaments tendons capsules in
the joint all of our connective tissue
would be active lubricated
nutritionally-rich able to detoxify
through the lymphatic channels and less
likely to be injured today we go from
inactivity to weekend warrior and we get
injured all the time one of the number
one causes for doctor's visit is aches
and pains associated with near
musculoskeletal injuries which lead
inevitably to drug use and we take drugs
for pain
you start fooling around with your
biochemistry poisoning your liver and
your brain I'm going down a torturous
dangerous road so those are very
important three rules of nature another
one is enjoy the Sun the Sun is a part
of nature
and we should not make it our enemy
there are various azen's of studies
about how beneficial sun exposure is to
us nowadays we are so afraid of the Sun
and we are getting the highest number of
skin cancer and skin diseases that we
ever did we should go back to nature and
trust nature more than we trust some
so-called experts who changed their mind
every 10 years and trying to basically
exist and justify their existence so
they keep making up artificial
information that appears like it comes
from expert voice do they really know
better than millions years of nature
millions years of exposure to the Sun of
course be smart about it don't overdo it
protect yourself have a hat but also
enjoy the Sun get some vitamin D while
you're at it or take vitamin D
supplements during the winter because in
this part of the country you will not
make vitamin D for about four months of
the year even more than four months
especially if you have haze or fog which
you this place is notorious for you will
have nots in here okay then this place
is not notorious for it well San
Francisco is okay so you need to make
sure you have enough sun exposure during
the the months that you can actually
manufacture vitamin d but most of you
are deficient people in florida are
deficient so why wouldn't you people in
San Diego are deficient I test them
because they're my patients over there
many of them they are deficient you
would be even more deficient so sun
exposure is important then we came from
the tropics that another rule of nature
humans have developed to Homo sapiens
sapiens
in the East Horn of Africa in the
tropics they had different types of food
exported to the Sun and other elements
than we have today we have to understand
the changes and modify our lifestyle
appropriately so that we are closer to
those conditions even if we don't want
to move to the tropics because the
tropics are not big enough to handle the
entire population at the 26 parallel and
north or south of it all over the world
we have to learn to live where we are
but make the modifications so those are
a few of the rules of nature there are a
few others I hope you're getting
something out of it definitely listen to
the truth about your food come and check
the other resources that we have
available you're welcome
is there a list of primary care doctors
that follow the functional medicine
techniques and also does medical
insurance typically cover you know the
lab reports and and the detox type of
work
first of all they are organizations like
the functional medicine the Institute of
functional medicine IFM and you can
google them funny to say that here you
can google i FM and they have a lot of
doctors who have taken their seminars
they receive continuing medical
education credits for real licensure of
doctors around the country as I said
before thousands and of doctors are
starting to dabble at functional
medicine in the last 15 years but the
IFM is your best resource for some of
those doctors be careful though a lot of
doctors only make heart change in their
practice approach they want to retain
what they have done before so they just
dabble instead of going go full fledge
and therefore you might not get the full
benefit unfortunately you have to do
your own investigation and call the
offices and ask what is the approach are
they trying to keep you as a patient for
a long time are they immediately giving
your hormones as as a therapy which then
requires of you to keep coming back
every few months for prescription or are
they trying to help you learn how to be
as healthy as you can on your own so
that you are not attached to them so you
can lead a healthy lifestyle by yourself
that's what most cost-effective but most
doctors also need to survive so you have
to be cautious and do your investigation
well there are many doctors who are
listed with the IFM and you can search
for functional medicine on the internet
you'll see a lot of doctors who practice
functional medicine to one extent or
another in tonight's lecture I will
expose some of the weaknesses and
problems within functional medicine as
well the problems are not functional
medicine because it's pure with its
intent the problem is how we practice it
humans always spoil good things as you
know in every profession
99% gives the rest bad name you know
that not just lawyers it's true for most
professions so you need to find the ones
who practice a profession in its most
most pristine state whose goal is not to
simply see more and more patients all
the time but to release them from care
so they can become independent with
resources that are allowing them to
maintain their health with support so
the doctor does not see you again again
at exorbitant rates you have to be
careful let the buyer beware and as far
as insurance goes some doctors who use
functional lab tests will bill the
insurance for you and it might be get
covered some of it is so cutting-edge
that insurance is less willing to cover
it but if you have medical savings
accounts cafeteria plans or flex
accounts that you have control over your
in health related expenditure then it
will be almost always covered I hope
that answered your question thank you
for coming I was wondering are there any
genetically modified foods that we
should be cautious of genetically
modified foods should all cause us to be
conscious they aren't any genetically
modified for that we should not worry
about all of them have been genetically
modified therefore we are all animal
experimented with like animals nobody
knows the true effect because they have
not been real long-term studies to show
the outcome of this complete departure
from the natural genomic structure of
the foods we eat
be aware that hybridization is different
hybridize food are not genetically
altered they are not spliced there's
still the result of two plants of the
same family crossed between each other
for improved if we call it improved of
course in quotation feature that will
make those plants more sellable more
attractive more
more juicy not necessarily more
nutritious
that's hybridization but genetically
modifying foods mean that you splice
into the genome some of the DNA of
bacteria of viruses of insects and you
end up with frankenfoods something that
we have never tasted before something
that has different molecular structure
because of the different expression of
the DNA and that can lead to molecular
variations which can trigger allergic
reactions for one that one is already
shown to be the case in clinical
practice a lot of people are developing
more and more allergies to soy product
corn especially because these are so
prevalent in processed foods almost
every day if you eat anything processed
anything packaged there is some soy
and/or corn in it because it's so cheap
to add them to the food and they cause
major damage for numerous reasons I
won't get into right now
but the GMO aspect of it is so prevalent
that inevitably you'll develop some type
of a reaction when I do lab tests for
immune reactivity or sensitivity towards
foods and environmental chemicals and
molds I almost always see that people
who eat soya regularly are reacting
Ameena logically to the soy and to the
corn so those are really important to to
pay attention to as GMOs there are a few
other GMOs that you need to be aware of
like some potatoes and some other seeds
and even things like papaya and some
cherry tomatoes you have to really be
careful some of them you can still get
organic varieties that are original or
heirloom or an GMO food there if they
label them as organic it meant it didn't
genetically modify them but in the case
of corn and soy it's next to impossible
to know because even the organically
grown ones are cross pollinated
with the adjacent fields where GMO has
been planted so by the way I do have a
restaurant in Minneapolis are called the
eco Politan restaurant that's why the
website is eco potent calm and in that
restaurant we have zero soy product and
zero corn product zero gluten zero wheat
and other gluten products and only
natural fruits and sweeteners not even
fruit juice but fruit a sweetener it's
the healthiest restaurant in the country
I recommend you look at some of the
menus and if you sign up for the
newsletter you'll get a whole week of
recipes as a gift and last thing for
today one thing that I do when I travel
and I'll take a couple more questions if
you have any and if the time is allowing
it when I come to every town I also try
to interact with people on an individual
basis and help them in a way that most
people won't be helped the thing that I
cannot do a long distance through the
phone or through the internet I can only
do physically is help people with their
skin people who grow moles on their face
or on their body who have skin tags who
have lesions birthmarks warts on the
mucous membrane or on the skin people
who have things growing next to their
eye on their scalp some of them can be
pre malignant especially if it's around
the face and on the top back of your
hands from excessive sun exposure these
things could lead to the development of
cancer in the skin and I like to remove
them for various reasons which are
listed in this flyer that you have
received it talks about different types
of skin lesions and what causes them
some of them from neurological reasons
irritation some from hormonal causes and
having them removed is not just to
prevent cancer
it is also to prevent neurological
irritation have amazing stories about
patients
that have been treated this way
non-surgically none medically no pain no
risk of infection guaranteed results I
come back here to fulfill this guarantee
every few months and I recommend that if
you do have anything like that rather
than just say well I have to live with
it because no doctor will take it off
because the results will be worse than
the original condition I recommend you
have me at least take a quick look at it
I don't charge to look at people's skin
and tell them if something is risky or
not so they can be safe and avoid seeing
expensive doctors just to have you be
looked at I don't charge to look at
people but if I do remove any skin
lesion there is a charge and it's listed
in here and that is because I do need to
somehow support my nonprofit activities
most of the education is nonprofit and
that way I can support these activities
either way it's very reasonable much
cheaper than surgery and because it
doesn't hurt and doesn't poison and
doesn't cut and doesn't leave scars it's
a no-brainer people love it they are
always happy with the results and I'm
happy to provide them with such
happiness just be aware of that and if
you're interested in that also go to
Anna
she takes appointments as I said just to
look at your skin I will not charge a
penny just for your own safety there's
no reason for people to allow any
negative outcomes to develop in their
skin can be prevented easily and
pain-free no more excuses to wait and
wait and wait until it's too late
so thank you very much do you have time
for another question or no we out of
time thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
