good afternoon everyone and thanks for
joining us I'd like to welcome the team
from Connexions rich Beranek is the
victory cameron professor of electrical
and computer engineering at Rice
University and is the founder of
connections for his research in the area
of digital signal processing he's
received national Young Investigator
awards from the National Science
Foundation and the Office of Naval
Research his his lists and awards are
truly endless Joey King Joey King is the
executive director of connections and
previously he was an investment banker
focused on incubating new technologies
he has extensive background as a
technology entrepreneur and was on the
founding team of f5 networks and sama
networks he was also the senior research
scientist at the human interface
technology lab of the University of
Washington and as a fellow at the
advanced telecommunications Research
Institute in Tokyo he holds a BA with
honors from Southwestern University and
a PhD from the University of Washington
thanks again for joining us I'd like to
quickly remind you that our founders
have have agreed to archive this video
on Google Video so look forward to
seeing it there please join me in
welcoming the team thank you I feel like
a lounge lizard do people mind if I stay
pardon me can everybody hear me okay
okay so I'm rich Beranek thanks very
much for the invitation to be here today
what I'd like to do is talk a little bit
about an education project that we've
been working on at Rice for the last six
years called connections I'd like to
tell you a little bit about where it
came from a little bit about the ideas
behind it and a little bit about the
intellectual property issues and the
technology issues and I'd like to keep
it like super relaxed so feel free to
interrupt me at any time with questions
and about halfway through we can go and
do a little bit of a demo that sound
okay to people okay
I think there's something coming in from
off-site okay so does a jumping-off
point does anybody remember these
anybody have any okay anybody still play
them okay so so one of the ways that I
want you to think about the connections
is start by starting to think about
music and the music industry and what is
it that's so special about music that
allows anyone in the world to be able to
create musical information allows anyone
to be able to rip copy that information
make it their own a lot of people to mix
music together in different ways either
on different compilations or even in
different pieces and allows people to be
able to burn their own music onto
records right either through a record
contract or even just is by themselves
and and the three bottom words are
basically stole appropriated from both
an Apple advertising slogan and a book
by Larry Lessig okay and so the key
thing about this this rip create rip mix
and burn culture is it's create an
incredibly vibrant musical world that's
very interactive where people are
connecting themselves into communities
connecting musical ideas and and
creating music that's completely
innovative and always up to date okay
and the key thing to ask yourself is why
does the same thing not happen with
books okay and educational materials and
course materials okay because I would
argue that the the publishing industry
and the educational industries are
anything but vibrant interactive and
community-based and so really what
Connexions is about is trying to break
through some of the barriers and
allowing people to be able to create rip
mix and burn educational content much in
the same type way that you might imagine
people creating musical content okay and
the key thing about the muse about the
publishing industry is it tends to
disconnect people okay it tends to
disconnect authors from the so-called
users okay and basically what the
publishing process does is it creates a
class of shutouts
right people who are not supposed to
contribute their knowledge back to the
to the world's knowledge Commons if you
will okay K through 12 teachers are not
supposed to become textbook authors
students are not supposed to become
authors and just general readers are not
invited into this author community okay
so generally what we find is that the
current practices of publishing tend to
actually disconnect ideas okay and
disconnect people and it's even worse if
you happen to speak one of these
languages that isn't English right and
and increasingly as more and more people
get on the net around the world fewer
and fewer people are going to have
English as their first language and
they're also being shut out of this
process
okay so Connexions came about six and a
half years ago when I and a number of
other people at Rice University we're
trying to think about these kind of
ideas and we were frustrated right there
was an itch that three itches actually
that needed to be scratched the first
was that the difficulty in connecting
ideas right and in my case as a signal
processing professor showing how math
relates to science relates to
engineering and applications government
policy intellectual property right
showing how ideas are really all
interconnected okay if you're K through
12 teacher grade levels or stove-piped
grade three math when you're in grade
three you're not supposed to be thinking
about grade 4 math right there's this is
this I would argue this as a problem
okay
and even though I come from a university
I would argue that universities are
great places not of integrating
knowledge and information but actually
of disintegrating it putting him into
departments that aren't supposed to talk
to each other and and stovepiping
information okay so this connectivity
was one problem the second problem was
the problem of making it so hard with
the regular chalk and talk lecture type
structure with paper textbooks to be
able to engage students in interactive
exploration because it's really in
exploring ideas and doing things that we
actually learn and that learning is
really reinforced then the final thing
is it's it's it at least then was very
very difficult to build communities
around content I had in my mind this
idea of building a textbook that would
connect like I said math to
science to engineering to to ethics and
and and government there's no way I
could do that on my own I needed to be
able to build a a collaborative
community of people to work on this
content and develop it okay
and as a result of the fact that it's so
hard to build communities around content
it's an absolutely glacial pace to
develop a book has anybody here ever
written the book okay can take three to
five years right from sort of
conceptualizing the book to actually
having it come out in print in the
engineering disciplines science
disciplines think medicine often the
book is out of date by the time it's
actually published okay so these were
the itches that needed to be scratched
and really you can think of connections
as a reaction to this and trying to
create both a technology system and a
community system for people to be able
to create rip mix and burn their
educational content yes sir part of that
I'm gonna address in about five or 10
minutes but this is a this is becoming
increasingly important states across the
United States are spending hundreds of
millions of dollars per year in
textbooks the average Community College
student spends more money on textbooks
than tuition
okay and we're talking about hundreds of
dollars for textbooks let's just give
out an example one hundred and twenty
dollar textbook an author might make
three four dollars from that book
okay so I'll get get back to that later
okay so is everybody with the program
here what we're trying to do okay so
really this is related to this idea of
the open open access movement and the
key thing is that it drives inspiration
from the open source movement so that
the two key ideas behind open source one
modularizing your software so that a
community can work on it a lot of people
and second opening up the intellectual
property so that it's easy for them to
do so we're applying those exact same
ideas to content okay and so here's the
way that you can kind of think of this
think of a sort of thought experiment of
taking every book in the world okay
and imagine ripping the pages out of
every book in the world that would seem
like it's a lot of chaos but imagine if
you could organize these pages and
sort of vast global repository right
that's where all this these ideas are
interconnected where all of the
information is open for anyone to look
at it's free for them to look at it's
free for them to contribute and not only
that the time scale of interaction with
the material from gestation to actual
publishing is on the order of seconds
and not years okay so imagine we could
do this and imagine in addition that we
could bring people into the equation
right grassroots organized bottom-up
communities of people from all around
the world in all of the world's
languages okay so that's really what
what what Connexions is about is trying
to create what we call it a commons or a
knowledge ecosystem okay I think this
would be cool if we could do this right
this is what we're trying to do okay so
really you can think of it as a place
where anyone in the world can can create
rip mix and burn and I mean anyone write
their own educational content okay so
what I'm gonna do is spend about five or
so minutes talking about who's using
connections which is our particular
system then I'll give you demo and then
I'll talk some about some of the bigger
issues sound good people okay so let's
talk about who's creating content so
that here's a group there's a group of
electrical engineering professors from
around the world the people in this
picture from Georgia Tech Ohio State
University Wisconsin Michigan we also
have people at Rice and rice and
Cambridge these are traditional textbook
type authors okay but these are people
who are unhappy with the status quo who
are pooling their efforts to build one
electrical engineering super textbook
that each one of these schools will be
able to customize to their own
curriculum and draw upon and and not
have to reinvent the wheel on writing
these books okay so this is a
traditional class of authors kitty Jones
is from this shut out class okay she's a
private music teacher and mom from
Champaign Urbana Illinois and she
decided a few years ago to start
contributing her music content for kids
to Connexions okay she's one of these
shutouts she's not supposed to be become
an author and if you look just in
December of 2005 her material had
over 600 about 600,000 page views per
month on this music material okay and
getting to your question about the cost
of materials a large share of these are
actually coming from United States K
through 12 institutions because it's the
music curriculum that's the first thing
that tends to get cut out as schools are
cutting budgets across the country okay
so tremendous amount of usage and and
she's again an example of one of these
shutouts
okay what's an example of ripping
content making it your own so there's a
grassroots organized a bunch of graduate
students actually in University of Texas
El Paso who decided that they wanted to
translate a bunch of our engineering
content into Spanish well they call the
project des Spanish within a week of
some of this material going up it became
some of our most popular material and
making large penetration into Latin
America used a Monterrey Tech and a
number of other institutions across
Latin America okay about the same time a
translation organization from Taiwan
call oops and Texas Instruments Japan
started a project that's translating our
connections materials into Japanese
Chinese Thai and a number of other Asian
languages with Vietnamese and Korean
rapidly coming coming on board so the
idea of having content in a myriad
different languages having people be
able to keep the content continuously
up-to-date in in all of these languages
okay the idea of mix is the idea of
being able to generate your own
customized course or your own customized
textbook okay National Instruments is a
company in Austin Texas who are actually
contributing a lot of their technical
training materials to connections and
they're actually building much like the
Adobe Acrobat player allows you to view
PDF files for free and on web pages ni
is actually developing a free lab what's
called LabVIEW player that's going to
allow anyone in the world to be able to
manipulate and play with their really
really interesting simulations that can
be used to teach science and
engineering okay so that's kind of
exciting so they're mixing that stuff in
with our connections content teachers
Without Borders has been involved with
us for about six months they're in 84
countries around the world they do
teacher certification and teacher
training they're going to be putting
their entire repository of teacher
certification materials into connections
and the key thing here is they're gonna
be able to do a localization and
translation of these materials so that
they can be used in all of these
different countries some other people
who are putting content into this
Commons
UC Merced so anybody heard a UC Merced
it's the new University of California
School in the Central Valley there
they've committed to putting much of
their science and engineering curricula
into connections they actually have a
facilitator at UC Merced to develop this
content we're also working closely with
AMD anybody heard of the 50 by 15
project very interesting they aim to
bring 50% of the world interconnective
internet connectivity by 2015 and so
they're basically going into remote
parts of the world bringing Internet
connectivity and also computer hardware
to remote communities and we're
partnering with them to deliver a lot of
educational content we also have a whole
bunch of other projects that you can
read quicker than I can say some of the
more interesting ones we're going to be
developing the top ten community college
courses and connections and a number of
other projects yes sir so I was going to
get to that there one of the projects
that supported by the Hewlett Foundation
and basically you can think of
connections as a logical extension of
the MIT project in that MIT
OpenCourseWare contains only MIT
material whereas in Connexions it's a
global repository where people from all
universities all walks of life are
welcome to contribute
so they're currently focusing primarily
on pushing content into MIT
OpenCourseWare however there are a
number of faculty who are interested in
getting involved there's some very
interesting questions around licensing
intellectual property XML things like
this that I think are gonna become clear
later on but yeah any other questions at
this point
sort of maybe just more interesting ones
that are coming up the government of
Vietnam is going to be deploying
connections across the country to
support engineering and science
education in in that country they want
to use the all the materials in English
but they actually want to link to sort
of cliff notes versions of all of these
materials that are translated into
Vietnamese so that the students can
actually learn in English but they can
have basically materials that help them
learn quicker in their native language
we're also going to be developing a
project in North Korea this sounds
bizarre but there's actually a Pyongyang
University of Science and Technology
that is being developed on a beautiful
campus in downtown Pyongyang North Korea
and we are actually going to be
deploying connections there for
supporting their curriculum and a lot of
that content is actually going to come
from South Korea and I'd be happy to
talk to people about this later okay
Bern so this is where things get kind of
interesting and different from some of
the other open content projects out
there like MIT OpenCourseWare so Bern to
us means the ability to generate a
physical object it means the ability to
generate a CD or a DVD ROM from your
from your your course that you've mixed
together it also means the ability to
make a paper textbook okay from the
material okay and the key thing about
these paper textbooks though is that
they're modularly organized they can be
authored by a community and just drawn
together by the person who wants to make
the book they can be personalized for a
particular class and they can be
completely up to date so you can imagine
a scenario where a community college
instructor on the first day of class
gives their students a test finds out
all the remediation that's necessary for
the class goes in that afternoon pulls
their book together in connection
and has it deliver to the class the next
day bye-bye FedEx okay so I'll hand this
around this is an engineering textbook
you can have a look at it it's got lots
of mathematics in it completely
automatically generated with the table
of contents index and all of that stuff
this is a music book okay similar I'll
just hand these around so if you want to
hold up that engineering textbook for a
second get to the last point here this
was a book that would probably cost
about a hundred and twenty-two dollars
okay in a bookstore today and he guesses
how much that would cost a student
twenty two dollars to the student in
hardback
okay and that twenty two dollars
includes not only profit for the
on-demand publisher is called coop who
is the the on-demand press that that's
making the book but a small
sustainability revenue stream that goes
to connections to sustain the nonprofit
aspect of the project and a revenue
stream that goes into a a pot that
allows anyone in the developing world to
be able to get this book for free okay
so we're kind of excited about this
because basically we believe that this
idea of publishing on demand is going to
change the economics of publishing okay
and and basically what it's going to
lead to is the impending eBay eBay
ization right or disintermediation
cutting out of the middleman of academic
publishing okay
because the only difference between this
122 dollar textbook and a 22 dollar
textbook is a couple dollars to the
author that might get royalties in a
traditional publishing scenario and a
very large profit and costs for the the
academic publisher okay very important
though that there's that we're dealing
with this longtail we're not talking
about publishing Harry Potter books here
right that sell millions and millions of
copies we're talking about small run
books books on hypergeometric partial
differential equations right that might
sell 200 copies that myself 2,000 copies
per year but the key thing is that
there's tremendous area under this curve
right that sustaining
has tremendous sustaining possibilities
for projects like Connexions okay so
we're kind of excited about the the
ability to be able to burn these
contents so currently within Connexions
we have about a hundred and forty-five
courses and as far as usage stats just
going back to January 2006 we were
logging about 16 million hits per month
that's about 500,000 unique visitors
from 157 countries and growing by about
12 percent per month so that just gives
you a sense of the thirst out there for
for free and and and open content okay
so let's talk quick about the enablers
behind this and then I'll give you a
quick demo how am i doing on time yeah
okay so enable us the first is XML how
many people know about XML okay this is
a big difference between us and and
other projects in that Connexions is not
a collection of PDF files that are that
are impossible for somebody to download
and customize it's basically these pages
that we've torn out of these text books
are encapsulated in XML that turns every
page into it so a Lego block right where
the nubs allow us to recombine this
material in myriad different ways okay
so the key thing is we can take that
this ecosystem right all these pages in
their primordial soup state right and we
can organize them into very powerful
learning machines okay and these are
these are learning machines or courses
they're they're web courses there's
they're paper books and these can be
customized for each individual okay so
you can imagine a world nut in the
not-too-distant future where every
person can have their own customized
learning materials and these materials
can be used in many many different ways
if you think of writing a module on how
to invert a matrix right that can be
used in hundreds of different kinds of
courses right not just the one where the
author originally intended it for okay
the other thing that's really neat about
XML is the the power of semantic markup
how many people have heard of things
like math ml okay so the really neat
thing and I'll show you more in the demo
but the cool thing is all the formulas
and connections are encoded in something
called content math ml which means they
actually encode the semantic content of
the formula it's not a picture of math
it's actual math
so in concurred in side.this mathema is
the fact that see that's indexed by this
index and equal sum integral of some
function times a sine wave okay that's
very powerful it means you can cut and
paste formulas from connections into
Mathematica and they work okay so you
can start to manipulate formulae it
means you'll be able to interact and
explore every single formula in in your
science engineering and mathematics book
okay which were pretty excited about
there's also a bit less well developed
but moving along chemistry markup
languages that actually understand how
chemicals are organized musicxml that
that understands how the musical musical
scores are organized okay and this is
this is a tremendously powerful tool for
the future that allows you to be able to
reuse content very easily okay the other
thing that's really powerful about XML
is the fact we have very rich metadata
behind all this data content that allows
us to connect and show the
interconnections between ideas so that
when when you're in a course and the
professor talks about oh you remember la
pete eles rules from connect from from
calculus we're gonna use that now and
basically four-fifths of the class their
eyes glaze over because they forget la
pete eles rule well they'll have right
at their fingertips their links back to
this prerequisite material that might
have forgotten okay and also links links
forward to information about material
that they might be that might excite
them or illustrate the concepts okay
and this is precisely really what was
driving me when i wanted to show how
some of this somewhat seemingly dry
mathematics in the area of signal
processing actually relates right to
tremendous range of different ideas that
are floating out there in the world from
really cool technology to the business
world to government and the intellectual
property world okay the second big
enabler is intellectual property okay
and if you remember back to i started
everything with this analogy with music
right and nobody brought up the fact
that that we can talk about create rip
mix and burn but in fact a lot of that
is illegal right it's called Napster
it's called file-sharing right so it's
critical that
that if we're gonna do this for
educational content we have to get it
right from the start right with the set
things up in a way that it's not illegal
to share all of this content okay so we
have to make content safe to share and
in a sense just like XML gives us a
common vocabulary for how to connect
ideas together we need a common legal
vocabulary for how to share content and
the inspiration here again is back
towards things like the GPL and the BSD
licenses that make open-source software
work okay and we were all ready to
develop our own licenses back in 2000 or
so when we were really happy to learn
about the creative comments how many
people know about the Creative Commons
perfect you might not know that Glenn
Brown is on staff here at Google who was
the first exec 'end executive director
of the Creative Commons okay and the key
thing is is at the bottom of every page
in Connexions every resource or course
in Connexions there's a link that says
that when you click on it tells you
exactly what you're allowed to do right
in fact it tells you that you're allowed
to share this content in many many
different ways as as long as you
attribute the original author okay and
people often ask usually ask before this
point they say well wire authors
actually interested in getting involved
in Connexions in particular if they're
not going to make royalties off their
textbook that would be sold by a
traditional publisher and the key thing
is that if you ask a professor or an
academic why they write at write write
books and course notes they're not
writing it to make money in fact they're
writing it to make an impact and the
critical thing about things like a
Creative Commons license in particular
this attribution license is it it allows
their content to make the broadest
possible impact in the world including
people making textbooks out of their
material people weaving together web
courses out of their material etc okay
and critically behind the Creative
Commons license the easy to read stuff
there's a very carefully crafted legal
verbiage that's being translated and and
and and move to jurisdictions around the
world and this is really taking off so
there's that probably by now over 50
million instantiations of the Creative
Commons license out there in a lot more
than just text
and and and simulations the kind of
things that you would find in
connections also in in in in the video
world and in the music world and this is
a very important movement that I think
we need to that we need to support okay
so maybe at this point I'll move to a
demo any questions at this point yeah so
let me defer that for like five five ten
minutes yeah okay so maybe I'll just hop
over and show some things here just to
give you a feel can everybody hear me
okay I feel like a keyboard player okay
so this is our this is our the
connection site it's at CNX org all of
the content is is freely available for
for anyone in the world to look at in
fact ninety about ninety-five percent of
our hits actually come in from Google
okay so we thank you very much which
somehow we turns out I think due to the
interlinking of the material the fact
that it's so interconnected with each
other and with other web resources
around the world our Google Karma is
really quite high you can click on these
various tabs to learn more we have an
entire suite of open source software the
people are helping us develop from
around the world you can browse through
all of our different content let me just
give you an indication of who out there
is is developing some of our developing
stuff I'll make the font really big and
I'll just sort of scan down here she can
get a sense see this is a critical thing
about Connexions it allows all of these
different institutions right and people
to get involved contributing content
okay and that's something that you're
never going to be able to do from a
institution only open courseware type
site okay so really we intend to be
really cross institutional okay and let
me just let me go in and show that show
you an actual course here okay it's
actually a course on our XML language
called CN XML which is a markup language
it's very similar to just HTML and and
people who know latex but it's very very
easy to easy to use this is a course a
course is just a collection of modules
let's just jump in and have a look at
one of these modules this is a module on
on XML itself sort of being a little bit
self referential here okay so let me
make the font go down a bit so this is
basically looks like a web page what it
is is a very fancy web page that's
encoded in in XML it has all kinds of
information you can learn more about the
content here at the bottom who wrote it
who owns it who is maintaining it
who has the copyright we have a version
control system so like CVS so we keep
every version of this of all the content
in Connexions all the way back through
time this is very useful for both
tracking the changes of content and also
some instructors might want to lock in
at a particular version we can also
easily generate automatically tell
people how to cite this content because
increasingly much like Wikipedia people
are using Connexions content in
scholarly work we also have this idea of
interlinking is very important so here
we have a sort of text-based indication
that this XML basics module is is but
one link in a big vast graph okay and
these are some of the first neighbor
nodes that are linked to this node in
the graph and they're actually they have
metadata associated with them for
example these are all examples of XML
and these are all contains supplemental
information on XML and the key thing is
these can be overridden and customized
by different instructors or authors yes
sir
one points of partners 7 different
elements of the signature with it
oh absolutely so we actually envision
that this that this kind of thing is is
going to actually happen sort of in a
grassroots kind of way that people are
going to take the content and rewrite it
from these different different
perspectives yeah that that's a really
neat point it'd be neat to do some
examples with that yeah yeah and
actually these are freeform sort of
we the author of a module or of a course
can actually customize all of the
information that they want to appear
over there okay we also can pull out of
our repository all of the similar
content related content this is much
like going to the library and you have a
card catalog number pulling out the book
realizing it's not what you want right
but looking or at scanning around on the
shelf to find all the material that's
sort of closely related ok so that's
like this course is using this content
and then finally because it's in XML
it's it's trivial to restyle right
restyle the content to have a different
right look and feel of the content ok
and this is critical let me just bring
up my bookmarks here critical to allow
other people to be able to have sort of
take ownership over the content so for
example when a person is pulling
together a course and teaching a Georgia
Tech they'll be able to have a Georgia
Tech style sheet so even if they're
using my content in their course it'll
have a holistic feel of Georgia Tech
right or of Stanford right so that's
critical to us the ability for
organizations and institutions to be
able to style the content and and and
and and sort of make it make it their
own okay and this is also related to
things like quality control and portals
that I'll get to in a couple minutes ok
any other questions at this point for it
plough on we also have a facility
basically a scale down same scale down
facility that we use to generate the
textbooks that can basically generate a
PD a PDF file of each individual module
for printing
I won't demo that now but you basically
go up here and click print that's
critical I don't know has anybody here
ever printed a webpage have you ever had
problems printing a webpage right the
beautiful thing about this is it
actually generates a equivalent of a
page in a book okay and so maybe at this
point I will ask if there's any other
questions and then maybe I could just
show you quickly how you actually
contribute a module to Connexions yes
sir so so in fact we're developing a
range of tools for the print one is the
idea of completely automatic printing
for basically from XML to a book but the
other possibility is export into any
number of formats like Word format latex
or a PDF so that you can basically
rearrange things however you like yeah
absolutely
in fact those books that you saw right
now were generated XML tool a tech or
tech and then to PDF and print yes sir
so a good point so are the base software
is is an open software package called
zope and plone we are huge fans of both
of those and then Connexions is
basically built on top of those we've
built a lot of extensions and and and
other aspects to them and if you check
out like the software tab all of our
software that we developed is all open
sourced and available and actually being
built in
yeah yeah exactly yeah other questions
yes before concept is formatted what
each year
to say am i doing
right
oh yeah so the question was do we crawl
the web and link to other content that's
so not currently currently we think of
connections as a repository right where
people come to put their content in I
think in the future what we're gonna see
is and it's already starting the
emergence of portals what are called
Hewlett Foundation's very interested
portals where basically they will crawl
the web and then be able to index
material from various opencourseware
sites connections etc okay it could be
in the future the connections also
develops a portal like that but for
right now we're happy to let people like
Google and these other portals help us
index all of this material other
questions so okay so a last little thing
to show you is the idea of how you
develop content and connections because
it's XML and Intel a couple years ago
this was a big barrier to content
creators because we'd say everyone is
welcome to contribute to Connexions as
long as you write in XML okay and
there's really two very important things
that have moved forward in the past
couple years the first is we have just
started beta testing the world's first
WYSIWYG XML open source editor and get
all those in the right order but it's
called Etna and if you go to the
software link you will actually be able
to find it this is something where we're
starting to collaborate with a bunch of
people on and so this will basically be
the equivalent of like a Dreamweaver
type thing for XML editing so we're very
excited about that the other is we have
a Microsoft Word or OpenOffice converter
okay actually it's an OpenOffice
converter Microsoft Word converter so
let's just I'll just show you quickly
how this works so here's a word doc you
see it's pretty simple but it's got a
lot of different stuff in it has some
hyperlinks it's got some pictures some
bullets right this is fairly typical of
a lot of educational type content and
now what I'm going to do is is login
anyone can get an account it's like
getting a gmail account
and in connections we have a number of
different workspaces so first every
individual gets your own workspace where
you can put content right in order to
work on it no one in the world can see
that stuff except you and then we have
collaborative work groups for example if
all of us in this room wanted to get
together form a work group so that we
could have a collaborative workspace
where we could work together that's very
easy to set up very soon we're gonna
have work group forums so it's very easy
to organize sort of groups to work
together on content let's just I'll show
you though right now how we just create
a new module and here you can really see
the sort of plone feel so we're gonna
add a new module to the repository this
is clicking through to basically agree
to the Creative Commons license right
sort of carrots sort of like the site
license aspect and now I just have to
say whether I'm going to use some FML I
might solve this keep that on there and
now all I have to do is give it a title
and
oops okay so now this is basically
tricked me into creating a bunch of
metadata and now the module will be
created it's born it's gonna be blank
and it drops us out into a nice little
editor down below here but I'm just
going to go straight into importing this
word OpenOffice document and basically
all I have to do is browse over to it
the usual kind of thing uploading
something it's like an email attachment
now what it's actually doing is piping
the word doc through OpenOffice
exporting as XML running a parser over
it to convert it into our CN XML it
takes about I don't know 10 seconds or
so here we are and it drops you off into
a little editor that you can edit but
I'll go straight to showing you that in
about two minutes right you were able to
generate write content it figured out
all the sectioning right figured out the
figures hyperlinks and even that table
there at the bottom right so it's it's
it's getting increasingly easy to
contribute material to projects like
connections even in something as
powerful as XML which we're pretty
excited about because this is much more
usable and reusable than anything in in
in in PDF for example okay so let's just
go back talk about the last couple
things start about protecting the
comments okay
so we have a we have an open client
inclusive open contribution policy right
so that means anyone can put things in
to connect in to connections right so
this means there's gonna be all kinds of
stuff in there okay including stuff like
this that took us a while to find which
is in fact a beautiful well okay this is
great stuff it's on lingerie the problem
is is that in fact this all of the
content was actually plagiarized from a
very well-known French hit a historical
journal okay so this was plagiarized
content and not only that when you link
off to the supposed course website it's
this person's lingerie selling web
site right so we have to figure out how
we're gonna deal with content that that
like on the bottom is illegal it's
actually plagiarized or on the top just
merely sort of dodgy right so how are we
gonna do that well the way that this is
done traditionally in the academic world
is there's some kind of peer review
procedure right and this is a very slow
time-consuming process right and the
problem is is that peer review you
pretty much could could easily say at
this point that the traditional academic
peer review system is broken okay it
takes so long to get a paper peer
reviewed traditional academic paper and
out in most journals it's very often the
materials obsolete by the time it
appears in in print okay much like with
print textbooks so what we want is is
some sort of new scheme that's both can
keep the peer review up-to-date but also
be inclusive and scalable that's really
really important so the issue then is
how do we find good content and how do
we direct users to good content Google
is one way certainly right if you google
for it you're gonna find stuff that
Google thinks is good right but then
there's just a question of what is
quality who's going to decide what's
high quality even the lines are blurring
between who is an expert right and
things like Wikipedia and bloggers are
really putting a lot of pressure on both
the the media out there and and and
other types of academic presses okay so
so what are we gonna do so in Connexions
we're developing a social software
approach so we have an idea that we call
lenses and the critical thing of a lens
is that any user can go into the entire
Connexions repository but they can also
go in via a lens for example if someone
types in a search that that via the like
a Google search they're gonna find some
content that rises to the top of the
search and other content that goes to
the bottom of the search so if you will
connect Google is like a lens on
connections but we can have even more
formal lenses for example institutions
that put their content in can
interconnections will be able to have
their own portal for example if there's
a bunch of University of Michigan
content in Connexions you'll be able to
go to UMich see an X org and find all of
the content that univer
Michigan is put in by definition this is
content that the University of Michigan
thinks is good enough right it's good
enough to teach at the University of
Michigan okay
similarly professional organizations
like ACM or the I Triple E could also
get get involved and develop their own
peer-review processes and have these
lenses okay and the inspiration here is
is is is social software ideas like like
delicious delirious Flickr okay and I
think increasingly we're gonna see
things like this even creeping into the
academic space okay any questions about
this peer review idea yeah
absolutely absolutely so a classic
example the University of Cambridge
philosophy department versus the
University of Oxford philosophy
department right yeah two very different
points of view so the key thing here is
that we don't want to exclude either of
those communities from partaking so what
you could have is a a cambridge lens
right so all this content can be in
Connexions but when you go in via this
Cambridge lens you'll see the stuff that
that's their point of view and when you
go in via the Oxford lens you'll see the
stuff that they think is important from
their point of view
okay excellent point so connections is a
little bit like a wiki but different
okay the key thing in connections is
there's a bit more you are
technologically able to edit anything
that anyone has contributed because the
Creative Commons license allows you to
do that but what we do is we put sort of
things in place to try to enforce
collaboration above the kind of wars of
editing over the same piece of content
okay so what you would do in this kit in
that case for example if there was sorry
to pick on Cambridge in Oxford but you
had basically the Oxford people would be
able to fork a new copy of any Cambridge
material and and change it the way that
they think it needs to be changed and
then the Cambridge and Oxford authors
would both be co-authors but the
Cambridge author would be notified of
this and could have their name taken off
automatically if they so wished right
does that kind of make sense so the idea
is try to to create within the software
sort of a schemes to allow to enable
more dialog over the material
and it's a very interesting question and
the it's very well I mean some of this
will take offline after the talk but you
bring ups a lot of really good points
because well I'll just say the last
thing I can say is that all connections
can legally do is take down illegal
content the minute that connection
starts becoming it's a lens for the
entire a gatekeeper for the comments
there's two problems one is totally not
scalable right because we're not like
Wikipedia in that sense and second it
basically changes us from the safe
harbor provisions right as an Internet
service provider makes us liable for the
content so some very interesting tricky
issues around okay so let me just end by
just saying the kind of things that we
have going on right now and then invite
more questions so we're developing a lot
more tools I mentioned already the XML
editor we're also there are people out
there using our the software that drives
connections these customizations of
plone we call that rap dos and you can
go to rap toast org that means to weave
in ancient Greek and there are a number
of people and organizations that are
running our software just as a content
management system we're also developing
tools for translation I don't mean
automatic translation but to enable
easier easier finding materials in
different languages and enabling people
to translate materials really really
easily and keep content up to date once
it's been translated so if the English
version is updated how does the
Hungarian translator know to go update
their material I also already mentioned
about peer review we're building
workflows for that so that organizations
can can basically be building their own
peer review processes within Connexions
we're also developing a distributed
infrastructure so that there's not just
a server farm at currently in Houston at
Rice University but we actually
distribute this repository around the
world we envision in the next year
probably putting up why
a server in Germany and and another one
in Asia and then basically building
things from there so there's some very
interesting issues around distributing a
content management server lots of work
going on in semantics stuff around XML
around semantic search we're gonna have
with already in alpha one of our
collaborators and I UB in Bremen has a
mathema search engine so you'll actually
be able to type in that you're looking
for a certain kind of equation and
you're gonna be able to bring that up
that's that's very exciting I already
mentioned a bunch of content projects
the most exciting content projects right
now are in dynamic content the idea that
since Connexions is a living repository
we're interested in content where people
are actually updating it on the minute
for example imagine an atmospheric
atmospheric sciences textbook where all
the tables right with temperatures and
wind flow patterns are up-to-the-minute
right accurate right as of the minute
that you generate the paper the paper
textbook for print okay and there's a
number of organizations that are
interested in getting involved with that
so I think I will end there and then ask
if there's any last questions and then
if people want to take things offline
yes sir
many others own marketing experts are my
customers
but our life is peaceful and
you
our products
universities such to
okay so that's a great question to
answer the first part your question was
do you see what's going to happen all
these editors what's going to happen to
this educational industry and publishing
industry and is there and and the
broader question is is there going to be
money involved here summer are there
gonna be companies and I think that we
really just have to look over to the
open source world and see that around
the Linux operating system there's been
an entire industry developed right for
example Red Hat right is a company
that's in the business of selling
services around this free open source
software okay for example a lot of
institutions and people don't when they
put Linux on their workstation they
actually pay 99 bucks to Red Hat to put
Linux why do they do that
quality control a 1-800 number when
things break right etc right that's all
it's all on one cd-rom and things like
that so we hypothesized right when we
start a connection six and a half years
ago that if this content Commons was
really viable there would be companies
sprouting up around the outside of it in
fact there already are okay one of them
is is this tremendous resurgence in or
growth in publish on-demand
companies like coop like Lulu press
which incidentally was started by Bob
Young ok have Red Hat okay to to be a
Red Hat for the open content world and
and I see that these editors don't
necessarily have to be put out of
business because I think there's gonna
be a very vibrant industry growing up
around this open content ok so does that
answer the answer the point there are
even for-profit lenses out there check
out faculty of a thousand-dot-com people
pay $29 a month to have a lands on the
internet to find the best most
up-to-date coolest stuff in the BIOS and
medical sciences other questions yeah
okay interesting do we have musicians
and authors of fiction uploading content
we do not I don't think currently we
have any fiction but that's absolutely
possible we've had numerous requests to
people start projects in like recipes
right gardening things that would be
outside of traditional sort of textbook
world as far as music we have a number
of musicians contributing however it
tends to be more on the music theory or
musicology side rather than using
connections to post their music right I
don't think that this is the this is not
iTunes right there are better places I
think to post and organize sort of just
pure musical content that being said
anything that you can do in the web you
can post in Connexions simulations music
videos all things like that there are
already people going to things like
Project Gutenberg and other projects
uploading Shakespeare for example of a
rather large proportion of the text
books that K through 12 institutions buy
are actually in the public domain so
yeah so if you do Shakespeare in our
search bar you'll actually find there's
already some Shakespeare in there yeah
other questions okay so I'd like to
thank everybody and we'll be hanging
around after so if you have any
questions for Joey or for me just feel
free to come bug us and if you have any
ideas on better ways we can harness all
the power behind Google that would be
superb as well thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
