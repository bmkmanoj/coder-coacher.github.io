am L which is the language used by
Google Earth and since the age of about
16 17 or so Nine Inch Nails has been my
favorite band so is very surreal and
strange to open my news reader one
morning and discover that my
professional and personal lives have
intersected and Nine Inch Nails was
syndicating kml so the guys who did this
so jam are here today to kind of tell us
about what's up with that and what they
did and how they did it and I'll hand it
over to Bryan and Craig a good afternoon
and thank you for inviting us to Google
today we are here to discuss Google
Earth Nine Inch Nails and real-time geo
community I am Brian hall I'm Craig
Johnston and once again thank you for
inviting us here we don't usually get
away from our desk very often so we're a
little nervous because we're not use the
same people so anyway it's about a 20
minute presentation we're trying to keep
it simple
first half we're just gonna talk about
some of the concepts behind what we
think visualization is and then a little
bit of our code how we developed what we
developed so we are part of a small
software development company based in
Glendale called Sud Jam and we
specialize in projects for the
entertainment industry primarily and
today we'd like to talk about one of our
special clients band called nationals
we've spent the last two years
developing the official online presence
for Nine Inch Nails otherwise known as
nin.com
nonny's Nails is constantly trying to
augment their creativity with technology
this is aided by the fact that Nine Inch
Nails has an unusually technologically
astute fan base the focus of medCom has
been aggregation insubstantial
subsequent syndication of official and
fan created content examples being
flickering YouTube because of this we
have quite a bit of freedom to
experiment with emerging technology so
to show you how we ended up here talking
to you we'd like to briefly touch on
some of our prior efforts in
visualization particularly with Google
Earth
last year nine inch nails release an
album for free download on the net name
the slip we decided to use Google Earth
to visualize the download data that we
collected and what turned out to be a
fairly dramatic result we use a little
over one point two million download IP
addresses and derive the lat/longs and
mapped them on to 40,000 locations
extruding polygons based by the number
of downloads at each location thanks for
an interesting history Graham our next
effort was to map the lights in the sky
to our data dates and locations to
Google Earth we use KML Network link
feature to pull the server for newer
data and updates to existing data of
course because fans are downloading a
KML file and tour dates change all the
time and there's always new information
a network link was ideal for that
because we could continuously pull the
server and if there was any updates to
that however we had a little bit of an
ulterior motive as well for putting
Network links in and that was this some
weeks prior to the first show fans
noticed a question mark appeared among
the tour data this caused caused quite a
bit of curiosity and discussion and with
that within hours fans had converged
upon the location which is in Griffith
Park in discovered that's me a ticket
hidden in a drainpipe so all right this
is up in Griffith Park and it was hidden
there the night before we put the
question mark and all of a sudden it was
found just immediately afterwards so
every few days another question mark
would appear on the map and almost
immediately a ticket was recovered by a
fan so about a week and a half prior to
the first show we decided to deal all 30
at once and so that created a frenzy of
a conversation online and fans assisting
fans globally and kind of filling up the
the freeways with ninetails fans in the
middle of night looking for all those
tickets so no matter how hard we tried
to hide them they'd still find him we'd
make the longitude/latitude a little bit
blurry so we'd say it was kind of in
this location but give a clue that was
maybe a hundred feet from there and it
still didn't stop them from finding us
so I think there's still one or two
tickets out there somewhere it must have
the way so throughout the course of the
tour also the band would drop question
marks and log the lat/long and so if
you're on the way to see a show you
might find a ticket at a bus stop or
some place along the way so what would
be next to learn in calm community that
would be mobile several months ago we
began the Department of the nin access
iPhone application the intent for this
application was threefold access to
content we wanted to syndicate audio
video and images to iPhone mobile users
access to community we wanted to provide
access to forums and private messaging
to iPhone users and finally location as
content the key feature of Ning access
is the nearby feature which permits
users to originate geotagged messages
and photos all associated with their
Ninh comm accounts so really to us
location as content nearby produces a
new form of content for ENCOM and that
is it lets users textually and visually
use range as a parameter so not just
where something was but how far
something is away from you or from some
particular location so geo tagging adds
an extra dimension to the user
experience and the interaction is
real-time support real-time to support
geo location located events like
concerts shows for this we developed an
INXS iPhone and iPod touch application
this application is best described by
Trent Reznor Kevin Rose and Rob Sheridan
in the following clip from their video
so this is about five minutes from a
clip of a video that was shot up at the
trends house kind of going over the
features of the iPhone app before it was
launched so laughs last half of the
video and it kind of really describes
the phone better than we can
so one of the cool things about the
iPhone is that it has built-in GPS so
that it can instantly get my coordinates
of where I'm at and allow me to have a
conversation with other fans on the site
so on the nearby tab at the bottom if I
hit that it's gonna show me what
conversations are currently going on and
this is kind of globally initially but
if I choose this little everywhere
button right here I can say okay show me
only conversations that are happening
within 2 miles 10 miles 50 miles and
that'll allow me to you know meet other
like-minded fans that are that are on
the system so like for example I can
just like click on this person here I'll
get their icon I find out more stats
about them their age where they're from
and I can decide whether another want to
communicate with them
I think it's cool thing that was like
really when you're doing the live shows
you'll be able to go in and say ok
because the GPS the phone knows I'm at
the live show I can take photos if I do
an impost here so I'll go new click on
the photo and I can choose that I just
want to fire up the camera if I choose
camera now I can take a picture and then
instantly post that up for everyone to
see so to show this in a bit more detail
here you can see all the messages that
have been posted in this case we're
looking at all messages but if you just
want to see anyone local you can change
the filter to say 2 miles and see only
the messages posted within 2 miles of
here that'll be great at concerts and if
you're at a show you can see only people
posting where you are so we'll change it
back to everywhere and here's an
individual message that we can look at
we then have the options to reply send a
private message view this users profile
and you specifically on the map where
the image was posted we do have an
option in here called location fuzziness
which will randomize within a mile at
the location of your message so people
won't see exactly where you're posting
from if that's a concern so
if I post a message on here
and I could include photo if I wanted
but right now I'm just going to post a
message as soon as I post it it'll show
up in here but also it's gonna show up
on our web interface here in Google
Earth and see it automatically moves to
the newest message posted if I click on
this little target it's gonna zoom way
in and show specifically where the
message was and I got batteries
I'll see that a message just came in so
now we've got our side of the globe here
it'll just keep on matically moving
around as new messages come in so being
a lot of the thought that went into this
was not just to be for the people at the
show or the people with iPhones but for
the majority of people that might be out
in the world watching from the web so
let's say that it's Showtime in Los
Angeles and we're playing at the Staples
Center that day before the show we'll
put up a link somewhere on our site now
when you click it will take you to the
show and this will zoom in to where
we're actually playing that day in this
case we're at the Staples Center
what will start to appear then his blips
of people having conversations and
you'll be able to follow from home in
real-time chats and photos coming from
the venue or pineap-- which should be
pretty cool thing and this is great
because however you zoom and whatever
your frame of view is a new earth the
conversation in the left hand side will
adjust so if you wanted Justin either
conversations coming in in your city in
your country in your neighborhood
you can customize that like this is all
done using the Google Earth plug-in
which is a quick free download it runs
right in your browser so you don't need
to run the standalone Google Earth
application so that sums up the feature
set of version 1.0 of our snails
iPhone and I if you want to check out
the entire video and article its on
we're calm so visualization material
Isis is a concept of location is content
of course but mobile puts them on the
planet and visualization adds a
compelling perspective and what better
visit is the visualization tool than
Google Earth where prior to access we
focused on the use of the Google Earth
standalone application using KML driven
pulling Google Earth got even better so
in the Google Earth plug-in once the
Google Earth plug-in was released for PC
as well as Mac really became something
that we could we could use a large
number of the fan bases Mac and so when
one of our concerns was of course if we
put anything out that excludes anybody
we get to hear about it so if this key
this then gave us the ability to drive
new applications by extending the
capabilities of Google Earth of course
with the JavaScript API so it not only
gave us a Google app but allowed us to
extend that app and make a new
application with it
which we've really believe is what 2.0
web 2.0 is about and this was a result
as you can see the Google Earth plug-in
is embedded in the web browser we've
added left pane which presents messages
in orders based on the mode of the
application this is the default mode
which we call Auto and in this mode you
pretty much can watch the earth fly to
the location of the newest message that
arrives and so finally we we get to why
we are here and that's to discuss how we
went about making this app and it was
really simple so hopefully you just
don't we'll see a lot more things out
there utilizing this technology
we were able to use existing then.com
kml services which are pretty much
format agnostic so those are easy to
switch around the description portion of
the kml consisted of HTML payloads and
instead of kml polling we're able to
more directly control the polling of our
servers with javascript for data
services we use a swarm of servers that
make up nin.com which run a PHP based
MVC framework api 10.com is the server
that serves the mobile community it
serves JSON to the phone and serialized
PHP to the nearby service also known as
access n calm the separation between
these two services adds flexibility to
our caching options access Denon comm
consumes serialized PHP in outputs RSS
in KML this also gives a lot of
flexibility or caching Oya allows us to
scale a lot easier to which we'll talk
about at the end so content is HTML
accessed admin.com returns both data as
content and metadata author location and
time the content returned by accessed
and calm is message data and photos or
small pieces of text and photos so given
that nearby as web browser-based HTML
was the natural choice for the content
payload we have tools like jQuery and
CSS which of course allow easy access
and manipulation of HTML so rather than
bring it in a generic format or or some
serialized data structure it was easy to
just bring it as HTML and manipulate it
from there
of course CSS style sheets are used to
manipulate the look and feel the feel so
this is an example of an HTML payload as
you can see we embed Avatar profile and
private message links in with the actual
message content here's some really
simple CSS we can set separate styles
for either the
Google Earth balloon or the left pane
here they're together there's quite a
bit more CSS than that but that's the
gist of it too greater control the
application we drive it using drop dead
tree HUD JavaScript um as opposed to
came out in short the JavaScript directs
the plug-in to load kml records the ID
of the newest placemark and adds data to
the Left panel so for this JavaScript we
like to use the following libraries
jQuery because that's what we use most
most of the time and we our developers
are familiar with it
so of course jQuery UI was used for the
tabs scrolling HTML effects Google Earth
JavaScript API and Google Maps for
location search and the very useful
lat/long js4 javascript do math we
looked at three options for populating
google earth we primarily used a cable
network link heavily in our lights in
the sky and geocaching projects that was
a good solution for kml driven
functionality but lacks the power of
javascript api snoo calls parse camel is
a great synchronous way to construct kml
from within JavaScript or use Ajax to
retrieve kml and send it to google earth
however we ended up using fetch chemo
and we found that was our best option
it's an asynchronous call that takes a
URL to a kml server and gives us back a
parsed object via callback
basically like Google Earth plug-in do
all the work and let us know when it's
done so our main loop is pretty simple
the Java Script uses the Google Earth
API to fetch a load of KML initially
that fetch is a large one I think right
now we're doing a thousand placemarks
initially and then after that we only
ask for the newest messages or anything
newer than a specific ID we have so
Google Earth plug-in hits of support a
URL parses and consumes a return KML
and afterload is complete Google Earth
performs the callback to the JavaScript
passing new KML object to us so very
convenient and it's pretty simple loop
works out well the key Mel's finished
loading callback interrogate the new KML
object storing off the newest ID from
the next call and modally calculates the
distance of the new placemarks from the
current users view using a hammer sign
calculation once complete it populates
the left pane popping off old item to
preserve the Dom so either append if
it's the new messages initial loading or
we prepend of course the message is
coming in so the first so access has to
visualization modes as you've seen auto
is worldwide more passive as the new
messages come in it populates left pane
with them and then flies to the location
of the newest message so if ten messages
come in at once with for instance what
we first launched it there would be
periods where would there be ten
messages in one second and then there'd
be another message every second after
that right now I think there's a message
every minute or two so we expect during
a concert or an event that just probably
gonna be much higher traffic so we get
batches of messages in and then we just
fly to the newest message so browse key
is more control the user and when the
user moves to a specific area on the
globe if we we take the location of that
area and only focus on messages in that
area and new messages coming in on that
area so as you saw in the video Tran
head zoomed in on the Staples Center and
so at that point only new messages
within a five-mile radius of the Staples
Center would show up on the left pane
the initial sort is all the messages
close to closest by their distance and
then after that it's its new messages
within five miles
auto mode is the default mode we disable
user interaction with the Google Earth
plug-in since it's more of a sit back
and watch sort of experience the left
pane is populated with the newest
messages with no regard to range from
current view when new messages arrive
the application flies to the location of
the newest message in the batch so this
is a code snippet on how we use the
Google Earth for auto mode as you can
see we randomized the range tilt and
heading settings in order to add more
visual variety to each location so
rather than just moving from one
location to another we also try to get a
little tilt in there and and also if you
notice if you have use this app clicking
on the same target link will kind of
zoom in zoom you out move you around so
if a lot of if you're zoomed down a lot
of people are communicating in the same
area it gives you this feeling it kind
of hovering around that area browse
modes let's a user take the range in
hover or focus on an area the intent
behind this is to let the user view
chatter and pictures during a show once
the user navigates to a view by moving
the Earth or clicking a special link we
then wait 2 seconds get the current
location resource the collection based
on range and then populate the left pane
with the closest messages as they arrive
new messages are filtered based on
proximity and if within range
they are then added to the left pane
based on a rival timestamp so here's our
real simple simple browser vent on mouse
up the we end up setting a callback in
timeout
in set time I and JavaScript and then
after that when a user when the timer
expires our call checks the time last
browse event if at least two seconds
have passed popular browsers called this
is to avoid sorting and resourcing the
collection as somebody's dragging their
amount
across Googler stand and trying to get
to where they're going
this is a snippet showing how we
register our event handler as you can
see we pass in a reference to the globe
and event type and a callback method in
this case we're associating browse event
listener to the mouse up event
and here's our browser event listener
this is event listener called when the
user releases the mouse after moving the
earth and as you can see we grab the
current time and set call called set
timeout wait two-and-a-half seconds then
call back to populate browse on event
the populate browse on event calculates
adults between the last browse event and
the current time we check to make sure
that this Delta is over two seconds in
the event that another event had arrived
during this timer so and here's pretty
simple code on how to get the viewers
current location on Google Earth so
Colin get latitude get longitude pretty
straightforward
to sort the place marks we simply get a
the collection of features from the from
Google Earth and then we sort using a
standard JavaScript quicksort passing in
our comparator which in this case is
named places comparator and here's our
sort callback places comparator pretty
much a straightforward Hammerstein's
comparison checking the distance of each
place mark to our current view the
populate browse function is used to
populate the left the left panel in
browse mode first we empty the Left
panel and then we run through and grab
the first twenty place marks and extract
the HTML descriptions and attach them to
the Left panel using jQuery and this is
the end result in action as you can see
at the bottom left there's also options
to toggle borders routes and models
there's also a location search which
uses a Google Maps JavaScript API of
course this one's moving a little
quicker than it normally move cell
next steps the nearby application is
still very much much a work in progress
we are aware of and still experimenting
with issues and performance associated
with the Browse JavaScript sort and we
are hoping to speed it up in a
cross-browser compatible way and finally
as mentioned we've had to resort to
polling to gather new messages and into
the Google Earth plug-in from our
servers as any engineer knows polling
with an unbounded audience is
effectively invite inviting the
equivalent of a DDoS the current
architectures allows system mitigate
this risk to various layers of potential
caching and so check out access nin.com
to see it in action and you know the
Google Earth API really did a lot of the
work here for us as you can see the
JavaScript was pretty straightforward
not really much of it really we're
excited to work on any project where we
only have to write a small amount of
code to have a lot of impact and it's
been very very successful with the fans
seem to really like it so we plan on
getting a lot more use out of the Google
Earth plug-in in the future so thanks
and also here are some links to some
articles in case you want to read more
get more about this so thank you
are we planning on generalizing or maybe
even open sourcing the iPhone app I know
that quote I know that has been bounced
around and really the iPhone app is
pretty heavily tied to nin.com and so I
know when a lot of smaller bands say hey
how can we get this app the app really
isn't as useful if you don't already
have nine snails calm the community and
the content so I think that's not off
the table it might be something that
Trent is looking at in the future but I
can't speak for him but it's definitely
something in along the lines of the way
he thinks so at least in some of our
discussions on open source I'd like to
see the whole app run on Android as well
whether or not it's a webpage but I
think there was there's there's a lot of
issues with with formatting web pages
for various devices and I think we
really tried to harness some of the
power of writing a native iPhone
application there are about three or
four interface screens in the iPhone
application that are web pages the
opening screen the media screen and the
nearby messages are actually HTML
rendered but they're circling
he's just like so how do we get the
users location on the website accessed
at noon com we don't so it's a sit back
and watch experience using gears to get
their location I notice in google dot
that Google dot load is it or and some
of the Google API calls there some
geolocation I think that might be
something we we would think about it
have to be a big option I know a lot of
the fans would would probably not be
happy with us if all of a sudden their
location showed up on the map as they
we're hoping to be anonymous so because
it is a site where you log in and you do
have a persona in the user name just to
have your location kind of broadcast out
there would have to be very explicit
what would we like to see from Google
well I don't know we don't have probably
a good answer for that one right now
probably just continue working on the
stability I know that there is some
performance issues on our side and we
you guys have been helpful in giving us
some some hacks around those and we but
we've actually like to publish another
Google geo developers blog entry so
maybe that's that might be where we can
make some suggestions on some things
that we'd like to see why we don't allow
messages to be posted from the web at
well really that comes back to us
looking at mobile as that real world
convergence and we feel there's already
a large online community there's plenty
of ways online to interact with that
community and so because the idea behind
Nine Inch Nails qarnain calm was content
aggregation and syndication that that
mobile was a way to aggregate content
and if you're out there in the real
world with your phone you're gathering
images you're talking about something
hopefully involved with where you're at
and and stamping that content with that
location if you're sitting at home in
front of Google Earth you're at home in
front of Google if you're not out you're
actually using that app so I think that
access Todman calm or the nearby feature
maybe isn't appropriate for use at home
but it's appropriate for viewing that
use at home so I think we're gonna be
able to paly looking at other ways to
utilize Google Earth that's an input
mechanism right now it's definitely to
display that data coming in from the
mobile world
talking about how the bands really been
innovating I'm curious how much of this
I mean this is a great app I'm curious
how much of it was the band coming to
you saying this is sort of our creation
of what we want to do versus the balance
between you guys saying hey this
nice shells is a really unique client
because you know we have always we've
been fans for many many years and we
definitely see see the creative vision
from Trent Reznor and I think that a lot
of this comes out from a mutual trust
and respect that we're out there looking
at the technology and he's got the ideas
and and what brings those two together
is are his art director Rob Sheridan and
we work really really closely with him
so usually what happens is they have a
general idea of what they want to do we
prototype something up they decide if
it's if it wanted if it should go one
way or another so we're kind of working
in collaboration there on those ideas so
it's it's really fun experience working
with Nine Inch Nails and that in that
respect
what can't we do that we think would be
awesome we usually so used to working in
a world where our limitations are
limitation so we usually don't ask those
questions and torture ourselves so I
think that's not something else that we
should probably note and then you know
come up with some suggestion maybe in a
blog article about this because I don't
think it we have anything offhand really
we we kind of get excited about working
around limitations we see a new
technology and so well what the band
clients are we're developers so clients
are always coming at us and saying can
we can we do this and this and this and
all we're always having to come back and
saying well the technology is limited in
this way but of course you can do
anything as long as you have enough time
so we were really happy with the way
this turned out and it was mostly just
on our side performance and making sure
it was a good experience for the user so
there was really wasn't a feature yet
that we had were upset that wasn't there
so I guess we're looking to you guys to
develop new things that we can try not
same here so we'll go back to our we'll
go back to our client and ask them I
know they're always thinking about
things like that so
the total cost to the customer
I have no idea that really were you know
the entire projects given a budget and
basically what ends up happening
especially with the project like this is
a certain a certain amount of the time
allotted to it expands or grows
depending upon how cool it is compared
to the project in general so there were
certain poly areas of the iPhone that we
spent a little less time on to work a
little more on this and vice versa so in
man-hours there was some late night
tweaking on this I don't think I have
filled out my hourly report so but it we
spent probably about probably about 50
hours I would say in just constructing
it and most of that time was was the
first few prototypes experimenting with
it after that it went together really
quick so it was pretty much a day at
work and all debugging yeah from now
crystal stole Keurig action yeah that
side time still occurring so the clocks
not not taking it we have some changes
to make on it so
right now it's it's blackberry and
Android are the two biggest requests and
I know we're seriously looking at both
of those it you know if not the band I
know for us personally we would be
excited to see an Android app we we run
the g1 out of our office so we're
definitely looking at that if not the
whole app then at least nearby the same
thing for blackberry if we ended up if
we end up doing one the the really the
point of the nearby app is to coincide
with the tour that's happening right now
or that's starting up on mate
he's going out on tour with Jane's
Addiction and that's really what this
tool is for to gather all that content
so fans who to you know go out there and
take all the pictures of the show and I
think if we don't jump on something
quick halfway through that tour it's not
going to be as important you have a
bunch of fans with Wi-Fi devices with
speakers any chance of using UDP to
broadcast sound good do we do we want to
use UDP to broadcast sound everyone with
a smartphone in the audience that
wouldn't be my decision that would be
Trent's but I'll run it by
actually we do run we do run copies of
some of our servers on Amazon's ec2
right now and we fire those up if
there's emergency or we get dug
something like that but right now we I
don't think it's not really in our
architecture at the moment but and I
know it's looking at Google's App Engine
something we definitely want to do
always looking for excuses to to check
out new technology and that's something
we really haven't explored the server
resources for the normal amount of
traffic I guess on a day like today
where there's really not much going on I
have been to the site so who knows there
could be some announcement that I'm
gonna have but I think we're running
right now we're running 15 heading
machines and across those I think two of
them right now our database machines and
that it's kind of fluid every now and
then will fire we'll move some resources
around but I guess during usage spikes
we get loads of between 4 and 8 on on
some of the head and machines just from
the cycling of the cache databases
aren't all pretty light they're all
running down at a load of one so we
primarily were on the Linux back-end my
sequel and a PHP MVC framework that we
had put together a few years ago
yeah and if you know yeah are we where
are we getting our inspiration for the
technology and where are we looking to
see what the fans want at least
technically I know I know Trent is
involved in the online community so he's
always saying kind of latest trends and
what's going on and then we are as well
even on the tech side and on the
conceptual side of things but if you
notice nearby looks a lot like Twitter
it looks a lot like a a few of the other
geolocation a messaging system so of
course yes we absolutely get our
inspiration off of off of the trends and
we try to tie those into the community
and so we actually look at where the
community is going at the same time
steer them technically as well so it's
it's it's mutual so we build something
and they force us to make it work for
them so yeah having having the Nine Inch
Nails community online to be able to go
on there anytime and jump in and and see
what's going on and see what is on his
Abaddonn line users are doing at anytime
is really a big help for development
because we can always gauge what people
are getting therefore on the technical
side so
okay thank you that's it thanks
