have Linda Nathan and four of her
students to spend some time with us at
Google I understand it'll be a
presentation I mean a performance it's a
special treat as well as we'll get to
hear about the Boston Arts Academy which
is a very innovative school in boston
and linda has dedicated her life to
education she's found in three different
schools in the boston area done amazing
work there she has a PhD from harvard
and currently lectures at Harvard and
why don't you please give a warm Google
welcome to Linda Nathan so good
afternoon we're all a little overwhelmed
and I just want to acknowledge hi move
yet again for having us he and his wife
Leslie of our hosting us this evening as
well at another mutual friend's home so
I want to just start by asking how many
of you went to public schools good how
many of you went to independent schools
okay how many of you were educated here
in California how many of you were
educated in the United States how many
of you are educated outside of the
United States and one more question how
many of you have children currently in
schools ok so I'm talking about schools
so it's something that we have all
experienced and one of the things that I
get asked when people learn that a high
school principal has written a book is
why on earth would a high school
principal want to write a book and one
of the things I answer is because I had
to I've been in public education for 30
years actually a little more than that
my career actually began out here it
when I was an undergraduate student at
the University of California Berkeley
and I did
some internships in schools in Berkeley
as well as adult education and I felt
about ten years ago that I began to feel
it was very important to tell the story
of both the difficulties and the joys of
being in public education and the title
of the book the hardest questions aren't
on the test is a very purposeful title
because I'm quite frankly very very
scared by the time that we're living in
where everything is being measured by
high-stakes testing and the notion of
creativity and play has sort of become
obsolete part of our vocabulary so we
now talk about kindergarten children
five years old being tested and those
kinds of conversations are conversations
that give me pause but I want to just
tell you a little bit of my background
to give you a sense of who's standing in
front of you I began my teaching career
in my actual career in the San Juan
Puerto Rico public schools as a title
one reading teacher my students were
from urban San Juan and had never seen
the ocean you know where San Juan is
right so it gave me a sense very early
in my career about what questions to
begin asking about how kids experience
school their community and their lives
the notion and none of my kids knew how
to swim so I began to think early in my
career about questions of access and
equity I began in the late 70s in the
Boston Public Schools as a bilingual
teacher in a large middle school and my
students were in the basement all of
them and they were integrated just for a
part of the school day for gym and
sometimes for art but whenever they left
the bilingual wing they would come back
with bruises and sometimes bloody nose
as from fights they had with other kids
in the school and this was supposed to
be a time if any of you know the history
of Boston of racial and ethnic healing
it was right after the court-ordered
desegregation case so we were all
supposed to get along but most of the
teachers that I worked with had never
taught black or brown or bilingual kids
so the idea of coming together as a
whole community was very foreign to them
so I began to think about how is a young
teacher I could have an impact on that
school community and I have a background
in the arts and so the first thing i did
was i began to after school direct plays
for my students my bilingual students
and very soon other students in the
school wanted to be involved and so we
began a bilingual which then became a
trilingual theatre troupe because we had
deaf students so we had spanish-speaking
kids english-speaking kids American Sign
Language kids and then teachers wanted
to get involved in the theatre work so I
began casting teachers on stage and soon
those same students that had gotten
bloody noses and bruises were coming
back to the bilingual wing with their
friends who were african-american white
or Asian and the friendships that
started from their work in the arts
ensemble began transferring to outside
the school wall so I saw very early as a
young teacher that the arts could have a
powerful powerful
were a powerful roadmap to bringing
communities together and helping people
think differently about questions of
race and ethnicity and language and even
social class so when I had the chance to
found the Boston Arts Academy 12 years
ago I was enormously excited by a school
in Boston that could rise above that
same racial misunderstanding and begin
to create a place where kids would
through the arts feel a sense of safety
security and would begin to think of
themselves as being able to truly act on
and in the world as citizens and so the
book tells the stories of those students
of those teachers it raises some
questions that i really hope all of you
would want to ask wherever your own
children your nieces or nephews your
eventual grandchildren friends of your
children would go to school one of the
things that I really believe in a minute
I'll invite the students up to interact
with you a little bit about this is that
every school needs to have an
overarching framework and that's got to
be something you can touch and feel the
minute you walk in Google absolutely has
an overarching framework and we felt it
you don't feel it out on the drive I
have to say you don't feel it outside
similarly in our building you don't feel
it outside we are as close to Fenway
Park as that wall and so we're in a very
interesting neighborhood in Boston and
our building sort of looks like a tanker
ship so you don't from the outside get a
sense of what goes on inside I think
that's the same here but the minute you
walk into this place you get a sense of
the kind of creativity and energy and
when you walk into our school the same
is true so one of the challenges I throw
out to you is when you walk into a
school can you
tell what that overarching framework is
can you tell what that school stands for
and that is different than a school
having a mission or a vision statement
standing for something is what i invite
all schools to think about how you do
that in our school we stand for
something and I'm going to stop here and
I'm going to certainly come back to the
mic afterwards to answer any questions
but at this point i want to ask my
students to come take over and come out
to the floor and i'll just give you a
little context of our school as they're
getting ready our school is about 400
students it's a high school we are a
boston public school students do not pay
tuition they do have to audition in and
the students will certainly talk about
that sixty-seven percent of our kids are
eligible for free and reduced lunch
which is the federal indicator for
poverty 22% are designated special needs
students about nine percent English
language learners and we are extremely
representative of the Boston Public
Schools so I invite the Boston Arts
Academy students to do their
presentation and then we'll all be back
up on stage thank you
you
I
you
so as X approaches I don't get that how
is that so while you come back as the
right side of the arrows going pop that
makes it positive I'm not too happy I
was going down should make it a negative
why are you saying it's positive mr.
Lonergan I really need your help and you
please help whistle on again so once
again I don't understand everybody else
gets it except me am the only person mr.
Lonergan please please help me I really
don't understand mr. lonegan miss nope I
quit fine in that connects oh you're
fine it's brett yeah Oh fine fine ah
what makes us write invented connect
what is the content connect what is the
content own it what are going to be
successful all right what do I me to be
successful only and then okay in fact
ask the question asked in put half
dorset Bruce don't push myself in that
tape rips push yourself what is that
yeah that's the only word that appears
with my mind new but what is that well
that's me only a baby to dance
autonomous well in English ah wondering
if I can push through this struggling
and struggling to pick things up fast
people looking at me wondering what's
good he has your training and why is he
here half my mind is telling me leave
going run leave and don't come back the
other half is saying so I follow the
good idea and water still wondering if I
have what it takes to pass all the tests
under con know who's I connect with my
audience tonight we're connect refine
how I can make my message pony yes onion
are you proud you work on my work this
my so I convey my message yes I can
people the artisan forgot to tell you
but they never really see the work
what's behind it people they will piss
me off why would you look at we need
drying piece of gray and say what is
that what's the point of doing that
people always say that what we try to do
it put whatever is in a head into a
piece of artwork i'm trying to say i
love you with some time to play oh yes
or monologue or song and you don't get
it organs farm on one or so goodbye
perfect beautiful you asked me what is
that what is that what is that what is
it that you to draw oh you dance you
play just sing no really you're an actor
was that really going to help you online
you can swing yourself i'm doing the
part how do you make any money created
sculptures sculptures people don't even
understand can't you do something better
no so we will continue to refine and
then connected home because we know that
is what we need to do to be successful
as artists and scholars and as citizens
everybody my name is Tommy Wilson and I
miss senior instrumentalist
hi my name is Katie furnari i'm a senior
theatre major at Boston Arts cat so
questions what do you want to know about
us what do you want to know about the
school and we're not going home with
those books all the royalties go back to
the school so we hope video by the book
as we have with questions for us any of
the students don't be shy good one
talking to my I'm just wondering who
Canada's performance if you didn't
perform you collaboratively other people
involved well um we first came up with
three ideas talent show tour of the
school and the last one was auditions to
get into the school and we kind of just
incorporated all three with the help of
head theatre director at the school miss
Rodriguez and she kind of put out all
the ideas together and scripted them so
everything was in order
so each of you represents one faction of
the Arts at your high school so I'm
curious as to how often you actually
work together putting your art in two
forms like this well in school we don't
well sometimes we may collaborate as all
mages but most of the time we're
separated in our own mages and their own
studies there are times within our
academic classes that we do come
together and we like focus on different
a different art so for example like last
year we did a project in math where we
did a lighting design project so no
matter what major you are you kind of
stepped into the theater world which is
my department and we went into the black
box and we took a look at you know the
ceiling and the lighting grid and we all
designed our own lighting plots and on a
paper we imagine that we hung our own
lights for whatever we wanted to do so
some kids chose a runway show or some
chose a theater show and each student no
matter what major you are you kind of
learn to the theater world and you kind
of designed your own lighting plot and
everything like that freshman year you
do Africa lives so all may just come
together and you put together whether
it's a dance piece or a performance or
even a song or drawing for representing
a different place in Africa so
could you all tell what we stood for
what do we stand for what's up to we got
owned it what else refine invent kinect
kinect so when i was referencing earlier
that we stand for something and we have
an overarching framework for us Rico is
not a federal racketeering act it is the
habits of the Graduate and when Leslie
was asking do we come together like this
no these students knew they students had
the opportunity to apply to come on this
tour with us and so part of that was
coming up with this piece but certainly
in all of their academic classes they
work across majors but they spend
minimum two and a half hours a day in
their arts major they have a much longer
school day than most traditional schools
and they can certainly tell you what
their schedules are if you're interested
but there was someone over here that had
a question are you integrating the
curriculum across the majors so the
question is how I think the answer is
what are the experiences you've had in
your academic classes using the arts as
the way men enojo Center well last year
yeah we did a project in math and it was
about animation so we drop drew a bunch
of notecards and we had to show how a
parabola moves big and small and so that
was a way that I could use my major
visual arts in my math class another
example of that would be science we did
a project where the whole subject was
looking on the evolution of humans and
we had to create a garage band piece
that explained the evolution of humans
so we do a lot of integrating in the
academics but the objective of the arts
major is that any student who graduates
from the Boston Arts Academy if they
want is competitive to go on to a
professional company or to major in the
arts about forty percent of our students
actually I'm here with my college and
career counselor Cynthia has to major in
the arts and we'll just do a little plug
so you think you can dance right anyone
knows the chose that you think you can
dance the winner is a 2007 graduate from
the boss North Academy so he certainly
is making us all very proud there was
another question I was wondering why you
chose Boston Arts Academy and if you had
you know other high schools in the area
that you could have chose from um I was
lucky enough to go to a school that had
a band i started saxophone in sixth
grade and then most of all the been
players go to be a from mccormick so mba
was on the really school around that I
could go to to continue my music and
evolve um I chose was not scanning me
because when I went to middle school
I've always been like to draw in I
always draw and I asked my teacher which
was the best high school for me to go to
pursue my art and then she said that it
was Boston art academy and then I asked
her if there was another high school
because that was kind of far away from
my house and she said that there was not
other high school that I could go to to
follow art and so that's why I picked
busting our to get me
my decision to big boss not scared me
was totally out of the blue because the
way if you knew me I grew up and turn
that in tomato and I played soccer all
my life and so when I came when I
immigrated into United States and
started going to middle school um that's
all I played I played soccer and so when
the come when we came to high school
there's a school called Boston College
High and its really good especially if
you're a soccer player you can get like
scholarships and so I got a scholarship
there but it was only a fourth of the
tuition and the tuition was thirty
thousand dollars and so my mom was like
I'm sorry I'm picking up the choice and
so one thing that separated ba from
other schools is that you can be
yourself and you can go as an
independent but also have other people
to help you in other schools you try to
be different you try to be someone that
you're not and so that's how I got to
the NBA a and because i had the passion
for dance so i was approached by my
drama teacher in like seventh grade and
she told me what do you think for high
school there's a school called Boston
Arts Academy should really audition for
it and I was like oh no only in 7th
grade I'm not even thinking about that
and then when eighth grade came along I
auditioned well we didn't find out till
like it was like really like late march
or beginning april so i had to put a
deposit down for a trinity catholic high
school I didn't really want to go there
but I didn't know if I'd get in or not
and then I got in and I I was really
excited to be able to go to school that
has not only just the academics but
really specializes in the arts because
that was always just an after-school
thing at my other school but it was
something that I could really grow and
learn and develop within here at the
Boston Arts Academy
so I strongly identified with your with
the ownership and pride in ownership of
what you're doing because i work in open
source and the pride in ownership is a
reflection of how you work in that space
and what you sort of share with other
people so how do you guys value the
other three components that you put
their I mean how do you what makes those
special to you is argue do those not are
they the same all three of them or all
four of those attributes I most value
probably refined and invent because
especially as a theater major we're
constantly thinking we're constantly
being creative constantly coming up with
ideas and how to improve our work and
same with in your academics there's
always a way to make your work better
and refine especially last week working
on my to theater monologues which are
we're presenting next week is I
presented them on monday I was half off
book I was sitting there with my script
reading it to the class and I was told i
told the teacher said I'm just exploring
I'm still very new to I monologues I
went home 'over the the next day I
studied them for an hour and a half I
went in wednesday and i perform these
two monologues and everybody's like you
did such a good job and i was so proud
of myself because i was like one and a
half hours sitting at home in my room
working on my art brought me from monday
to wednesday to a whole nother level
from where I was so we're finding
because I can always make them better
and inventing because sitting in my room
I was collecting ideas and thoughts and
movements and levels and all these new
nuances for my monologues I take to
heart all the elements of Rico but when
one part of me co that stands out to me
like Katie said is we find because as a
dancer you have to learn how to be fine
if we find you work if you fall you get
back up you don't walk off and be mean
with it um so we find is
thing in my life even in academics if
you have an essay and if the vocabulary
is wrong you teach it might say oh can
you find that you say sure I'd find it
and you give a hundred percent on that
we find paper I would say refine and
connect because in visual arts you
always have something new to make up in
to make it better if you make a drawing
you must stop you race you do it again
until you get it better and connect i
would say because visual arts always um
try to make up a word that people and
the audience can connect with like I
said on the play because it's hard when
you do a a piece of artwork that you are
the only one that understands it and you
are the only one that knows what the
point of doing it is so I think that
connect is really important for me to
put into my work so that people can
connect with something they saw before
or their neighborhoods or their family
culture any single little thing that
people can connect with what I do to me
the biggest Rico would be invent because
as a saxophonist we're always creating
new lines always trying to create things
that will make people look at us and wow
he's really good and did I use this
instrument as I see it as a tool and my
way to express myself to the audience
how many of you know John Coltrane or
Charlie Parker they are really good and
they use their instrument or two or
whatever you want to call it to express
themselves and sing really it's not like
they're playing they're singing to the
audience so invent would be really
important to me because creating that
those lines and that's that's home would
make the audience look at me like wow
he's really good
so the the arts all all of your
disciplines are really about
communicating to an audience presenting
something making some kind of you know
you're basically showing something
someone there they're watching it or
listening to it and so that's a one
element of Connect is connecting with
your audience but also another element
of connection is working with other
people collaborating in a group and
learning from each other and I would
like you to comment a little bit about
how how your interactions in the school
satisfy your need to connect socially
with other people I feel I feel that a
lot of us we come to the school for art
and what we have passion to do and we
all connect on that same level whereas
other schools everybody connects either
the basketball players stick with the
basketball players or the soccer players
stick with the soccer players and
everybody is on the same level a baa and
when somebody needs help we all
understand that and we all help each
other out and everything so it's pretty
it's pretty cool you have something to
say
but yeah being the one thing that really
brings all together and we have this
strong bond is our passion for the Arts
so no matter what everybody kind of
looks out for each other and everybody
kind of keeps an eye on each other to
make sure that everybody's doing well
especially within each of our arts we
have what we call an ensemble so I'm not
just a theater major I'm a member of an
ensemble who's like my family so if one
person struggling we all help them or
we're all struggling with them and we're
right there beside them to help them in
whatever they need so if somebody has a
problem we're all there for them to talk
to you if I have a problem I know that
the other people that I can go to and we
always help each other whether it's
within our major or seen or monologue or
in an academic class like with my math
homework
so this is maybe more of a question for
the principal than the students I mean
some of you have mentioned how you feel
like the arts really bring you together
and I I know I'm coming from a strong
music background myself in high school
and college I felt like it was always
really easy to generate an automatic
community around you know your choir
your band or different those those
groups you were involved in but I never
I didn't find that those communities
grew up as easily around English or you
know european history or statistics and
so I'm curious you know if you have
tried to kind of implement this
framework in a standard academic high
school you know and if that's been
successful in any insights that you have
on that topic so the question of how do
you sort of do this in a standard
classroom and my easy answer to that is
without being disrespectful I think
those standard classrooms are broken and
I think that we need to really be
reinventing how we think about education
and connecting to who our kids are so
when joseline talked about doing
animation in math class that is the way
i believe math class should be taught
that you need to bring in kinesthetic
learning emotional learning physical you
know you name it we can no longer just
have teacher teach at the blackboard or
the smart board or whatever you want to
call it and not connect with who you all
are so we work very hard in our academic
classes to have them be very relevant
and relevant does not need to be soft to
who our students earn to their to their
lives and their required as in all of
their academic classes to work together
in teams they can't graduate from the
school and no one has experienced this
quite yet the two seniors are about to
go into it our hardest some
if you can believe it is second semester
senior year because we don't believe
there should be a minute of time wasted
in high school and too many high school
students you get into college you're
done you can't graduate from our school
without getting to a certain level in
humanities for which is our english in
history last year and they will have to
work across teams to accomplish that
they're all scared and their grade will
depend on their team so we've really
taken this notion of connection and
collaboration to being a requirement for
graduation there are too many high
schools in the country that makes second
semester be that tough I would argue
every high school should make sort it
should only be a three-year thing you
know I have this ridiculous second
semester but our students are so ready
for college once they finish that so I
appreciate your question are there other
questions or we can certainly so I went
to a fairly small high school in my area
in Los Angeles there's only three grades
only a little less than 3,000 people and
I'm wondering how would this model work
how might you think it would work with
an order of magnitude more students yeah
three or four thousand your four great
right yeah I'm pretty rigid that way I
don't think particularly urban kids need
connection need relationships and you
could certainly have a campus of 3,000
we were just on a campus of that large
this morning in Oakland but there were
four separate schools on that campus I
think young people primarily need
relationships and guess what so two
adults so you know our faculty has to be
able even though we're 60 strong to be
able to sit in a room like
this and debate and discuss and I think
when you get as big as 3,000 kids just
get lost unless you can have smoke
Learning Communities or small schools
within that I don't know i mean could
you imagine the arts academy at 3,000 no
because you wouldn't know your teachers
you know i mean that's that's the real
dilemma that i think we've because of
efficiency of space we've let our high
schools be way way too big and i think
we need to get it back down listen we
want to thank you you guys have been
terrific we're not leaving we'll hang
around we'll sell books we'll chat but
thank you so much for being such a
wonderful audience for us thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
