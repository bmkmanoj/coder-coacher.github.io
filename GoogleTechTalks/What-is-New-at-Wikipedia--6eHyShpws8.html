that my very biased opinion wikipedia is
the best thing that ever happened to the
web and lots of thing i've been on the
web since the beginning lots of good
things happen to the web the other hand
wikipedia could be the worst thing that
happened to the web but if we consider
that as a solved problem done let's go
and do something else and so we have
today three people who are probably
doing more than anybody else to make
sure that doesn't happen and so I wanna
introduce Eric Muller actually I had a
little of dilemma because I'm email Eric
sent me he listed himself as the vp of
engineering of the wikimedia foundation
and when i was writing the announcement
before I got the email i was looking at
another reliable source that listed him
as the deputy director of the wikimedia
foundation and that reliable source was
wikipedia and so now now i have a
dilemma should I believe him or should I
believe Wikipedia I think that's a
dilemma that many people face every day
and I think we'll be good you can talk
about that many other things so Eric
Miller hi thanks for having me thanks
for the introduction hoodie actually
both a true so Wikipedia is still
accurate I'm the deputy director and vp
of engineering at Wikimedia Foundation
at with me today Rob on piano leader
Sharma who are going to be joining me
for a part of this presentation I rob is
director of platform engineering and
LEDs tractor features engineering so two
very important areas at the wikimedia
foundation so just as a quick background
in case it's not entirely and blatantly
obvious wikimedia foundation is in fact
the only organization that operates
wikipedia it's a nonprofit organization
it's based in san francisco and it has
about 70 staff members working on
technology working on community outreach
growing the wikipedia community funded
by donations as you probably know and
some of you are donors so thank you to
those of you who do
in our annual fundraising drive and so
that's that's the wikimedia foundation
and as a non-profit charitable
organization everything that we do is
entirely and one hundred percent
open-source software so we're going to
talk quite a bit about technology today
and everything that we're talking about
is open source I'll be mentioning Google
search phrases so you can dog food your
way there and basically you can play
with it help with it Patchett submit
patches and that's why we're here so
hoodie brought us here and said hey you
guys should talk more to to Googlers and
get more folks excited with helping or
this in twenty percent or otherwise with
specific projects that we can media is
doing that's what we're trying to do
we're trying to get those of you who
have time and interest excited in
helping with some of the stuff that
we're doing so we'll talk about it
everything is open everything is
findable we're a lot less legally scary
than other organizations in terms of our
willingness to share information and
document publicly what we're doing and
nothing that we do is is private or
confidential so you'll find information
about everything with we're talking
about here so let's talk about editing
so who in this audience has ever edited
a Wikipedia article thank you to all of
those who are editing and so if you've
edited a Wikipedia article so let's take
an example of a Wikipedia article so
this this is the article about Europa
it's a beautiful lots of cetaceans a
featured article actually meaning one of
the highest quality ones we have a
beautiful photograph there from NASA and
tabular structured information citations
pronunciation information it's pretty
rich now what happens if you actually do
try to edit this article so what happens
is you see something like this so you
see that you're basically getting
swamped with this strange mock-up that
you have to learn in order to edit
Wikipedia so I'm wondering what what
you're thinking when you trying to edit
Europe but maybe you're thinking
something like this
but in any event you're pretty thinking
I am NOT going to do this so how should
an editor work what should an editor
operate life so we have been starting
project at the foundation to completely
redesign the editing interface for
Wikipedia it's been a long time coming
and I can show you a little bit of the
first work on this this project today so
just to give you a super quick show and
tell of what we're currently doing so
this is an actual editing surface
implemented in JavaScript and there's
nothing particularly exciting about this
if you think about it like your google
docs can do all this stuff and better
and it's still very much an early
prototype now the one thing though
that's that's pretty remarkable about it
which is a unique is the fact that
underneath it all it actually operates
on the basis of wiki markup so if you
see here side by side you see on the
left side the rich text representation
of the text and on the right side I can
see that when I make a change in the
market representation is also updated
which is simply a station of the fact
that it works with wiki markup as an
internal document object representation
of what I'm doing so in fact I can see
something that's a bit like a document
object model for the entire document
which stores with it the various markup
that's used to represent different
elements of this text so we had to do
this way and the reason we have to do it
this way is that one we're not going to
just force everything to use whatever
interface we cook up we have 90,000 very
active volunteers who write Wikipedia we
can't just flip the switch and say hey
by the way we just changed everything
get used to it we have to do it in a way
that allows people to use it if they
want to and in order to do that we have
to have something that supports both and
so that's argument one argument too is
that wiki markup actually does a
shitload of things that you can't easily
do otherwise so
when Google Docs you're primarily doing
word processing in wiki markup you're
doing essentially to some extent
programming that's the scary bit so if
you think back to the the article about
Europa that I was showing then this
stuff right here the table on the right
side you will notice that every single
article about a moon and the solar
system has the same kind of table with
the same formatting with the same fields
and that's not Google Docs style editing
that's cross document collaboration
using standardized templates which
accept certain parameters and which need
to be existing in the same form in all
those pages and so when we build an
editor we have to build an editor that's
actually designed around this kind of
maca we have to build an editor that
actually is designed to support all the
stuff that exists in Wikipedia and when
I say there's programming involved I
mean it a lot of these templates as they
are called actually include things like
automatic unit conversion and other fun
stuff that also is built by Wikipedians
alongside the article content and that
we also have to represent in the editing
interface so that's the hairy job that
we have undertaken and in in the new
visual editor we're going to try to make
every single functionality of wiki
markup user friendly and accessible so
this is important why is this important
has anyone in this room seen this graph
before other than wmf employees so this
graph is one of the graphs that is
giving us sleepless nights and what this
graph is basically illustrating is the
growth of the Wikipedia editing
community and that's represented here by
the blue line and every single month in
this graph represents the number of
active editors namely people individual
human beings who've made at least five
edits to the english wikipedia in that
given month and so what you see if you
fall
that graph is that as you start going
into 2006-2007 the graph is actually
flattening out and in fact declining and
so the number of people who are editing
Wikipedia is going down the other thing
yes yes that's registered it is every a
single point in this graph represents
just the number of registered editors
who have made at least five edits and
the other line of this graph the red
line represents something different
which is retention every single point in
the red line represents the percentage
of people who joined in that given month
and who are still active one year later
so what this graph tells this is an
important story and the story it tells
us is that as Wikipedia got bigger and
bigger the retention of new people who
joined the community dropped
dramatically in fact the drop into
attention is consistent with the
increase the dramatic increase in the
editing population that we saw in 2005
2002-2003 know why this happened at
least we know some of the reasons why it
happened we've done lots and lots of
analysis of what is driving people away
after they they start editing one of the
things we know is driving people ways
the complexity of the editing it's not
the only thing another thing that's
driving people away is the social
interaction that they might have on
Wikipedia which doesn't have to be at
all a pleasant social interaction your
first experience of creating an article
on wikipedia might be you make a page
someone else comes along and says we
have considered your page very carefully
and we think it should be deleted
another experience you might have is you
edit a paragraph and someone just revert
sit with the comment lack of reliable
citation and so in the years two
thousand five to two thousand seven as
the community has grown it has also
started emerging rules to deal with that
influx of new community members new
people joining in trying to improve
Wikipedia in many cases at
making it worse as an open editing
environment it has the vulnerability of
people coming in and potentially doing
destructive editing or just low-quality
editing and so during those years 2005
to 2007 a lot of rules have been built
that make it actually harder for new
people to make edits that are going to
be accepted by the active editing
community now if you think of this as a
social software problem then you know
there aren't many other social sites on
the web where you have to convince the
social side that they should accept you
as a member so at least not scalable
ones so this is kind of the current
reality of Wikipedia you have to be
impressive enough or resilient enough
and persistent enough to survive sort of
the early gauntlet of the user
experience technical complexity
likelihood of your article being deleted
likelihood of you edit being considered
poor quality and being reverted all
those are negative experiences which are
causing this red line to go to the level
where it is today and you can see that
as the English Wikipedia community reach
what you could consider its natural
carrying capacity given its current
technical and social operating
parameters you can see that the
retention rate also started to flatline
it is not cleaning further however given
that early massive drop in retention
that we're seeing we now have a problem
a very significant problem retaining you
editors so this is why is the operating
entity behind Wikipedia and our other
projects we think very hard about this
graph and the technical change that
we're going to make to the editor is
only going to be one of the changes that
we are either going to make or have
already made in order to influence and
help improve the ecosystem of Wikipedia
now this is something that you can
actually help with so we have started a
challenge at Kaggle which you probably
some of your
are you familiar with data challenge
provider where you can go and submit
your own mathematical models of trying
to predict what is causing decline
activity patterns in Wikipedia so you
can try to help us understand
mathematically what's happening in the
community so if you are so inclined I
would encourage you to participate in
this ongoing participation challenge you
still have almost a month to come up
with a brilliant solution that is better
than all the 164 entries that are there
today so that's plenty of time so one of
the other things that we do as we try to
understand what's happening in the
community is we try to make sense of the
data in a visual way so for example this
is a graph that we have appropriately
called wiki pride which is a
visualization of edit activity patterns
in the english wikipedia specifically
the amount of text added to the english
wikipedia in different months each of
the colors and the color spectrum
representing different editing cohorts
meaning groups of editors who have
started at different time periods so
this is a way for us to understand who
is actually contributing text is the old
users is the new users are the old users
contributing more text now than they
used to be and this gives us a pretty
good sense of the process of
replenishing the Wikipedia community now
the good news here in this graph is that
you do see the graph not just staying
the same blue collar like you are seeing
that although the community size is flat
we are replenishing the community with
new community members so that's the good
news the bad news is that as you start
digging into the number of new community
members it's actually going going down
the number of people who are
contributing large quantities of
meaningful high-quality content who a
new is going down so that's the the bad
news of this graph and other analysis of
this type that we've done
and there are a number of other
visualizations out there that that you
might want to check out if you are
looking for ways to visualize knowledge
we could be doing really sort of a
project for lots of people doing
visualization work this is an
interesting one that I like that's just
a way to showcase currency of editing
activity so this shows four different
months is fairly old one from from back
in 06 07 that shows like blips in
activity in terms of active edits
remember when Steve Irwin died and
nicole smith died you can see those
blips so are very nicely in these kinds
of visualizations this is also an
obvious one that we have done which is
an animation that you can find on the
web which is active editing
participation in different parts of the
world the obvious take away from just
looking at it briefly is that it is a
very Western rich country centric
editing community also something that
we're trying to very much change so this
is one that you're probably not going to
meet unless you have already started
working on your submission but there is
a visualization challenge so if you do
happen to have a very cool Wikipedia
visualization somewhere in the draw that
you have never shared with anyone guess
what you can still submit it so I'm
going to ask our leader to talk to
another important component of our work
that relates to the graph around
retention that I shown you and it's
specifically I'm which is going to talk
about our all the interventions that we
are working on to make we could be a
more social more engaging more friendly
and a better experience and these are
just the very first experiments we're a
small organization we just kicked off
this work and we're working on it with a
small team but but these are some of the
ideas that we exploring so thank you
Eric and what I wanted to talk we're
about is a very exciting area that you
know with our small development team we
are trying out and experimenting on
different features and different ideas
which we feel will actually increase
engagement in
pirius community and also make it easier
for newbies to join in so let me talk to
you about the first feature that I'd
like to show to you now this is the
article feedback rating to and basically
this is on every page on every article
on English Wikipedia so if you look at
any article today you'll see this simple
tool that allows a reader who would be
coming to any page on Wikipedia to be
able to rate now this may be simple in
concept but what it does is actually
engages and encourages the user to do
more than just read and you know to go
in to the next baby step which is to go
and rate so this also not only gets us
some feeling and some idea about you
know what the quality of the article is
but also encourages them to go in and do
more with Wikipedia so going in to do a
reading and then going further to do
editing now this is kind of a small
experiment in one way but it is on all
the pages and we have seen from the data
that we have so far that there is about
a two point seven percent increase in
people who are actually rating to go and
edit which is cool if you go in Google
artifical feedback data you can go at
all about it we have a lot of
information on this project and we
usually have all our project info on
mediawiki org so feel free to go and
learn more about it the next feature
that I want to show you is the mood bar
and this is another experiment that we
are running right now on the english
wikipedia where new editors are the
folks who are actually seeing this graph
for this tool and it allows them to
actually share their editing experience
with everybody which means that they can
actually do this very simple thing make
it
easy express their sentiments they're
happy sad or confused and give a
140-character comment on why okay so far
it has been pretty widely used and in
fact from all the editors who have given
comments we actually have about sixty
eight percent of those editors actually
giving us feedback through this feature
the next one which our next feature that
I'd like to show you is very interesting
this was actually an idea that one of
our community developers you know
envisioned and it's called Vicky love
it's again on the english wikipedia and
this is a very easy way for users to
share an appreciation so what you can do
is you know you if you're an editor you
can go and give some other editor a barn
star which is kind of a common way in
the Wikipedia world of giving credit and
appreciation food and drink you could
give a baklava to somebody if you like
and you can localize it to your own you
know language community or your own
local area kidneys some folks really
love kittens in Wikipedia and you could
even share puppies of course and of
course you can make your own so this has
been an incredibly appreciated idea if
you will and these are you know kind of
whimsical in one sense you know for our
world but these are part of some of the
features that that I worked so far if
you have some other ideas please feel
free to share that with us the other
area that I'd like to talk to you a
little bit more about is localization
because part of our community you know
as you see the graph that Eric showed
you earlier is very US and European
centric and we feel from all the
analysis that you know and the data that
we collect that the next growth areas
our global which means that Asia
specifically the Indian subcontinent and
Latin America specifically countries
like Brazil are the high growth areas
where there is a tremendous amount of
participation that we anticipate from so
wikipedia has support language support
for about 200 plus languages today but
it is not adequate oops so what I'd like
to say to you is that in that area we're
at kind of at our infancy we have a
pretty load good localizing community
but we are starting off on the ambitious
projects that we would like to build out
open tools and technologies and API is
to be able to provide a better language
support in the non-roman character
languages specifically the indic
languages and the rtl languages like
Hebrew and Arabic to be able to increase
participation this is one of the
examples of Ricky love actually running
on the Hebrew Wikipedia today and it is
it has been localized as you can see for
Hebrew again Eric I think I'll turn it
over to you thank you again and I just
want to take a moment to go back to
regular for a second you know if you
look at this and you you have no
Wikipedia experience I think there's a
pretty good likelihood that your
reaction would be these guys are just
throwing stuff at the wall and they have
no idea what they're doing why are they
doing like kittens and food and bond
stars but guess what like this is what
actual Wikipedia editors have been doing
for years so the way that this design
came into being as early dimension is
that someone in our community actually
started building manual ways to send
those things to other users and other
users have been using them for years and
they've been starting building their
kitten libraries and their food lie
and so forth and really all we did in
this instance is take a look at
something that the community was doing
and make it easier and that's a lot of
the focus of a lot of the things that
that we're trying and we're seeing in
the case of Ricky love that the
community of experience that is a lot of
them were actually like ha that actually
makes a lot of sense a lot of people are
doing this already this is very easy
I'll start using it and we are looking
at the individual interactions we have a
log of every single one of those
transactions we can see what are people
doing with it and the nice part of this
feature being an actual operation is
that it is being used to thank a new
editors we can now find example of users
when you previously looked at their
discussion pages which is the public
space where discussion takes place
between users you would see that they
only got warnings they only got messages
of like you did something wrong and now
they maybe get a word of appreciation
maybe they get a bond start maybe they
get something different that's positive
and a personal message saying thank you
for what for the thing that you did here
and and we serve it our active editor
community and we said what's the stuff
that matters to you like what's the
stuff that makes you stay what's this
stuff that's important to you and and
they said well if other editors say to
me like what you did here is really
important what you did here really makes
a difference the way you helped me out
in that discussion was really useful
that image you uploaded wow it's is
really beautiful that's the stuff that
makes people state and so that's that's
why we build out this simple interaction
tool and we're thinking of different
ways in which we can facilitate the
expression of appreciation and welcoming
behavior and grow the warmth of the
community and turn it from a very valken
community into a more human community of
interaction and so this this is a small
example that may perhaps seem silly
although I think that the fact that it
seems silly to a lot of geeks is perhaps
a good thing because part of what we're
trying to do is broaden the community
Wikipedia to be less of a geek community
more of a human community more a
community that's not ninety percent male
that has room for inclusion of different
voices different people in different
ideas so let me talk a little bit about
innovation in the context of Wikipedia
because my guess is that then as the
Silicon Valley talks about Wikipedia
like if you asked like a venture
capitalist about Wikipedia they'd
probably be saying something yeah that
was pretty cool 10 years ago yeah
they're not doing really anything
interesting right that's just a pretty
static site they build the enpsychopedia
and they're done right not really like
the truth is that when you have 90,000
people working on a complex product like
Wikipedia and we're talking about a
community that as I mentioned is very
technical and very geeky they actually
do very interesting stuff and let me
give an example of this this isn't that
interesting of a feature although the
particular implementation is interesting
this is a simple image annotation tool
that you can use in Wikipedia today and
what's interesting about the
implementation is that's actually quite
a bit more powerful than some of the
tools that you have in other websites in
some ways so for example you can make
links you can embed images inside
annotations you can even load templates
or very powerful stuff into annotations
it's it's pretty powerful in terms of
building descriptive metadata for images
now the thing about this feature is that
wikimedia foundation never commissioned
it never prioritized it never did any
actual work on it whatsoever in fact
didn't even put it into production at
some point magically it appeared and so
let me explain to you how that happened
so about five years ago we started
experimenting with the idea of letting
our most trusted users which is actually
a fairly large community of thousands of
people edit JavaScript on wiki and so we
have the ability within Wikipedia for
trusted users to actually write scripts
and so you can write scripts that affect
the whole site you can write scripts
that affect only uses that activate a
specific feature or you can write
scripts that are personal to you
everyone can do
last of the three like even if you're
just a new user and you'd like to build
a cool feature you can just go ahead and
do that but the first two categories
require a trusted user status in our
communities and this is precisely what
happened here someone built this pretty
powerful widget just purely in
JavaScript stored it as a wiki page its
version as a wiki page it's edited
collaboratively as a wiki page and the
community had its own decision making
process of saying hey this is actually
really useful we should make it a
default feature on the site for everyone
to use and so the whole process of going
from development planning thinking into
production usage there is no lawyer
involved there's no developer from the
foundation involved it just happened and
that's pretty awesome and so there's a
lot of stuff like that that happens in
Wikipedia all the time lots of bottom-up
innovation of people writing side
JavaScript individual JavaScript we have
an environment called the tool server
which is actually a cost of boxes which
we give volunteers access to where they
can get access to real-time database
replication to run specific more
computationally and data-intensive
applications like reporting tools and
lots and lots of really cool stuff gets
built that way all the time and really
interesting ideas happen to be tested
and explored on Wikipedia first because
it's actually a very interesting
environment to test and explore ideas
and social media researchers often do
work in Wikipedia because it's very easy
to do this kind of thing give a bunch of
users access to it or even if it's a
good idea help us move it into
production so this is a recent gadget
that we've worked on that actually
helped take this a step further which is
embedding the cloud 9 code editor into
Wikipedia for the specific purpose of
editing JavaScript to make it even more
straightforward to write code in the
wiki version it in the wiki collaborate
still uses mediawiki itself is the
versioning backend you could think about
bridging it to get or some other crazy
stuff like that but it does work today
and you can use it to code inside the
wiki which is pretty neat so I'm going
to ask Rob to talk a little bit about
that part of the media redevelopment
process which you would expect isn't
quite that accessible so I've talked
about on JavaScript developer and the
stuff that users can easily do this
stuff that that's at the surface but
he's going to talk a bit about our core
development meteoric itself as a
platform PHP application and how it is
being built and one one thing that's
perhaps a little bit unusual about that
is that that too is a more open process
than you might expect thank you so I
guess I'm going to spend a lot of time
here in the weeds even as I'm talking
about the community aspect of this in
the community development aspect of this
so one of the big areas that we have
been spending a lot of time thinking
about recently is how to improve our
development process and we went through
this two day long exercise just trying
to figure out like how you getting a
shared understanding of our development
process and one area that stood out is
kind of a unique part of how we do our
development is is how we do our code
review and that's one of the things I
want to just talk about here today which
is code review of course is not if any
of you that are seasoned in development
know is not a particularly unique thing
to our community what is different about
the way that we do it is how we do it
which is that in most projects the the
idea is that you that somebody write
some code and then prior to committing
it the developer then goes find somebody
else to do the review and then and then
if that second developer says that it
looks good then the code gets committed
well we have a different process which
is that people who want to commit their
code commit it right away and then it
goes into our code review tool and
you'll see we have
the this is a screenshot of our code
review tool and you'll see up at the top
there is a subversion revision number
it's already been checked into the trunk
other people are already building on top
of this and and but it's not necessarily
a given that it's actually been reviewed
yet the point of doing post commit
review like we do is to let people
collaborate build on top of each other's
code without any gatekeepers and then we
we try to do the review after the fact
so that you know we still need to do a
review to make sure that we're not
deploying something absolutely crazy to
the website and you'll see from our
development process back here one of the
things we were also trying to do is
identify problems that are with our
process and those problems are the red
blotches there and that blown-up area
around code review is is one of the
areas where there's a lot of red
blotches unfortunately some of the great
things about how we do it I've already
described like it does increase the
velocity it does make it so that we can
have a very large community of very
motivated developers we have three
hundred and thirty-five developers who
have commit access to the mediawiki
source repository of them 75 have made a
commit in the past year to the core code
so this is it's not as though we're
talking about a small number of people
here this is a pretty large group that
we're trying to coordinate through this
through this process here and but that
does create a lot of social problems for
us where for example if we fall behind
on code review but all it takes us quite
a while to get through the backlog and
what's worse is that we end up with a
situation where it becomes harder and
harder to revert code from our
repository because it's already
entangled with other code and another
problem is just sort of the social
aspect of it part of what makes post
comment review work well is the fact
that the
it makes it it you have to be able to
revert code quickly and you have to not
have any pretenses about reverting code
quickly if even the developer doesn't
fully understand it or you know or it
hasn't been fully vetted or discussed or
whatever but people you know especially
new developers in our community but even
some experienced developers in our
community sometimes have a rough time
with getting reverted and so it does
create a bit of social tension in our
community but still it's these are
problems that we're trying to sort out
part and and the and in sorting out
these problems is made it a little bit
more complicated by one of the other
things that we would like to do and
we'll be doing over the over the coming
year which is to migrate our version
control system if you're familiar with
various version control systems we're
currently using some version and we're
planning on moving to get and that is
going to impose a whole different
workflow on us in in addition to you
know the tool changes that we have to
make it's probably going to be a lot of
social changes for us and and one of the
things i'd be interested in talking to
you that have experienced here in this
as far as like how to make get workflows
sort of compatible with the way that we
do things well well at the same time
sort of to get taking advantage of the
best of get and another thing is also
just from a tooling perspective one of
the things that we're contemplating
moving towards is instead of having our
own code review tool using something
like somebody else uses in fact we're
probably going to be moving to Garrett
which is is a google open source project
so we were still in the process of
investigating this and figuring out what
features you know making sure that we
have feature parity there and there's
probably at least a couple features that
we would either need to add or get
somebody to add or something along those
lines so
so other aspects of community we one of
the things that we've been participating
in this year's of course google Summer
of Code thank you very much we've we
have eight student or we we had eight
students this year of which seven are on
track to complete successfully and just
just do a quick I'll do a very quick
overview of what some of the students
have been up to part of stemming this
editor a problem that we're we're
currently working on right now is just
making it easier to sign up for the site
and so one of the students is working on
making a more modern web form for
actually signing up for the site where
you get actual visual indication while
you're signing up that for example the
user names not correct or anything right
now our current are unavailable i should
say one of the one of the things that
are our current web form is very
old-school HTML right now and so this is
about making that much nicer experience
and look there's color which is kind of
a unique thing on a lot of our web forms
so another thing is another student he
is working on the putting together a
it's a mediawiki extension for pulling
together offline collections of articles
and what they're doing is taking an
existing set of scripts that have been
off on a prototype server and are using
it to and and taking those Perl scripts
and turning them into a proper PHP
mediawiki extension that that would can
go through and assess the pull out the
mark-up in all of these articles that
describes what quality of article it is
and we have as you can see a fairly
complicated scale of of articles
featured articles being at the top and
then
ranging all the way down to stubs and
lists and and just unassessed articles
and so on and so these are important
ratings to understand it when making an
offline collection because sometimes you
just want to get the good articles and
so that that's one of the things that
this the student is working on another
student is working on a project for
citations making it possible for it
making it very easy for an offline
archiver to archive an article as it's
been referenced inside of a media wiki
oreck seen the inside of a Wikipedia
article so an editor hit save that
references this outside reference and
then that that triggers an archive
request from firm set for say internet
archive or whoever and that then that
cached version of that reference is
actually available if you've ever gone
and followed a reference on Wikipedia
you know that a lot of times what
happens is those references kind of
disappear into the sands of time and so
this is one way of trying to preserve
that another student has an article or
it has probably the best name of a
project amicus which is a an anachronism
monolithic infrastructure for
customization of user scripts that's
basically they gadgets a tool that Eric
showed you earlier that school an
infrastructure a better infrastructure
for setting user preferences and and
using gadgets in it and expanding
gadgets in a more systematic way making
it a lot nicer to actually manage
preferences personal preferences for the
gadgets that you're using another
student is also working on social
improvements to the social profile
extension that we have for mediawiki
that's it and this is a great thing
about our community is that not only are
is Wikipedia Turks me wikimedia
foundation using mediawiki for running
Wikipedia but mediawiki is used by many
different organizations and in fact this
project is being mentored by a different
organization wikia employee at a
different organization I should say and
and working on an extension that is not
being used by wikimedia foundation which
is great similarly we have two more
students working on semantic query
improvements and semantic schemas for
the semantic mediawiki community so I'm
going to talk a little bit about how we
how we work with our community we've we
have hackathons a couple times a year in
addition to other events as well this is
a picture from our Berlin hackathon
which is a which is a great event we and
a great working event this is a you see
a lot of Wikimedia Foundation employees
there but you will also see a lot of
people from from the community that are
not directly affiliated with Wikimedia
Foundation there and we all got together
and did a lot of great work we did some
usability tests we did a lot of planning
for the upcoming year we there was a lot
of fixes done to mediawiki to make SSL
support work better and for ipv6 as well
and then additionally a lot of bug
smashing we smash 65 bugs they're so
great working meetings great experience
I think for everybody they're pretty
exhausting but great experience part of
the reason why I bring that up is
because we would love you to be there
for a next one and so this this one is
not a hackathon so one of the events
that we have that is coming up that is
wiki related issue and say that we're
holding is wiki sim which is a symposium
held right here in Mountain View that
is about the broader wiki world and it's
a much more research focused event than
the events that these hacking events
that i've been highlighting but it's an
event that since it's right around the
corner is potentially interesting and
pretty easy for you all to get to and if
you want to just know more about what's
going on in the world of wiki research
and just if you're interested in those
higher-level issues that's a that's a
good place to go I'm additionally if you
want to go to these one of these more
hacker focused events we're planning to
meet in New Orleans in the middle of
October and work out a number of things
including a virtualization
infrastructure for making it possible
for other developers to and actually all
developers including folks on our staff
to be able to better test mediawiki
before putting in deployment with a with
a very production like environment so
that's one of the things that we're
going to be working on is figuring out
some of the issues there and then also
working on some of our next-generation
architecture stuff which let me talk
about that for a second so this is so
part of my role in the platform
engineering group is just working on the
media wiki core and specifically a
performance and stability of the system
and one of the big areas that we know we
can improve or one of the big what are
the tools out there that we know will be
a huge improvement for us in in the
speed of our site is moving to the
hip-hop compiler which is a PA is a
separate implementation of PHP that is
if you're familiar with how PHP works as
the language is an interpreted language
in most contexts this this is an
alternate implementation that actually
produces a compiled version and what
means for mediawiki and Wikipedia is
that it's we think for rendering pages
it's going to improve result in a four
to five four to five times improvement
to the the page speed this is
particularly important because we you
know what we found is there's a number
of articles you probably don't really
encounter too many problems with
performance on Wikipedia because we have
very very aggressive caching but when
you do need to actually see a page
re-rendered from wiki text into HTML
that's we're referring to as parsing
when you actually do need to encounter a
parsed version of a page it can take a
very long time to render that we keep
track of the pages that take three
seconds or longer to parse and just in
the sample that I did they were just
before this talk there were 17 thousands
slow page renderings in an hour that
were we're slow as defined as greater
than three seconds just to give you some
examples of articles the list of hard
rock musicians was the was the article
that was like the took the most time 176
seconds to render which if you would
accidentally hit that page you know if
you're interested in your hard rock
musicians 176 seconds to wait for a page
is clearly too long and something that
we need to fix because it that you know
kudos to the hard rock musicians for
having the longest parse time there the
list of current members of US House of
Representatives by age is 90 seconds but
there's a more substantive article the
Barack Obama article takes night it can
take 94 seconds to render so these are
so clearly we have to get some of the
performance issues and figured out
because especially for the editing
experience when you hit save on an
article that's or even preview on an
article as you're editing you know
you're going to take if you want to edit
the
Barack Obama article it's going to take
you 94 seconds potentially between the
time that you hit preview and the time
that you actually see your change which
is is is a little bit much yeah yeah
exactly so so those are the syllabus is
some of the issues that we're looking to
address and then we're also
investigating things like changing our
templating language and making things
more efficient in those regards so and
with that I'll turn it over to air to
talk to about mobile thanks so just on
the point of why are some of these pages
to so you're not going to encounter it
if you go to the Barack Obama page is
going to be there in a couple seconds
because it's cached if you're editing it
if you're previewing it what the
application has to do is to actually
parse out like whatever number of
citations is for like 200 or 300 and
what that actually means in practice is
fetching 200 300 different
instantiations of the scitation template
which formats dissertation so there's a
quite a bit of complex interaction that
actually occurs when you render out a
complex page like that because the page
isn't just a page it has dependencies on
other pages which have dependencies on
other pages so it has to be constructed
from from multiple resources by the
parser and so that's a computation job
where hip-hop can potentially help us
there are other optimization strategies
that we looking at for some of those
cases we have a few minutes left just to
give you an overview of some of the
other stuff that's in the pipeline and
for those of you who have time to stick
around maybe we'll have some some
questions so mobile obviously a big area
this is just a simple graph of the
traffic I'd love to show you some really
awesome mobile stuff unfortunately our
mobile gateway isn't that awesome if you
go to m dot wikipedia.org you get a
pretty simple straightforward we'd
experienced it does that it is a good
job of reformatting articles so if
that's all you want or just go to the
regular said you'll get redirected there
on an Android device iOS device whatever
it's reasonable
it gives you good information quickly if
that's what you want but what we'd like
to do is do more editing more
interaction on mobile that leverages
specific mobile device capabilities for
example one of the potential really
strong users use cases that we see for
smartphones is obviously photo upload
specifically and application like hey
guess what the the famous building right
next to you doesn't have a photograph
yet why don't you go ahead and take one
and just add it right to the articles so
there's quite a bit of very very strong
applications that you could build to
leverage the fact that everyone has a
camera so this this is the kind of stuff
that we are going to build it's very
high priority for us you can see in the
graph how much traffic we're already
getting from mobile it's up to fifteen
percent that's with still pretty
haphazard mobile site experience so
there's still lots we can do to to grow
that number and that's really reflecting
the changing shape of the web as you're
all aware so the other project
represented in this architecture grant
and diagram that's the first iteration
of the virtualization infrastructure
that Rob la mentioned which initially is
intended to allow all our DevOps work so
the inter interface between development
and operations to proceed in a secure
sandbox environment where people can
build out services and Papa ties them
configure them in a secure sandbox and
then move them into production which is
pretty big big a pretty big deal for us
because it allows us to be more
volunteers would access to visualize
copy of our infrastructure so we can
train them up to be ops volunteers which
isn't something that we can easily do
otherwise so as a volunteer-driven
organization virtualization is a
powerful tool for us for onboarding
people and giving them an environment
where they can do good stuff without
doing harm if they are good people will
give them more appropriate access levels
the other thing is this is just the
first stage we're putting quite a bit of
effort into this project as an
organization because we have seen that
our community is amazing at doing
bottom-up innovation so we'll give them
far better tools in terms of free
computing infrastructure
access to live database replication
access to specific services better
infrastructure or gadgets by the
infrastructure of the tools better
infrastructure for BOTS improved ap is
so that if you want to build a new
editor if you want to build a reporting
engine if you want to build analytics
reports whatever cool stuff it is that
you're trying to get done you should get
free access to resources from us that
enables you to do that so we call it
wikimedia laps it's a project that we're
very actively working on if this is your
domain of expertise the nola hackathon
is the place to be we'd love to have you
there it's a big deal for us because
again like this infrastructure that
enables volunteers to do great stuff is
really important for us finally one of
the other projects that I want to
mention and give a plug to is something
called wiki data which is an idea that's
been in the works for a long time and
essentially the background here is that
Wikipedia articles have tons and tons of
structured data the way that data is
represented in articles is plain text
you can ask questions of it you can't
queried with an API if you have
information here like a table about
Sweden with population data and other
useful structured information it's just
text which sucks and which also means
that guess what you have not three but
in fact more like 200 different versions
of that table in the different language
editions of Wikipedia so each of which
is a separate copy each of which is
separately maintained by that language
community the inconsistencies between
the data that have to be manually
corrected if you are studying a Swahili
version of this article and you have no
data guess what you've manually copy it
manually maintain it separately in a
separate instantiation from the source
where you copied from that situation is
pretty untenable in fact people have
written all kinds of horrible hacks in
order to maintain data in Wikipedia
there's been lots and lots of effort I
was just telling some some Google as
this story like what what happened is we
have have had structured data in
unstructured form in Wikipedia for eight
years and freebase a company that's
pretty awesome started getting funded
started processing this data and making</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
