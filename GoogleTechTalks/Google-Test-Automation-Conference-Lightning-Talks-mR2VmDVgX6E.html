to lightning talk sessions before but
speed is of the essence first off I'd
like to thank our lightning speakers
since at the end things can tend to get
a little crazy at a lightning session
this is also my warning to the speakers
of this is the order you are in and out
happen the only rule in lightning talks
is five minutes at the end of five
minutes we will all applaud very loudly
and these evil is done okay and we
actually have signals for them cards
that we will hold up to let them know
and when the dreaded white 0 card is
held up they are done and we should all
then applauded very loudly okay and the
main thing here is to listen we will
make all of these slides available after
the conference okay let's get going dan
north from plot works on getting lean
thank you i know some foot words I've
been with greater confidence and not
hear the sound of my own voice okay so I
was about secondary effects of tehsil
too we were getting very excited about
test automation the obvious effects are
things like your test run repeatedly you
don't forget to do that or you don't
forget to do the boring ones once they
always make it what I'm interested in is
the options and the behavioral changes
you get as a secondary effect of that
automation so we're on a schedule about
five minutes ten slides three things to
talk about to acknowledge with some
changes plug without the slide seeds for
all sides three proofs is seven another
one okay I can't count so first things
three things talk about first thing
there are three types of lean with
different objectives so lean isn't a
single thing lean as like a set of
principles of which there are three
different types of practices and then as
various implementations of those
practices I'll explain what only in the
second software delivery rose at these
two of them there is no
delivery is it's not just about oh
that's nice amazing it's all stay with
you guys delivery in software isn't
delivered until someone's had an idea
turned into working production software
I'm not talking about the programming of
the testing ground looking up the whole
pipeline that it was at least some of
them test automation that allows you to
use incredible sense the Third Point
time diversity together and that's what
I'm in my second row thanks okay first
point there's three types of lean it's
all about eliminating waste we've all
got about lean lean lean manufacturing
all those things lingers that
eliminating waste but there's more so
there's also things that you're trying
these metrics are aiming for so in lean
manufacturing which is like the Toyota
car plant it's about minimizing variant
car car car broken car car that's wrong
okay lean product design is about
maximizing discovery new thing you think
same thing that's wrong okay so it's
slightly different focus and that's why
when hybrid cars came out under the
first to market to an installment market
all three and then link supply is what
we have for supply chain management
optimizing throughput so for
deliverables of these two of these
running tests and deploying software
like creating the software is a
production of sewing brain excessive
deploys off in the production process
that's a lean manufacturing writing
software she creating it and defining
the test is a creative process that
sounds that lean product design is
actually a whole bunch of work around
trying to make that manufacturing let's
move over i'll come back to need to play
in a minute or 30 seconds so one of the
primary effects of petals much it's
quicker it's less boring TN you're smart
testers can get on the small testing we
like that all the exposure least our
secondary effects of test automation
regression testing is automated every
test your eyes immediately regression
says because you can rerun it changes
can be verified fast i go from changing
checking in the code running automated
tests right I'll know whether it worked
on them inspiration testing is automated
so releasing software is these are all
these things together me test automation
allows us usually principles to
fantastic the so going back to the
earlier slide writing software creating
software and test is lean product design
so with automation I can discover things
more frequently that was the metric I
was trying to increase testing and
deploying software is lean manufacturing
automated tests don't vary test test
test test yet it's the same suite every
time I'm just adding stuff to it
automated deployment is deterministic
it's the same set of rules that have a
large stone so that means I can
frequently released high-value software
which is great earlier roi great more
responsive to business needs just in
time analysis and testing I get
concurrent stuff going on so I had an
idea my analysis just hit my clothing
Justin hit my testing and I'm ready to
release that stuff suddenly I've got
linked supplier but supply chain
management or my software delivery
process and that's kind of order to say
so I booked two people to thank Maricopa
dick and very proper nip the sheets are
loads of the statute some new book out
returning a conflict fantastic
implementing lean software development
from concept to cash and a back with
Robin kisses the frog legs who did all
this stuff in kenai I made it ugly so
got shameless plug so this is me to you
guys are you moving in this direction
are you looking at the lean approach the
agile approach your software delivery
and using test of exposure to achieve
that do you ought to be better at it
come and talk to me got time for a half
a question
this has with both lean deliveries it
came in and it was scheduled okay so now
we have the J mock twins same three
minute add price who will be doing j
Mach 1 and 2 and they actually have a
schedule of j Mach 1 done by five
minutes right night okay great thank you
okay oh so general took one of the
things that the point about mark off
your testing is that we think that the
most important thing that's interesting
by the way objects talk to each other is
the messages they pass rather than the
states that the state that was action
that autistic services from their
neighbors what's interesting is what
they need from the nervous and how they
talk them so what we've got here evident
by the pointers so what we've got here
is that the example we want to use is
like an option science and we've got a
slider which looks which gets told about
new bits and decides whether to raise
another bid here's our test it calls
that accepted method on the sniper and
the sniper made been on the lot or and
things may fail when it can tell the
listener but what's interesting is it
what's relevant is that the these are
interfaces this is all we care about
from the point of view of the sniper and
in the test we use mock mock
implementations of the lot listener and
we use the whole point of our test
driven is to drive out these
relationships and to discover the
objects and the interfaces that we
haven't seen yet so here's the code and
welcome to sunny this is what they want
looks like in practice
and here's here's our option sniper and
we're passing all of this all the
neighboring objects that we think are
relevant either in the constructor with
your office of constructor injection or
through the actual call and it's a
little bit of knowledge leftover
language dog or proxy thing but in
practice we create our locks up here
pass them in and then what we do is we
specify what we think is important about
the the way this man is going to talk to
the lot so we say that in this case the
lot expects once that it's going to call
the method bid with something that's
equal to this value I'm making do other
things we can say we have a whole bunch
of genetic conditions except it's the
same object we can do we can say
sometimes when the method is called it
will do something you'll throw an
exception or return a value and
sometimes the interactions aren't
important for the test they are not
relevant but we need them to get through
so we were Stubbs claws as well
everything and this is the national
again that we saw in in Tommen the
language dog yesterday is this notion of
building up that embedded language in
Java which is where we put a lot of time
on to this over the years good it's
going to
right so here's an example and one thing
for very very keen on is got this
fantastic ID so let's visit and we use
sort of our chains interfaces so that
when you actually do a contagion thing
you get just the bit less relevant and
as you work your way through it's like a
workflow and in the type system and
that's that's what quite nicely to look
a lot of argument to get that stable the
other thing we put a lot of effort into
was the air reporting it so important to
get good error reporting especially as
if you don't do that it's very hard to
tell what actually happened for what
went wrong so his example of a failure
and it tells you that what you actually
did was called hot bit with a this value
but what you expected was to call once
bit with the rustling like that and what
you get is the list of things that you
could possibly have that we were allowed
in this test the other thing that's
really nice about testing in mock
objects will you get a failure is that
you get the status but the error happens
usually happens at the time for the you
make the phone call which is really nice
because you can type in your bugger have
a poke around see what's going on in the
in the environment and
thank you so general one has been around
for a couple years and I know there are
people here who are using it in practice
and in production so recently we've been
writing general too and you check the
first version in on Wednesday just
before the conference on the floor dead
show uses about what they can expect
no.3 Nickerson to play with it and give
us feedback before we are make air one
queen or release the main differences
are that isn't Java five you don't have
to extend any particular test case the
mock the J mock library is now
independent already are and Tessa
framework instead of having a mock
object s teasing that relate a mockery
so you can start a test that I kind of
like that type of my analysis I from
North Dracula and I've stolen it and the
monthly represents the context in which
you're under test is exists X
neighborhood the objects around it that
is going to communicate with them that
you want to check so the motto is
responsible for creating what versions
of these neighboring objects and also
for testing and they are being in focus
correctly
so you can see that at the top of the
test after granting a mockery you name
create some more context by asking the
rockridge create them and they come back
as the type of event you want so don't
have any mob class and don't have any
proxies or like mess it's just looks
just like the object that you would
expect to see production but it's a fake
finishing we then Korea or auction
sniper past again those those objects
that are being effective for us and the
code is not much more so easy to read
and then we create in actual test code
we then have to tell the context what to
text or expectations to test and we do
that by actually writing some continuity
constraints to say how many of these
things do we want to happen and then by
actually making a call to a method of
the mock-up jam passing in some
parameters that we went to okay so here
we stay we want exactly one core to the
listener or that method with those
arguments we can also say that parsing
some constraints to weaken the
constraints we don't just want before
values we can pass in anything at that
time for example here allow is like
stops and Jamie one just as any causal
known whatever we don't say whether
these expectations have to happen in
order or in any order and we can mix and
match there's other constraints a
bi-national glimpse that you can say
sometimes have the order and some things
can happen anyway
and so on I believe poke the object to
see what it does and then actually did
it that's it really there's a lot of
hideous hacking with java and c that to
make java be invoking readable we had to
do with double brace hacks and crazy
java 5 10 20 things and stuff like that
but luckily it's all hidden and you can
open ignite immutable tests so the
advantages that we get auto completion
in the ide no longer active type strings
to us say what methods we want to expect
we can create methods in the IDE with
quick fix from within the tests and they
are going to get editing to the
interface that we're mocking very handy
and we can refactor so slowly back to a
safe flight easy mom unlike easy mop
it's a specification style of writing
your test rather than repayment or the
court in weekly we find that very useful
because it changes the way you think
about writing the text you're not just
according something to be playing and
checking us exactly the same you may
cause you to think carefully about what
is important about the interactions in
between the objects in this particular
test case and that's it it's currently
being open to CES imaging up to module
and the CVS is our addresses were wrong
okay and Christine women from
progressive insurance here's a talk
about getting more money for your career
projects today the first thing I'd like
you to do is forget about thinking about
ways that will give you less money for
your projects so we've ever had any of
these thoughts like it's so obvious that
test automation is a good thing it's
really not obvious to everyone it's
certainly not obvious to anyone outside
of IT my management knows the ROI of
test automation they don't necessarily
know the ROI of test automation or ever
thought hey I just built this it's not
my job to sell it to accounting also
please illuminate that but let's look at
how you can get more money great
projects I'm going to suggest to you
that your test automation project
however fantastic it is is not really
complete until you've rolled their own
reporting their test foundation report
outs that we come out of it and what
should be in these report outs i would
say quantify the value of your automated
testing a little bit of the challenges
compared to how you might have thought
about doing that first of all I'll tell
you as a hint the answer always has to
be in the form of a number that's how
you quantify the value of something and
zeg intense it's almost never going to
be the number of tests that you executed
that that doesn't convey to an
accountant what the value of your test
automation voice and quite frankly
number of defects probably isn't going
to help an accountant understand that
either remember the back end back end of
every project is a budget and behind
that budget is as a bean-counter infant
that bean counter somewhere is destiny
convince that he should son more beings
your way so even a couple ideas look at
how many production problems did you
prevent and remember if you found a bug
or you created a brand new test case
that didn't exist before that's a
production problem that didn't
right so that's a problem you prevented
how many risks did you mitigate and
categorize them by severity how many
high pirates how many high medium low
risks that you did you prevent and how
many labor hours did you save in the
process if this were like you manually
tested how many labor hours would have
been spent on that and give it an
average billing rate that's a pretty
easy number to come up with in terms of
dollars safe and then what percentage of
did you increase your coverage by your
test coverage by this list can go on and
on this is just barely scratching the
surface you could easily talk to your
manager and asked that very question
what would help you sell this to to
account what would really compelling to
that this is worthwhile doing so after
the conference because early email me
but I truly hope you'll join in the
Google post-conference blog and share
your own ideas I know you've all had
successes at this and some failures I
think this is a huge area opportunity
for us and developing test automation
tools we you know we've got some
fantastic things we've seen just amazing
things in these past couple days now we
just have to translate that into terms
that the counties can understand so
baked
okay hundred with the man who has really
taught me what PowerPoint is about so as
you said I'm engine I am now on steam i
work at Google i'm doing an internship
at the moment and when i first started
my internship and upper struck me Allen
came to me and said we have a problem
that's my only slight 8500 different
user agents and we have no idea what
they're capable of and what they're not
capable of so we have a toll cody
transcoder you can take your mobile
phone out do a google search and if you
click on a result it shows you the
website and it's optimized for your
phone so let's make an example we take a
4 square feet website like CNN com and
we want to put it on a one square inch
display that's kind of hard if you don't
know what you can show on this disk like
does this display show jpg images is
this display even may be capable of
showing some JavaScript so the big thing
is you want to have built a database
where you store all the capabilities of
all these mobile user agent so there is
a thing called or fell out there and
were full has all these capabilities
stored by you to the region the problem
with orful is is an open source project
everybody can contribute to it and
because of that the quality is not very
high plus not everything we want to know
is defined and Werfel so some dude says
okay this capability goes in there and
this capability the capability does not
go in there so we wanted to extend
Wuerffel and make it more accurate and
better so it actually contains the stuff
we want in order to do that we create a
test sources to get input and see what's
better data and collect data I'm going
to present you around five input sources
they're from manual to fully automated
most of the time you cannot fully
automate the whole thing because you
have no ability to control the phone
remotely so what you do is you want to
write a framework which is really easy
to extend and with new test cases and
the framework should be really simple so
if you want to a website and you just
want to have questions on it answer with
yes and no so for example can you see
the screen circle yes no if the user
enters yes I know he supports jpg the
problem with that is you want to have
that in all available markups so in wml
HTML XHTML see HTML you name them so you
want to have an output record that
automatically detects what the phone can
show which markups and print everything
out in that out that abstraction layer
plus you have different languages so you
really really want to do that once
you've done that you also want to take
care of automatically store everything
so you don't have like somebody saying
go through this website and give me
feedback by email because collecting
that that's crap so this is one way of
gathering data it's not very automated
so I'm going to continue once you have
some data and you can apply some
heuristics to your database for example
we have a cutting-edge phone with a huge
screen showing is able of showing
cutting-edge video formats and in a
database it says it's not capable of
showing check back that's just uh not
really happy true so you want to go and
check if it really doesn't do that and
fix that then what you also can do is of
course you can use search party input
like you a
files from vendors but they usually
don't cover all you want but you can
make automatically equality across
through the web and uses that as an
input source one of the most coolest way
to do that is actually you can find a
lot of things out by analyzing your log
files for example you have a year if
your user agent supports https so what
you're going to do is you look in your
log files if you find a log entry that
says this user asians was on this https
website and then navigated on https
websites so you know it supports https
or let's say this form only can be
submitted by a javascript and if you see
a user agent in your life has actually
so many stuff but by this form you know
the user agent support some JavaScript
and you can fully automate that if you
find my path through your websites you
just constantly analyze your love files
and you're all set and if you have all
this input you want to have a really
cool tool that shows you the difference
between your current database and you're
all your input and then by easy clicking
it and applying yourself there you're
all set and that's how you
okay testing her she's are they please
hi I'm from Summit our company you
may've heard of my talk specials it's
basically five heresies in five minutes
or pause be shocked okay so what were
these I'm going to do is I can't talk
about some things you usually considered
very very bad I'm going to point out
some circumstances were actually they're
very very good and actually quite
valuable so take be well unless taken
around the water because my toilets go
randomized okay so take the bottom
bottom one making users test the system
that's horrible I mean what kind of
comes in for that software in pizza yeah
he's just tested so what I actually
meant was that you go to your actual
logs where you actually use your
application you are they are people
using a system with real inputs in real
ways and then you convert that those
logs came to test so if your lawns of
the main reason for you can use them as
the basis for a debugger session for
example so you're going well with these
inputs as that happens easy to put a new
big idea if you circuit box properly it
also need to do before misters progress
and be Cowboys the problem on my
performances are realistic it's based on
real data not talking anymore it also
solves the whole problem with smoke
tests or acceptance tests where if
you'll need stuff up at anos complicated
reality that goes away completely we use
this a couple of places well pricing
financial instruments and reporting the
system at a retail company you live
federal convictions okay doing well
random order again mutation testing you
may have heard of this basic idea is
your tests stay the same we have a
little problem that changes your actual
code and run your tests if I change the
code but a test pass that your test the
bad unfortunately it's usually
considering practical and academic
because it's
expensive however if you target the
usage adverbs parts of your system
they're hiring score I've actually
refactored or up bro well actually
mutation testing works its practical
azizam we tend to either use ivan was
just at all or more likely we use manual
mutation testing because it's quick it's
easy it's cheap Timur on in completely
random order master production you'd
have to be insane to me that however if
you're doing a release how do you know
works in production well you have this
other system it's all right production
but maybe maybe not however acuity use
an actual test that runs in production
on production hardware with production
systems you know it works if you came
banking for example your integration is
with another back they're not gonna give
you a fake bank to test the myth however
if you stop a test portfolio for example
that their view any other bank knows is
not real there's no money in that proper
goes away one more that's other people's
code that's like first thing they teach
you me the tivo university don't test
the people's code it's pointless however
if you have a vendor that provides you
in something like an RSS plaza or
messaging system or the database and
they upgrade their very patiently broken
stuff you depend on if you don't have
tested ensure that it works well your
scheme or words your friends up drink
last but not least stomach analysis
works in the real world again it's
another screw academic technique where
you have some of the runs of your code
and tries to find problems again will
you stay well it gives you between false
positives it doesn't work however
nowadays it does um you can download
things like five bags or pie checker or
the next version of intelligent will
have a static analysis server inside it
and the point is then you find the kind
of bugs that test it doesn't
I if I kind of buzz that people don't
find because they don't know their bugs
like where you liek resources and you
people have to review code for hours on
end or you're a tool right now it says
here and here and after its told you as
a bug that it becomes really obvious and
the other thing it can do is point a pro
Canadians if you have a broken library
now crazy from fix if you have a broken
language idiom you expect me to find out
about it and all about who built the
library to find out about it so the
classic one being human father Java I
put everyone I guarantee the ninety-nine
percent of the people his room if they
did that with the troll it's a privilege
Amanda we alter the same way static
analysis means somebody puts a quite a
nap rotating once right cyclases tool
for it on salt well except for the
barrier to go through all your code and
fix all the thing that's on your broken
and these are five heresies in five
minutes thank you okay two more this is
using up your time
Oh
hi I'm Jamal I'm from yonex biggest
Russian search engine first of all went
to thank Garang car was a tackler story
of from us testing we do absolutely the
same it's definitely the acute graphs
interpretation layer and so anthem but
recently we discovered a problem that
let me show we was about to launch an
new feature of our mascot show the
traffic jams or deny
and
we need all the preeminence testing
everything was just good we just
announced the feature to the internal
him at least and within five minutes we
got us wrong email saying the project
with a working incredible slowly but our
monitoring shows nothing call the tests
showed nothing we started the
investigation and discovered what
vintage was continued our loads of jacks
Creek calculation so time needed for
renting the page in the browser was
enormous so Jeffrey was totally infected
to read use that time and the project
was market access for the summary I can
see suggests nisha not ugly the time
between the moment when first bite of
request has sent in the moment when
heart might answer was received but at
the time required to you all javascript
rendering and all innocent what happens
inside the boroughs and the client side
especially if you are expecting users
with the old traffic and Gators that is
a question
okay James Richardson and magnetism why
bother hi there my name is James Reston
I've talkest summer similar to
Christine's basically all this testing
is great it's really fun all the rest of
it over in the real world aighty
methodologies and technologies when
applied in business space me to generate
a positive in our benefit ie like cool I
t's not cool unless it produces numbers
on the bottom line so we know for sure
at the moment that loads and loads of
software projects don't do that testing
properly we see huge software inclusions
in the media and countless others go
unreported so if this automated approach
is actually any good then it should be
possible to to define a quantitative
convincing argument for its use right so
otherwise everybody here is just messing
about with nerdy computer funk so I
guess you are are probably the best
people to ask as you know have a lot of
experience with these tools so I guess
basically my question to you and don't
necessarily expect it to be answered
right away is how then to sell automated
test them to our peers to management two
boards to other companies to improve the
development community generally any
ideas please send me know
okay James my name is James benzema on
the test strategist which means that
when it comes to doing things with
testing that involve thinking about what
you're going to plan and how you're
going to plan it sometimes I have
something useful say they're mine at
this kind of conference I'm confronted
with a different group of people that
having my normal line of work the test
strategist most of you guys can spell
pearl however I can test for emergent
behaviors and I'll come to that in a
moment and one of the problems that I
see very strongly that perhaps you guys
being able to see verbal see less
strongly and you may heckle is that I
believe strongly that some tests have to
be manual Magus boo thang now the
problem is some tests being manual the
problem is some tests being manual is
that some testers engage in manual
testing because they're not very good
some test is engaged in manual testing
because they are good some testers
recognize that there are issues with
doing everything in an automated way in
particular when you look at surprises
emergent behaviors things that turn up
that you do not expect nothing about
manual testers is saving all those of
you who have mo testers most of you
probably have a manual testers somewhere
in
production screen somewhere sitting
after you is a tester that uses well if
not the hands then let's hope their mind
they use themselves to observe what's
going on not simply to trigger but also
to observe those problems so as I've SAT
through these last two excellent days
I've looked at various things that I use
as a manual exploratory tester an
observation focus tester when I'm not
doing automated testing and I've got a
big list and you might find that list
there it went up this afternoon it may
still be up by its know depends how
habit I get thank you to those of you
who are confident and hacking first
thing using snippets of code as a
general rule testers should be able to
code it if your manual testers can't
code please teach them to code it will
help using sip it's of automated code
can help hugely replaying tiny bits of
automation within a test that may be
manual can not only speed things up
reduce finger trouble it can also help
you observe things otherwise you
wouldn't been able to observe because
you're going faster because you're going
more accurate it's tremendously useful
technique tiny step it's of automation
say tiny you may wrap up ten minutes
worth of typing and a tiny snippet of
automation
but it can really help second thing get
your testers used to using unix or other
comparison to all other tools that have
pipes and comparisons get them using
these things how else are they going to
compare the dumps of two gigabyte
databases one day to place another
database with large print out very bored
tester finally we've heard a little bit
about this today but not perhaps in the
way that I would use it virtual machines
have been a coming technology may be the
last five or six years I use virtual
machines to handle bugs to Mike Otis so
they can't say to me doesn't work on my
machine I give them one so it does work
on my machine as I give them the machine
I run a bunch of tests and I know that
occasionally it fails i might save a set
of those i might see which one fails i'm
going to go back to my side set i might
hand it over to my codes and say see
it's about to fail on your machine happy
tester happy customer sorry to the code
so ultimately yes life is too short for
manual testing but you have manual
testers out there their lines are just
as short as yours
please help we're to go there okay so
coming into this my perspective is a
little different from a lot of you first
off we don't do web applications we're
not doing things that are living on the
web we're doing client server
applications that are used within
hospitals and medical organizations
second we're highly regulated because
our products can kill people we control
in your accelerators that deliver
radiation therapy for example that's one
of the things we do so that's my
perspective coming in so what I have
identified is that most testing
strategies that people put together have
single points of failure that means that
if it gets past that gate it's getting
out into the world and it gave to my
mind that we need to figure out how to
solve this problem this problem is very
much similar to what you see the
security where they do defense in depth
or what NATO did during the Cold War
where they defended against Russian
invasion in depth they had fallback
positions they knew that yeah they might
get past this gate but we'll get them
here if we don't get them there we'll
get them here so the question I'm posing
to you is how do we solve this problem
how do we drive away so that our test
strategies don't have the single one
Cepeda there's some ideas first is
really need to start integration and
coordination across to all testing level
see I think we can do view our testing
levels as discrete and they're not
hooking up to each other we don't have
as insane military overlapping fields of
fire and we need to look at that so when
you look at your unit how does that
connect to the integration how does
integration connect into system how does
unit connect in the system how do they
work together how do they coordinate
their activities to make sure that
things are happening another area I
think that we're really missing out on
is in the wild yeah we have windows
error reporting things crash
but there's so much more that we could
do there in terms of collecting data on
what's going on and with the states of
the system with non crashing events and
picking that up and making it possible
for our users to report meaningful bugs
because instead of asking them what
computer there aren't we just figured it
out and put that in the bug report the
other thing is integration of our tools
set- factories it's an incredible based
quality because of what are called ERP
or enterprise resource planning systems
the kind of stuff that sa peanuts we
don't have these systems that work
together that are connected together so
that we can see how it all goes from
defect feature tracking all the way to
how we're managing the project again
discrete islands that aren't talking to
each other we need to look at how to
make those work together I think
service-oriented architectures hold a
lot of promise from that but we need to
start figuring out what are those
services what are the communication
channels that we're going to put in
finally a bonus for you guys a UI
automation tool which actually works i
discovered this toilets called test
quest it is a very interesting tool its
features are its non intrusive
cross-platform cross device you can use
it on a Palm Pilot as well as on Windows
machine on a Mac or Linux box localized
testing won't be supported so you can
run this HS French German etc it's easy
to maintain when I was at Adobe Systems
we had this implemented to do automated
on build test for photoshop three
versions of photoshop two platforms
seven languages every day the bill depot
sealed up at midnight we have to have
the builds ready to go at 8am for the
testers and we did it and at the end it
was taking a half an hour a day or a
person's time to make it work fantastic
tool check it out talk to me about it
thank you very much
okay and there is his contact
information and finishing us off oh you
know I'm so tempted to set up here for
about three minutes and not say a word
just to see if I can beat the type
anyway my name's Curtis Ovid PO with the
pearl foundation we're kind of like the
Mozilla Foundation except where smaller
poorer people Athens see so I'm reading
about Q a list about this guy he's
complaining about his code this code
happened to seg fault but he had tests
to find out why guess what his GUI did
yep he's doing went bye-bye along with
this all this code this annoys
developers so what you really want to do
is you want to be couple things if you
have something with the generating test
out but whatever is gathering that
output and aggregating it needs to not
be integrated too tightly so you don't
want an API you want a protocol so that
stream at amy gets cut off you don't
want to have your GUI or whatever you
have producing summarizing this results
dying on you so what's our requirements
we want out of this I want it to be
human readable I'm sorry there's a lot
of things which part human readable you
done with the test out but sometimes but
it's also got to be machine-readable
sometimes that's a little bit tough what
about XML some people say pearls rights
only and ain't got nothing on an XML
kids I mean in fact I'm not even sure
it's right only because had a pound for
every broken xmlwriter out there or
parser for that matter so I'm going to
talk about that the test anything
protocol and I need anything tap isn't
language-specific it's not tied in a
particularly to lure platform or
anything like that whatever language you
want to write tap in whatever language
you're parsed have did it just works now
if you look at that that's tiny human
readable you may not know what all this
test output means but you can pretty
much figure it out I got the results my
test
I got a test number I got an optional
test description I have directives here
like this is a two new test we got skip
tests available right here we have test
Diagnostics God XML expected happiness
it's also machine readable that's a
pretty simple grammar right there nice
simple and it's mostly light or I added
a new identities you don't have to wait
for well-formed XML to get your results
back you see your results continuously
screaming idea while taps being spit out
we have implementations in Perl and I've
seen it for see it's called light tap
we've got if a PHP lot of PHP testing
tools now optionally output tap it's
available for Python I've seen
implementations for Ruby javascript has
tests simple even one for postgresql
just popped up a few days ago now this
is driven by the pearl q18 that's a big
bucket of suck we need your help why
because this is being ported to a lot of
other languages and we need to know what
you folks need we got blinders on we
know in our needs are we don't know what
your needs are so if you want to help
you can go out of the pro-q a list which
I comedian a put up there because I
thought about that at a time or you can
email me over at Sipan org and we need
to create a language agnostic list so we
can solve your problems without being
tied to pearl specifically thank you
very much
we could have done another 12 slides
okay that is the end of the lightning
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
