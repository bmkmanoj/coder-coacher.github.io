the international center for journalism
with us um before she gets started with
her remarks i just realized in the
information we sent out i didn't provide
any bio on who Joyce's other than
president of the ICF J and I just wanted
to give you a little bit of background
that I grabbed and had verified so just
just so that you realize that when she
gives us her opinions and reviews on
something she knows where if she speaks
so prior to coming to ICF Jay Joyce held
a wide range of senior editorial and
management positions at Business Week
and Newsweek at Business Week she was
executive editor of global franchise
where she played a role in expanding the
magazine's reach in improving its
editorial product from around the world
as assistant managing editor at
Businessweek she supervised almost every
department the magazine as the asia
regional editor she launched the asia
edition of Businessweek managed
award-winning coverage of China's growth
Asia's financial crisis in turmoil in
Indonesia at Newsweek she held a number
of journalistic posts include quitting
including the Moscow Bureau Chief
special national political correspondent
and State Department correspondent she's
been honored with five overseas press
club awards and won national headliner
award among other honors and she served
as the Freedom Forum fellow nineteen
eighty nine to nineteen ninety she's
covered let's see Chernobyl handover of
Hong Kong to to China I was glasnost an
amazing range of stuff that's what she's
going to be telling you um just wait she
has a bachelor's degree in Russian and
Chinese area studies as well as a
master's in Asian Studies from
Washington University and a master's in
journalism from University of Missouri
she speaks conversational Russian
Chinese and Spanish so um with that
background i think i'm going to hand the
microphone over and on sit down and
start listening thank you for coming
choice thank you very much Pablo I just
wanted to I'm so delighted to be here
today I my first trip to Google was in
two thousand maybe before most of you
were here
and I remember sitting down with Sergey
and Larry and both of them telling me
that search was the killer app and maybe
everybody in the world hadn't figured
that out but they had figured that out
and just watch and now I come back and
I'm impressed and bowled over and and we
all know the Google's the Google story I
prepared a little speech that deals with
some of the issues that I'm concerned
with as a journalist or a former
journalist and the head of a nonprofit
that tries to promote quality journalism
around the world and I called it a
global digital journalism a
transformative moment and I'll I'll give
this speech and then I welcome any
comments or questions or any discussion
you'd like to have the digital
journalism revolution has created a
revolution in journalism across the
planet and certainly there is a global
digital divide between the developed and
the developing world but even so the
internet is changing how news is
delivered and covered in the developing
world give me let me give you some
examples there are bloggers in Egypt who
are posting victims up posting videos of
torture victims there are Guatemalan
community radio stations that are now
starting to use the web to create a
platform on which they can create a
network and share content there a
citizen journalists in Mexico who are
broadcasting crackdowns on protesters
that would never have been covered
before so we see that this is an
incredibly important moment and access
to information technology is really key
for journalists in these countries but
what makes this moment truly
transformative is not information alone
but the quality of the information and
this is a big theme of mine the quality
and for the information more than ever
the world needs journalism that's
discerning insightful and fair
journalism that reveals critical issues
and stories that might otherwise go
unnoticed and untold for companies like
Google the future of global journalism
is also i'm sure a very
important issue I visited you know
Google News repeatedly and you know it's
you've got you've got skin in the game
as they say the websites of the New York
Times The Washington Post CNN BBC and
other top news organizations as you know
are increasingly attracting numbers of
visitors but Google News likely has more
visitors than any one of those sites and
if you ask me who the most powerful
person is in the news media today I
could easily argue that it's not the New
York Times or publisher Arthur Souls
berber souls burger or the Washington
Post publisher Donald Graham or even a
person at all it's an algorithm your
your algorithm so it sets the agenda
from millions of readers each day all
across the world and this development
raises some tough questions that I think
all of us needs to address how do we
ensure quality and integrity in a
fragmented digital landscape how do we
make sure that all stakeholders in news
production and distribution uphold their
responsibility for protecting the news
now the world's growing
interconnectedness has sweeping
consequences for journalism we've seen
the advent of larger and larger mass
media organizations whose owners primary
business is not necessarily journalism
news cycles have shrunk from days two
hours in even minutes leaving
journalists with even less time to make
very difficult ethical decisions well
for us in the established news business
reputation is everything we need our
readers to trust and value the
information we provide in whatever
platform the news is delivered the web
newspapers TV cellphones journalism
ethics remains an integral part of what
we do strong ethics and skills helps us
earn credibility with readers and
viewers and also strong ethics builds a
reputation for credibility and
reliability that spells greater
opportunity for commercial success
governments both our own and those
around the world are less likely to
impose
media if journalists hold themselves to
high ethical principles today a solid
grounding and ethics is needed as never
before after all we live in an age when
news stories of global impact as well as
rumors and outright falsehoods race
across the world at the click of a mouse
shaping public opinion for better or for
worse the consequences of ethical
failure in an era of global economics
instantaneous communications and systems
of mass destruction are much more
serious than in simpler times when
damage from ethical failings was more
likely to be isolated and contained
think Danish cartoons media ethics it's
becoming clear must emerge from the
people who write and edit the news from
publishers and station owners and from
those who sell the advertising and
subscript and subscriptions to sustain
the news and from those like Google who
aggregated effective and meaningful
ethical standards can never be imposed
from an external source they must must
be an outgrowth of what all of us with
our various roles to play do every day
now I cfj the International Center for
journalists and I'll use the acronym
tries to assist journalists around the
world and gaining the skills they need
to do their job responsibly we recognize
that independent media are a
prerequisite for free and civil
societies we work around the globe in
Latin America Africa Eastern Europe the
Middle East in Asia often in countries
where fragile nascent democracies are
confronting the burgeoning demands of
global economics and newfound pluralism
greater press freedom has allowed for
more assertive less defensive journalism
and greater consciousness of the need
for standards to ensure quality and
avoid abuse during its history I cfj has
worked with some 40,000 journalists from
more than 170 countries to share
practical hands-on skills in journalism
and business media management
I cfj helps these journalists provide
their fellow citizens with the
information that they need to take part
in the social economic and political
lives of their societies and to make
smarter decisions that we hope will
improve lives just to give you an
example we're conducting business
journalism programs in China health
journalism training in Africa
environmental journalism and training in
Latin America and Asia and just so that
you know we're play we place in equal
emphasis on training in business in
training business the business side of
the media because editorial independence
is impossible without financial
independence now let me return to the
impact of the internet in the West the
rise of the Internet has turned a highly
developed media on its head I'm sure
you've had discussions with journalists
these days you know what I'm talking
about what happens when this
transformative technology affects
countries where an independent media is
just beginning to develop all of us need
to be aware of the effect of the growth
of information technology in such
regions and what an absence of quality
can mean it can mean the difference
between a free society and unfree one
the difference between justice and
injustice the distance the difference
between an informed citizenry and one
that is deceived by government
propaganda these differences are truly
enormous we all know what good standards
are and what quality is in traditional
newspaper journalism but what are the
best practices when it comes to citizen
journalism and the blogosphere there are
Trailblazers around the world you all
know of oh my news in South Korea but it
proves us to figure out what constitutes
quality information in an effort to
promote it in a fast-changing digital
environment at ICF J we're trying to
help journalists navigate this new
terrain we're getting untold requests
for help with digital training from
around the world it's just pouring in
our flagship program the night
international
journalism fellowships sends global
reporters to places around the world to
work on high impact projects many of
which have digital components and these
journalists go out there and do their
work for a year at a time in Guatemala I
mentioned it earlier but in Guatemala
for example our fellow is working with
community radio stations many of them
run by indigenous people to create a web
platform where they can share
programming with one another and also
with Guatemalan immigrants in the United
States and we think this is going to
help exponentially increase content and
better inform these communities on a
much larger scale and we just signed an
agreement with the University of
Guadalajara to create the first digital
journalism Center in Latin America this
comes in response to unending requests
from Latin American news organizations
for deeper understanding of how to
produce quality journalism on the web
this is going to be a year-long degree
program and it will also include modules
for working journalists the curriculum
is really exciting we're going to teach
everything from digital investigative
journalism to multimedia management the
university is invested quite a bit and
now I'm going to try to raise funds for
the rest and we're hoping to launch in
September and recruit students not only
from around the region but also among
Hispanics in the u.s. and this will be
quite affordable we're also aggressively
expanding our website we have several
websites but I'm going to mention the
international journalists network or IJ
net org it's the go-to site for
international journalists to learn about
training programs and networking
opportunities and we publish in five
languages English Spanish Portuguese
Arabic and Persian and we're hoping to
add Russian Chinese in French and our
latest I jnet offering is an interactive
guide on how to produce a quality blog
for journalists in the developing world
we're also working with the Poynter
Institute a journalism training
organization bay
in miami to develop interactive training
modules in multiple languages with
content customized for different
cultures and regions as you can imagine
there are journalists in some countries
where you can't even send someone in to
train or help but you can do distance
learning and we're trying to provide
those kind of resources so that when
things do free up in these societies the
journalists have the skills they need to
thrive and the other thing is at a time
when US news rooms are cutting back on
international bureaus and coverage which
is a huge concern of mine we think we
can provide a link for us news providers
to quality journal to quality local
journalists around the world so we can
link up u.s. News &amp;amp; Western news
organizations with really good local
journalists I cfj is not an advocacy
group our goal is to provide valuable
training and we know how difficult it
can be operating overseas we're trying
for example to engage the media in
countries like China this fall we're
launching what we consider to be a
groundbreaking program in global
business journalism at the prestigious
Cheng hua university in Beijing this is
a two years master's degree program that
we hope will create a cadre of top-notch
Chinese business reporters and editors
who can produce clear balanced
insightful coverage of China Chinese and
global markets and we really do believe
this will help make the Chinese market
much more transparent and foster greater
understanding between China and the
international business community and
given what's been in the news lately
with Chinese exports there's certainly a
need for more watchdogs for the benefit
of us all I want to underscore that our
colleagues overseas truly first turtles
that most of us here cannot imagine in
their effort to tell the truth each year
I cfj presents three awards two
outstanding international journalists
who inspire us simply by doing their job
last year we gave one of our awards to
Drago halo of the feral Tribune in crow
Asia and he has done whatever he can to
hold war criminals in the former
Yugoslavia responsible for their deeds
baggy labu car by ova who was born in
Uzbekistan and is now works as a
reporter for the AP witnessed the
massacre of uzbek by the government in
the city of antigen and exposed this to
the rest of the world and then there was
this young woman journalist sada algebra
head of the BBC's Arabic service this
woman is an iraqi journalist who has to
change the time that she leaves for work
each day to avoid being kidnapped when
she reports from bombing sites she
cannot stay too long or she risks
attracting the attention of insurgents
she has to keep a distance of a hundred
meters from US troops who might
otherwise shoot she lives an apartment
that has the best four hours of
electricity each day so she prefers to
stay in the office and she tells no one
except her very closest friends and
family what she does for a living this
year's winner includes our first citizen
journalist his name is al Abbas and he's
an Egyptian blogger who was dared to
write about prisoner abuse crackdowns
against protesters and other subjects
that the established local media have
generally avoided but what's happened is
because he's done such a good job he's
gotten so much attention from Egyptian
viewers and users of his blog that the
traditional media are now forced to
follow and cover the same stories and
when that happens you start to get
accountability these journalists remind
us that news is not a commodity but a
vital service that requires skill and in
many cases unusual bravery simply to
practice I'm going to give a little plug
here but we have an annual dinner where
we are not honor this year's winners
and it would be so wonderful if Google
representatives could attend it's on
November 13th I have some pamphlets here
should anybody be interested and it's
it's really where we showcase what these
international journalists do and the
type of work that I cfj does we give one
award to a u.s. journalist who we feel
really stands for high quality
journalism and this year it's going to
go to NBC's Tom Brokaw and our keynote
speaker is ABC's new news anchor a news
anchor Bob Woodruff who you probably
recall was gravely injured in Iraq and
every year our MC is George
Stephanopoulos and we're very grateful
for him for that before I wrap up I want
to talk about another important concern
of mine in the digital journalism world
and this may sound blatantly obvious but
we need editors more than ever
customization of the news I mean
customization to one give me what I want
when I want it is in many ways the glory
of the web but it can also be worrisome
it can keep journalists like Drago and
shada from reaching their potential
audiences as we know editors and news
producers painstakingly decide what
stories will appear on the front page of
a newspaper on the cover of a magazine
or during the 30 minutes of a nightly
newscast on the web readers with their
RSS feeds often decide what they want to
receive the distant remediation of the
editor in other words removing the
editor and putting the news consumer in
charge of the news received has
significant ramifications those key
judgments that editors make suddenly
disappear and the danger is that readers
or viewers miss news they didn't know
they needed to know when you customize
to one you often lose the serendipity of
finding great discoveries that are
important to you and your community and
the ability to set a common agenda is
diminished the web also allows users
to reinforce their beliefs and shun
competing analyses you go to the blogger
who believes the same things you do and
you get just what you're looking for and
there can be nothing wrong with that I
mean we all read particular columnist or
watch particular commentators because we
like their slant on an issue but many of
us also watch columnist sweet columnist
that we don't agree with just to learn
the opposing view and on the web the
danger is that customization to one
means that we miss exposure to
alternative thinkers to the other side
of a key issue so while digital
journalists in countries like Egypt are
often bringing an alternative view too
compliant if not controlled media we're
a little bit concerned that in the u.s.
we're hearing what we want to hear and
turning off other voices so is there a
next generation of the web that instead
of focusing on creating more niches
tries to bring us together how can all
of us involved in the news business get
people out of their comfort zone and
learn about the other side how can we
ensure that there are funds to produce
the news that we and citizens across the
globe need to exist as free independent
societies I have yet to hear a financial
model that I think is even viable for
most big media news organizations that
have vast Bureau networks overseas I
still don't get how they're going to
survive and maybe you smart folks at
Google can figure it out and I ask you
to work with us to try I'm really a
believer that people will search for
quality news on the web and that users
will continue to insist on credibility
and integrity and an era when anyone can
say anything they want on the web
information from quality news sources
will mean more than ever before these
days when you ask someone where they saw
a particular news story they often
respond Google News you may not have
produced that story but you are
identified with it quality and integrity
have always been core to Google and
that's why your search tools are so
great your founders realized that search
was the killer app and if it were used
as a sales tool it would diminish its
credibility based on that common desire
for quality there's lots of space for
all of us in the 21st century news
business to find ways to work together
to ensure that quality ethical
journalism prevails thanks and I'm happy
to take any questions yes hi
journalist
and seems like one of the things that
you're doing
so what what you can do is I don't know
whether you've actually certify these
journalists but if you could provide us
with some sort of signal or information
about those journalists then that's
something that we could take into
account in our algorithm for instance
that would that would say okay and is in
addition to just looking at the number
of links that this article gets we'll
look at the reputation of this
journalist and factor that into our
ranking too so is there is there an
effort to I mean is first of all is
there any information that you could
provide us in that regard and second is
there any effort to certify journalists
as part of your training program yeah we
don't tend to certify them and we have
talked about rating or ranking
journalists which is a little bit dicey
because you know we're giving them the
skills they need but how they choose to
go about using them is a different thing
we are chain that has 20,000 journalists
who log in every month to find out about
networking opportunities and one of the
ideas that we were tossing around was a
facebook where they could post the type
of stories that have been written for
other publications and you could see the
type of work you can go up there and see
the type of work that they're doing but
whether we could you know I wouldn't
what I wouldn't want to do is certify
that somebody's taken the the course and
that is an necessarily a guarantee that
you're always going to get quality
journalism we hope that's the case and
we hope that they have the skills but I
think it's a good idea and it's worth
thinking about so is there anything you
can think of that you could tell us or
that we could learn about journalists I
mean we can create signals to figure
this out ourselves but coming from the
journalism standpoint that you could
what should we be looking at that could
tell that could tell us how good a
journalist is or whether or maybe it's
just you know what what are the
characteristics of content that
well we could try what we could think
about is to think about how we could tap
into you know we've been around for 23
years tap into the trainers and the
fellows who have been out in the field
and yet maybe get lists of journalists
that they know are doing really quality
work and the other thing is if if they
pose to they right for you know if
international journalists write
consistently for the AP even on a
freelance basis it's almost a guarantee
that they're reaching a certain level
and there might be if we can get them to
post stories on an IJ net but there
might be a way to do that as well yes ok
I'm just getting a pin you know I can't
be a journalist without a pen in my
handsome um kind of elucidating a little
bit more on what you just said yeah I've
heard other journalists say that there's
this there's this pressure right now on
the web for fracturing and it's coming
from a business standpoint as well
freelance journalists bloggers and that
that's a very different thing from the
New York Times with a newsroom and
editors and the point they make is that
the newsroom and editors and that social
environment actually tends to reinforce
a certain set of ethics that that is
identifiable and that freelance
journalists to a lesser extent and
individual bloggers to a greater extent
have a tendency to fall into some traps
like going native like being more
beholden to their sources than they are
to their audience and other things like
that do you think that and you just said
something about you know someone who's
consistently publishing for the AP is
that's a good that's a good signal that
they're maintaining a certain level of
ethics and reliability do you think that
first off there's some spot where this
balance will naturally fall where
there's sort of a unit of journalism
larger than an individual and smaller
than the New York Times of the AP that
that is naturally viable and that can
well then that can maintain that sense
of integrity and and viability well I
think when you know I think that's a
really good question I'm you know we had
talked about doing some programs for
bloggers here to get them together talk
about what are best practices because
they are on their own often sometimes
they're obviously from from the mass
media and they splintered off and they
have the values but you know when you
work in the newsroom there is so I'm
sure as you work in an organization like
this there are cultural values that do
get passed on from generation to
generation to generation you know we've
evolved to a pretty good state despite
all of our failings a pretty good state
of how to how to balance church state
issues you know in other words where the
business side stops and editorial begins
we know how to separate those interests
we know how to think through tough
issues in the newsroom and if you're you
know what we found internationally is
that a lot of the bloggers want the
journalism training they want you to get
out there and give them the sense of
what is right what is wrong and i will
tell you that's even true in the ethnic
media here we did some programs for
ethnic medium personal finance
journalism and there was huge amount of
confusion about what is a conflict of
interest it wasn't defined at all that
conflicts were were rife so it's a
pretty it's a pretty big issue and I
think that there is a role for training
in that area but I don't think you
should underestimate how important that
is and how important it is to have those
values how important is to check your
facts how important it is to get your
name spelled right and to make sure that
things are in context to make sure that
you know that you're not writing about a
stock that you own and you're pumping it
up as they used to do in China that
you're not in China you're not paid to
go to a press conference I mean it gets
it gets very basic but so I think
there's a lot to be learned and as we do
fragment I think the need for that kind
of training gets gets greater and
greater but as you see like in oh my
news they actually have editors who vet
for
content you'd never think even the new
iterations that are coming up and being
massively successful still have that
role of somebody is is serving as
gatekeeper somebody is serving as as
quality control officer and and I think
that's really essential let me just add
one thing before you know there are some
there's a new program about to take
place at the state university of new
york at at stony brook and this is a
program it's quite interesting it's also
funded by the knight foundation but it's
to teach all students at the University
how to consume news how to be a good
news consumer in other words what is
good journalism in this fragmented world
so some of the training may go to the
consumers of news and some of it needs
to go to the the newly formed
journalists or citizen journalists so if
you take a recent example I saw this bit
more special on the lead up to the Iraq
war and the information that was put
about by I guess what might be called
reputable news organizations in this
country you know basically siding with
colin powell's presentation at the UN
and so on and so forth which now
everybody knows was a load of nonsense
you know everybody the reputable news
media were just I mean they went along
and followed down a blind paths are
right I know what happened they were
completely yeah I mean is it nothing
worked all these good quality training
ethics it just I don't know it didn't
work yeah you know it's not a perfect
it's not a perfect world it's not a
perfect world and there are failings I I
will tell you as a journalist myself
listening to Colin Powell I this was a
reputational thing to and he had a
reputation that he put on the line and
because he had the reputation that he
had I think it carried a certain amount
of credibility whereas if it had been
others it would have been a lot more
difficult and that did help sway
probably a lot of traditional media in
the wrong direction but I'm not saying
it's perfect
but I'm saying that there were dissident
voices even then you could turn to Paul
Krugman at the New York Times and see
that he was against the war and writing
a column on it so it's and is that an
ethical failing or is that a judgmental
failing you know it's it's a it an
ethical failing i would put in a
different category
save us from this tablet absolutely not
maybe trained journalist but somebody
with another view or something when you
start to say that you know make you
think oh that means yes I think multiple
voices are great when I'm what I'm
calling for our quality multiple voices
in other words is that picture that you
just sent in as a as a digital
journalist real is it reliable that
story that you saw in the New York Times
was probably the best judgment of that
group of editors and writers at that
time is is is this a best judgment are
you in the pocket of somebody is
somebody paying you to write this
multiple voices are great yes and you
want them and it's a wonder i'm just
sounding some cautionary notes here but
i love the fact that you know people are
weighing in and I I see is a journalist
multiple ways you can you know you have
a Rolodex of sources and those are
valuable sources but now I can see ways
of exponentially increasing my sources
through digital technology I can see new
where networks forming I can see all
sorts of great things happening I'm not
trying to diminish that I'm just making
a call a call for quality and how do you
know its quality oh hi yes you're hired
where are you I'm sorry Peter Wehner
spoke at Google last year and came into
point that who did sorry uh Peter Wehner
is that New York Times writer and author
and he was talking about okay is his
that his topic was like you need to pay
for reporting in the internet isn't
sufficient and one of his his claims was
that bloggers aren't reporters they echo
reporting and add commentary and by
contrast you're grouping bloggers
together with reporters could you can
you comment on that well bloggers can be
reporters and bloggers can also just be
mouthpieces
I would say that this Egyptian reporter
that we're honoring or bloggers that
we're honoring is a journalist is this
what I would call a citizen journalist I
think you know when I think of myself
somebody said to me you know you should
blog every day on your site because that
will help increase your visibility and
blah blah blah and I can go on there and
off the top of my head you know spin
something on a daily basis I don't think
that's quality you know I just don't
think that's quality maybe you think
maybe other people will think its
quality I really want to go out and do a
little bit of original reporting
original thinking and I think the best
bloggers are people who are experts in
their field who bring something to the
table every day that you want to check
out they've got a great idea they've got
a great insight they've got a great
product whatever it is I think those are
the bloggers that or have a voice that
resonates with you but it's the voice
has to be intelligent in some way or
another and so I think that you know to
me the difference between a blogger and
a columnist I mean they can almost be
the same you might read a person on the
op-ed page because you think they're
there just have a great perspective but
usually those pieces are reported and I
would say the best blogs bring something
new if they just sit there and tell you
the same old stuff every day you're not
going to go return and read it am I
wrong
you're correct but i'll head how that is
pinking up it is comparable to to
bloggers and the most bloggers mark
egyptian your Egyptian example is an
exception but most bloggers aren't going
out there and getting news stories there
themselves they're looking at other news
stories and bring them to your attention
right well that's a that's a different
type of blogging they could be they
could be aggregate they could be
aggregators in a funny way and spinning
out the news but i think the bloggers
that i know that i returned to on a
daily basis or in a frequent basis or
people who i think bring something
special to the table right there a
german there have la goes to a
journalist or who want to communicate
and there i think that's right there
blogger is a very very very big term
yeah go ahead in your talk you talk to
you mentioned ethics and used as example
the publication of some cartoons that
led to riots and injuries of handful of
people and it sounds like in your
response to this question a few minutes
ago you did not categorize the US
coverage anyway of weapons of mass
destruction and things like that as an
ethical failure even though it led to
war and the death of a million iraqis
citizens and things like that I mean
that seems to me like it's a huge
example of an ethical failure and that's
something we should be paying a
tremendous amount of attention to okay
the thing is is the ethics that you know
we have to we have to rely on the
information that we have access to and
we have to rely you know the the
information I mean I don't know when you
found out about when there when there
was meth weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq but I found out only after the
troops went in and they were know it
there are no weapons there I don't know
what again I just don't know if this was
judgment call or you can you know there
were journalists that were writing up at
pieces that this was not a good idea and
they were journalists that were writing
pieces that it was a good idea but the
information that we had to work with was
somewhat somewhat limited and you had
somebody as credible as colin powell
going out there at the UN stating that
they were there now I'm not trying to
defend this because obviously it makes
me you know heartbroken to think about
what's happened but i would i'm not sure
that i put that in the category of i'm
going to step over some line and put
this information out for the sake of
going to war that i'm trying to promote
the US government policy because i
believe this is the right policy and we
need to go to war i'm not sure that that
was the slant of the new york times of
the washington post or any of them i
would bet that it's not
be objective to scroll up show there by
object the question was about
objectivity and bias in a fragmented
digital world and whether you think
they'll be people will go from work
objectivity or more bias I think you'll
see both I think you're going to see you
know extreme voices out there that will
attract certain people because they want
to hear that and I also think that the
ones who get many many eyeballs will be
the ones that make sure that their news
is reliable and and and high quality
because that's what will make people
return and I think that people you know
the question is how do you know and if
you have if you is is branded news worth
anything I mean when I was looking at
google news this morning I saw a lot of
a lot of you know branded news sites
there I also saw some unusual ones that
I didn't know about and that doesn't
mean that they're not good or not bad
they may have great reputations where
they are but the question is making sure
that whoever the new sources that you
feel that this is a really reliable one
because people are coming to you for
that kind of quality I'd like to kind of
go back to the very first question the
guy asked what kind of signals could you
give Google to help Google figure out
the reputation of people and I guess I
want to say to you that the things you
have made a lot of sense and especially
the issue of reputation today in
journalism certainly to me and that the
second part of what I wanted to say is
actually addressed more to the Googlers
here than it is to you but he was asking
you you know what could you do is in a
way what what could you or anyone
outside do for Google to help to help
establish the concept of reputation and
it it seems to me personally and not as
a representative of Google that that
search engines like Google could do
a lot more to to be sensitive to notions
of reputation I have you ever had a
dialogue with people at Google about
development of the notion of reputation
and in well I just got here so I think
we can have that later today maybe
because it seems to me that there's a
good deal more that that could be done
and is probably is something more for
the people at Google to do to support
the concept of reputation but what we
can do is be a great link to many voices
that could be wise counsel our board has
stellar international journalists on it
the journalists that are called and
every time there's a crisis to come try
to figure out what went wrong on Jayson
Blair or whatever the head of Bloomberg
News Lou bacardi of the AP who's you
know a standard bearer of high ethics
jim hogg of the Council on Foreign
Relations who was formerly Daily News
and Chicago publisher we've got a lot of
resources that we can help link up and
and and bring to the ring to the table
for very median Hardy discussions on on
reputation and I'd be happy to do that
hey I just want to say thanks for coming
really appreciate you being here and I
had to miss the first half i had a
meeting i apologize so if this is a
duplicate question i'm sorry i have a
blog myself and i've been studying
journalism and i'd like to be closer to
a journalist and it turns out there's
not a lot of resources that i can find
you'd think MIT or Berkeley or Stanford
would have digitizer their journalism
courses I've looked on iTunes University
where people have gotten podcasts and
there's there's really not a lot in
terms of resources that I've been able
to find so my selfish question would be
along the lines of if I'm a blogger and
want to be closer to a journalist what
steps should I take but the more general
question I guess is what what advice do
you give to bloggers you know who are
looking for those resources or how do we
solve that problem of people who want to
be closer to object
to decrease their bias night you know
not have those coins of complex I think
that you're an underserved market myself
and I think that we've we've been trying
to think about how to do that how to
provide training for us bloggers to
cover international events but you
raised a very interesting proposition
that is also something we can think
about if not for us with another
organization which is a mentoring system
we've been talking a lot about how we
can mentor and it would be a fascinating
thing to have and I'm talking about
mentoring in a more professional sense
where you have not just call somebody up
on a whim but you actually have the
mentee the person who needs the
mentoring setting the agenda saying
these are the things I need for each
meeting having monthly phone calls with
a given journalist and that's something
that would be very interesting to think
about I do think that a lot of the lot
of the Institute's are trying to think
about how to provide training in my in
my you know my struggle in my
incarnation is how do I teach quality
blogging again to digital to journalists
overseas what what are best practices
and I think the pedagogy is not yet
there yet but we will be getting there
because there's you know all journalism
schools are starting to think about it
and I know that our digital journalism
program which I hope takes off in
Guadalajara will be precisely that type
of thing you'll be able to take a
six-week module in X you know in quality
investigative reporting or in digital
reporting or whatever it is so but if
you would like to link up with the
journalist I think we can help you do
that too yes your talk seems to focus
mostly on I guess what I would call
change from within and source material
kinds of things and it seems to me that
very few news organizations today spend
much time reporting on the news of news
itself covering the process of news and
what news readers or consumers or
whatever
I should be looking for as signs of good
quality journalism and I wonder what
you're doing about that what we should
be doing about that things like that
well I mentioned this program for at
suny stony brook where they're trying to
educate news consumers about how to
consume the news i don't think that
newspapers necessarily see themselves or
TV stations as purveyors of teaching
what is quality journalism journalism
schools do that and i think that
consumers aren't going to journalism
well that's what we're seeing a crop of
all new types of programs you know come
up now to try to educate people on what
is quality news when we're you know
we're deal mostly with international
journalists and you know they're up
against turtles that are phenomenally
difficult it could be that you know you
know you heard the description of some
of the just what it takes just to go to
work and and how life-threatening this
can be we deal with issue we just had a
program for Latin American journalists
on how to establish an ethical newsroom
and how do you establish an ethical
newsroom when you don't have necessarily
any kind of infrastructure for that how
do you go about building a consensus to
get that in the newsroom how do you how
do you get the editors to buy in how do
you get the business side to stay away
you know all the kind of things that
that are really crucial and we have some
tools for doing that with international
journalists but I think it's a good
question because I think that there's a
lot of confusion as to what is quality
journalism now that said I have I have
to two kids who you know or our college
age and and they have dealt with
information on the net from the very
beginning and I actually think that
their filter for garbage is pretty high
but I think that interestingly enough
that they they seem to understand that
this is this is just not worth paying
attention to and this
is and when I see that you know my son
has CNN as a home page without me
telling him to go to CNN I think that
that's encouraging in a way because he's
using reliable what reliable news
sources yeah so moving beyond reputation
if we had all the time in the world to
develop new technology how can we what
tools do you think would would help
enable both better quality journalism
and better understanding comprehension
of what's being output by by the
consumers and just to give you two
examples maybe to go off of what about a
better system for providing references
and doing automatic fact-checking or
what about a better user interface for
showing dissenting views on some opinion
yeah those are all good ideas I mean I
think that they're all sort of basics in
terms of you know journalism training
you know check your facts may make sure
your your information is is accurate go
back you know make sure if you have to
that a quote is in context don't pull it
out don't don't use parts of it but what
kind of metrics could use I mean one of
the things that sometimes I'll do a
search just on Google to find something
and what often what pops up of course is
the most widely read story you know when
I check myself out on the web oftentimes
the first story after 25 30 years in
journalism is a story about my son who
happens to be an excellent poker player
and I'm quoted in that story about his
poker playing prowess and so okay that's
interesting statement about me but not
exactly about the type of journalism
that I do so I wonder if there are ways
where you can have searched for quality
quantity whether you can have built-in
ways of searching for quality and how
you would do that I mean would be worth
a much bigger discussion and I think
that would be an enormous service to
readers an enormous service so you can
you can pick the type of search that you
would like to like to get and if it's
for news that's what I want I want
quality
I can't I need I need to trust what
you're telling me because I'm making
decisions on this it's it's it's shaping
my life it's it's potentially affecting
it we're improving my life and I need to
know that this is this is not just
garbage yeah thank you for coming by the
way um so you've mentioned probably
three different new sorts of journalists
or quasi a journalist digital journalist
citizen journalists who I guess our
happened you know happened to be in the
right place at the right time and then
write up something bloggers who I think
maybe you're delineating journalist
versus bloggers is whether they're just
you know op-ed mouthpieces versus
actually trying to do real journalism
and then that last category I sort of
the new digital journalist where they're
there freelance journalist but they're
not necessarily attached to any
organization and that particular group
of people seems like they're working
very hard to to put you know quality
journalism out and how much are they
promoting themselves and the work that
they do because obviously you you have
to find them and they have to make
themselves known and for for google I
mean it really helps if people advertise
themselves because you know search
engines do well when when things are
linked well and people work hard to
promote themselves so I'm interested in
how how do you find these new
journalists do they come to you or do
you just we have we have people training
all over the world so often times like
when we solicit for our awards we get we
get thousands of you know people that
get our email and people write in and
say this is an excellent candidate here
this is an excellent candidate here and
we build kind of a understanding of
who's doing groundbreaking stuff we're
now like on the
of sort of the digital revolution in the
emerging markets now clearly there are
some countries in Asia that are you know
on the cutting edge but the vast
majority are first getting their heads
around it and and you were first
starting to see who can do what so we
don't have a very very very long list
but what we want to do is make sure that
we can get out there and provide the
skills now and the knowledge of how to
do it well and what doing it well really
means so that you guys can capture them
and put them there and I'd also like to
think about how how I think we can be a
very good broker with that whole
universe of aspiring journalists out
there digital journalists high-quality
digital journalists and you know again I
mentioned in the speech as we cut back
in newsrooms overseas you know I was
overseas for 11 years as a correspondent
and you know they knew what they were
getting when they sent me overseas you
know they knew the type of reporting and
they knew what they can trust and you
know what you have to understand that
there's this very very high risk of if
you if you hire somebody that you don't
know and you get slept with some lawsuit
in some country where there isn't the
First Amendment you had a lot of
problems on your hands so it's a very
very dicey situation so that's why you
know you had international journal you
know you had journalists from your own
organization go out and then you can
train analysts who are local on the
ground and have them come up through the
ranks but now we're that's that's
disappearing and now we're just trying
to identify who can be really good
sources for this type of stuff but it
isn't easy and journalists don't
normally go out there and self promote
they let their work do it and they let
other people promote you know they'll
say oh look this guy's doing great work
in Pakistan I want to hire him as my
stringer and and I think by using and
seeing who is hiring these people what
type of photo journalists are getting
picked up by all the news agencies what
type of freelance journalists are being
used by Bloomberg this one that one if
Bloomberg does indeed use freelancers is
worth is is worth mana
and that could be a quality control
mechanism thank you thank you very much
for my pleasure thank you for inviting
