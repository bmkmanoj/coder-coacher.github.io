great welcome to GTECH this is the
official launch of GTECH last night was
a prejack a pre g tag session and i hope
i actually did see many of you there so
hopefully you had a good time and got to
see some great talks from google
engineers about google technology today
we're going to launch G Tech which will
actually only have four speakers from
Google and the rest will be from the
industry and if you remember and you did
vote
you know those speakers are because this
is part of your selection I wanted to
welcome you on behalf of the committee
they've worked really really hard to
make sure that this event came together
these are the familiar faces that you'll
see walking around so if you have any
things that you need anything you need
help with and all the things they've
been helping you with already please
reach out to any one of us and we'll
hopefully make the rest of you stay here
great I just wanted to touch briefly
about the theme this morning why did we
pick a team of tests to test ability in
the past we've really had G Tech which
is a test automation conference and what
I really wanted to do this year was
expand the T in DTAC to mean more than
test and that's really the challenge
that I want to propose to this set of
folks to go through the discussions
we're gonna have the presentations that
I got to be proposed and then there it's
a set of interactive activities that we
planned around it you will see that
there will be various talks they will
discuss test automation there will be
things about testability and our goal is
to say how test has two billion test
automation can come together and make
the software development process more
efficient and move faster we saw some
talks yesterday about angular and so on
which is actually the the framework that
can make it faster for you and I'm
hoping the rest of the talks today and
tomorrow will expose some of these the
thought process and real experiences
that are out there and why is this
important I think the times have changed
typical software development processes
are changing we're moving into the cloud
and as a result the fast pace of
development and deployment and reaching
out to our customers is changing the way
we think
about tests and testability and
deployment and release so it's it's a
way that it's we're at the right time
and we want to be able to use your in
collective intellectual to come up with
some great solutions and we look forward
to that
the last point there on the sub sub
bullet is address the root issue I think
the point is that the value systems that
develop as part of testing and the
stigma associated with it I think
there's a lot of smarter engineers that
do this because they are passionate
they're trying to change the system
they're trying to make sure that people
understand the value of quality and good
design and this is an opportunity for us
to get together and discuss how we can
push this upstream and and the cloud
really enables that because if you want
to talk about pushing quality upstream
testability is the heart of it and it
should be baked into your design and
everything that comes after that is sort
of an afterthought and sometimes a
band-aid and we want to try and see if
we can excite people come up with you
methodologies or discussions that can
make that happen so just a little bit
more about G tag this year we call it G
tag with the twist we tried different
approaches that we think we're really
successful we'd love to hear your
feedback on that we selected the
attendees first and then allowed you to
vote for the speakers that you wanted to
see and if you if you have been to
multiple conferences you know that a lot
of times you don't have a choice of the
speakers there and a lot of people give
feedback that the speakers weren't
really and the topics weren't really
what they were looking forward to so
hopefully we've addressed that and you
will have a say in giving feedback as
the as the day progresses there should
be feedback forms on your tables if
they're not already there or in your
packet but we will get them to you we
love your feedback so we can think about
how to improve a GTECH in the coming
years we actually encourage people to
submit proposals either as a preview in
video format so that the committee could
evaluate the the content and also the
speaking style and other other subtle
elements unfortunately we didn't get too
many of those but we did get lightning
talks we actually have one
thing or two in in those format and we
would do more lightning talks and I'll
talk about that in a bit
and of course the pre G tack event that
happened yesterday we are Google so we
talked about data so I thought I'll
share a little bit of data about what's
gone into setting this conference we had
over 500 applicants we accepted 98 we
tried to keep a very healthy balance
between Google googlers and non-googlers
and if you can see the numbers here that
is the notion to get the right set of
people in the room to have these
discussions we actually have a little
bit more Googlers than the number 20 and
that's because we have people from
Google staff and senior leadership
that's here so you'll see a bunch of us
over there so the numbers a little bit
skewed to that side we had a call for
proposals we got 80 plus proposals and
we actually split them up into three
different categories and 21 of these
proposals were from Googlers themselves
and again we tried to make sure that
this was not a Google intensive talk so
we had to balance out between how many
Google talks there were and that
actually led to the pre jitta GTECH
event because we wanted to make sure
that the great speakers we had also an
opportunity to share the technology is
at Google there are 52 companies
represented 23 countries and that's the
way the best we can guess based on
passports information that we got so we
would might be off here seven
universities between people who are from
universities at this present point the
students or faculty two committees of
course the planning committee and the
logistics committee and one GTECH so and
of course there are other speakers I'm
gonna I think you will introduce them as
we go through the day today and tomorrow
but a very happy set of speakers they're
all here they've all made it and we we
met up with them last night everybody
was high on energy and looking forward
to presenting their thoughts to to this
forum and we're happy to have a mere
welcome every one of you and we hope you
would have a great GTECH in the next two
days just some stats about our site we
had about 11,000 plus visits 26,000 page
views and 7,500 unique visitors that
came to the site
that speaks to the the interest that is
available in G tach xxx 3% of these were
direct hits to the GTA abyss site 37
search engines and 30% referring sites
and I think the referring sites are
mostly the conference sites that we
enrolled into and also the Google
testing blog the top three countries
traffic the first one is no surprise
this event being held in India and jaea
back for the first time so we had a lot
of traffic in India and then the US and
the UK followed in that in that
particular order and just this is some
highlight about how many people actually
voted on the speaker discussion we had
so we received a 185 votes this was
spread across three categories of test
automation testing and testability and I
think the participation sort of tapered
off by the time we reach the third
category but the first one was pretty
much full so but it was hopefully a
worthwhile exercise for you all will
love your feedback on how this went a
brief discussion about today's agenda
you will have the agenda in your
booklets it's also at the back of your
nametags
so you can actually have easy access to
the agenda we will start off hopefully
and we have started on time and the
keynote by Bob binder will be next and
we will go through the day we have a
bunch of breaks baked in and we have
some fun activities to make sure that
the energy level stays high and that you
get to know each other a little bit more
I do encourage everybody to mingle more
at your table and outside of this and
during the breaks because that's one of
the best opportunities you have of
mingling with people across the across
the globe that I hear we as you can see
we've split the agenda into themes these
are correlated to some of the themes we
had on the voting sites so we have test
automation we're going on first and then
testability and tomorrow we'll talk
about testing a bit more in detail some
housekeeping details we do have
lightning talks planned for today and
tomorrow
and we have asked people to think about
lightning talks yet we want them to be
spontaneous as well if you want to sign
up for a lightning talk we encourage you
to come in the corner over there in the
middle there's a board you can sign up
for it
world's going to be driving that so I
invite you to go up there and as you
have a thought about a thing you want to
present please step up there and sign up
we encourage no heavy-duty slides other
than maybe your name and your theme on
these lightning talks
these are today and tomorrow so you'll
have another opportunity to do so
tomorrow feedback again there'll be
feedback forms that will be available to
you please take the moment to actually
fill those out eventually at the end of
the off-site way of the conference we
would be handing giving you a URL to do
an online forum as well so you'll have a
second opportunity at that point in time
if you need internet connectivity again
reach out to one of our the committee
members and we'll be able to provide you
with the access codes for the
connectivity we do ask that if you are
go to VPN into your corporate gateways
that you keep it to limit a limited
because we only have a certain set of
those gateways open based on the hotel's
access points so please use them and log
off as much as you need so I would
invite you to participate in this
activity or let a fun mingling and heavy
discussion there is a lot of information
in your handouts that we'll discuss
about a profiles of each of the speakers
some about the committee and the deep
agenda we have an invitation or a
welcome note from Patrick Copeland who's
our focus area or the global leadership
global leadership of and productivity in
Mountain View he couldn't be here today
because he just had a baby so he sends
his regards and sends his greetings and
that's part of the booklet that you will
see at the at the end of it basically
I'm going to now invite Robert binder
Bob to come up and kick off the the
conference here today we will have two
keynotes one on each day and then a
closing keynotes tomorrow by James
Whittaker
and Bob's gonna kick us off Bob's a
software intrapreneur and a patent
holder a pioneer in many ways I'm just
gonna read out some key aspects of his
profile which are very astounding he was
