about cover a response to a solution to
determine system of linear equations
O'Meara and this is joint work with yes
he's currently sitting i miss india and
work with you and also they are you
Kamiko going to the problem they just
give it with the application this
application comes from a smart hit where
energy is distributed from the
distribution side the household is in
three different phases the each of this
household is connected to one of these
feathers what are these faces so when
the conditions are made this household
closer the distributor knows that this
house is connected to this particular
faith but after a certain number of
times repair each other repair or some
of that isn't this phase i think we just
change but the shooter doesn't know
about that but what I distributor the
phases and means should information
should be they are guilty team because
this helps in reducing our ignorance is
and if there's value in route then and
this then the usual so to make the phase
imbalance goes very low he has to move
exactly which houses an equal to K so in
this problem we are going to solve this
is a segment problem okay so simple
approach would be something like you
shut down one particular space and see
where the
who are complaining and that is very
Nigel back that is there is disruptive
you cannot like this concepts and mr.
contract agreement and you give a lot of
money back so other could be same giving
you each and every rose and see which
which house is connected from work but
chlorophyll but again this is very
expensive so it's in the den got lots of
data with a distributed because what is
it going what is happening in the
tentative a distributed network so these
must marketers EE after every second
time interval this week are saying how
much energy is consumed friend but by
the effect red horse would so these guys
are coming to the distributor and also
to retire soon transform aside it is to
boot on roof but this particular case
this method I to has spain spain but for
this particular time interval so we have
this two sets of data and using these
two sets of data can be family from that
particular algorithm to find out the
thing okay and there might be some some
error in the measurement some of the
houses was switched on something like
that there is no data or definitely some
supra- event because the time interval
that that I can transform us a
commission rates and housework winds up
in there should be some some synchronous
Angela and also there might be some
transmission costs because the power is
coming to give them but for all what we
assume is these errors to be 0 okay so
problem for information so let us
probably this problem for a particular
case so input to this problem with the
restroom I want gets more metrics that I
I attainment of the matrix give the
you buy back your house Jay in the if'
time interval and VI the transformer for
marketing at the eye center and output
of this problem with it binary with this
is so exciting on whether a particular
house a scientist electricity so thick
with a constraint that the energy from
the Sun Royce x-ray this term eix
denounced that photo amount of energy
consumed by all the households and VI
corresponds to the lay a coupon at
ascend from the cosmo cosmo no say-so
equidistant these two quantities and we
get this constant here also evidence
that we ignore the law system so if you
solve this problem individually for each
pin and we can if we can guarantee that
these functions are the exact they then
after getting back the solution for is
this each of these pages if we simply
combine those those relations you should
wear to the overall solution so
observation so a 22 to get the exact
assignments to get the exact assignments
we have to come up with some shorter who
this is ax equal to P this set of linear
equations so that the soldier who has
only one function is all
unique solution so that when the surface
source said whatever they sell
significant a that that you can assume
that since that is the image also that
is the is a segment so if there is there
is only one user then this problem
becomes is the subjects of the
all-inclusive is classic north infinite
program on the other hand if there are
enough video be in the and we have been
a number of measurements in the ramp the
whole system is food regulations and
simply something that the solution so
far too personally asked that is there a
possibility that using me in Turing
lesser number of measurements can
achieve that uniqueness so that the
software takes the guess a number of
measurements and we get the solution so
this is the research program great where
they took title and for this talk I
really focus on that place when you just
know that the number of motion connected
to a particular type it is some small
quantity a so we want to give us an idea
so that even in this case it takes that
it does what it is small and the
algorithm and out solutions you can use
a number of measurements so for this
contribution is that we take this this
therapy recovery because recovery
algorithm which minimizes the sum of all
tech size with this package is the
constant and then we give a necessary
and sufficient condition for i get if
they exempt recovery and when I under
make the batteries if the random matrix
a the property that
people we try to find out the
probability of this exact the condition
/ to sex act very satisfied and to show
that this the finding the probability is
is related to the problem in Cuba tree
in the SF problem and as far as oh nice
boost this connection is new in
comparisons and using the immigration
data we conjunctive that first pass the
scales faster region so listen the
company will be something the number of
measurements regard for exactly is
something like came into is invited
where it is the man heading into
function so the outline of the talk will
be but I make some good preventable
videos once and then the question is do
you think I'm getting back punk
foundation and the produce of getting
the conditions are spread and the
simplicity then one of the reverse what
is vitamin message in an earache what
did he take they took it a modified the
transformation of the problem where they
use the signals of binary signals of h
plus and minus 1 and 1 to +1 and for
this system they gave conditions for a
quick recovery and also for
endometriosis they wrote that that is
how i phrase this transition behavior of
this recipe accommodating people as
things large it seems like when the
number of music mix is less than things
i do then cannot recover attorneys get
eternal embed within this technique as
e-commerce exactly but the problem with
that they didn't consider this fashion
doc the last week's considers particular
concern series by the home antenna but
they consider the spa services to be
identical to efficiently in academics
fears of their particular so using the
evolution a case personally feminine
face stay in between severe month it is
true kings of Ireland and n minus the
entries have been very sweet cider
grandma but with this notion from the
sparsity the binary sourcing is always
zero space because there is no no
guarantee we take you back once so we
can use the first people who use their
approach for our mission of specific you
have to realize these week a constant
whatever but it is this the since the
current is constant we are using
something so whatever the birthday is
the things is attacking some something
another so we so we considered another
thing that that the sparsity should
simply have gotten you are using that
number one should be a number of 0 n
minus K and we should be just that if
you consider so now we go to the
Canadian Spanish Spanish simple solution
to the fine let us let a point the
latest furnishing this is the NPD
texture and you divide thus the
innocence of a face in ruku bus by set
of music setup takes place that is you
and another sip why it takes one and you
see the first for me what's coming
columns of the matrix rightly so left
i'm giving an example now the first part
of the columns represent each of these
columns as a pointing out after dividing
spit so in this is all the all the
problems for which excess that is you
and representing by red and all the
other columns for each wave x-rays very
one bye-bye green so that I the theorem
that we have in the paper that case is
an image tradition if if we consider two
to converse as 11 mixer is of the points
of red points equal including the Virgin
convince above the period points if
these two columns by myself else has a
common fine then there cannot be any
researcher so what they need this to
happen this poop on Nexus should be
mutually exclusive this is not the
income wine so for this problem you can
see them this is particularly
expert unit you take an example where
the gets the recent election one piece
is change and in that case the school
term XX so I work making the proof of
this is in the vapor and he didn't which
is a simple application of very version
is a 5-1 in user where he gave the
Phoenicians for a generic AP mean this
punishment for point officer now
I go the you can see that that there is
some version of the points and then the
foundation so this case is probably
related to that the casing of the office
set of my dream haha in the glorious
this this substitution scale so that
those points can be separated from the
rest of the point I have a plane six
points and two subsets can be separated
from the others ok now i show the
relationship between the a probability
of getting the exact solution and a
program so but he arguing replacing the
poverty that that
solution for an enemy raining and
suppose that it is drawn from the
description fire changing other column
cosmic matter in that particular case
here is the expected number of cases /
yes so even if you generate the random i
can say you see the farmer and the sea
dog whines india africa buddy and see
how many of them are a number of gay sex
for toast wine event various together
with the property this is this is this
sounds from this we get an indicator
random believer from each of these
what's of the fetuses and in that case
it is in fact sake of subsets of size
scale is a passive aggressive in second
i am very good 10 then you can see that
since that columns are exchangeable so
the probability that a particular
subsequent village actually yes it is a
data breach we subsidy commission is
that is following then we'll be done to
fear me and this is expected this is so
this case is probably having fish
studies in common
combinational finishing problems and are
but they're just focus work to find out
what is the maximum number of assets
possible Fred / party for a particular
for a particular set of clients and but
there is there is only one one one where
they are considered for random set of
points but then I am as you know that
isn't they give me some kind of a
problem but for our political situation
you need something like donkeys that I
go to the signals so weak similar to
three different currently equipment and
we inherited mutation and 200m of
instances for each of these data points
and what the sacks of the how many on
that 200 was actually a successful in
current solution second so I first i'll
give the competition period it removes
their LP so here we plot and the excess
is Jeff let me know my number of
measurements of perfection of protein
number of the tables and the y-axis the
spot specific kill as a factor of number
of reservation and in the z axis the
success rate now if we see the deficits
was a success with particular succeeding
we see is see some cut like this if you
like another a successive we get another
dog and this access le increase the
success we seek a pen and moon
mentioned that this man's become with
this arrow as any come to life so this
development is ready to bust and hit it
so I we need similar xmas acquire a
clear my shorts weather the country I
think the first up from again so the the
the time the human below this stuff is
where the Holy Land Securities Heights
accident so much soup even if the vision
for succeeded 24-hour is more then I
compared with the monofilament safely
and yeah we only show the label sick for
your pant leg and we see that that it
and here we brought against passage of
excellence initiative system he doesn't
varsity and whatever variations of
already have shown that that we use it
bitches so I binders I'm trying to
understand when you talk about success
rates and your original problem from the
bay area so i have my smart meter put
recently so detection measure this
against the week the reality real data
set no we generated on because one thing
i have intermediate the random matrix a
is from standard normal distribution so
that they're kind of something like that
negative designer tunnel it means you so
you can have some limitations but in-
realism in smart with other mixing so we
also be some experiment physics
experiments on keeping something like
the normal distribution but not making
me for that we want to keep the car
similar so i'm using in the crapper
to a question regarding what was the
last curve that you show so if we want
for that yes and so in the case of your
curves it seems that there is a regime
where sparse does matter and then second
regime where you didn't vote one by two
bigger to two different regimes behavior
enjoy any comments on our dynamic theory
that is why you getting that up the
girls how many existed was the news at
least faced mounting emitter central
idea okay but we have not done it but
but the basic understanding is that if
the sparsity here if the sparsity it's a
clear by name is equal to 1 that means
what that number of measurements is
occurring because you can immerse
sparkle today swing like this you are
expected to get
is what you say that if you're never
going to have what we have yes no one is
already half means you have enough
middle measurements and in that case
sparsity other questions
ok let's take this secure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
