today we have a very fun guest here it's
Alana's Peru guzik from Harvard
University let me introduce him a little
bit 2004 he got his PhD in physical
chemistry from Berkeley and then in 2006
he became assistant professor at Harvard
for chemistry and chemical biology and
this turned into a full professorship in
2013
Elan thought maybe in the announcement
has a very accomplished resume was a lot
of awards maybe just to call out to is C
MIT Technology T our 35 award for young
innovators under 35 he also has a
prestigious DARPA young innovator award
and I think it's probably fair to say
that Elan spearheaded or founded the
group of or the field of doing quantum
computing for chemistry and that
included actually playing as early as
possible with emerging quantum hardware
so he was one of the first users of the
d-wave machine and he's now eager to try
out latest algorithms on the chips that
come out of the quantum hardware group
in Santa Barbara the talk he will give
today is addressing another area of
interest of Ilan's that is applying Big
Data approaches machine learning
approaches to molecule discovery and
material discovery so looking very much
forward to that talk thank you so so yes
I guess my group has two parts one it
has to do with material discovery one
has to do with quantum computing
I came wearing both hats to talk about
funny computing but also to really talk
to you guys expert on
so let me just begin by stating that if
you think about the challenges of the
21st century for example even the
challenge of water filtration you might
or purifications you might think about
there may be some materials that
actually will allow you to this cheaper
or the discovery of drugs or the
discovery of a lot of energy generation
and storage materials so if you think
about a lot of the challenges of
humanity they eventually touch into a
material that we could make cheaper we
make longer label to make better so this
is kind of one of the motivations of why
we do what we do let's just begin just
by counting just thinking about you know
how many how many molecules that our
total is just begin by thinking about
how many atoms just single atom stuck in
just the visible space does anybody have
any idea order of magnitude you can be
you can be off by several orders of
magnitude we're at Google we're about
off by 20 orders of magnitude is ten to
the eighty two atoms in the cerebral
universe so just counting the number of
atoms but you know if you remember atoms
are kind of like LEGO pieces you can
take a nap to man come in and to really
pull it with another have to man another
item another atom to make a molecule
right so if you now you think about
molecules that are roughly accessible by
our synthetic techniques and now there
are people are making robots like Marty
for cattle at urbana-champaign are
making these robots to make molecules
combinatorially if you think about how
many molecules can you make right it's
actually a larger number chemical space
is actually estimated in the literature
with a bigger orbit in ten to the six to
ten to the hundred eighty of course in
principle is infinite because you can
keep building larger and larger now your
polymers you know molecular
exponentially going molecular complexity
but access synthetic accessible
molecules that you might make you know
with reasonable amount of cost we're
talking about maybe this order of
magnitude so chemical spaces in bands
and the question of how to search it to
find the solutions to those problems is
what is interesting to me so what are
the tools that we use to actually go on
exploring that space well the first
thing that you want to think about is
maybe this this idea right in mind that
I have a huge database of molecules and
then I use look at
molecule and pull it out of the database
I actually use the Google Images
database actually I just pulled a random
molecule from Google Images and here it
is right and the question that I don't
ask you since molecule before a bola or
is good for solar cells or is it good
for storing energy that would be
actually the best possible kind of
project that you could look at the
classification of the entire chemical
space right and we try to go there
eventually but you can also think of a
simpler possible idea which is you take
the same molecule and you ask yourself
one question okay like how good is this
molecule is a solar cell material okay
do you see it's a slightly different
problem because now I just instead of
like trying to find all the possible
uses for a molecule and let's just
concentrate on one that's we like to
call in chemistry or in mattias
screening problem I want to screen for a
particular property and the tools that I
just revealed he'd already quantum
mechanics and machine learning are the
two tools that we actually we're going
to employ and I use quantum mechanics
here although I think a lot about what
is quantum mechanics in the quantum
computing side of my life here I use
quantum mechanics as a mechanic okay so
I'm not interested in this meaning of
the wave function okay this is a poem
that was written by Schrodinger about
Eric who killed a NICU kid was amazing
he actually used pencil and paper in the
war to actually calculate molecular
structures with my hand okay and
actually the metals our employer
actually they they you know the
great-grandchildren of these methods
okay
so metals are actually take a molecular
structure and then use quantum mechanics
to calculate these properties so that's
one of the metals that we use and the
other one of course is machine learning
I'm at Google so I want to show a quote
of Bill Gates okay but it's actually
relevant I think the quote to Bill Gates
you can read it there and see why
because you know a break for machine
learning will be worked in Microsoft's
and while we're sitting here at Google
so so now what is the idea of screening
okay so we have a space let us be
conservative let's assume the space of
CAP synthetic available molecules
essentially 60 I don't have the
amount of computer power that you guys
have I'll show you have a lot but I
don't have as much as you guys have and
of course I don't want to wait forever
so unreasonable size of chemical space
that I can chunk is ten orders of
magnitude smaller than the number of
available molecules that mean for a
particular project I can take about a
million molecules maybe it's a hundred
thousand maybe 10 million that's roughly
the amount of molecules that I can
actually look at in chemical space so
that first space of searching you know
reducing 10 10 to the 6 10 to the 6 is
an art onto itself there's a lot of like
stuff that we're developing in my group
to do that so I'll tell you more about
it but that's the first step and then
you're gonna come up with different
computational screens hopefully a very
cheap method first that actually can
look at all of them and actually
classify them and say you know these are
good to look at you know this other ones
you throw them away use a better method
use a better method and then you
eventually get to the point of the proof
right you actually want to talk to
experimental is to make the molecule you
wanna go on convince some human to spend
about half a year of their life in a
food with gloves to make the molecule
that you design in the computer that's a
very tough problem and actually we work
a lot in the in the theory experimental
interaction software tools actually even
how to talk to these people and convince
them that is a way there to make your
molecule actually it's a very
complicated situation and then you wanna
feel that this very very very very rare
data points you're gonna get from
experiment and chop or modify your niche
the library as soon as possible and
iterate as soon as possible so in my
group we have done several projects that
use this type of technology that we've
been developing I'll give you this talk
in kind of an over there of how we learn
how to do things better and start to you
telling you about this Harvard community
project which was our generation 1.0
project then I move on to our organic
flow battery project which I like to
call a 2.0 project and then organically
it is 3.0 and then all use of like to
just cool and
time to tell you about if anybody wants
to talk to me about how life started
we're using the same tools to explore
chemical networks to think about how
life started okay but let's just begin
by the beginning so the first thing is
what type of molecules do we search for
when I say my peers I really talk about
organic materials more precisely I'd
like to think about it as the field of
fine chemicals just small to medium
molecules for polymers but what we do is
actually very well aligned with the u.s.
materials genome initiative actually
when this man initiative was started I
got an email that I thought it was spam
it said greetings from the White House
and I opened it and actually was written
from the White House they were talking
to me about possibility of initiating
this type of initiative we're one of the
few researchers that we're doing that at
the time now it's a big thing the idea
is of course we have in the United
States we have this advantage of
computational science but don't by
people like you guys big data how can we
combine those two with experimental
tools to actually advance Humanity in
all these different areas and of course
benefit the country I'm going to feed
the world so we recently got a review in
animal reviews of materials research
that actually talks about the slight
differences between screening for pharma
every time I tell people about this they
say oh why don't you work on pharma when
I tell them is quite hard to predict if
the molecule is gonna cross the
blood-brain barrier or if it's gonna be
you know toxic to the liver and stuff I
prefer just to make sure if something
sticks to something else or if it's
bright or blue or something like that
okay there's less problems in screening
for for materials than screening for
health okay and finally there's a lot of
people to think about materials did you
think about solid state materials turns
out there's very few of very few alloys
very few periodic materials there's many
many many many many more piece ways of
making molecular lego pieces than
periodic materials okay so anyway that's
just a different type of features of
this space I'm not gonna go into detail
now I have a new metric which is the
metric is like if you want to measure
the success of a theoretical chemist you
wanna figure out how many materials this
person has predicted and they have been
made and have been characterized and
they are actually good materials and if
you apply this metric to most of my
colleagues including me all the way up
to 2000
the measure will be zero that's the
expectation value okay
many many many people talk to you about
it say oh I'm gonna make materials in
the computer and so on and it is because
they don't talk to experimentalists they
don't do a lot of screening and so on
that they are not successful and we've
been painfully trying to be more and
more successful about it so when you
talk to somebody that does these
materials genomics as this field is
called as them how many materials have
you predicted that's the first thing you
want to talk to them about okay so this
is our first one look this was actually
cutting down chemical space of 10 to the
60 to 8 okay so we have this very you
know point pointed idea that variance of
a particular chemical molecule or
crystal we're going to be good so we
calculate an 8 particular molecular
crystal structure which looked like this
and then finally our collaborators in
about Stanford called us with the news
of the you know several years we stuck
to the project in 2007 okay so four
years we'd convince people to make it
and you know it was measure and the
posters were leaving and coming we end
up with a molecule that has a whole
mobility of 14 centimeter squares over a
volt second the fear of Merit for
example is amorphous silicon it's about
one you know you know there are much
more conducting things like pure silicon
right you know in Congress or thousands
but you know this is actually really
pretty good okay so it's a sec at the
time it was the second-highest whole
mobility material organic material which
is good for flexible organic electronics
and so on so that was our first one so
at this one we have one but you know we
screen one molecule
sorry eight molecules so now so you know
the first idea of my group and we
started in 2006 was well let's try to go
and try to come up with these materials
this is the first world view of
materials I'm going to tell you about
they are called organic photovoltaics
you can imagine printing out these
flexible plastic devices that you can
put this court in so I could replace the
court ends in this beautiful Sony
building with actually light harvesting
units where I can cover your parking lot
or I can cover the huge freeways of Los
Angeles or super importantly I can
charge an Android phone by using a path
right that would be very very useful to
me at least but now that's the first
worldview
actually the company that did this
Kanaka is on there okay the real user
fig is more for this type of people okay
you have one point four billion people
in the world they have no electricity
you wanna get them off the grid you have
these people that could potentially use
these little panels here to harvest
sunlight for the house you could imagine
having the reverse organic
light-emitting diodes flexible one so
she can read at night and actually this
is actually work of Sheila Kemeny out of
MIT that is thinking of it's flexible
photovoltaics she's working with which
all Indians in Mexico and think about
that they can even make solar Poncho's
as you can see here will be more hipster
than having a solar poncho okay so so
that's the kind of thing that I think we
really can change your mind okay
so now see if my paperwork's already got
that do this colleague is mom there
okay okay so that's the idea so how does
your gran external service work a little
bit of chemistry you have this blend of
donor material and acceptor material a
material that absorbs sunlight majority
early creates what is called an exit on
it's an electron and hole pair okay so
you don't getting materials they
separate and that's how most
photovoltaics work but inorganic
materials electron the whole are bound
to each other so they move around
together but then the region acceptor
that dissociates sucks the electron and
leaves a hole in the donor so I'm gonna
show you let me mention that one of my
undergrad it's made about this but first
before the animation let me just tell
you a little bit about chemistry
there's monic molecules with quantum
mechanical they have energy levels that
are discretized so one of the energy
levels of matters is the highest
occupied molecular orbital homo right
is it the last energy level the quantum
mechanical that is occupied by two
electrons and then the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital okay is the one that
you can excite into when you perform an
Exeter okay
so the relevant parameters for this very
simple model is that the gap or energy
difference between a homo and LUMO and
the position of the home or position of
the LUMO determine the relative position
respect to the acceptor you want
to be low in energy and you also want
the homo as deep as possible I really of
course below oxygen otherwise your
plastics or our self oxidizes right
which would suck right if you make this
plastic that have its own light and then
it oxidizes so those are the same
parameters that we are after in this
particular project and this is a video
of my student that shows you the mess
this is actually the rest this is
actually an atomistic morphology
obtained from Jenny nurse women in
Imperial College in London we just made
a beautiful animation around it of the
electron and hole moving this is not the
results of any simulation but it gives
you an idea of the messy structure of
donor blended with acceptor we have a
dramatic rotation around the acceptor
and then as you will see the electron go
to the full ring which is in the
acceptor in this case and the hole will
remain in the in the polymer now you
have this beautiful journey our cross is
amorphous material all the way down to
the electrodes closing the circuit and
then basically generating a quorum
hopefully you can store in a battery or
connect your to your iPhone so anyway so
that's that's the story this is an
amorphous material and the question is
well do I need to simulate to left
amorphous stuff or maybe I can use
techniques like machine learning and
related tools to actually learn
something about it so now this is the
the modeled and very simplified model
that we use to begin the screening the
the shot Mac Ishod Wair
actually for me the corner car and now
professor in it Austria developed a
model that says that you know if you
have a band gap of about one and a half
electron volts and a LUMO level of minus
four electron volts then you have about
the 10% efficiency of the polymer and
then on a molecule and if not then
you're about two three four five percent
solar compression efficiency means the
efficiency that you get of thinking
about the power conversion efficiency of
the sunlight coming in to power that you
can draw out of the solar cell okay so
based on that what we did is well let's
try to slice of chemical space so this
is the the first decision that could
have been done better in generation 1.9
our
we talked to our experimental colleagues
at Stanford and Shin about all those
well this that is 26 fragments and if
you combine combinatorially you can come
up you know many this may be good for
ourselves there so we said okay cool so
we wrote the script you can imagine the
Pythons combines all the molecules you
end up with three million molecules and
there you go how do we compute them so
then that's when we started to harvest
some of the you know computer power out
there some of you might remember if
you're old enough the SETI at home
project it's still going on but when I
was an undergraduate back in Mexico it
was really cool people were just
downloading the screensaver to for your
trash from this guy and find this little
green aliens here right so that's
basically what they did at the time and
what I did is basically free partner
with IBM and Stanford and now we're
partnered with buffalo my former poster
to start to this project and we started
a hybrid energy project which actually
uses the IBM world community great to
use per CPU cycles to compute and of
course what we do is generate also a
beautiful screensaver and calculate we
have calculated roughly 32,000 CPU years
that's equivalent about fifty five
hundred million quantum chemistry
calculations so this is to our knowledge
the largest ever quantum chemistry
solving ok so again this is another
video of course at Google is going to be
very primitive but you can in mind we're
saying here you're going to have these
three million molecules
you're gonna distribute over all these
banana computers that people have around
the world and then in each one of those
banana computers you're going to
actually compute one of these particular
oligomers that we generated
combinatorially and then try to find
which one is a golden one all right so
that's basically what we did and maybe
you know if you are lucky you get the
lottery back so how efficient is this
process right let's see so that's
basically the sharper plot remember this
is the region here that you have about
ten percent this is the first plot probe
you have ever seen that has log of
molecule Norcom number of molecules
calculated with quantum come what in
chemistry usually each molecule takes
twelve hours of computer time this is an
aggregated huge data set right that
shows you that the ten percent efficient
solar
is about only 1.5 percent for example or
35,000 molecules right so this is I love
my dose of computer time and I'm working
towards making them more useful because
right now I have the bowler yes to them
in the sense that most of them were
computing very crappy molecules right so
only only 1.5 percent of them were doing
good molecules so can we do better than
that and of course all of you Google
people say yes come on do things like
Gaussian processes right so can I fit a
model right it allows me to seek through
these molecules before I send them for
quantum chemistry to all these poor
people there are donating computer time
let me build a little model that
actually is calibrated against
experiment I can helps me quickly sift
through this in other words add another
layer okay today and of course I also
process is an invariant this Gaussian
distribution will your any observations
is a very beautiful theory okay and you
know do you guys know much more about
them than with than I do I guess but of
course you have to come up with some
function that is called the kernel that
gives you some idea of the distance
between these two different objects so
you have to encode them in some sort of
function X I will discuss in a second
you have to have a length scale and this
pre factor here that gives you an idea
of of the of the your your own choice of
what's gonna be the distance so the
height parameters you're going to take
reasonably the distance between your
points so there's a maximum covariance
and the length of this kernel and what
do you put him and actually was talking
too hard what a lot yesterday in dinner
what exactly you put in there to
identify a molecule so now we borrow
from over Pharma colleagues and we for
my colleagues say well we have this
algorithm called Morgan single and
fingerprints that takes a
two-dimensional structure of a molecule
looks at it as a graph for example this
carbon atom and starts going recursively
in the graph and looking at all the
nearest neighbors okay this does a
concept for chemical functional group
and generate a binary string we usually
use 512 or 1024 bits you can use you can
generate them off every tray length and
depth and there's a lot of redundancy
checking and there's a lot of stuff that
goes into this algorithm that
I don't know all the details of but you
can use it a black box and say here is
the molecule you have a few parameters
that specify how to generate a big thing
out of it it's like a hash of the
molecule and then you can come up with
similar binary similarity measures and I
love to find these papers that are kind
of encyclopedic there was a paper that
was doing clustering of all the
different binary similarity functions
and historical analysis of them
there's tons of them the simplest one
actually jacquard actually comes like
this if item one and item many items
present this is a numerator over this
denominator of present plus absent okay
and it was using biology actually and
it's one of the measures are used to for
example try to differentiate genomic
trees so you can think about different
measures like jacquard Rogers for Seuss
around this table again this is about 50
and you can see here a correlation of
tanimoto mrs. Forbes Daniel Russell
reverses Royer's etc these are not very
well correlated but this is a type of
choices you have to make and we just use
the simplest one okay so that's kind of
the first thing you just set up a bit
string that defines the molecule you
compare any use of course where it's
called a Gaussian process if I have
experimental data this is important in
chemistry experimental everywhere it
will be these points here okay now we
know what the X means is this
multi-dimensional parameter space of how
close the molecules you know the vector
that will define you know when a
molecule is in this multi-dimensional
space and the ocean process because it's
this Gaussian distribution with all
these points has a has a inherent
knowledge of what is what good places
for example to explore where there's a
lot of variance or good places to
exploit perhaps because this is a place
where I want to find a lower function of
a lower value of the function so these
explorers whose exploit is of course
very natural here so now let me just
show you a simple force graph diagram
okay basically house-call it's called an
active force diagram okay basically you
know is it's a chip it's a kind of like
a visual way of clustering I'm gonna
show you an experimental database that I
did with my own the graduates of about
500 different experimental data points
and I don't worry too much about this
parameter
about homo-lumo this is the percentage
power combustion efficiency of the solar
sail opens it with voltage source it
with current etc and you can see the
point here is that you see clusters of
about the saints the same color you see
here this is real actual but that tells
you that I can mount a caption process
on his fame because when they actually
cluster my molecules with this HL is
proportionate to the tanimoto distance
at least with the eye I recognize some
patterns so that's kind of like a hand
waving way of telling you that gradual
processes work here I can show you data
of line and a lot of stuff but what we
learn from this process for example even
from the first 1.5 percent top
candidates we can learn for example
which molecules are statistically
enriched which fragments so if you want
to make solar cells instead of making
them at random I'll recommend you to
actually use fragment 26 24 17 and 15
they're statistically better than all
the soil fragments and my organic
chemistry colleagues honestly what
they're doing is they trying to use a
chemical intuition but they are randomly
sampling the space so for most of the
solar cells that are out there are 4
percent efficiency which are about the
same maximum of my distribution roughly
right so this can allow you to to do
this but now I told you one ideal I
don't want my volunteer donors of
computer time to see this talk and stop
computing I wanted to continue computing
so now because we add machine learning
we can actually prioritize and then
calculate with quantum chemistry so this
is a neural network model of the actual
power conversion efficiency versus our
predicted one you can see we have
progress around zero they have to do
with a neural network blah blah blah
this is an old plot so we have made now
we have much better correlations cross
validated etc but of course what you
wanna do is just take the best ones from
the neural network of these huge spaces
of molecules that you can go to billions
if you won right and then now go on
compute the millions that you can
compute right so that allows you to go
several orders of magnitude beyond what
you could do before so that's why I want
to talk about this here the machine
learning company ok so I don't have to
tell you what it's a neural network but
this is what I'm gonna do in my
sabbatical become an expert in this
right now on the level of maybe perhaps
a first year graduate student but of
course the idea here is you have a
bunch of bio-inspired nodes here that
are basically summed up and activated
nonlinearly to come up with this network
that has inputs and outputs and in this
case I just given you one of the simple
you know Integra doesn't have you know
feedback mechanisms okay and the things
that we use and I try to show you some
of the techniques that we use are
probably very primitive for you but
whatever we use areum's prop okay which
basically we do mini batch learning with
rmsprop this is kind of standard stuff
we put analyzing with Microsoft's
worldwide algorithm which pretty good
for us and something very important for
us is that we learn all the things at
once most of the properties and ones and
we find out that our neural networks are
actually much more robust and now I'm
going to show you a result of our better
mirror network that is it was already
submitted so release is already
submitted what shows you that you know
we can throw away most of the molecules
in this area and just compute these ones
so you notice there was a lot of waste
in this computational projects and so we
started thinking about other ways of
improving on it nevertheless if you
actually want to go and look at all our
results they were generated by the
public for the public this is a hippy
project you can go in there our database
is being rewritten and you can just go
in there and get all our molecules or
even writing a little game where you can
draw molecules and get their efficiency
stuff like that but now I want to spend
more time telling you about the next
generation project so first I tell you
about generation of electricity both in
a renewable world we face more issues
this is actually I was in the Galapagos
Islands for me scientists at the
conference and one of the islands a
Cristobal is powered 50% by these three
windmills speak about that you go there
look at this string windmills and 50% of
the island is getting its power from
this little windmills and one of them is
even lazy there right that is just
amazing
right what's the problem with windmills
right those guys have a diesel generator
to complement the windmill because of
course this is a problem this is a wind
supply this is the solar supply as far
as I know there's no sort of supply at
night well in the demand you know it
goes up and down and open
one time I saw the degree demand of
Brazil during the final of the World Cup
okay and it went down to 50% use this
almost or something crazy like that and
you can even see the in the middle of
the game like the 15 years of research I
call it a intermedia did you see the
electricity go up because people open
their refrigerators okay you can
actually see that so it's very
predictable sometimes we have these
fluctuations you have to compensate and
these things that we drew here
artistically are batteries right so one
of the very important components and
California just demanded batteries to be
installed in the energy grid aren't
there to regulate agreed if you have a
certain political threshold of renewable
energy right so that's the idea that can
also also help us go to those 1.4
billion people and tell them you know
what is the in start here which one is
the electricity utility here in LA
California through California Edison
right get off the grid right connect to
this thing and just do it your own right
so that's what you could do if you were
in the developed in the underdeveloped
world in the developing world if you
don't have access to degree you might as
well just not connect to it or if you
want to feel very good with the world
you can do this well right so that's
what I were interested on this is a
company based in California called
Interpol that has this test test system
just to show you how they look you have
the solar panels you have these big
batteries but this is not like the
batteries you have in your cell phone
they are slightly different and they're
called flow batteries whatever my flow
battery energy is amount of chemicals
you have a power is amount of
electrochemical cells you can use to
actually compare that that's energy to
power right so therefore you want to
decouple them with just pops right you
want to have a system that you can
regulate the power will regulate the
energy as much as you want
okay so flow batteries that what you
want to use for large-scale energy
storage so there are these tanks with
Poe so light and megabyte two different
solutions that are doing the day you
charge they will your solar cell and
United withdraw or you can use it to our
we trash electricity prices is very
important you can get rich by buying
very expensive so very very cheap
electricity and then
when is we expensive and of course you
can make a lot of money doing that and
this is what our president has to say
about this ads company that provides
multi megawatt energy storage solutions
using and I have no idea what this is
vanadium redox fuel cells that's one of
the coolest things I've ever said out
loud so I'm his fan is awesome
but there's a problem with this okay and
again a long time for this problem
there's not enough vanadium in the world
to actually store the energy that we
need even if we talk all the vanadium
okay so me I'm mister organic materials
guy we started working on organic
materials can you replace this with an
organic material right so therefore
arpa-e which is our founder ARPA is like
the DARPA of materials and we we're one
of the few projects that have ever be
able to do that our RFI II made a
promotional video and of course most of
it is experiment and this is what they
devoted to also theoreticians our energy
storage efforts as well that's that's I
would come in okay but what we did is we
actually screamed and found this
molecule of tell you about which is
better than beneath you how do you
scream first 10 to the 60 what do you do
open a chemistry textbook okay and you
look at the different classes of
molecules and look at which ones are
between 0 and 1 it's more or less what
you want to be okay and then you say
well maybe I'm not gonna use amines and
I'm not gonna use all the fees but
perhaps Queen oh so good right so that's
it so we said let's go to Queen ohms
okay so let me probably you guys don't
know too much about Quino Quino sorry
north plant the electron transfer agents
in plants shuttle electrons back and
forth they used it using photosynthesis
we also have them in our bodies they're
also laxatives if you have it like
luxation
you know if you have problems in your
stomach you can take array and you can
also use it to make cakes and if you
really want to attract female
cockroaches you can also put it on top
of yourself so it's a very important
candy
I'll make a chemical messenger if dyes
stones of queenan's like alyssa in that
are the eyes and your jeans and stuff
like that they're using the Australian
Python and at Harvard where I come from
actually even in the 20s you know Louie
Pfister which is a very famous professor
in my department was already saying they
are very different that although sort of
molecular classes that you were talking
about why does he say they are different
again this is not the chemistry lecture
but the whole point is that they are
swimming in the water and they can take
two electrons and two protos at the same
time
unlike vanadium they can only take one
these these little suckers can take two
at once okay that's very useful because
then you can double them in high density
right and they are reversible and all
the parameters that we know pretty much
physical chemical parameters are better
than vanadium okay so we already beat
Binet diem in our first paper okay so
how do I calibrate let me show you this
1964 machine learning okay we actually
just calculate the energy of the
molecules correctly with the free energy
and we calculate these with respect to
experiment this is experimentally
measured reduction oxidation potential
and it is something that comes out of
your quantum chemistry 1969 was already
known in chemistry you can do this so
now I'm showing you machine learning of
1969 so we do it better and now we can
correlate very cheap quantum chemistry
calculations with the observed values
with our squares of point 97 okay so
that allowed allow those to build first
of all we learned a lesson we were not
going to be the library of three million
molecules matter of eight we built a
library for about three thousand and we
went to screen okay I mean about three
months our library looks like this these
are the bands of Windows with our groups
and seventeen different groups that we
plug in here now you can see the Lego
nature of this these are benzoquinone
NAFTA Queen owns and anthraquinone so
all these little places where you see a
little art here goes with 17 different
substitutions okay and again you can do
it in a script in an afternoon and then
you have a distribution of the readers
potential so this Queen owns the
textbook was wrong there's a much much
more
big variety of Queen ohms and you can
actually cut catalogue them by the type
of Queen ohm here are the redox pair so
vanadium that Obama was talking about
and you can replace an idiom and test it
in the lab meet with experimentalist
every week and that's painful for a
theoretician to be listening about
experiment and details but that's what
Google Chat is for okay and then we
found this molecule uncheck win on this
sulfonate we like to call it Jesus
Christ queen oh okay and you know it's
been cheap you can actually to synthetic
steps or so at the industrial scale can
give you disguise the queen on okay and
maybe it's the Savior okay for the world
okay and here it is our paper is in
nature has our little Harvard scale flow
battery of course working to scale it
and as I told you before the most
important thing is to have engineers
experimentalists and Terra teachers
worked together
most of the traditions that work on this
work by their own so then nobody wants
to make this stuff you have to talk to
them everyday work together they have to
tell you what to do what you have to
tell them what to do you work together
okay so you need always experimentalists
and Changwon so in my group which is
very good at visualization summarize all
our hundreds of passes of calculations
in this type of correlation plot so
different types of Queen Anne's and what
did you do for example to the redox
potential and so on okay so that's the
kinds of things that you want to do
because an organic chemist understands
this visually so that's the extra mile
you have to go for example OAH lowest
redox potential but there are solve
families of windows that have a slightly
different and tendencies and others and
anyway so we were able to do the low
potential of the battery very well we're
still working on the high potential of
the battery so we need another molecule
for the hypotension that is not intact
win on this all foreign and when we
screen forwards it towards it okay now
this is where our so for to start to
come up we have of course databases that
we can actually go in and search and you
can see the stable molecule sorry blue
and the unstable are in red the
potential goes from left to right and
you can see how this island of red
molecules the scores of red molecules
there that is a very good negative
result you can tell experimentalist stop
making qui notes for hypotension and
that's where machine learning and
quantum chemistry can allow you to
actually tell people stop doing
something and accelerate materials
discovery where by a factor of five or
ten okay because you can just be surely
see the data right and and you know we
have data plots like this is a hundred
thousand we have done five hundred
thousand and so on you see this very few
stable blue molecules there all right so
maybe you move on to a different family
of molecules after all it's 10 to the 60
of them okay
and of course to you guys is trivial but
we could spend a lot of time with a
software engineer thing here still in my
group filtering the data but here is
basically a baseball card view okay so
we discover that we talked to Sperry
Mentalist the best idea was to think
about baseball cards you know we say
look here I will talk molecules for this
quickly batch so you have the system
where we have patches and with we
disclose the batches with our
collaborators you look at the properties
of a particular batch and now our
software system is more advanced than
these videos you can actually click on
the molecule and see it in 3d and do a
lot sorts of cool things and underlying
it we have a lot of data structures for
example if you want to look at the
molecule how it reduces or oxidizes you
have to consider all the possible
reduction oxidizing pathways and come up
with the lowest energy one and this
gives you an idea of what is the
plumbing that is behind our databases
okay I thought it was good to show it
here so now in the last 20 minutes let
me tell you about our latest story
generation 3.0 we were approached by
Samsung because there is an issue with
organic light-emitting diodes some of
human have Samsung phones here and I
have to tell you that any molecule is
found it has an AMOLED the blue pixels
die sooner than the manufacturers want
okay so if you were able to solve that
problem then this is gonna be AMOLED
displays everywhere
everybody's LCDs and stuff like that so
we started working with them the market
is huge you know you can also think
about LED lighting you can think about
beautiful flexible applications of LED
the market is huge and of course you can
think of flexible displays
and the other different type of cell
phones like the Amazon fire iPhone 6 or
LG are actually LEDs instead of organic
LEDs so how does organic LEDs work they
are the opposite of the solar cell it
showed you and how the beautiful
animation would you generate carriers in
the electrons it's likely probably the
same portfolio you of the solar cell but
now you roll it in reverse you put about
maybe five six bolts then the charge is
localized and they emit light okay so
now let's listen learn a little bit of
chemistry okay what's the problem the
problem is that molecules have something
called triplet an excited state code
triplet that has three excited States
there is not bright it doesn't emit
light and it has a singlet that is
bright electrons and holes come in a
statistical distribution and therefore
you have 75% chance of landing in this
triplet okay the phosphorus is
phosphorescence is bad basically it's
phosphorescence means in lane emission
stays there forever and because quantum
mechanically cannot emit light it just
stays there and they may emit the light
very slowly that stalks for display
right you want as much as possible
mission from the singlet but you only
have one singlet so yours you basically
lose 75% of a video right there well how
how about this phosphorescent materials
like phosphorus that you can see they
emit light very efficiently from The
Triplets how does that work right well
usually you have transition metals that
increase a quantum mechanical effect
called spin orbit coupling okay so the
rate of emission has caused us the spin
orbit coupling over the gap between the
singlet and triplet if you singleton
Tippett who are close in energy you can
overcome this effect of the spin orbit
coupling
okay well the state of the art materials
that are you cellphone actually use
transition metals to enhance the spin
orbit coupling and this curve the only
point to this cube is that they have
saturated toward one millisecond
emission decay time
so what microsecond emission decay type
we have not been able to move on beyond
this and this is a state of the art the
olives what is the problem of the blue
you have this methyl molecule bond okay
that has cycling of seven you know a few
bolts every time it emits so what
happens to the bond it breaks so can i
replay
that menthol by something that has no
methyl so and no metal man so let's
replace it by a molecule that has no
metals okay and for that reason because
this Manik is break if you go to Amazon
you find this place for $9,000 and labs
for $4,000 okay so with my professor
seller you cannot afford those but
Chihaya Adachi in Kyushu University made
a breakthrough if you actually have
molecules hardware is more singlet
triplet gap you can have thermally
external excitation from this level can
take it to this level and you can flow
rates from this level in other words a
triplet there are three levels here can
activate so it's called thermally
activated delayed fluorescence it will
activate back here and Flores back if
you know what I'm saying the problem is
that most of these molecules are not
bright okay and because they are not
bright people thought this was not
possible but he found molecules
somewhere exactly like like Goldilocks
but bright enough stable enough and had
this effect okay and they start the
revolution about five years ago and
that's that's when Samsung approaches
and says can you help us with your
computers help us overcome all the
amount of development that our this
college gap so I got together with my
collaborator Ryan Adams this is a very
good moment to mention him all the
machine learning I've been doing has
inspired informed collaborating with
violence is awesome our synthetic
collaborators at MIT Tim swager Stephen
book one the most cited chemists in the
world mark Baldor old memories so this
is a team we have done more than 150,000
but maybe 250,000 or some molecule
screen so far since we started this
project about a year ago and we have
sent sent several terms to synthesis is
also outdated so how do we win here how
can we we came up with very good
audience I'll show you at the end well
because now we spend tons of time
thinking about the coating of chemical
space and the story goes like this in
the first program review I showed the
molecules to my to my collaborators in
Korea and they were saying I hate that
molecule because of this I hate that
molecule because of that
we never work the maliki will never work
so we implemented a lot of tools to
blacklist symmetrical all the molecules
Pressley in fragments etc etc etc so all
our effort came in two very good ways of
generating the first screen of 10 to the
60 to 10 to the 6 so that everything
that I would colleagues saw at Samsung
was pleasant to them ok and I think
that's the key to materials design so
this is our first generation that when
they saw its molecules they were
scolding us that's already right but the
second generation now we're reading the
third one so I gotta blast charlie so
child is very pleasant but blast a
hundred ninety ninety thousand molecules
was symmetrically placed and this looks
like a spaceship type of molecule easy
to make if you're an organic chemist you
will like it but you don't like to make
this one ok so how do we do that when we
increase the number of possible
fragments to actually have better IP
space so this is the number of fragments
that our Japanese colleagues have used
the area for achi all the groups have
come up with these ones and we come up
ourselves by spinning the fragments all
these new fragments are going to our
libraries and of course the ones that
come out of blue is blue our goal in the
IP sense right so this is just a plot to
brag about the fact that every time we
improve our libraries then it come
better more symmetric more free more
fragments more blacklisting rules which
basically means more filtering before we
even compute something and therefore we
have more interest per fragment ok so
I'm running out of time so I'm gonna
skip this slide skip this life too but
we do exactly the same thing that we did
in between any project since the
beginning we sample you know a few tens
of thousands of molecules we calculate
them with quantum chemistry and then we
train a machine learning system in this
case a neural network and that different
network allows us to prioritize the
molecules to say these are the good ones
these are the bad words and we only
compute the good ones and usually once
we are done with it with a good ones
then we change to the next library and
the next library it accelerates
discovery really quickly ok so again we
have to make a software system that uses
all these tools automate the scoring of
how difficult is to make a molecule
incorporate the chemical expertise of
your of your partners in this case
Samsung
the fragments to be able to come up with
a set of good molecules for example of
this 588 combinations of molecules of
this donor bleach and acceptor symmetric
molecules like this notice the donor the
bridge and the acceptor here this level
combination there's only nine out of
these 588 here okay now you can actually
actually start without the using voting
I'll show you in a second to actually
rank the molecules and you can see that
there is this Pharma descriptor called
synthetic this ability score that is
roughly correlated with molecular size
okay
that basically anticorrelated so if you
have a high high low is a score organic
chemist biomolecule pleasant okay so now
you can also screen over synthetic
accessibility score which is a pharma
type metric for how it is to make a
molecule and now let me show you this is
our first device about dawn about maybe
eight months ago I don't remember
exactly this is the video for first
device and just today I got an email
from Harvard we have a for you it won't
mean anything we have a 16.7% external
quantum efficiency device so if I were
colleagues from Japan and looking at
they know we're exactly the same as them
right so today we caught up to them in
five years in a year okay and this is
the email I got this morning literally
eight am here because of course was from
is three years okay okay so I got the
16.7% email right because we just got
the news from Korea of course was
working before so for us sent us
overnight the 16.7 and then they send it
to me and and then I show it to you so
this is Tim here sale Rafa come on
Bombur alien for Haley Lera super happy
with the 16.7 and of course is all this
all the group members people from from
the bath of swagger Adams group Samsung
etc have been made possible this
molecule that is as efficient as the
best ones in there in the world right
now in the area so now what are the
things that we do of course we think
about this type of companies like tinder
my students
I'm sorry my student Ryan but which that
is he introduced me to Tim there he has
the honor of showing it to me and he's
not gonna be working at Google actually
so Ryan he showed me this application I
have never used it myself
so I was inspired by Ryan to actually do
the same and that's why I have my
organic chemist vote on the molecules
and I learned from it right now not my
children but just learn I have very few
data points but I have people from MIT
from Samsa from Harvard vote on these
molecules and tell me if they like them
or not and this allows me to actually
figure out and here is a baseball card
much more complicated for organic
light-emitting diode okay so this is
kind of our new network this is a
generation number three we have people
voting in the computer we have high
throughput screening that involves
several layers that include quantum
chemistry some empirical methods machine
learning flat lifting a lot of library
generation and a lot of feedback
generating library seven to three months
that are better and better okay and that
show you have progressive about ten
years in my group that allows us to
think about materials this is actually
the last data slide because I know I'm
running out of time this is actually
from the group of Ryan Adams this is
Miguel Hernandez Lobato and others
pioneered this many Spaniards in this
project if you glue two million acres
together like this you can actually come
up with like the two no principle
nonlinear components or know how to say
this technically but gives you the best
to non linear dimensions to see your
data set right and you can see these
islands that aren't made by our library
generation so we generate in islands and
what you see in grey is crappy molecules
and when you see in red is good
molecules and what is encoded in these
if you actually go as a chemist and look
at these islands there are combinations
of donor and acceptors so there are
rules right this is to me to learn what
the heck is near Network learn okay I do
this and I find out the good
combinations of millions of dollars and
acceptors and now I can tell my
experimentalist colleagues do not please
make any molecule in this island even if
you think it's good right there's
nothing there so I call this like
sailing the Pacific when you were like a
politician
maybe they were sending many boats and
they never came back but when they found
Hawaii you know they went to Hawaii so
that's what happens to us
making organic light-emitting diodes
molecules our latest batches are full of
golden molecules that Sampson can go and
test and this is kind of like this what
I wanted to be and now because I'm at
Google I'm showing you a plot of an
apple person but I really like this
quote okay that two designs often in
this case molecules really have to get
it and you really have to be passionate
and you really have to be in ten years
at it okay so so you have to take your
time and it takes a lot of effort and I
showed you all the effort that it takes
and that's why I like this crew this
plot is this quote of jobs and I'm gonna
show you a tank result picture of my
research group thanking them all Ryan
which is going to be a new Google
employee is here with his cool glasses
yeah by the way it's also here visiting
and finally a small advertisement or a
small development was that we're getting
so good at it that we're actually
spinning off a startup company called
calculate the place where you do
calculations we're going to actually do
these and we hope to be the first
chemical company without labs like the
uber of chemical discovery so that's our
company that's being spin-off of my of
my lab right now and with that I open up
for questions I know that there's a
number of folks behind the camera on
some related projects and the show would
they be able to ask questions or the
question is in the in the chart that
shows the 10 percent efficiency rate is
that maximum we can get from solar
cells that's a very good question it
what is the maximum that we can get from
solar cells that's called the
shockley-queisser limit and it's
computed about 30-something percent for
a single Junction solar cell you can go
for multi Junction solar cells to higher
limits in the case of this organic solar
cells with a single Junction because of
all the losses and so on you can get
about 15%
but if you the 10% is more likely the
commercial validity threshold if you can
make that solar cell it's about 10%
efficiency it's actually cost-efficient
to pull it on a rooftop if it's below
that then is too low density you know so
it's not so because most of the cost of
a solar cell is a back panel and the
module and so on so even if you have a
pretty plastic on top of it if it takes
too much area it's gonna be expensive
so it has to be at least 10% efficiency
we're working on tenth on solar cells
with many junctions so it will be not
very soon that experimentalist and their
additions will come up with solar cells
and make to add 20% efficient or so I
think that's not far away in the future
that will involve just two more layers
thank you as a machine learning person
one of the first questions you would ask
is when you want to train classifier is
how many input-output pairs you have now
you had different projects here but can
you give us for some of them order of
magnitude let's say how many
fingerprints four molecules you have and
then associate it was let's say
efficiency sure for example the largest
data set is the harbor cleaning project
I have if you want to learn the quantum
chemistry result you can have a molecule
and compute this quantum chemistry so
first let's talk about learning quantum
chemistry okay there you can run as many
quantum chemistry calculations as you
want so in the clean energy project the
neural network that we used was trained
about 200,000 points
okay it was a three layer neural network
typical deep neural network of only 28
64 32
nose like that and that that was trained
about 240 points now the Gaussian
process has showed you for that we put
before that's the process that
calibrates experimental data to the
quantum chemistry data okay so we have
two things first a gaussian process that
takes you from experiment to quantum
chemistry and then we have a quantum
chemistry predictor based on a neural
network okay so there's two levels of
machine learning the first one we see
about 500 data points experimentally
and that's what we use a collection
process there which allows us to know
the errors and it's actually probably
cleaner in my opinion then for the
queenan's we used maybe about of the
order of tens maybe twenty or thirty
experimental data points in that
particular case is r-squared linear
regression is perfect because it's a
long story but it has to do with the
fact that these molecules almost have no
entropy when they reduce or oxidized
therefore it's basically just enthalpy
and you can just quantum chemistry get
very simple numbers and correlate them
with a complicated free energy so then
we uses maybe 30 points so you see so if
I want to learn quantum chemistry data I
can use as many as I want and usually go
to tens of thousands for example in the
case of the olives okay in the case of
the olives all it's in some sense are
easier than organic photovoltaics and we
can get away with between maybe ten
thousand to forty thousand point to
chemistry calculations per batch to
train a neural network to predict the
entire batch so if I have a lot to alpha
million molecules right I can machine
learning with about forty thousand
entries and then many only is good
enough to predict the rest
no that was quite helpful I'm the type
for large training jobs let's say in
image recognition no so it wouldn't be
unheard of to even use ten to the nine
ten to the eight training samples are
much much larger numbers and you were
just quoting to generate such huge data
sets is it said where do you perceives
as a bottleneck what is it more on the
computational infrastructures that if
you I'd say it wouldn't be a problem for
you to generate ten to the eight ten to
the nine samples but then learning from
it is difficult or in many cases just
inconceivable to get useful
input-output pairs of set order of
magnitude well I think I think for me
the bottleneck is two things what is
what make is human what to scream for
and to get the data out of the
literature to make
I think the computing is about 25,000
molecules in a small closet per week you
can go even beyond that you can use the
cloud to as many as you want and then
the learning has never been a bottleneck
we had to paralyze our learning with
hog-wild and things like that but you
could use a lot of tools maybe Google's
tool to learn this I will say the bottom
leg I think is to make the right
decisions about what's gonna be your
library and how to how to chop it so any
automations so help what does observe
about there so any automations like data
scraping would be awesome for me the
effective data scraped all the data
tables and materials for example and
also if I have tools for building my
library is more automated which is part
of what's going into calculating all the
developments that we lead into how to
make libraries so I think there is a
bottleneck not necessarily the computing
or the learning it's just the initial
part of sealing chemical space needs
humans steel and doesn't make sense yeah
hi once you've found the other side of
that flow battery hop a hum how much
more efficient is gonna be comparing to
the vanadium existing or or how much how
much time is gonna take to actually you
expect it to deploy a large-scale
battery so so my colleagues I know Sarah
started Astro battery company that was
purchased by Lockheed Martin which is
very interested in this space so these
big corporations that are actually
entering the space to manufacture the
flow batteries so the actual battery
itself and all that this big companies
making it now the chemicals that go into
it you know the vanadium right it's very
expensive right
so we estimated our cost of the
electrolytes you know it's about these
three times cheaper than binary even
perhaps more so we're going to win in
the cost of the chemical itself it can
charge up to tens of thousands of times
so we believe that the battery will be
there with stable queenan's for twenty
to thirty years right
so you just replace them later they are
so cheap right so we basically lower the
cost of the electrolyte so for example
the Tesla battery that it was just
houses made of lithium we can replace a
battery today with that thing if
somebody scans it off way cheaper okay
we have a calculation I cannot tell you
right now wait cheaper so so the
materials themselves are very common in
the production itself is relatively
cheap it's a fraction of oil yeah so you
could use oil instead of pouring it you
