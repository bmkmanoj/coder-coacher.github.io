on engineering sustainable buildings our
organizers are any pairs from Virginia
Tech and John's I from University of
Colorado and so let them kick this off
I'm Jonesy and we have three jobs for
this morning session so i guess john is
a popular and a famous name so i guess
many of you probably already see this
this image it shows the population
population density and it is predicted
eighty percent of the world population
will live in cities by 2050 what that
means to buildings that mean we either
have to build more new constructions in
cities all retrofit existing buildings
and the impact mobility is a huge so you
look at all the numbers forty percent
energy used gas emission forty percent
raw materials thirty percent solid what
weighs twenty-five percent water use
toward etc and if we look at the general
scientific opinion about a group warming
indicate in order to keep the average
warming temperature 122 degrees celsius
by 2050 we have to reduce 75% greenhouse
gas emissions by 2050 accordingly you
see all the governments organizations
set up all kinds of short-term long-term
goals to reduce gas emission and there
are many many ways we can do that to
achieve this target so look at it this
all the figure here we can do building
transportation industrial low-carbon
fuel a renewable energy all stuff and
they noticed that the left the bottom
here this will the building it do see
the huge potential in terms providing
more saving than the cost so that gives
us some opportunities and the for the
building guys scientists all the
engineers architects think about what we
can do here and this session really
going to demonstrate or introduce how
people can do to design construct and
build buildings with engineering
knowledge engineering tools and approach
and Annie going to introduce our speaker
next great so we've got a great panel of
speakers for you today and we're going
to try to look at things at a variety of
scales at which engineering analysis
could occur so our focus is on
integration and lifecycle analysis we
really believe that's an important way
to move forward our first speaker will
be John Oxon Dorf and he's going to talk
about life cycle assessment and
performance-based design specifically
with regard to low-carbon buildings then
we're going to hear from John haymaker
and that will exhaust our supply of
John's for the day and he's going to
talk about design process the process by
which our buildings are just excuse me
our design and innovations that can
happen during that process and expanding
design spaces our third speaker is
yelling at Shrek and she's going to talk
about multiscale modeling of buildings
and as you'll see the built environment
exists on a on a multitude of scales
we've got different people specializing
and everything from the materials of
which it's made all the way up to how
buildings exist in the urban environment
so we hear about some of the differences
in approaches to modeling at those
different scales and then our last
speaker Chris Pike is going to focus
more on what we can do with information
to try to bring the market forward and
transform the market through information
technology so that's the panel we have
for you today and with that I'd like to
turn it over to our first speaker john
oxen Dorf good morning thank you very
much to the organizers and thank you all
it's a real privilege to be here I'm
very excited to come and share our work
I'm going to try to give a high-level
overview on some of the key issues
facing green buildings i'm going to
focus on on low carbon carbon can be
swapped air interchanged with energy at
times here and i'm going to both give
you some reason for pessimism and some
reason for optimism I hope so the trends
are that buildings are the law
largest and growing a percentage of our
energy consumption this is what it takes
to operate buildings if we look under
industry that includes some large energy
consuming industries like the steel
industry the cement industry glass so a
lot of building products and then of
course transportation has direct
implications on also the design of of
buildings and communities so so in
general buildings are have a major
impact and also I would argue there's a
lot of illiteracy right now around
buildings if we look at the design of a
high-performance car there's obviously
an integrated design team most of you
have a car like this I assume it's clear
from the beginning that there are some
basic decisions that need to be made
like what direction will the car drive
in and it's also clear that this cannot
be solved by one discipline it's an
integrated systems approach and that you
have consumers who are energy literate
in the case of cars that's of course
because they're standing at the pump
staring at those numbers they know how
much gas mileage their car gets they
know how far it can go they know roughly
how much they pay if it's a beautiful
day outside you can roll down a window
in a car and contrary to buildings where
you might have a thermostat on the wall
where you can you know point an arrow by
a few degrees in cars you have hundreds
of sensors the person next to you can
change their climate and in general this
is clearly an industry where where
performance matters and and we're driven
in that direction let's now switch to
buildings what's the gas mileage of a
building you know the general public
despite spending much of our time in
buildings I mean all of you there's an
invented statistic on the MIT campus
that the average MIT students spend
seven minutes outdoors each today I'm
waiting for that to be verified by Chuck
vest but i think it's an invention so we
spend a lot of time in buildings we
spend more
on on operating buildings Cambridge is
ridiculously expensive so our largest
assets are usually tied up in in real
estate and yet in terms of our literacy
about the buildings and their energy
performance we were a long way away from
where we need to be and part of what
happens is that engineers are often
asked to optimize poor design so what we
have is we have design decisions that
have been made formal decisions we would
like the shape of a building largely to
look like this and then we come in with
our very sophisticated engineering
analysis and we can optimize things and
we can try to improve performance by
let's say a few percentage points but we
are optimizing a pretty sub-par design
to begin with so this is a building that
I stood of in stood inside of on five
different occasions and every time I
stood in this building I scratched my
head and I literally took pictures and
tried to figure out how this building
stood up because it didn't seem like a
very good design to me and then a little
while later I got the answer it doesn't
stand up this was a quite serious
tragedy at Charles de Gaulle Airport it
occurred at five o'clock in the morning
so a few people died rather than
hundreds of people but we have a design
process that I would argue in the case
of buildings is fundamentally flawed and
part of it has to do with a tremendous
gulf between the professions of
architecture and engineering and if I
could just speak very briefly on this
golf because i think it's crucially
important to consider we educate
architects and engineers in two
different camps and they never work
together they never learn to work
together and then they go out into
industry and we say now work together
and they've often been taught to
mistrust each other during their
education that's one thing second thing
when I was an engineer when I was an
engineer when I was an engineering
student I was given problem after
problem I'm still an engineer i was
given problem after problem that had an
answer and i drew a box around it and
boy is that satisfying as engineers to
find the answer and then what's even
more satisfying as when
you get a green checkmark next to it and
you feel really good about yourself and
you do that for several years in
engineering education and then if you're
lucky you get to a capstone design
course at the end of my undergraduate
and I got to do a parking garage which
meant I could figure out the spacing and
calculate the beam sizes and then at the
end of graduate school there was another
design project and that happened to be
another parking garage and that was
terrifically exciting but the key point
is as engineers in my education I was
given highly highly constrained problems
architectural education on is it the
other extreme where the problems are
highly unconstrained and there are
almost infinite answers and so where
does the real world reside somewhere in
between these two but there are benefits
to be had by trying to bring these two
professions and communities together
both in their education and then later
and frankly it's the only way we're
going to get towards better performing
buildings and this is a kind of poster
child for that golf so the other thing
is you may say well can't we just put
photovoltaics on buildings and isn't
that going to solve things putting
photovoltaics on a standard building is
like putting a small PV panel on your
Hummer and touting its green performance
so if we covered the john hancock tower
in boston with pv you could generate
only about twenty percent of the energy
required to run this building and so
that gives you a sense that there's no
silver bullet in the case of buildings
and i would argue that what you need and
what we need is a profession on what
you'll hear about in our session today
is silver buckshot you'll hear about
different strategies that can help bring
down the energy requirements but
fundamentally we're big believers that
we really need to focus on the demand
side and before you put a PV panel on
your Hummer you should ask some basic
questions about the weight of the
vehicle and and size and and other
things so that's you know in this case
it has to do with building orientation
and we'll get a little bit more into
that I want to dig it in a bit more
detail into this curve this is the cost
abatement curve put out by McKenzie on a
change of different technologies to
reduce carbon and on the horizontal axis
we have the abatement potential where
the width of the bar is associated with
the technology's potential impact and
reducing carbon emissions on the
vertical axis we have the cost of
implementing those technologies so
obviously anything above the bar will
save carbon so you can put TVs and and
but it will cost you money to do that
and so here you see technologies carbon
capture and storage quite expensive
solar PV s then on on the then you have
negative you have cost savings
associated with a range of different
technologies the single most
cost-effective one is to switch to more
efficient light bulbs and as I'm cooking
to a nice even glow under these heat
lamps I can tell you that that Lighting
has a major influence in buildings but
the real point I want to make by
focusing on this curve is that there the
costs of carbon right now trading on the
European market are about twenty dollars
per ton of carbon so if I were going to
bet on technologies that I think are
really have the potential to change and
and influence where governments could
look should look to achieving
cost-effective carbon reductions I would
bet on technologies below this threshold
and interestingly many of the most
cost-effective ones that actually pay
you to cut carbon and to save energy are
in the building sector and these exist
both in terms of existing buildings
retrofitting existing buildings and in
the design of new buildings and so this
is a key message for the day and for our
session is that there are benefits that
are there there there are low-hanging
fruit that are possible the
international panel on climate change
has identified buildings as the single
most cost-effective sector for achieving
carbon reduction so so we know the
possibilities are there the question is
how do we get there another comment
about economics and buildings has to do
with lifecycle economics and and in
particular when we build a building for
every dollar of construction of say an
office building over a 30-year lifetime
of the building you can do a
back-of-the-envelope calculation that
says you might spend about five dollars
in terms of
operating that building for 30 years and
then if you ask yourself well I'm really
providing a healthy working environment
for employees and you look at their
salaries you might spend two hundred
dollars for every one dollar of
construction on the salaries of people
in the building so most of you spend a
lot of time in buildings and the
interesting thing is getting these
different budgets to talk to each other
to maybe spend a little bit more money
on a higher performing building in order
to cut your operating costs a in half
and increase productivity of people who
are in the buildings and what's
fascinating is this applies to office
buildings where obviously professors we
could clearly write more papers if we
just have a nicer office but it also
applies to retail where Dale its paces
perform better and retail it applies to
hospitals where patients get better
quicker if they have a view outside
access to fresh air it applies to
schools where test scores are higher so
there are measurable benefits across
different sectors but a lot of these
benefits don't come into the initial
cost and the astonishing thing is that
on many many places in the world and
some of you in the room have probably
been involved in commissioning buildings
even the budgets to build the building
initially don't necessarily talk to the
budget that operates the building so and
you know at a university at MIT we plan
to be here for a while when we build a
building we know we're the ones who are
going to operate the building but even
just getting those budgets to talk to
each other so I emphasize this because
it really I hope drives home the point
that lifecycle thinking thinking is
important in the design and operation of
buildings so what are some of the
challenges we need better design tools
for conceptual design stage I'll go in a
little bit of detail on that we need
better life cycle metrics you know if I
asked you what is the energy performance
of your home or office I might get a
blank stare back whereas most of you
could be quite articulate about
describing your car and we're a fairly
conservative industry with with a very
small record and tradition in R&amp;amp;D so
here's an example of the conceptual
design problem from my field of
structural engineering right now in
architectural design we have software
that is absolutely marvelous you can
generate
forms it's very exciting and exists in a
world in which there's no gravity
there's no sunshine there's no rain in
other words there's no physical
simulation there's no evidence of
performance in this world what you can
do to show how good your structure is
you can 3d print it and so architects
all over the country and around the
world there are 3d printing their
designs and you know and then they use
that as demonstration of how incredibly
strong they are and then the design
process is that that gets handed off to
an engineer and we try to make it stand
up and we have to confess that we as
engineers have incredible analysis tools
so if you give us a problem if you give
us a form and asked me to analyze it i
can tell you deflections i can tell you
a lot of different things about it but
these analysis tools are not designed
tools so they do not allow us to help
invent the form initially and this golf
is absolutely fundamental in the case of
buildings and so i want to really
emphasize that you know this is a recent
quite elegant small footbridge in
Belgium that was built because it was
lowest cost I think it's a quite
beautiful design but the analysis tools
that we have could never have come up
with this form and the world of
structural optimization is quite
interested in the academic world and
minimum weights whereas from a design
perspective we may be interested in
optimally directed solutions but we're
interested in a whole suite of problems
within or solutions within maybe twenty
percent of the optimum so we need more
design tools there are some conceptual
design tools under development on the
energy side MIT over the last decades
develop the design advisor so you can
take a building prototype in different
climates you can apply different
technologies and do fast and dirty
annual energy simulations and make
changes the problem is it only applies
to boxes and as you saw from that
architectural design tool we're not
getting a whole lot of boxes these days
in the case of structure I've got some
very exciting PhD students now who are
developing new tools that are designed
driven so they use genetic algorithms
they use
sheen learning and they're trying to
explore optimally directed designs but
really giving the designers the freedom
to explore this ill posed problem of
design which has so many different
objectives and then the fundamental key
is trying to bring in an integrated
systems approach within the
architectural software so recent
development that I quite like came out
of Harvard called diva which stands for
something like design iterate validate
and adapt we're within the same software
where architects are generating forms
they can do daylighting analysis they
can do energy simulations and i'm
talking with them about trying to bring
in some basic structural simulations and
so you can see where we're moving there
but I have to confess we're really in
our infancy in this area of conceptual
design we're going to hear a lot more
about that in detail from my colleague
john hay maker and from yellow mesh of
rich next the other key area of metrics
we need greater literacy in in my group
at MIT we focused a lot on global
warming potential measured by co2
equivalent so this is it amalgamates
different gases and and from the
different life cycle phases of
construction and operation and uses that
as a metric we use lifecycle assessment
which looks throughout the lifetime of a
building at this point in the talk
you're leaning back into your
comfortable chair and getting a little
bit tired so I'm going to offer you a
code cold coca-cola to demonstrate this
field of life cycle assessment this is
what it takes to make a can of coke in
England in terms of materials it starts
in Australia with mining bauxite that's
a reduced to aluminium oxide it shipped
by or carrier it's melted it goes to
sweden and norway reduced down to pure
aluminium it then gets shipped to Sweden
or Germany it struck two it's heated and
rolled up to 900 degrees it's trucked
again it's cold rolled into thin sheets
it's trucked again it arrives in England
it's punched formed into cans washed
dried painted twice lacquered flanged
sprayed with a protective coating
inspected palletized forklifted
warehouse it's trucked again it's washed
cleaned and filled and only now arrives
this elixir of flavored syrup phosphorus
caffeine and co2
that begins with beats that are come
from France those have to be harvested
milled refined shipped trucked the
phosphorus comes from a country called
Idaho where its excavated from large
mines that use the electricity of a city
of a hundred thousand people it shipped
again to a chemical manufacturer the can
is now sealed but it has to be wrapped
in cardboard colored that comes from
forest pulp that may be grown in Sweden
Siberia or British Columbia palletized
trucked gets to the supermarket after
all of this it's there an average of
three days drinking it takes a few
minutes throwing it away takes a second
and in England they throw away over
eighty percent of all cans we throw away
enough aluminum in the u.s. to replace
our entire commercial aircraft fleet
every three months so this is a
phenomenal source of aluminum in the
21st century will be our landfills in
the next few decades most likely so that
gives you a sense of a material flow
analysis of all the impacts involved and
you can go in and you can do metrics to
measure the co2 responsible and then
companies like coke are doing life cycle
analysis of the of the life of a can of
coke and looking at the refrigeration
energy requirements and about fifty
percent is in the materials and this
matters this this use of a metric to
quantify it because you can then
privilege and prioritize where you're
going to put your energy if your coke or
if your google or some other other
company and so a lot of companies
universities governments around the
world are trying to develop a good
estimate of their carbon footprint and
trying to understand what reductions
they can make and companies it's
absolutely essential for them to look up
and down their supply chain and so
that's what LCA does for us that coke
can example is only a small use of
primary metals by the way I could have
used that what was it called a graphic
supplier Michael I'm sorry diagram flyer
to find this graph but the largest
consumers crushed stone sand and gravel
in the 1980s we surpassed what is what
is defined as the carrying capacity of
the planet in terms of our resource
consumption so if you relive today over
and over again
allow the movie Groundhog Day you
wouldn't be able to to we wouldn't be
able to do it for perpetuity we would
run out of certain raw materials and so
this growth on a finite planet we have
to ask ourself where it leads we have to
begin to think about mining waste
streams from buildings and from
construction into new products and in
LCA of buildings we look at the pre use
phase extraction manufacturing of
materials and we look at the use the
heating lighting and operation of the
building and then at the end of life
what happens with it and even the
question of how long buildings last we
don't have that much data on it so so
trying to get a good understanding of
how long buildings are deployed and and
what the expected lifetime is is not
something that's clear right now we've
been doing through a concrete
sustainability hub at MIT we've been
doing LCA for a range of different
buildings residential and commercial
these are the kinds of things we find we
find about 50 pounds of co2 per square
foot co2 equivalent to construct it and
over a 60-year lifetime each year about
10 to 15 pounds of co2 equivalent per
square foot to operate the building so
within only three or four years of
operating you you equal the initial
emissions taken to constructed and so if
we're interested in reducing the carbon
footprint of buildings the honest truth
is we can handle higher embodied
emissions up front if they give us
dramatically reduced operating emissions
over time so that's where the major
focus is in the building industry is in
the operating energy of buildings the
one of the key motivations for this is
the development of the 2030 challenge
and some other initiatives we're going
to hear more from the US Green Building
Council later in the session about some
of their initiatives we're leading
architecture and engineering firms have
made commitments to try to create all
new buildings right now sixty percent
better than the average carbon emissions
for that building type so if you're a
hospital you take the average for
hospitals and you do sixty percent
better than that stepping up in
intensity or in scale of reductions
leading the carbon neutral buildings by
2030 and I should say other countries
around the world
are being much more aggressive this is
already considered to be extreme and
aggressive in the US but for example in
the United Kingdom they're hard targets
of net zero energy buildings being built
for all new homes by the end of this
decade so so this is there's growing
demand for this all over the world and
growing consumer base who's interested
in this as well so what we find in large
it is on design firms now is that
they're benchmarking their projects
against the 2030 challenge goals they're
trying to find general trends and there
hopefully shining a light on you know
Bill and Ted who didn't do so well and
so so I think we're moving toward a
better understanding of a culture of
energy performance and higher performing
buildings than we've had in recent
decades and I think we're also moving
from a period where green building
assessment has been fairly kind of soft
and feel good as dramatically as the
growth has been over the last decade and
now we're moving into a harder more
rigorous metrics being applied and
people want proven performance people
need to know what they're where carbon
footprints are and buildings are a big
part of their portfolios so the overall
opportunities that I've tried to
highlight is that conceptual design
tools are fundamental these are multi
objective very poorly constrained
problems and we as engineers have a lot
to contribute but we need to get away
from just give me a shape and I'll
analyze it and I think that field I
really want to emphasize is only just
beginning and that's quite exciting
design education is fundamental we have
a lot to learn from architecture and and
they have a lot to learn from us but we
need to begin to address this and in a
way I have to acknowledge that we don't
fall neatly within discipline bounds you
find people working in buildings and
civil and mechanical and there are some
architectural engineering programs
around the country but in general
despite the importance and the economic
and environmental impacts buildings are
we don't fit neatly in many schools of
engineering as an example we have
talented young people applying for NSF
fellowships every year in buildings and
they're always not really sure where to
apply so it's a common problem
for us I was excited to hear the
previous presentation and I think the
poor history of R&amp;amp;D their innovative
ways we can try to overcome that with
collaborations between industry academia
and government and that's some of what
we're working on I want to finish with
just a couple of design examples to
hopefully give you a sense that there
are some great possibilities right now
and how do you get to those 2030
challenge goals of a net zero carbon or
net zero energy building it's really a
combination of these three strategies
where the first and most important
reductions that are achievable are in
the initial design let's get the basic
orientation right let's not have a giant
glass facade that that gets full
sunlight in the summer so that your then
burning lots of fossil fuels far away
sending them at great in efficiencies to
cool the space by blowing cool air and
when you could just find some other
orientation or you could work harder on
the initial design and then the second
is using technologies and systems on
site for renewable energy and then the
third is if you really want to get down
and you don't have room for on-site
renewable you could go to off-site
renewables but this is the basic
strategy for achieving a net zero
building and i'll just show you three
projects that i think are inspirational
the first one is a net zero school that
opened in Kentucky last year the first
step was they worked very hard as an
integrated design team of engineers to
reduce the energy demand and this is
plug loads and lighting and heating and
cooling down to 30 k BTUs per square
foot per year and then they were able to
generate that on site with a large PV
array on the roof of the building but
they cut they initially started by
cutting the demand by about seventy
percent eighty percent and used a range
of integrated technologies to achieve
that and this was was very
cost-effective and was within the the
budget that that they named at and you
get much lower operating costs over time
so there are benefits to that a second
building is a commercial building this
is a National Renewable Energy Lab in
Golden Colorado which is a NetZero
commercial building and again focusing
on the demand initially trying to reduce
that demand working very hard on
orientation size of windows natural
ventilation
this is an office building where the
windows can open on a nice day and the
number one complaint among office
workers in America is that the office is
too cold and the number two complaint is
that the office is too hot and so you
know being able in an environment like
this where we're in a beautiful climate
here in the Bay Area and you are
generating Heat the lights and equipment
or generating heat but can we use that
heat to drive processes for natural
ventilation to draw in some of the cool
air I'd like you if you step outside
after this this boring session ends I'd
like you to just contemplate the change
in environment that occurs even as
bright as these working spaces are in
these buildings when you step outside
and just think about that so being able
to have offer able windows on a nice
days is pretty fundamental and I just
wanted the very last project I'll show
as a project my students and I were
involved in where a client in South
Africa said I want to use local
materials local labor passive energy
strategies and it has to be poverty
relief and the key goal of showing this
project is that building design depends
on climate and sight and conditions and
we've been guilty over the last few
decades of building the same types of
buildings all over the world regardless
of climate or culture or available
materials and so moving towards
site-specific design is really important
so I worked with an architect Peter rich
he developed an initial design using
passive solar we had done some work in
low cost structures made of low cost
materials in this case out of earth and
bricks we sent MIT students to South
Africa who developed a brick made from
local soil with seven percent cement
added as a as a binder we trained
workers to build structural arches and
bolts with this binder and then using
structural design software we developed
forms that needed no steel so these are
no tension basically earth and bolts so
very very low embodied carbon much lower
than typical buildings about eighty
percent lower because they use local
materials so think about the coke can
and all the processing and shipping and
everything else whereas here we looked
at what was on site we looked at
people needed jobs and we tried to
maximize solutions that employed local
people and use local materials and to
our great surprise last two years ago
this building one world building out of
the year out of 700 other entries in the
world and I think it speaks to the fact
that there are different design problems
wherever you are in the world and we
need different solutions for those so I
hope I've given you a sense of both the
diversity of problems and some of the
solutions that we have measuring
managing reducing carbon emissions will
be the norm if it's not already the norm
and your organization's cost effective
reductions will transform the built
environment and our most available to us
in the built environment so I'd urge all
of you I hope all of you will will begin
to take an interest in this LCA gives us
a rigorous way of benchmarking
performance but we still are
fundamentally as an industry really
dealing with with a broken chain where
the software is not terribly effective
and the design teams are not well enough
integrated and to achieve those kind of
net zero energy buildings that I showed
you at the end you need an integrated
team and we need a new class of
engineers who can be at the table and be
comfortable in that design environment
thank you very much Suzanne plumber from
AMD so what is MIT doing to fix this
problem of architecture being completely
separated from engineering are you guys
working on a joint program in our
education and our undergraduate yet so
starting about maybe 15 years ago John
can correct me MIT founded a research
program called the building technology
program which is a joint program between
civil mechanical and architecture and so
we have faculty members who are
engineers we have one architect and we
teach courses and we run a graduate
program where we have primarily
engineers but some architects as well in
the mix so that's part of
we're doing there we are trying to bring
design thinking into our undergraduate
education and and into our graduate
education so so I think we're making
some progress but I would just say we're
not you know we haven't figured it all
out but that's basically how it works
it's a research program with a series of
engineering faculty members and
different disciplines who are all
working on green buildings and trying to
train a new class of engineers in this
area obviously Eastman chemicals how
will it double as he's a person oh thank
you how will it developed and versatile
is life cycle analysis tools and what
are the metrics you use from there to
optimize the design so there are a
handful of different software's that are
out there now but you can imagine it's
the data are terribly important and and
we don't have very good data right now
so if you look at Switzerland the Swiss
government has said all new buildings
you will have carbon calculations here
is the calculator you will use and here
the numbers that go into it and we will
refine those over time we're not
remotely close to that yet in the US so
so I think the field is kind of
stumbling along but even just comparing
metrics across different studies as hard
so there's some commercial software out
there there's some government software
that's about to be updated but in
general we're not at the point yet where
we're influencing design very much the
the best one I know of is a software
called B's which as of right now is
about 10 years out of date but I've
heard a new version is coming out soon
but it's still a question of data and
it's a question of you know where are
you and what we're moving toward is
carbon labeling on products so when you
get a bag of cement or you get a
concrete truck you know what the carbon
emissions are per ton because the
supplier has provided it and that's what
architects and engineers are demanding
because clients want to know what's the
carbon footprint of the building so I
think we're moving toward carbon
labeling of the whole supply chain but
we're not quite there yet so I think in
the next decade that's what you will see
and you will see
architects and engineers choosing
materials based on those published
values of emissions and so that's where
that world's going hi Kevin Chen from
google thanks for really nice talk I
noticed that in the McKenzie curve the
biggest kind of opportunities are
generally in kind of retrofitting and
pretty mundane things around insulation
and I can't help but think sometimes if
you're an architect or a structural
engineer it's kind of your a hammer and
everything looks like a nail that the
best thing to do is to not build the new
building and so I see that kind of in
general with green things that you know
I'm gonna buy a new green handbag but
you should just use the old handbag you
already had and you should you know just
drive less instead of buying a new Prius
or a second new Prius or something like
that so have you kind of dealt with that
at all like talking to people about
saying maybe you shouldn't be building a
new building at all just kind of a
Admiral thing so I'm with you brother
and the truth is that there's a there's
some exciting work now that's really
looking into this in terms of you know
even if you tear down an old building
and build a new high-performance
building how much better are you off in
a 50 year life cycle and also
considering that the most dramatic
carbon cuts that have to be made and I
didn't try to state the case for carbon
because I didn't think I needed to make
it in this audience but the we really
are looking for action in the next few
decades and you're right the most
effective thing to do is to retrofit
existing buildings it's less sexy it's
kind of like politicians repairing
bridges rather than building new ones so
but it's fundamentally important and
that's where a lot of the cost benefits
are so but that has to do with wider
issues about consumerism about you know
our growing companies and campuses and
those are some big fundamental questions
we have to grapple with is how do we
grow but let's just say that I live in
an old house John yeah Allen Jacobson
for material I was wondering you showed
a couple examples where Net Zero
buildings exist right so they've they've
proven that technology can happen
um why aren't all buildings netzero I
mean is it is it come down to the cost
of energy and if the cost of energy was
the real cost of energy than people
would be incentivized to do that um it's
it's a few different things it is about
incentives it's also about clients who
come to the table saying I want a net
zero building and bringing together a
design team to achieve that because I
think I mean let's take school buildings
as an example let's be honest firms have
solutions and a drawer they pull them
out and that's what they apply and they
meet code and and the firm who designs
and builds the building isn't the one
who pays the energy bills so they're not
terribly interested in cutting those
emissions or cutting they don't reap any
benefit from saving energy over time
unless the client has come to them and
said this is a stated goal so I think
that's important to say and I will say
that if it were easy it would be a
no-brainer but right now you know our I
think our energy in this country is
artificially low I think we pay we pay
we don't pay full costs in terms of
externalities and other health effects
for our fossil fuel based energy and if
we did those externalities would help
change the pricing but right now it's a
combination of yes you can do it but it
takes a concerted effort and it's not
going to get there without the right
combination of technology and policy and
and and and frankly to be perfectly
honest the most effective thing in the
building sector right now even
implementing a carbon tax for example
would not help us as much as improved in
regulations so over time as building
standards go up buildings improve but
that process you can imagine is quite
slow and and there are people who are
out ahead of that regulation and that's
what those Net Zero buildings are but
they're quite far ahead of it look at
kelowna Columbia University first thank
you for a very interesting talk I see
that you stressed very much the
importance of making the right decision
at the beginning so with an analogy with
computer systems though seems like there
is a design time
and then there is a run time for the
business when the business the building
operates so I would like to understand
to which extent those decision that you
make at design time are in some sense so
fundamental and so static decision that
you know the the modeling of how the
building's operates during the day or
during decision seasons is after all
something you can do once and for all at
which extent instead you need the
additional technologies to sense the
building as a dynamical environment and
dynamically dynamic system yes which
needs to so be optimized continuously
yeah then the next speaker is going to
go into this a bit more detail in terms
of the initial design but but
fundamentally it's true that we can
adapt buildings over time it's true that
building occupants can play a role and
let's say twenty to thirty percent
difference in energy use if you put a
sign next to an elevator saying this is
you know eighty thousand dollars a year
in energy costs and it's better for you
anyway to take the stairs you know we
take elevators at work and then we drive
to the gym and then we ride a
Stairmaster you know I mean there's some
just so I think occupant behavior is a
whole area of research and there's a lot
of work on that but but that is even in
addition to the initial design so the
initial design is still where the big
mistakes are made and occupants don't
have that much to say about it and as an
example all of you and your offices you
don't have a whole lot of say about the
performance of that building someone
dictated that for you and and you're
kind of stuck with it so so I think
while you can make adaptations during
the run time where that for me is an
additional layer of icing and in
particular it's still the initial design
that's that's most important but it's a
good point all right said so do not iron
in Colorado State University I noticed
you mentioned a lot of collaborations
quite a few times between architects
civils and the mickeys is it by design
that you left my kind out the electrical
engineers because it is where
it's non-trivial to connect the wind
energy and the solar energy and manager
Thanks it's it's not by design it's not
fair irreverence that most of the
audience so there are a lot of computer
scientists and electrical engineers here
and the truth is that there's huge
potential and importance and that whole
the whole aspect of of what electrical
engineering can bring two buildings in
terms of smarter buildings and energy
delivery and but let's just say I don't
know much about that but it is a it is a
big area thank you for raising it my
name is Sam Dekker from Cummings I'm
very interested in a personal experience
in trying to work with a local community
city boards and elected officials and
trying to get the kinds of buildings
that you just showed built and what I
find is they're completely unprepared
most of the time to deal with bridging
the gap between cost of construction and
and vice approached a city council with
the lifecycle cost assessment request
you know shouldn't that be the
foundation for the buildings can you
speak about what role you're kind of an
institution the design team everyone in
the room and working in their hometown
what role we have to play and an
outreach related to that yeah there are
a few things and and we do have to be
creative about the financing because for
example you know places like like MIT
and and other big universities they're
taking pots of money now that was
reserved for operating the buildings and
they're using that and the initial cost
to get to achieve savings in operation
because they can get a better return for
that investment than they can from the
market so making those economic
arguments are absolutely fundamental but
it's not but i think it's it's clear
that most building projects begin with a
with a tight budget and it's also clear
and i should acknowledge which further
demonstrates how fragmented and
difficult the building industry is
projects rarely come in on time and on
budget any of you who've ever managed it
can
struction project I mean coming in under
budget and ahead of schedule is almost
unheard of so you know we can laugh
about it but we can also say there's
something broken here and we need to
work on it across a range of different
sectors and and I think we're going to
hear a little bit more about that later
in the session but i would i would say
arming yourself with the with the
payback periods and the life cycle
costing and and trying to justify where
where the money should be spent upfront
may mean that you end up with a
different kind of building you know
maybe you have unfinished concrete
floors that helps you with modulating
thermal changes but so but you save
money in other areas and so so i do
think i'm not giving you a good answer
here but i guess what I'm really trying
to say is that is that creative
financing is necessary you find in the
UK right now some of the major major
construction companies are doing design
build operate so they'll build a
hospital but they'll sign a 40-year
lease to operate that hospital and
therefore their whole financing
structure is built around the life cycle
profits that they can achieve over 40
years so it's in their interest to come
in ahead of schedule under budget with
low operating energy over a 40-year
period and that kind of creative
financing is is one way to achieve a
lower life cycle costs but I I
acknowledge that it's a it's an
important barrier thanks for a wonderful
talk I think this tension between form
and function is always being in
architecture and you know maximum no
square footage per dollar versus the the
beauty of the building and so forth so
but so my question is about reuse to
what degree can we just take the
building that was designed the net zero
and just and build it again somewhere
else so until a large degree a lot of
these things can be can be copied and
and what I'm leaning towards is open
source architecture and we've seen that
in software is that in hardware to what
degree are these blueprints cell usable
so it's it's true that in theory that
would be possible I think things like
attitude and and solar position matter a
lot local climate different latitude
it's the same latitude even you have
different climates whether you're in
Colorado or somewhere further east so
that matters but but i would say that
publishing giving away data performance
numbers you know it's hard to get good
data on buildings on how they're
operated and what you don't measure you
can't improve i mean go to your go to
the person who runs your office building
and ask them to give you some data on
the energy performance of your building
and see what you find so i think i think
we are seeing a move towards publishing
making it transparent letting other
people learn from what we've done but i
would say right now it's no two
buildings are alike and you have
different work cultures and and that is
part of the design problem but you're
right that there is there is potential
to learn from these few really excellent
examples and try to duplicate them
elsewhere and so that's why they are
terribly important and i wanted to share
them thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
