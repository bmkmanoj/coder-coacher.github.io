does talk about a product called euro I
play which is about giving your eyes
that work nicely to flavor media so
radio and TV so hopefully failure
self-explanatory that local this is a
sort of overview diagram that explains a
bit about what we're trying to do
essentially we're building a piece of
infrastructure what we as an analogy
call DMX for media the idea is you know
if you were Tim berners-lee and you
wanted to build a dozen but they will
add event a DNS yet you might just say
well before I can get on and make a
decent web shot no one's going to up in
all these numbers i need something which
looks up from the name to the number so
we're trying something a bit like that
in terms of making it easier to find
media content i'm sorry is there a
presentation I mean the left slide yes
we can't see it can you push
presentation on your remote the blue
button on presentation oh I'm sorry um
you know actually this is dressed up and
it again oh my back oh that's better
game you get there now cool you can see
ya great at that so this page is a
description of essentially the world
that we see ourselves living in and what
it is that we're trying to do we see
today is an environment with pretty
complicated media distribution and soy
loads of different technologies with the
same content but quite different ways of
distribution so in the good old days we
just have broadcast radio and television
platforms relatively recently and Johnny
hopefully we now get a lot of television
over the web as well whether
broadcasters website or web site such as
youtube a video blog website whatever
there's a range of applications there on
the internet but not of a web as well
and then finally I think quite
importantly many of us will have copies
of much of this content at home whether
it's on a PVR on something like a media
center pc what consumer oriented piece
of software or just just a plain Homer
server so you've got all this choice
about where to see content but it's all
split into these solos and fairly
complicated and when we first started
thinking about what we could do
space we thought of a whole load of
interesting applications around simple
media distribution and valid quite hard
to tie together the content was
different places and figured that a bit
of infrastructure in the middle might
just be helpful and so that's this year
I played look in the middle that we're
talking about now what physically we're
doing there is three things first of all
we're doing a very simple design in
terms of an excavator format and some
URLs that you can hit to get things an
idea if you like number two we're making
a first version of that a first server
that runs those those things that
produces and receives that XML and
responds to those URLs and then finally
we're doing some crawlers that pull data
from all that stuff on the left-hand
side into this first server that we're
using it's worth so no this is for
consumers this is all a developer
service so we see ourselves as a conduit
between two developers that might have
data and stick it into this central fate
and some developers you'd like to make
applications you'd like a noticeable
view of all the data across all those
different things sample applications
that we see at the most simple wouldn't
it be great to the permanent link that
tells you all the information about
where you can watch a television show as
it moves between rights windows as it
moves between locations in different
software wouldn't it be great to that
link was smart enough to know pays in
the UK rather than the US alone and
directs you to a broadcast of sight of
the u.s. that won't work but only to the
UK one and then some things you could do
that's more social or just simply
producing a nice simple television
interface that pulls in all that stuff
that's the overview of what we're going
to talk about I'm going to step through
the first section least go talk a lot
about the technical aspect of what we're
doing in the middle and then George and
I will talk about some of the
applications that come from the center
so we are Lee Anne I the founders of a
small UK startup called motor broadcasts
that's working on this George country
the BBC on the biggest a bit incredibly
supportive of us in this both in terms
of providing followed your support for
so that costs to get going on this it
also to providing data and expertise and
comments on what a broadcast would want
in this we're also building a growing
working very
details of that later but we're actively
looking for people to get involved in
this as developed as you might have data
you might like day so we'll just think
this is a good thing to have around so
television is a wonderful thing I love
television I actually love radio as well
but so what's a link to it television
has just just a a fantastic history
that's about at least three things
firstly it's about telling great stories
which engage millions of people every
day and it's not very fashionable to say
the television is an exciting thing
still but I believe that a sadistic
syndicated people are still watching an
awful lot of television and they'll
continue to appreciate that that
storytelling experience secondly
television has over the years but an
awful lot of good because it's that mass
medium it's been able to bring things
like this is a client error for a UK
series they'll to bring pictures of
amazing wildlife shots to initiative
people of the UK but this series was
distributed throughout the world in
terms of education in terms of
information it can be a pretty
incredibly powerful the third important
thing my provisional thing is that
fundamentally it's simple fundamentally
the proposition it offers you is come
home at the end of a long day don't
worry about anything turning on perhaps
flick some channels but find something
you'd like to watch sit back and enjoy
that quite a different experience from
browsing the web and trying to find
interesting and different stuff and I
think it's an interesting experience
particularly because in this world where
we have to interact with more and more
things television potentially offers a
chance to switch your phone just be
informed when tightened without a lot of
faffing about and it's that simplicity
that we were very focused on and we
first came to this supplier earth and
amazing series went throughout the world
but the simplicity angle isn't really
holding as true as we might like so
we'll hear our logos of just a few
places where you might find the planet
Earth episodes so it was actually a
series that was funded jointly by the
BBC discovery and NHK so they were all
the launch broadcasters you end up with
a range of on-demand services on which
it's available it's a BBC iPlayer or
something which is promoted now very
heavily in the UK the BBC is also
involved in something called can
which is going to be a sort of second
window on demand service so the content
is available for seven days of Lee DC
and then it Potter's into a different
rights window something quite common
stoughton media business models at which
point it's on kangaroo rather than the
BBC iplayer and the u.s. is a similar
arrangement where things are passing
through a site called hooli that's a
joint venture between news corp and NBC
and itunes is an option that perhaps
comes in a little bit off the broadcast
and offers you a chance to buy it there
is a huge array there of broadcast to
logos of people who broadcast these
things on their own channels so many
broadcasters in so many countries that
it's difficult to list them let alone
know the difference between SVT and STV
or ORF versus y la and each of those
increasingly I'm sure are going to have
on demand services on the web as well as
their traditional broadcast services I
put up more BBC channel logos because
people will repeat it would be more
times to watch it I put up a Lego The
Pirate Bay because we're the
broadcaster's like it or not they're not
good here the only people distributing
this weekend they will fight a battle
against those people but some of those
options will continue to exist and then
most people recognize that off for a
while content posts into a copyright
free window it's a good idea to put it
up for archive use for educational use
because he has an archive things like
the Wayback Machine will look so
increasingly odd kind of video content
as well as other stuff and then there's
a big picture here the biggest of the
hard drive because you know that the
place where the most of these locations
is just hard drives that are around the
place we've got copies sometimes that
those copies on allowed by the
broadcaster but if it's on PDL it's
perfectly legal in most jurisdictions to
record it off there for your own use and
to keep it there our drives are getting
bigger we'll have more more copies of
things like away so that simplicity this
promised translates technically to an
incredibly complicated environment you
end up with hundreds of broadcast places
and times tens of web locations if not
hundreds numerous versions an HD version
SD version the u.s. versions got
Sigourney Weaver on it the UK versions
got David Attenborough on it presumably
there's a smokier version as well I
can't miss copies of this all around so
they blinked your pictures of cats and
they'd had a teleconference
lion look at three picture of a cat
fixin to do it more and more now I can
we see it all for poops you need to jump
through to watch this but it often you
to know what time is it jump through one
big you need to know where you are the
cat's not quite arrived yet but you need
to that's right I wasn't sure you need
to know if you're the UK or the US or
some other country because it recently
people was right miss Gerri blocking
techniques to only make things available
in a particular place you need to know
what device you use because if you use a
portable device probably only support
certain encodings whereas a computable
probably bit more flexible I need to
know how your pain do you want to watch
the advertising version increasingly if
you don't was going to be a paid version
if you wanted to paid version is
probably a good cause you were then
they're less good quality one is
probably one to own and want to rent
just incredibly complicated each of
those represents our hope that you need
to jump three fundamentally but we
started all this was I would like to go
to go home use a remote control like
this turn on and find the content I've
like my user agent to figure out all
those things for me it should know where
I am it clearly knows what the time is I
should have told it some simple rules
about whether I pay for content or not I
should have told it or I should know
anyway what encodings that can deal with
and work things out it's not the only
use to watch it on television but we
felt if we could put a date informant in
place that was good enough to give you
that sort of simple interface anything
else in terms of integrating in a blog
or a website was also going to be an
awful lot easier so we set ourselves
some quite simple requirements I'll come
on in a minute orly well to describe it
how we're working to satisfy those first
of all we wanted permanently your eyes
for a piece of content the BBC actually
do a great job of that they've now got a
website where you go and find the net
instead of planet Earth and it's there
but they're really the first people to
do that I think even bloggers you might
recognize some of these principles of
not meeting things around often end up
rejecting or changing their domain and
we felt that there was a role in making
sure those permanent your eyes have
provided a wide range of content so that
then I can say to you I recommend this
so pass through your eye and you can
rely but you're going to find something
at the end of that regardless of what
time it is secondly we felt that it was
vital that you were more importantly
your user agent got deterministic
behavior out that you or I so it will be
good to know whether the file is
available or not it would be good to
know that it contains the correct
version of something that is you know
really representing what you expected at
the end of that you or I isn't obscene
in some way or perhaps as a slightly
bigger worry you know is it the free
watershed all the post watershed version
you only know that the fireplace I you
can download it and then it's going to
work with your kit and if you've got an
HD version HD TV you probably want a
very different version from the version
that you want on your iPod you're going
to be pretty irritated if that ipod
version tries to scale up your big TV
and finally really nice terms of doing
interfaces if you've got nothing more
than reliable titles a little synopsis
and there's a good length that maybe we
skip forward and back between episodes
in a series and you can produce a nice
interface but we set the first to its
bottle and the third is really nice in
terms of putting together some blue it's
an infrastructure that pulled all this
together a question I get asked a lot is
so it's a mess can't we just blown
broadcasters for that surely if they
just understood a little bit better what
the world of the internet was about and
that we just need simple files put up on
the website to be used as and when the
world would be a simpler place I'm
always quite keen to emphasise that
actually lives in pretty big factors in
play the broadcaster's here as well
firstly as the Writers Guild of America
strike indicator they often don't oil
rights and they end up doing deals with
people like the writers of course the
guy who owns the clapperboard whatever
to rent those rights from them for the
content they made rather than by the mag
right and their economic model is all
built on renting rights rather than
buying it so often the broadcaster's
only have the right for a period and
they'd have to take it down so they're
not in a position to offer a permanent
euro where the content can be offered
secondly a slightly more complicated me
actually I think off the more difficult
to get over they really care adult
relations
this be what context I mean they used to
not only saying we'll make this show but
the show will go at 8pm it will have
these efforts in the middle of it I'll
have these trials for our other shows
and that's the model in which they work
to put another way you know that orange
match wasn't special it was arranged
nicely with that you know the pretty
array of other matches and so
organizationally in terms of their
business model it's quite difficult for
broadcasters to move away to a model but
if you stick something up there at a URI
and that other people put the navigation
around it we can have arguments about
whether that's a sustainable position or
not part of this is about trying to help
broadcasts you fund the content at the
moment to move into a new world where
they still got a model while creating
better interfaces for everyone he wants
to build local conditions I think
another way to look at this is
fundamentally we're talking about some
information friction that's helping to
keep them what's going you know it's not
easy to jump from I want to watch this
episode all the way down through here is
an encoding the work for my heart where
in my location at this time and this is
the ER I to get it from and you need to
do a little work to pull that stuff
together and I think what we're really
about here is reducing that information
friction so the information comes very
quickly and very soundly from one place
to another and all of a sudden you've
got a world with a lot more
opportunities without having to hit up
against the barriers so that's really a
quick description of that first section
the environment that we see go jump into
what we're doing about it but have you
take questions on happy
we'll jump into some some details so I
think good news number one in terms of
the friction is that software provides a
good amount of grease to get over it so
course our stuff is built on an awful
lot of open source software I open
standards our stock is limited west java
and apache and tomcat with an offer
allah java libraries and we're spitting
out day to annex in xml it also happens
to be rdf a lot of what we'd like to say
to you now is a bit about why we chose
to use IDF and some of our learnings in
taking that slightly unusual technical
choice the other good bit of news in
terms of reducing that friction is that
all that data pretty much exists it's a
case of crawling it and putting it
together which we've felt a bit
tractable to ask now the BBC do a great
job of putting it at your eyes and as
will explain in a minute actually
publishing it increasingly in XML but
here's a moderately complicated example
if someone who does know that work we
found as we've looked around and saw you
have to do this that if you stop from
two directions from Wikipedia up there
and you grab everything from Wikipedia
and you achieve that info box for
television series or a film is pretty
well structured you get the titles of
the synopsis in the cast list and some
pretty big your eyes for a lot of the
series of films around if you stop from
another place and you have a TV schedule
you stop to get an idea of what was
broadcast way we then find its worth of
the easy often by crawling broadcasters
websites to link that show through to
that broadcast time because Wikipedia
link through to the show on the
broadcaster's site a broadcaster at a
time and also a link to their show
website so that link that the top three
sections is fairly easy to make and then
finally often or fair data provides a
missing leg because on many platforms
metadata is broadcast that says you know
what this episode is part of this
broader series so we can tie the whole
thing together so even in a moderately
complicated example it's possible to
pretty reliably cool title synopsis cost
content URL where you can get it from
the
caster transmission toilet series link
ish and you can put all sorts of stuff
like that you can see an easy way once
you got back for to add all sorts of
other data sources or maybe to start
augmenting files that are on your hard
drive with a URL around this so you can
link back to other data so the software
is largely their data there we're all
about adding a little bit of software on
top that pulls it all together in order
to make this a reality it's what we're
doing as we said is three things we
talked quite abstract so far about the
Amon you know what it is but to get
concrete on what technical work we're
doing first we're doing a simple design
so it's an XML veget format it happens
to also be RDF kind of in the same way
that are 88 happens to the audio that
most people don't worry about that
secondly an API which simply accept the
URLs with some guaranteed behavior at
the end of them then we're doing a first
implementation a website with an RDF an
API interface as well as HTML and we're
doing some first crawlers what we're
going to talk about here is the design
and the first implementation just as I
don't go to the ebc and talk to the
vacuum a television programs talk about
make cruel the cipher that would seem
like that a strange move and I think
it's also so what we're not doing this
is not part of building a commercial
business we aura I start up but here is
a village in Africa and if I were in
that virgin Africa thinking about
starting a retail business I think I
have two options as I look around me as
I observed that there were no rights
over within the village or really to the
village I would probably figure out that
that infrastructure is needed before I
have a flourishing retail business so I
could / dump the retailer idea and think
hey I'm going to build some some roads
in terms of structure here or i can say
you know what i'm going to join the
council i'm going to get involved in the
building in the right business i'm also
going to crack on with my retail
business which will flourish as
instructors in place that's very much
our process so some examples and things
that we're not doing all the data that
we're putting out here is getting public
the night if
some dates little pudding will come with
a attribution license or something and
what's that keep that going but as far
as possible we want the data to be free
for anyone to use it's not something
that only we can use commercially or
something like that secondly all the
software that we're watching around your
own player is going to be released fire
approved open source license thirdly
we're not going to start filing patents
or anything like that we didn't really
won't do anything else that the
community that we're building around
this don't like we're fundamentally
building some infrastructure here which
went north immoral activities for either
others to build applications on top we
started from assault disorderly mixed
bag logistic standards in this point
there's something called TV anytime
which any of you've worked into the
vision may well have come across and you
ask a TV anytime expert what the big
challenge with TV anytime is and they
say deciding which bits to implement ie
and the big standards committee in it
but everyone 10 idea they stuck
something in as far as I'm concerned the
whole bit of standard is to take things
out rather than positive so it's a
complex view of the broadcasting
industry three years ago doesn't really
cover on demand stuff incredibly
difficult to figure it all out the use
it as an inspiration when we're trying
to figure out represent subtitles but
not live then started that we apply to a
second thing which is probably more
widely years of TVA survivors of
something called XML TV it's a plain old
XML standard described schedules very
simple mobile demand so again not really
a simple starting point please go talk
now about what we actually did right so
as Chris said what we're attempting to
do essentially is provide some provide a
service provide something which allows
user agents and devices to understand
what content they've got no where they
can get it make sure that they can get
the right version that they're
interested in and basically make the the
experience for the user and as simple as
possible and so looking at that if I
break that down into the technical
challenges
the first thing that you need to do to
be able to do that is have a way of
identifying the abstract content that
you're dealing with which is essentially
the permanent your eyes that Chris was
talking about and secondly you need to
be able to link between those abstract
identifiers for video content and you
are elsewhere you can get their content
on the web only once you've done those
two things can you start attaching
metadata which is going to help you
understand which content you should be
accessing a given time whether it meets
the rights criteria whether it's the
right form after the device that you
showing that kind of thing and finally
is christen the intention with this
service with this principle is that when
I'm intending to open the data this is
this is open this we want this to be
adopted as widely as possible and so
it's important that services of this
kind are able to collaborate and for
that we need to be able to establish
equivalence between metadata that
different services have so in this
diagram we can see is this is a sniper
small part of the BBC programmes
ontology dictionary if you like for
describing video content and this is
this is our starting point for
describing the terms and the method ater
that we're interested in so you stayed
from the top going down you have the
concept of a brand which corresponds to
a broader show so that's not that's not
an individual piece of video content but
a group of content which related to each
other so EastEnders if you like below
that you've got an episode as it sounds
ominous so if there's a particular
episode of EastEnders which is aired on
a particular date that's your your
episode concept within that you have
versions which correspond to the example
Chris cape is pre and post watershed and
this is versions as in and different
bags of frames which the creator's the
content
intended to be distinct for different
audiences and then on top of that the
BBC also attached broadcast date and
which from our perspective we're
treating similar to locations on the web
it's another way of getting their
contents if you imagine if you imagine a
URI play aware device attached to your
your dvb and then it might be connected
to the Internet it might know that it
can download it for my player over here
but it might also know that it's on the
floor o'clock on channel on BBC two and
so it will treat that as another way
another location before that content so
that's the starting point of the BBC
have the next slide and we've added to
that the encoding concept and which is
an encoding other versions so if you
have something in you know certain red
screen resolutions and maybe mpeg-2
encoding versus another encoding with a
larger screen size it allows your with
with that concept included it allows
your device to know which is the most
appropriate version to show and finally
the we've then got the location primary
concept which is essentially a you or I
it's it's a it's a location where I can
get this particular encoding and there's
an auxiliary you've got the policy over
there which is it a concept group the
right information about when this stuff
will be available so an example of a
policy might be the iPlayer policy at
the BBC which says you're allowed to
watch piece of content up to seven days
after it was broadcast on the BBC so
that that policy information helps your
device know when you can get a
particular piece of concept content and
the razor ship between these concepts is
relatively straightforward a brand has
many episodes and episode has many
version has many encoding and encoding
has many locations so to talk about how
you go about establishing the identity
of a piece of abstract comment content
for semantic web gurus this is the
process of minting your I'm creating a
name for something which is abstracted
may not or doesn't exist in any place
that you can go and get it's just a name
for something clearly if you want to be
able to talk about video content which
appears in many locations and understand
that this piece of video content over
here is the same as this piece of video
content over there you need to have that
common name so with your I play this is
the scheme or four names that we're
creating this is very personally
straightforward at the top breakdown of
the primary sources the brand the
episode the Virgin encoding location and
broadcast times appear as a separate URL
scheme and policies and separate URL
scheme as well you're right play sorry
go so the brand here represents like
that the name oh yeah that's an include
programs named group yeah so if
different broadcasters have like ten
o'clock yeah they appear they'd have a
different brand they would have two
separate brands yet so you know if you
if you if they both have ten o'clock
news then they would have to appear at
different URLs and your eyes and have
different names is there and there's a
mechanism in place fit and so when when
someone has well okay so in terms of
where those names come from there's
various options which we would support
any of one the ideal solution would
clearly be that the broadcaster's would
would mint those names themselves and
clearly we've started from
the program's ontology that the beauty
of created they're doing a great job of
creating names for all of their programs
and minting your eyes for them and
keeping those your eyes permanent saying
there they are at the moment not many
other broadcasters are doing that in an
ideal world all broadcasters would start
doing that and that would make life very
simple you didn't even more ideal world
they'd actually start producing them in
the same format as well but maybe that's
too much to hope for so in a world where
not all broadcasters are minting your
eyes for their programs there needs to
be a reliable source where you can get
those kinds of names so that could be
your I play if another service springs
up which is doing something similar but
is not your I play that would also work
and as I'll explain when I get onto the
IDF section and the the principal
includes mechanisms which allow you to
state them the name I've given for this
thing is the same as the name that this
person is given for it so that you can
have services coexisting which we just
do the same thing there's a very
interesting trade-off between having
that name as a piece of text that aims
to be human readable versus a long
number a bit of hex or whatever we've
decided to go for the human readable one
as much as possible on the basis that I
think it's actually it works or white
Wikipedia and you end up with a large
number of names that are quite sensible
so I very highly in Google generally you
look at the link and you know that
you're going to get the thing that you
expect you end up with a few of course
where it ends up being a bit of Max and
ten o'clock news risks that because
there's going to be many of them and
you'll have to put some sort of slowly
non-standardized portal on the end to
make it make sense and we don't see this
as a so much a directory where you find
the content you want as once you find it
elsewhere you follow this link through
each other to get it so we're not so
worried about that effect and we feel
that you know generally that's quite an
advantage of people seeing a nice easy
I mean humans humans aren't going to be
typing these you all right and when we
do it annoys me you know and we're doing
testing but we don't expect people to
Iquitos it so you have lots of course
man how was the big stroke while you
were such a student they had these home
yeah gives new rose oh yeah that was
hitting it up before advantage either
way just meet you as I feel sexually
really because before he would me yeah
yeah mess anywhere else have the name of
the book clutter from the credited in
laughter the years this I think I serves
RFC within 10 years ago out by that one
of our bosses and 40 got 14 watch TV and
this is everything this this is RFC
where's describe the way to you you're
right way identification of different
programs I think this is yes specific
but broadcloth protocol okay no it's not
broadcast protocol it's about as it is
it too late is to refer to see a man
show yes as it's a way to name this and
well you can look in the weather there a
lot of discussion whether whether this
is a good operational and they also
discussed in blogs in somewhere around
this rock receive a base cus whether
someone should use like website your URL
to identify brokers or not so yeah
different different marijuana iris
intuitive argument if you want one one
thing we should point out is that whilst
it's important in principle for brook or
video content have a name the exact
scheme of the name doesn't actually
matter in fact we've come up with this
scheme because we just we think it's
good we think it's simple and easy to
understand but as might become clear
when we move on to the RDF stuff the
actual structure of the the name is
independent as long as it's as long as
it is a unique identifier for the
resource it does matter about the
structure and I think one of the things
that we anticipate
hopefully as this service grows up is
that people will contribute ideas as to
what the best structure is and it might
change but it doesn't it doesn't affect
the underlying principle so just to
clarify then you've got three
hierarchies here yes they're also one of
the things that becomes clear when you
start messing around with RDF and
metadata like this is that you end up
with an awful lot of your eyes so here
at the point is that exists in three
separate hierarchies yes so um the the
top one is the most important this is
that's the hierarchy of the names for
video content the second one is a way of
encoding broadcast time channel
broadcaster as it as a URI and the last
one is a relatively arbitrary naming
scheme for the different that's what
most policies what connects the
freighter the IDF so I don't have I
don't want to tell teach people suck
eggs but to just briefly talk about RDF
which on next slide exercise that was a
hint yes RDF an RDF document is a
collection of XML describing a resource
and so what you end up with is a chunk
of XML identified by a URI and it holds
a bunch of properties together and says
these properties all apply to this
resource and so in terms of tying these
three your eyes together it's the rdf
XML document that does it and we'll see
that shortly so I'll go through what's
going to say for this slide and then
we'll come on to that stuff I think it
what we were saying briefly on that
second hierarchy you get no data back
when you hit that instead you get a
region eight back to the first one it's
quite a nice simple interface where you
say you know what I know the time I was
watching I know the time I was watching
it hits you back to that first one then
you get a set of RDF it's true the
behaviors that you gave you these
different your eyes and hopefully will
become clear as we go through actually
about that day time is that gmt UTC
that's the w3 standard for date format
so as its UTC well it would be a UTC be
there is a field four times so you can
you can specify times anyway like I mean
precisely that we'd imagine there is if
you specify a great time with the time
zone we would then reject redirect you
back on UTC one so there's one
definitive 1 and similarly if you put
seconds or something we'll get back to
one specific your eye and then that in
turn would redirect on to the place
where you get the actual data so the
actual episode your version is playing
at that time yeah I mean it's worth in
fact if you go back briefly it's worth
pointing out that and on the one hand
you mint a URI which is the canonical
URL for a given resource and but at the
same time that you do that you may also
sort of spontaneously cause to exist
several aliases for it so for example
the example you are I that we've got at
the top there the holy city one and you
can see the episode part of the URI is
season number and episode number and in
the case where an episode actually has a
title you might have you or I which was
Brandon title of episodes title and the
season and episode number version of the
URI would be an alias for the same
resource you'd always have a canonical
and economical form so it would be
possible to say if you put in the season
episode version it redirect you to the
canonical version so you know which one
you dealing with would you ever have
would you ever have an example of the
second existing without the first yes so
in the case of Holby City I don't
believe the episodes actually have
titles so looking at episode daughters
though they have absolute mess would you
ever have one that whether you associate
by time that doesn't have another one
identifying it by showing episode or
something similar and ultimately
something has to have a name when you
get right down to it so if if you if
it's hard to imagine it is hard to
imagine a piece of video content that
doesn't have a brand that he belongs to
at a certain borden all at or a name
of any kind yeah if that happened for
example that might be that i'm sure
Channel Five's programs never fall off
there so imagine that that might be that
at that time on bbc1 the program full
affair so there wasn't any program going
out and then that was dead out we've
probably got a name for it internally it
wouldn't be a program at some point we
should probably could probably do with
understanding the various different
cases and mapping them to perhaps HTTP
code so it may be even anything i
specify some stuff back I'd expect you
to do an attention thing with the HTTP
code except think about when you
indicate that you don't know and when
you need to take that you know it
doesn't exist for example both equations
both at some of my potential just
 Indian dishes ready if I were to
have you out for one-minute has to eat
alien form examining maybe it's
improbable sense yep yes you first get
me looking back to the start time so you
know what the chemical euros and then
back to the original place so if surgery
goes rise with each point of the ods
your Brides will get that after the
parade rates if you want to access it
programmatically you never work that's
assuming that we know the duration of
the program and one of the things that
rapidly becomes clear when you when we
start working with this stuff is that
you have to deal with sparse data and so
you you have to always deal with the
case that you might not know something
especially when as with this service the
hope is that if all community the
community around this will be
contributing data to it and so you have
to provide them the flexibility to say
oh I know when this program starts but I
don't know how long it is and then if
you don't know the duration for it and
you ask for something we don't know the
answer to you'll get back and n services
we don't know and you can presumably
pick times whether it's adverts on and
you wouldn't be logging the AdWords it's
going to be halls yes should we move on
to del DF stuff yeah so um RDF resource
definition framework is a technology for
describing resources on the web so it's
kind of it's an obvious design choice
whether or not to use it for something
like this in our case we chose to go
with it and the highest the highest
level really
the the choice which makes it
self-evident is do you buy into the
vision of RDF and the Semantic Web as a
pro RDF fundamentally as a technology
presupposes this idea of the Semantic
Web where you have lots of semantic web
based services collaborating and you
really gain the best the most benefits
from using it in that kind of
environment versus the con which is the
sort of the reputation it has in terms
of perceived complexity that it adds so
what I'd like to talk about briefly is
some of those issues of complexity go on
to the next slide so um pretty the
choice another way do we roll our own
XML format for describing all of these
things or do we use RDF to do here's an
example of what a home rolled XML format
might look like for some of this stuff
as you can see very simple I don't scare
anybody um which is a good point the
principal concern in terms of it being
complex is you know we need people to be
interacting with it with this format and
so might be that we can get over our
fears about and we need people reading
we don't want to put people off with it
so yeah here's the simple non scary
version and as you can see Brandon
breaks down into episode and you can
happen attach additional metadata like
titles and whatever to each of those and
that gets a little bit more complex when
we start adding things like XML
namespaces slightly more scary but still
quite straightforward and if we then add
in if we make that rdf so to speak you
can see what it changes to
essentially the names of the the odd the
URI names of things we're talking about
become RDF without attributes and
resources reference each other using RDF
attributes as were RDF about attributes
as well as you can see there so um when
we went through this process in terms of
the design we were thinking to ourselves
is it possible to make an RDF form an
IDF schema which we can use to describe
this stuff as simple or as close to two
as close to as possible the the simple
format i showed you first and ultimately
we decided that apart from what looks
like a lot of syntactic sugar we can
essentially to for developers putting
information into the service or taking
information out of the service they have
what looks like a slightly more complex
format but ultimately can be treated as
that simple online so looking in more
detail at the metadata we might attach
for allowing our user agents to actually
make the kinds of decisions of you want
them to make and here's a snippet of an
example encoding so this would be
contained within its corresponding
version and episode brand and a user
agent might download go hit the URL for
a given episodes receive a fragment of
RDF which contains this and it would
tell it that there is an encoding widget
which has the kind of bitrate the codec
and the audio format that you're
interested in and it's available at this
location and is restricted by this this
policy so if it's within the uri play
sorry the iPlayer window for viewing
that content you would know that it can
get it from the first location whereas
if it wasn't it will be able to find an
alternative location where it was
available and in each case it would be
able to check the encoding information
to find out of the available ones which
is the one that's most appropriate for
the device I'm actually going to show up
on and so that's all this underlying
identification of content and and and
permanent your eyes allow allowed this
metadata to be delivered to the user
agent in a way that we can stack so I
want to talk a little bit about that one
what we found by using RDF and what we
thought and so in terms of what's good
about RDF is flexible and it allows you
to do the the equivalence relations that
I talked about so so if you imagine you
have to separate RDF documents
describing the same resource for free
with in RDF you get the ability to say
this description is the same as that
description over there so by creating
uri players of service in this using rdf
and we're immediately opening the door
for anybody else who wants to create an
equivalent service and the two will be
able to close it codes it side by side
you also get the flexibility that people
can extend that format so we we're
defining some very basic concepts for
the intentions we have in terms of
making user agents function better but
RDF gives you the capability that
someone who might be interested in
creating a service that lets people find
content with certain actors in them or
something like that will be able to
extend format publish information in
that format and it would continue to
work with our service fine that's a
feature of RDF and its type system the
trade-off for that of course is that is
more complex your service unlikely the
hope home rolled xml format has to be
has to understand a wider range of
documents that people
I presented with and know how to deal
with them and know how to deal with all
the corresponding error cases and things
what people say things which don't make
any sense similarly that extension
feature is enabled by the inference
engines which are essentially built into
the to the rdf model when you define an
IDF schema you state the type model you
state what properties it has you state
that something is an extension of
something else whenever you handle an
rdf document you therefore must take the
document you've been given and calculate
the deductive extension of what the
document states so that you know all of
the trees that is really making and do
with it that way so that but the fact
that that inference is built into RDF
enables that whereas but clearly there's
a trade-off there which is that you have
to spend our computer time to do the
deductive extension each time and
finally an advantage of RDF is that it
is declarative so people around the way
are able to make statements without a
large amount of context in terms of what
they're using the information for they
can state the information of stand-alone
trees and easy to use it so that makes
it easy for people to make statements
about video content around the world and
you can harvest it and use it within
your right leg the downside to that is
that you do have to interpret those
statements so if someone if someone
makes a statement that a brand contains
certain episodes in one place and
someone makes a statement that brand
contains certain episodes in another
place if you've already uploaded one of
those descriptions and you want to
upload the next description you have to
know whether you should be removing the
ones which are missing or whether the
ones that have been uploaded are just
additions to it whatever so you get
additional complexity that way
so what is that all translate into and
rdf as a technology has been thought
about as i said in terms of a broader
Semantic Web and it's not RDF is not
created as a technology for people who
want to publish data people already
publishing data in their own formats on
the web without the aid of IDF RDF is
more about people being able to create
services that interact with each other
and as such there are some differences
on how you might go about implementing
the service that uses RDF if you're
creating a data source as opposed to one
of these bigger search engines or
aggregators so some some hints I would
give to someone who is thinking about it
one the first and most important one
would be don't treat your ontology which
is your definition of terms as
configuration data that is essentially
what you would do if you were going to
create something like an aggregator
because you don't care about
interpreting that they could beyond
what's stated in the ontology but when
you're creating a data source reading
about RDF treating the ontology as as
configuration data is almost a given for
most people who talk about RDF whereas
it quickly becomes apparent that really
what you want to do is encode down to
ontology as part of your application so
in our case it gets incorporated into
our data model and is pervades the code
as opposed to being a configuration data
and the second is those like to
incorporate everything into your main
ontology is it's very tempting to do and
to try to state all truths as definitive
and whereas it quickly becomes apparent
that you want to separate those things
those trees that you are stating is
definitive and those which are just
appropriate for the application do you
happen to be aiming at and so keep those
two things distinct finally probably a
rule for all software in general but
particularly this
keep it simple it's very easy to end up
thinking about all sorts of distractions
whilst you're talk whilst you're coming
up with your definition of IDF terms but
it's amazing how a small change at that
level can lead to a lot of complexity
down within the code okay I'm going to
hand you back to Chris to finish up okay
so let me write this pretty quick weave
dive deep into the middle bit and how
we're doing it and what the design is
there's quite a lot of complexity around
using all the earth there but actually
once the engine that Lee's been writing
is put in place we found that your life
in terms of crawling getting data and
interpreting what's already there and
figuring out what else you need to get
becomes much easier so we fill up a
building a very good and strong centers
of this I want to talk very briefly
about how we see that playing into a
sort of future world of media
distribution and that's what we are now
we've basically said we're building this
service it's going to feed a range of
applications that we can probably all
imagine them for the best ones haven't
even been thought of yet with some
simple data so right now we're saying
BBC a discovery data feeds into that for
instance or slightly random warring of
crawling the data across and hopefully
getting in better and better formats as
it goes on maybe we need some Wikipedia
stuff people who distribute content and
nice people to know so many want to play
this natural day sure as well and you
can imagine that diagram quickly gets
very complicated in terms of piecing
together all the different elements of
data we hope however that it's useful to
with applications becomes part of the
environment to the point where it's not
our ambition to run the main server that
does this it's our ambition to start to
create a slightly different world so
maybe rather than just as putting it out
everyone starts to put out data in a
format that might look a bit like this
or evolved from it that helps you to
solve these applications at that point
all very worthy is what beta coming
direct from the horse's mouth but it's a
bit complicated for the application
provider so then what you probably do
need is a very simple aggregator pulls
it all together and sends it on to the
application provider it's at that point
that we hope that we would be able to
remove some of the walkie wiring take a
small role in the overall thing and we
hope to move towards this world where we
start to build some standardization
standards is a big word but you know we
start to contribute to the first stages
of
zation of how you describe television
programs from brand all the way through
to encoding and location that's the
benefit people who want to build
applications and I just like to talk a
little bit but we're doing it quite
quickly so that's more common wise xmas
special 977 most which TV show ever in
Britain we will be the most TV will show
ever in the future because we have 20
million viewers at a time it was about
55 million people in the country at that
time those three channels we knew all of
this and we knew and why people watch
Italian how they watched it mostly by
people filling in to our forms which
incredibly still exists as a way to keep
track of how people watch telly it was
simpler then we as a different era the
Prime Minister once made the BBC delay a
different TV show not Mork and white
because screening would affect your
election results so it's kind of not
really like that anymore one of the
things we really want to encourage with
this is an ecosystem we want viewers to
be able to choose what they want to
watch we want devices to start being
able to say I can do this I can't do
this we want a world in which people
never have to care about codecs and
we're trying to encourage devices and
web services to interrupt together both
large companies let yourself as well as
tiny tiny bedroom companies we want
people to play and get their hands dirty
and you know some of the BBC really like
three software and standards and we like
helping them because we think it's going
to help us we don't think we know
everything about this we think we've got
a strong understanding of what a major
world-class broadcaster needs from this
and we think that perhaps we could get
some learning from tiny tiny micro
broadcasters as well as other people
that understand how the web fits
together and we see it benefit as
directly in new services which we're
going to be producing and which which
will potentially become incredibly like
the location and konec and aware so that
viewers don't have to be really that's
what's kind of always on it so right now
we're finalizing the first version of
this and as part of that iteration
between code and design figuring out
what the URL should be what the data
format should be so forth in two weeks
we're really going to move into a book
with prime time data time pulling all
the stuff in and getting a service it's
got quite a lot of emotion in it and by
the end of May you should expect to be
able to see it and to use it hopefully
program applications can stop pulling
some veteran knowing that it's a pretty
statement system to use and we're
definitely keen to have people you've
got data or no other way to get it stick
it into the mix as well so we're ready
to talk more with my website we've got a
google group and we're we're starting to
discuss this and other does is if you
love to talk more after to take
questions um okay so what are you define
the the brand and when you include the
episodes you know definition of your
brand does that scale to shows you know
The Daily Show five episodes a week
every week for the last 14 years you
know don't you end up with a massive
definition file I mean how does that
scale out for shows that run
indefinitely couldn't you d couple those
and say have the definition for the
program separate from each individual
episode but have some kind of way of
relating the two in what will be
necessary to do that at the time so you
know at the brand your I give the brown
information and links to the most recent
episodes maybe you end up with a I
switch at the end of it that says give
me or give me the last five and then yes
so your eldest represents the episode
there's also a lot of lot of shows over
time they just evolve and you know law
and order they'll replace the entire
cast three or four times over because it
just keeps on going perpetually some
ways the ramp that top level is a black
sheep in terms of those debt that
definition of terms because it in some
ways it's easy to view it as an
arbitrary grouping of the underlying
episodes because the episodes the
episodes of what really correspond to
the thing I want to download the main
reason that we will we included for two
reasons one its already part of the BBC
ontology and secondly in terms of the
interface that we'd like to create and
the simplicity of that interface we want
people to be able to navigate from the
current episode to the next one and so
there has to be some form of grouping
that allows you to define what the next
one really means so as usual doesn't
matter but and importantly it's entirely
feasible and past
for someone to create an alternate
grouping that sits on top so if you're
only interested in if you're interested
in breaking it down by year or season or
something like that you can do that and
you can lay that on top of form what
we've got and he interested in how
people are going to extend this and why
the points by the Guardian focus this
seem to be obvious applications but
social networking other bits and pieces
to this absolutely you intending to kind
of hang on to some kind of standards for
that encourage people to cooperate
better through your eye player Peter
cast doubts the world and see what
happens but I think that we would
probably and other I would like to have
a bigger as more serious communities
best for make a decision like we have I
think you probably would always expect
it to be a leading edge that wasn't part
of what we were looking after it I
reference implementation or describing
on our side over time you probably
increase their so there's an example we
don't learn from our past lists at the
moment because it's pretty difficult to
presenting some of that stuff but that's
a fairly obvious thing because I think
it would like to say you know what I
care about anything that's got this
director this actor in it so that's the
sort of thing that people can hang on
very quickly and very easy now if
they're sort of all the efforts but we
could extend it beyond that to the next
bit for us for example to be I'm told on
the internet or a TV programs event was
downloaded certain areas and that isn't
necessarily something that we'd be
linking to if they were on in a torrent
sites whatever but perhaps we might like
the fact that if that was happening that
it would be a nice thing if at least the
map dad was correct and that's so
therefore we witness if you run exam
service but hey it's it's it we're
providing information about TV shows and
then someone else is saying where they
exist so sort of touching that mean you
see what the thing is stopping me
watching anybody wanted it with any
changes this accommodation its roses on
which isn't really dressed for the stuff
is this all going find it at internet
intended on canvas yes did the decisions
do my village watches what this does is
it respects where there are those rights
issues their specs it but means that the
viewers have to care about it so I mean
you see that in just solid ever
naturally to use or
there are other things have noted you're
making war three there's definitely more
things that can be done that that could
be a discussion for the rest of the way
but I mean uh I see this is one part in
helping to move to a different world in
terms of think one of the things that
enables current models is that degree of
friction that means that you haven't got
this information on or I want to watch
this episode one of my options and so if
we remove some of that friction and I
think you know it's one of a number of
things that helps promote as noted
mother's x 20 more than 55 is not a fine
do this for them actually the vitamin
equal takes over him or boiling
incredible start off I make in fact
we're always fighting with the malls
meet you by the way thank you realize
what you stop talking to come to my
knees yeah we have to poke you became I
keep turn up against Isis which is
exactly where we separately often to a
quality thing on the side and
interestingly because you've got a
policy with your I attached to it you
had an application protocol say you know
what if you need to specify the stuff
that's in that policy I might as an
application providers to ignore that and
not even bothered to try and parse that
policy and I I think we've done a lot of
reasonable job describing the drm but
given that it tries to do things and
some things that kind of defy gravity in
terms of you know revoking keys already
give it to someone and so forth and you
know it's not possible to think about it
hard and define the complete set of
prescription someone might try and lie
so I mean common restrictions at the
moment are it's available for a bit and
it's taking a one again and that's
clearly very easy to describe and then
you know we applied one of a number of
dr existence to it which you will need
to understand before you can decode that
and it's that sort of level of five or
six parameters that we described at the
moment I think I agree with you that it
became incredibly complicated thing I
look for separating replicated lactation
