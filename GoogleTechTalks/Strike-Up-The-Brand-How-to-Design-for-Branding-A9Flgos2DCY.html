well hello everyone sorry to turn the
music off there but it's time for dad to
do his talk so I just want to know do I
need to introduce Jared does anybody not
know who jared is I do need okay Maria
doesn't know who gerardus bullets kona
so jared is well-known figure in
usability he's ridden Burke's used in
lots of presentations he runs a company
called user interface engineering which
is very well known in usability circles
and I'm delighted to have dragged along
here today's me talk about branding and
he's promised to be controversial and
stimulating now he's also made a special
request earlier today he did a talk at
Yahoo and the Yahoo crowd a very meek
and we're very quiet and so he's made a
special request for us to heckle and ask
questions and we don't want anything
thrown at a Jared but but interesting
stimulating questions are very welcome
and and this also this talk is going to
be recorded for google video and
released publicly so to spare that in
mind when asking questions at the end so
over to Jared thank you very much i'm
very pleased to be here and very pleased
to be in stereo i think if you just hold
your finger up to your nose about a foot
away you can actually see everything in
3d so what I want to talk about is the
relationship that we've discovered in
our lab between brand and usability so
sort of talk about what what it means to
design to strengthen the brand in
addition to designing to make a usable
process and to talk to some extent about
the overlap between that this is the
homepage of Cisco calm and if you come
to cisco calm cisco has a very strong
brand particularly amongst its its
customers people who enjoy using cisco
products
are very much go around and tell all
their friends and think the company is
great and would be very sad if cisco
were to disappear tomorrow and so it's
very strong but but the experience the
cisco.com site is an interesting one
they have a marketplace on their site
where you can come and see the various
products that they have for sale they
have software and they have manuals but
they also have for example merchandise
that you can purchase and if you decide
that you want to purchase the
merchandise you you click on one of
these boxes like this one here it says
logo merchandise us and you're
immediately asked for a username and
password chances are you don't have a
username and password so the experience
at that point is that you get this
screen that tells you that they that
they apologize because you have entered
an invalid username password combination
or you've forgotten your password and at
this point you're actually required to
register in order to buy a t-shirt with
a cisco logo on it the registration
process is actually a four-step process
you go through step one where you
specify the language you wish to speak
your name and then confirm the language
you wish to speak and put in your
password and then you have to then
decide how they're going to sell things
to you in the future then you get to put
in your business information and your
phone number and then you get to confirm
the language you speak one more time
describe how you want to see search
results if you ever see search results
on their site and then you're sent an
email which you have to dig out of your
email folder you have to then click on
it to actually get entered into the
system and then at that point you have
to remember how you got back to the
marketplace so you have to go back to
the marketplace homepage you then have
to get the password you then enter the
password and it then lets you see what
apparel is for sale and you can find
that lovely jacket that you always
wanted this is also you can wear a piece
of clothing with their
we'll go on it now the question is what
does that do to the cisco brand what
happens when someone goes through that
experience does it strengthen their bond
to Cisco or does it weaken it and that's
really sort of the question that we're
we're interested in and how brands work
and how people interact with the the
types of interaction so we started
looking at this question way back in
nineteen ninety eight so we've been
spending the last eight years sort of
looking at what does it mean to design
for branding on a website and we've been
looking at graphics images various types
of messaging the experienced users have
we've used I trackers and field studies
a variety of techniques to to do this
and this is ongoing research this is by
no means done research it's just one of
our ongoing research agendas and when we
talk about brand a lot of people think
that what what you're talking about our
logos but in fact logos are not brands
they are brand elements they are
representations of the brand this I'm
sure is a recognizable logo did anybody
want to take a guess how did eyes that
okay there you go that is the Nike logo
of course the swoosh which which nike
paid a graphic designer graphic design
student $35 for this brand for this logo
so yeah that's what they got that's
that's that's that's that's pretty much
the going rate for a 16 billion dollar
company this you sure it's not clear it
could be korean air yeah it's it's just
a brand element it's here it comes up as
a Pepsi representation but in other
places in the world you might
immediately associate it with something
else the FedEx logo is an interesting
logo in that it used to be Federal
Express and they spent more the
then two and a half million dollars i
believe to change it to fedex and the
primary reason for doing that was it it
required less purple paint purple
pigment weighs more than white pigment
and as a result they saw significant
fuel reduction charges of fuel charges
on their planes because they were able
to reduce the way now one of the key
benefits of the new FedEx logo is
actually the arrow does anybody here not
see the arrow in the end the logo you
can be brave and raise your hand if you
don't see the arrow a couple of you okay
the arrow is right there between in the
negative space between the E and the axe
they paid two and a half million dollars
for that arrow and I have to show it to
you and the interesting thing about the
arrow is that half the time it's pointed
in the wrong direction now those are
brand elements and when we're talking
about branding that's something very
different so we sort of started to go
off and look up definitions of branding
and on the encarta website we found this
one which is branding originally a
searing of flesh with a hot iron to
produce a scar with an easily
recognizable pattern for identification
or other purposes so that was now it
occurred to us that this came from the
ax Carta database which we then realized
is a Microsoft property so this does
seem like a Microsoft pattern but there
are other definitions that we like to
work with in particular this is when we
found for Miriam Webster and we liked
the definition here that says to impress
indelibly there's this one here it says
to mark with disapproval to stigmatize
that's the coca-cola people tried that
it didn't work so much for them this is
definition that we like which is brand
name which is having a reputation and a
loyal following so when we go with with
brand what we're talking about is this
sort of loyal following this reputation
that's what we're looking at now
branding is basically a when you look at
it from the perspective of the
individual who's being branded the
the recipient of the brand stuff it's
basically a conditioning process where
you use colors symbols phrases to create
some sort of emotional response that
creates engagement and eventually causes
people to to interact with and seek out
that brand and it's it's really much a
repeated process does the name pavlov
ring a bell it's it's very much this
sort of interactive thing and probably
one of the best brands that we have ever
seen is harley davidson it's really an
incredible brand and it gets people to
do things that few other brands do I
mean imagine you know close your eyes
for a second and imagine this this is
just you know how it works imagine a
Google customer with the Google brand
tattooed to a body part ok that's what
harley-davidson does yeah they get
people to tattoo things to their body
and it's just amazing even Lorenzo Lamas
does this so and by the way this is a
the result of google image search finds
all sorts of amazing things but brands
are not necessarily just logos they can
be physical things like the design of
something like an iPod or mini or they
can be people and so you it's how people
interact with those known things that
turn out to and brands are not
necessarily always positive they often
can have a negative reaction and people
don't necessarily respond positively to
them and there are all sorts of things
that happen vioxx which is this is an
old ad for vioxx they had Dorothy Hamill
as they're a source spokesperson and you
know Vioxx subsequently was a fine brand
to start with and was very positive but
then the news turned against them when
people started having all sorts of
issues with heart attacks and heart
failure as a result of taking it now
maybe you know the problem was that they
chose the wrong spokesperson and instead
you know someone like Barry
bonds would have worked better Barry
Bonds is a baseball player baseball is a
sport that people do when they're not
working just in case you were wondering
yeah he does it well he's working that's
true uh hey apparently he gets to do
drugs while he's working so do we but so
it turns out that if you want to look at
what branding happens what's what's
going on is in essence what people
invest in branding branding is is from a
corporate perspective as an investment
what people are doing is they're putting
you know it's sort of like saving money
up in a bank account you put money into
the brand you make investment by doing
brand related activities and then you
hope that that money will then come back
in some form typically in in some sort
of sales or future income so and there's
two ways that that investment can be
made affinity branding and dispositional
branding affinity branding has to do
with the relationship of the brand
element the logo for instance and the
item so here I have a computer and if I
told you if I put on this computer a
Sony label you would immediately
associate things with that particular
computer you'd associate things about
the quality of the computer about the
price about the technical capabilities
about the reliability and this would all
be based on your previous experience
with the sony brand if i were to take
off the sony label off that box and put
back onto that box a different label
let's say the walmart label instantly
your perception of that box would
probably change you would think of it as
a different device that would it would
be something that is less technical or
more less pricey and particularly let's
quality or maybe if you you know like
Walmart you dislike Sony it might go in
the other direction
so your perceptions your experience with
those particular brand elements causes
unit and that's how affinity branding
works affinity is this sort of
relationship between the two and there's
all sorts of ways that it works for
instance banks use the FDIC and Equal
Housing lender logos because it
instantly gives them some sort of
credibility it gives them the transition
of the affinity from those particular
brands the FDIC brand or the Equal
Housing lender brand instantly transfer
to that institution ProFlowers has to
explain some of their brands they for
instance put the FedEx logo on their
site because they deliver their flowers
overnight by FedEx and they want that
association with that but they couldn't
just put the logo there they also had to
explain why the FedEx logo was there in
order to give people that background
this is a cruise site and you know it's
it's like hundreds of other cruise sites
that are out there it's it's filled with
all sorts of stuff again to give it
credibility they talk about all the
different cruises that they have so they
list all of the items there so again
this is how affinity branding works by
putting the brand elements on the site
all of a sudden it gives the site that
much more credibility to those people
who are positive that about those brands
that have a good brand engagement with
those brands not all brand elements end
up connecting with their brand there was
a study done during the height of the
dot-com boom where they asked people
what pets online pet store this was they
gave him about ten different choices of
pet store calm pets com pet food calm
dry things and nobody knew they all
recognized the puppet but they didn't
know what store it went with people it
was very rare that people could actually
say that this was pets com now pets com
is gone but the puppets you can still
buy other places where it breaks you
know has to do with with just the fact
that people
have certain expectations on an early
version of the site from Samsonite they
they had issues one was that this didn't
actually look like a their banner it
looked like a banner ad so people were
confused about the fact of what site
they were on they were all so confused
that this site which was supposed to be
the outlet store for Samsonite was
selling American Tourister suitcases
which people perceived was a competitor
and a competitive brand they didn't know
that at some point in time samsonite had
acquired american tourister and it was a
sister brand because they often were
seen as being sold against each other
and other strange things about this page
like for instance we had users in our
studies who didn't want to buy any of
the suitcases listed here because they
thought they were boat suitcases and
they wanted airplane suitcases so so
affinity branding is about having the
logo near the item and having that
transferred the value of the brand
element transferred to it so it's it's
it's much like being in an airport and
having the getting off the plane and you
know having flown to San Francisco
realizing that it might be cheaper to
rent a car than to take a taxi downtown
for the trip you get off the plane you
go down to baggage claim and and in case
of San Francisco you ride the little
tram to the rental car cabana and then
you're faced with this slew of rental
car agencies for which you need to
choose one and there's hurts and there's
Avis and there's your budget and there's
Bob's discount Reynolds and all of them
are identical they all have the same
size booth in the same shape and the
same color scheme and the same surly
teenagers working behind the counter the
only difference is the brand elements so
you choose your brand in that regard
dispositional branding is different
dispositional branding has to do with
what happens when you don't have those
visual clues when instead you're back in
your office and you're thinking gee I'm
going to make this trip and now
I think about it it's probably cheaper
to rent a car than to them to take a
taxi so I'm going to pick up the phone
and I'm going to go to a website whose
website am I going to go to Who am I
going to call on the phone and in that
instance you know you say well i'm going
to call hurt so I'm going to call Avis
that's dispositional it's it's it's
dependent on the brand popping into your
head at that moment and so to do a
little experiment I'd like to try
something and I see that many of you
have brought equipment instead of paper
to write on but if you have a piece of
paper or some place to take notes or you
can just make a mental note i guess if
you want i mean i want you to answer
these four questions okay so we're gonna
do a little experiment here we're going
to see how this works when you answer
these four questions the first question
is if you could go anywhere in the world
to dinner tonight what restaurant would
you choose so imagine if you have paper
write that down or type it into know a
file on your machine or for those of you
who write it on your arm or something so
what restaurant would you choose second
if your car failed you today and you
needed to replace it tomorrow with the
current financial state you are in for
current your current financial context
what brand of car would you buy okay
next if you had to get a package to the
east coast by 8 30 or 1030 tomorrow
morning if it was absolutely necessary
that you do that whose package delivery
service would you use and forth if
someone came rushing into this hall
right now and said have you guys seen
the headlines you have to see the
headlines what source would you go to 4
headlines yeah I know
okay just done up just put it down okay
now if you've recorded all this if you
if you haven't what I want to do is I
want to turn to your neighbor and see
compare the floor answers and see if you
have the same answers as your neighbor
okay my turn yoo hoo okay okay let's
start with the first one how many people
had the same restaurant is the person
sitting next to them hey buddy no you
you did what restaurant Charlie you just
were too afraid to admit it okay you
guys are loyal employees got it okay
they bought you with food is that what
they did yeah you know this has only
ever happened to other times I've done
this with thousands of people and
there's only been two other times where
this happen and by the way it wasn't
Charlie's that they suggested did you
always were the times that was both the
same restaurant is in two different
presentations it was the outback
steakhouse how weird is that ok how
about brand of car who had the same
brand of cars the person sitting next to
them ok a small number of you did
betting like Toyota Honda Lamborghini
amber guinea okay they paid you well
here too
you got it he works in the user
experience group doesn't everybody okay
so now how about the same package
delivery service how many people the
same package delivery service oh wow
fedex and UPS are doing well good
excellent how about up-to-the-minute
news source who had the same up to
minute news was it who hadn't didn't
have google but had the same
up-to-the-minute news okay interesting
very good well now here's the deal
they're about three times many people
had the same package delivery sting has
had the same brand of car but if you
actually look at the number of overnight
delivery services versus the number of
car models there are car brands there
are it turns out that there are about
one-tenth as many car brands as there
are businesses that will deliver your
packages overnight so statistically we
should have more matches for brands of
car than for overnight delivery services
the reason we don't have that is because
of the investment that companies like
FedEx and UPS have made and it's also
potentially because of a little trick I
play which is I just mentioned fedex and
that's called recency and what happens
is is that when someone sees a logo or
brand element they are more likely to
think of it dispositional e in the next
24 hours then if they don't see it in
that period so that's why companies pay
to have logos and things put on shirts
and jackets and billboards and stuff and
why so many of you are wearing Google
where so for showed the meanie so we
were dispositional e inclined toward a
car as well it didn't work well I didn't
talk about the many as much but you're
right that's true but it turns out that
that all of these things play a factor
many doesn't spend as much time as FedEx
does or UPS does trying to get their
brand into your head so they it turns
out that these things all play a role
now dispositional branding
is very context-driven so for example if
i gave you a different context for the
restaurant if i told you for example
that you are going to take you know a
very important customer to the
restaurant you might choose a different
restaurant well you guys wouldn't but
everybody else would choose a different
versus a restaurant that you were going
to you know you wanted to go to
celebrate your birthday with six very
close friends half of whom have seen you
naked at some point in time in your life
or a restaurant that you might want to
go to when you have a it's seven o'clock
at night and you have two kids under the
age of five who have not eaten since
four and there since noon and they're
very cranky and they definitely should
take a nap but they're not taking a nap
you might choose a different restaurant
at that point or you know a restaurant
you would go for lunch actually you
probably wouldn't choose a different
restaurant for that but the fact is is
that the brand that pops into your head
is very much dependent on the context
that you're at and that's how
dispositional branding works now in
order to create these brands it turns
out that there's also two methods in
which you can make the investment in
branding there's two things you can do
one is in direct messaging so that's
this active of putting logos on all
sorts of things to get that effect of
primacy and recency and and to have
those things come to mind and these are
very repetitive these take a long time
to do they're very easy to implement the
very easy to design and so the lots of
organizations do it the investment to
make on them is very small this is very
different than the second approach which
is experience branding an experience
branding you have to look at the
experience that the receiver is having
with the brand and the elements around
it and so it turns out that if you think
about the restaurant that you chose
chances are you chose it not because of
any sort of advertising that that
restaurant did but because of the
experience that you've had at that in
fact if we were to go to Epcot Center
disney world today and we were to
interview the people coming out of epcot
center and we were to ask
what made them go to choose to go to
Disney why do they pick that as their
vacation spot seventy-five percent of
the people today would tell you that the
reason that they chose it was because of
the great experience they had the last
time they went 75 percent and of the
remaining twenty-five percent the
majority of them would tell you that the
reason they were going was because of
that they have a friend or family member
who wouldn't shut up about the great
experience they had had at the park very
few of those people would tell you that
they were going because of some
advertising that they saw or some
explicit marketing the Disney had done
that it's primarily the experience that
they have that's what drives traffic's
to the theme parks and it turns out that
this is this is true Netflix has decided
that there are two most important
variables for them to track are the
number of people who sign up and when
they sign up tell them that the reason
they signed up was because a friend
highly recommended that they do so turns
out that in any given period about
eighty-five percent of the people who
subscribe to netflix say the primary
reason they subscribed is because a
friend or family member highly
recommended it and they also track in
the last six in the last three months
have you tried to convince somebody to
sign up amongst their existing
subscribers ninety-three percent of
their subscribers say that in the last
three months they have tried to convince
somebody to sign up they use those as
key performance indicators for their
company their company they have found
that their business lags those
indicators by about six weeks so it
turns out that when those numbers
stopped to dip that gives them a
six-week prediction about when their
revenue numbers are going to start to
dip and so they very much track those
two numbers which is referrals which are
all based on experience so these things
turn out to be very key so we way back
in nineteen ninety-eight that one of the
first Clues we got out of this was an
that we were doing when we were
comparing Ford to Edmonds and we were
having people look up information on
both sites in this case we were having
them look up how many people could you
fit into a ford ranger and the scenario
was something like this you you you you
landed a good job you've got yourself
recently married you had a kid you've
got another one under negotiations and
you've you now are in a position where
you can buy that pickup truck you've
always wanted go find out if in fact
they make a ford ranger which will seat
you know the wife the kids the dog and
and will be comfortable to go find that
out so we ask people do that both on
Edmonds and on the forward side when
they did on Edmonds the adventure they
had was that they would go the admin
site they click on new trucks they would
then choose Ford they would then pick
the particular Ranger that we were
talking about they would then quickly
find the safety specifications and
safety features and then at the bottom
they would find here that maximum
seating was three and that in fact the
what they found was that you couldn't
fit everybody into the truck but even
though that was the case what we were
measuring was people's feelings about
the ford brand and we found that their
strength of the ford brand actually
increased while using edmond so so the
act of using Edmonds to find this
information people felt better about the
ford brand at the end of going through
this process when we tried the
experiment on the Ford site we saw
something interesting to do the same
exercise on the Ford site you had to
click on showrooms and then click on
this black on blu link that says Ford
and then you had to click on the Ford
logo and then you got these for more
pictures and this thing here that says
people in their stories and welcome to
ford vehicles calm
where everybody has a story and every
story has a Ford car or truck right in
the middle of it and now you needed to
know to click on vehicles and then you
got four more pictures including this
woman here it looks absolutely
frightened about the Model T that's
chasing her another Ford logo and now
you had to click on trucks where you got
four more pictures two more logos and
now you had to click on Ranger where you
then we're told whatever now to be fair
this was an advertising campaign that
was being run by j walter Thompson
Ford's advertising firm of record called
the whatever whenever wherever campaign
and this was the first of a very large
animated gifs that was being downloaded
and it would say whatever wherever
whenever and it would take several
seconds where the screen would just sort
of shout whatever are you and it was
basically the idea was you could use the
truck whenever or whatever you wanted to
do it was part of a combination online
marketing and television and radio
campaign but now you were required to
click on a link is probably one of the
best links i've ever seen it says go
anywhere which would bring you to this
page which had one two three four five
six seven mentions a ford including this
one down here that this this disclaimer
here says excluding non forded branded
to deliver to derivatives how many
people here drive a non floored branded
derivative anybody no but our user still
really didn't quite know what to click
on at this point they they knew that it
had at least one seat in it you could
see that clearly
uh but they were at this point I didn't
know what to do there's this link here
that says comfort that if you knew to
click on that you would then you might
click there but it turns out that
brochures was the link that you wanted
you had to click on I'm sorry not
brochures brochures would actually have
you fill out a form and they would mail
you a brochure that's exactly what the
web is for right in this case features
I'm sorry features is what you clicked
on when you clicked on features you got
this page and now there's a link here
that says interior that's looking good
and then you get to interior and there's
one that says seating that's looking
good and then you get this chart that
tells you everything you want to know
about the seats and a ford ranger except
how many there are there's no
information about that so here we are
eleven klicks into the site and we still
don't have the information nor is there
any path to get to the information from
this point and so at this point people's
perception of the ford brand was much
worse even though they ran into all the
brand elements multiple times they are
perception of the experience it was the
experience that the trumped so it turns
out that that in this particular
exercise that was what we first got the
hint that experience plays a much bigger
role than any sort of brand elements
that happen now Netflix as i mentioned
uses experience to tremendously and they
create all sorts of features which allow
you this in this particular case these
are social networking features that they
have where you can specify people who
you like to talk about movies with and
if there are Netflix subscribers you can
see what's in there Q they can see
what's in your queue you can share what
movies you've recently talked about you
can make recommendations just to them
once you do this the stars change the
different colors to represent whether
your friends liked it or just the
general public liked it so you get to
see what's happening on the longtail
craigslist which one would not consider
to be an exceptionally highly visually
designed site has extremely high brand
engagement amongst its users as does my
space for reasons that no one can
explain it you know so these are
experiences where
where the brand elements themselves are
not part of it it's it's definitively
the experience part of the activity
that's going on so what we've learned is
that good experiences are all about our
what create brands both offline and
online and it's what really sort of
manages brands and we can see this in
the way that we measure brands we can
see this through we've over the last few
years we've developed an instrument that
allows us to measure the strength of any
brand we want to measure before and
after and even during a user session so
we can actually tell how people are
interacting with a given brand and so
for example in a study we did where we
had people shop for electronics we would
give them we would find people who
needed electronics we'd bring them sites
that have the products that they needed
we would give them the cash to purchase
those products we then measured their
their experiences on the site and so we
looked at what turned out to be 11
different sites amazon Circuit City del
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble best buy Crutchfield
hewlett-packard ebgames target walmart
CDW and J&amp;amp;R electronics and the red
boxes represent experiences where the
brand strength went down from what they
said they felt about the brand before
the session two after the whereas the
greenboxes went up and as you can see
Amazon which started very high dropped
in actually using the site because most
users found that particular session very
frustrating they because shopping for
electronics on Amazon is is is typically
a frustrating experience so it dropped
not as much as Dell which dropped
tremendously or hewlett-packard which
dropped tremendously target was the same
way interestingly enough Walmart went up
but that was primarily because the
starting score was so low people had
such low expectations about the Walmart
brand that they were actually impressed
by the fact that it worked Crutchfield
went up also as did Barnes &amp;amp; Noble where
people are buying CDs and video games
and J&amp;amp;R electronics stayed basically the
same when we but that was before and
after the shopping session we then
contacted them two weeks later to see
how their order was fulfilled and what
we saw between the time that they
finished the study and they actually got
their stuff we see that amazon dropped
even more circuit city dropped a huge
amount you be games dropped a huge
amount target dropped a huge amount
Walmart did not do so well on
fulfillment Crutchfield went up yet
again people really liked Crutchfield it
was a brand they were not familiar with
and they liked it CDW basically regained
its thing and again jnr source stood
still so what we can look at what
happens and we can see that in the
online space it's not just what happens
in the session that affects the brand
it's also what happens before and after
the session in terms all the touch
points that people are having so it's
true customer experience that we're
talking about all the different touch
points that are going on here now this
brings me to advertising this is the
million-dollar home page where if you
were unfamiliar with this particular
campaign student in England decided he
was going to sell ads at a buck a pixel
and you could buy a 10 by 10 space for a
hundred dollars and he sold a million
dollars worth of pixels to people and so
you can go this at million-dollar home
page calm and the only purpose of this
site is to go and look at all the ads
that I guess click on them now a hundred
dollars isn't a lot of money for an ad
though I know you can get adsense ads
for less the but it's interesting that
what people found was that the first few
advertisers who came to the site
actually got a huge amount of click
through traffic from it but as people
started buying all the ads now this
thing got covered on CNN and The Wall
Street Journal and The New York Times so
it was getting a tremendous amount of
press people were going to the site they
were clicking on the on the eyes to see
what's going on but that's time
went on and the ads i started to
populate we saw was that people stopped
quickly and the people who purchased ads
later and later in the cycle found that
they got virtually no traffic whatsoever
no matter what the size of their ad was
but the guy did get his million dollars
and subsequently decided not to use it
first tuition so when we look at what
advertising is versus branding they are
very separate activities and so avidly a
lot of people perceive that what's
happening when you're advertising is
you're working on brand and people talk
about that as a branding improvement
strategy but it turns out that that's
not necessarily the case and so we see
things for instance it on some days if
you go to salon.com you before you can
read their online newspaper you have to
watch an ad in order to get admission to
the site just to see the homepage and
figure out what the ads are sometimes
you have to actually watch a one or two
minute add before they will let you do
that now the question is how many people
are paying attention to that ad at that
moment before they click over to the
homepage or how many people are just
sort of waiting for that button to pop
up that says show me the homepage and
they can finally click through to that
so there's this real question is to
really how effective that ad is and ads
show up in all sorts of different places
this is polycom's homepage the polycom
makes video conferencing equipment and
audio conferencing equipment and and
because they're trying to get people to
be aware of all the things they offer
their homepages be basically become a
large advertising center and people are
constantly fighting to get advertising
space within the organization that they
have in fighting to get advertising
space on that homepage and they're
constantly trying to drive people to
that content but how many people who are
coming to the polycom site at that
moment care about all those things in
fact the odds that they'd be interested
in anything other than the thing that
drove them to us I because no one just
going to randomly show up at polycom
calm you know it's not a site where you
say hey we got you
20 minutes till the apprentices on let's
go check out polycom calm that doesn't
happen so you know they're coming for a
reason they're coming because of a
product that they want to buy or
technical support that they need or some
particular thing 99% of this stuff is of
no value to them but more importantly
the issue then becomes how do you decide
what what works and what doesn't what's
important this is plenty of fish.com and
plenty of fish com is a dating site
which does not charge any of the people
who are dating unlike many other dating
sites it does not charge anybody for the
service the money is made and they claim
to make ten thousand dollars a day
purely through Adsense so people are
coming to this site to find a mate and
for some reason they're clicking on ads
which you know produces revenue to the
site many of the ads being other dating
sites and so the thing about advertising
is in essence what it's about is
distracting the user for what they're
coming to do it's it's trying to take
them away from what they're trying to do
and this is not just true of online
advertising this is true of all types of
advertising right you're trying to watch
a television show and they interrupt
that show to give you things that you
weren't interested in seeing except
during the Super Bowl and same with
radio and you know nobody likes the ads
at the beginning of movies that that you
know go to the movie theater and see
four minutes of advertising there nobody
seems to like that it's just you know
they do it because they want to disrupt
you from what you are doing they
couldn't put those ads for example at
the end of the movie right it wouldn't
work they can only do it at a point
where you will just not get up and leave
and so it's advertising is is basically
about disruption sometimes the
advertising get successively disruption
we had a user who ran into a small
problem they were running Firefox
looking at the New York Times site this
ad popped up and for whatever reason
would not go away they could not get the
ad to move
move it was one of these floating ads
that appears you've all seen them and it
would not vanish the close button would
not show up no clicks would make it go
away so the user was unable to watch or
to read the article and so did this
experience helped Accenture or the New
York Times for that user not at all and
you see other types of things here is a
the Z Frank show which is a very amusing
sight that that pretends to give news
and here he's talking about Tony Blair
and because he mentions Tony Blair
Google Ads decides to advertise Blair
com which actually is not Tony Blair
site it's a clothing site and so the
issue here is there's an association
that's happening between Tony Blair and
this clothing site which it's not clear
that the clothing site is that anxious
to have the association be made and this
sort of thing happens you know fairly
frequently with contextual ads here we
have an article from the International
Herald Tribune which talks about ipod
there Apple sousou's competitors and
because it mentions the creative zen the
ads for those items are there so again
i'm not sure that the advertisers are
that are the brand owners in this case
creative or that excited that these ads
are appearing in those contacts so you
get you get these types of conditioning
things that are happening and we don't
know what is happening from the users
perspective in terms of of the negative
branding that might be occurring when
someone sees reinforced advertising
elements in a negative article so what
we've been learning about branding at
this point is this idea that that
basically we've got these two different
goals you're trying to both build up
affinity branding and dispositional
branding and that as you build those
things up you're doing it through
indirect messaging and through
experience we found that experience is
much better tool both on the web
off the web as a method for doing it and
that branding is very separate from
advertising and that we have to consider
them as very different and understand
how they interact and that's what I came
to talk to you about it and to share
with you how my machine works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
