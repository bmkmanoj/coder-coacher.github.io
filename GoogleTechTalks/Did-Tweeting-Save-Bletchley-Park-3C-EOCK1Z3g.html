Google and I have the honor of
introducing dr. sue black who is joining
us to talk today about Bletchley but
just quickly she's a on the faculty and
a senior researcher at the University
College London she's also a member of
the british computer society as a
council member but also was the person
who set up in 2001 pcs women which has
been a fabulous organization to help
women come into computer science also I
know you're a strategy member of ACM
women and I know the ACM the associated
computing machine is meeting this week
for the annual conference and the
neutering awards and things and sort of
ties into Bletchley given that on
turning with their I know that the UK
Foreign Secretary has a group on freedom
of expression that you participate in so
thank you for that and also recently sue
founded go to foundation that which
there's a wonderful in the invite for
the Tech Talk there's a wonderful story
and the BBC video of these seven year
olds using raspberry pie and scratch and
beginning to program and really sort of
getting what this is all about and the
go to foundation is really to bring in
maybe at the end you can say some about
that after the Bletchley which would be
great to bring young people are all
people into CS and I know that you had
originally studied other things and then
later came to computer science so I know
that that's near and dear to your heart
of like getting more people into tech
and in a CS world the last thing I'd add
is ID pro magazine recently selected dr.
black for a tech hero award and they
said of the UK leadership we look to Sir
Tim dr. black and the other tech leaders
for inspiration so thank you so much for
your amazing work to make people
conscious of lechery and you know it was
really falling into disrepair and sue
visited and became instrumental in in
kind of getting the momentum going to
what's happened now and I remember just
the last thing as part of her enthusiasm
I was at the Silicon Valley comes to the
UK events
which we do every fall where 40-odd
Silicon Valley folks of all different
types show up and you can we do probably
about 50 events with the UK techies and
others from Parliament game bridge
Oxford London with startups and and
everybody students and we were lucky too
I was looking to meet dr. black ed Nesta
which is their industry organization and
you came up and said I need your help
the Turing papers are going up for
Christy auction and we need to keep them
and get them for Bletchley Park so that
we can all share in them and so we
Google were lucky to participate in that
because of Sue telling us about it and
her leadership and the papers are now at
Bletchley Park and they're amazing and
you should go see them so dr. black
thank you very much Megan wow what an
intro so I'm a computer science academic
as Megan was saying I've taught computer
science for probably nearly 20 years now
and my first degree is computer science
and I've got a PhD in software
engineering outside of my kind of like
my regular job so so that was that's my
work but I'm also a very passionate
campaigner and when I see an issue
somewhere I like to try and do something
about it so kind of running along with
my CS academic career I've also been
campaigning on issues around computer
science and so first of all that was the
kind of in the women in tech space
setting up BCS women and then later on
it's been mainly focused on helping
Bletchley Park so if you recognize these
pictures here's the mansion house at
Bletchley Park and also a photo of hot
six at Bletchley Park so who has been to
Bletchley Park cool it's about half the
audience I'm happy to that's a very good
result and who is on Twitter's I'm going
to be talking about Twitter quite a bit
as well anybody oh maybe this is the
wrong place to ask
here's on google+ hey everybody that's
cool um so Bletchley Park the site used
to be about 52 acres which was very
large it's now about 26 acres which is
still large there's the mansion house
there that you can see there are lots of
hearts that we use by the code breakers
and buildings that have been renovated
and some as you can see here with hat
six that hasn't as yet being renovated
so as the people that have been there
now Bletchley Park is quite close to
London is actually in between oxford and
cambridge and it's on a direct train
line from London so it's a great place
to visit if you're in London and only 36
minutes away so a quick brief history of
Bletchley Park so I was with Sir John in
the Computer History Museum the other
night for a dinner and he was making the
case that it's argue arguably one of the
the most important sites of the 20th
century because it brings together the
whole world war two story about people
coming together and making an impact and
making the world a better place but it's
also the birthplace of one of the first
computers the first programmable
electronic computer Colossus which was
invented by Tommy flowers and taken up
to Bletchley Park as part of the code
breaking effort so you can see here an
Enigma machine and when they were trying
to crack enigma the chance is it was
clear was calculated the chances of
cracking enigma where you can see the
number on the screen there 158 million
million million to one so it was a tough
job you know it wasn't something that
was easy or straightforward and one of
the things that I think is kind of
mitigated against Bletchley Park being
well-known is the fact that Churchill
ordered at the end of the war that all
the machines be cut up and buried and
also everyone
sworn to secrecy and wasn't allowed to
talk about it for at least 30 years
afterwards so I think that's one of the
reasons that that it hasn't been so well
known that we haven't been talking about
it I mean we are we have been recently
but for a long time no one talked about
it at all so my my first trip up to
Bletchley Park I was computer science
academic I'd set up this group called
BCS women which was to support and
connect women working in technology and
as chair of the group i was invited up
to Bletchley Park so when I went up
there the first time I knew that I knew
the name Bletchley Park I knew the kind
of home of the codebreakers kind of
thing but I didn't really know anything
much else about it so I went up for a
meeting and at the end of the meeting I
thought right now's my chance to go and
have a good look around and see what's
here so I started walking around and
wandered into one of the huts and in
there i saw this team of guys at the end
of the heart fiddling around with some
very complicated but very
interesting-looking machinery so i went
over to talk to them and asked what they
were doing and it was a guy called John
Harper who was leading a team of people
rebuilding the bomb machine because of
course all these machines had been
destroyed and so more recently great
teams of enthusiasts of taken years I
think it took 12 years to rebuild the
bomb machine so they've rebuilt these
machines so I had a chat with him and
said what are you doing so he told me
all about the bomb and then he said to
me what are you doing here so i said i'm
representing this group for women in
tech so he said well did you know that
more than half the people that worked he
will women so I was like no I had I had
no idea about that at all I just kind of
had in my head it would be kind of lots
of guys in their 50s with tweed jackets
kind of sitting around smoking pipes and
doing the Times crossword that was kind
of kind of sort of you know the image I
had in my head of the people that work
there so to find out that more than half
the more women
surprise for me so I said how many
people worked here so he said more than
10,000 so I was like I really couldn't
believe that because again in my head it
was like enough people to fit in a
reasonably small room I had no clue that
it was more than 10,000 people so again
I was really surprised and so that day I
kind of went away thinking I've you know
I'm a woman in tech I'm trying to
connect and promote women in tech here's
a great story 5,000 women working on
this site nobody knows about it well
obviously some people but is not in the
general consciousness so I went away
thinking I've got to do something about
it and what I did was tried to raise
some money for an oral history project
to record the memories of the women that
worked there so here's some of the the
women that we talked to you on the
bottom right there's Ruth born and Jean
Valentine who both worked there as
teenagers and talking to Ruth it's just
um it's amazing to think what they did
and at what age they did it so Ruth said
that when she was in sixth form at
school so that's like maybe between age
16 to 18 she left sixth form and decided
to sign up for the Navy so she went
along to the navy office and signed up
and then shortly after that she was
taken up to Scotland for two weeks
training so you know a 17 year old going
away from home two weeks training and
then the the group of girls that they
were really were asked whether they
wanted to UM work for sdx so they asked
what is s DX and they were told it's
special duties X and they weren't told
any more than that all they were told
was that um they would there wouldn't be
any promotion it would be low pay long
hours and once they were in they
couldn't get out and they were sworn to
secrecy so can you just imagine being a
17 year old girl and being told that I
mean for me I'd be yes yeah please can I
do it
just sounds um very mysterious and
attractive and so so they signed up for
it and they they they signed their names
and pledged our secrecy and went along
and she said on the first day that she
and so that turned out to be going to
Bletchley Park but they didn't know till
they got there when she went for her
first day of training at Bletchley Park
you know they still didn't quite know
what was going along and going on and
she went along to the heart that they
were going to be trained in and she said
they were armed guards on the door so
then she realized it was very serious
what they were doing but you know just
imagine being a 17 year old girl in that
kind of situation with lots of other
girls and going along and being armed
guards in the on the door and then going
into this what she said was a very dingy
hot with lots and lots of machines and
they were working with the bomb machines
that's what they were being trained on
so long hours in dingy hearts with lots
of noise and she said it just smelt of
oil all the time so you know that's just
one snippet of one person's story
there's just so many amazing stories of
the women of Bletchley Park so some
great stories of women at Bletchley Park
this is an article about the launch of
the window station next project which is
the project that I was talking about the
oil history project so I gave my little
talk the stuff that I've just told you
about getting involved and the women and
what we were doing and that Simon
greenish in the picture with me up there
who's who's the who was the CEO of
Bletchley Park at the time so I gave my
talk and then he came up to give his
talk and said that um he at Bletchley
Park was teaching on a financial
knife-edge and that they weren't sure if
there was an epidemic at the time there
was a lot of talk of swine flu epidemics
and he said if there was something like
a swine flu epidemic he was right that
the number of visitors would drop and
the main money coming in to Bletchley
Park was from people visiting and so the
number of people dropped then their
income was dropped and he was really
worried that bloody park would have to
close so so I kind of thought to myself
you know I had the we were sitting there
and it was just going round and round in
my head well that's not right you know
that that can't happen so a few weeks
later I was invited up to a reception at
Bletchley Park and that was the first
time that I did a proper tour so before
I just gone into one heart on my own and
talked to a few people so this time
there was a proper organized tour and I
went round the whole place and then I
just had this moment on the tour where
it's always been given by a veteran so
someone who worked there we were
standing in a group outside this Hut so
here's a picture of it here on the top
left heart sick so we're just standing
there looking at his heart and he was
telling us about all the major
achievements that happened in that heart
you know from things that happened in
that heart the code breaking but that
occurred there and and the ramifications
of that in terms of the Battle of the
Atlantic and all the amazing stuff that
was achieved because of the code
breaking that happened at Bletchley Park
and I just had this kind of moment of
epiphany when I just thought this place
can't close I've got to try and do
something about it so at the time I was
a head of a CS department at the
University of Westminster and so I was
on an email list for the cs heads and
profs in the country in the UK so I
emailed everybody and ask them to sign a
petition which was on the 10 Downing
Street website asking to save Bletchley
Park and after sending that email around
i checked the petition a few hours later
and found that loads of really to me
very famous CS profs from the UK had
signed the petition so I thought ok it's
not just me other people feel the same
way so so that was great so I talked to
my colleague John Harper who's in the
top photo there with me on our trips
to park I talked to him and said what
else can we do we need to kind of get
more recognition for this and he said
why don't we write a letter to the time
so I thought yeah it's a great idea so
John wrote a letter we sent it around
the heads and profs and within a few
days almost a hundred of them had signed
it and I then thought I need to get more
publicity for this so I contacted all
the journalists that I knew so I set up
a blog too so this is my blog I
contacted all the journalists that I
knew saying I think I've got a story we
need to save literally park and and the
upshot of that was that Rory kefflin
Jones who's the BBC technology
correspondent got in touch and asked me
to go up to Bletchley Park with him and
filmed me up there saying it was a
disgrace and we needed to do something
about it so that's four years ago that's
july two thousand eight and so that went
out on the BBC News and around the world
in fact which was a bit of a shock for
me because I've got people friends in
the US and canada and australia saying
we just saw you on TV why you why you on
TV so that was quite funny cuz that no
clue that that would happen so that
message went around I got lots of emails
coming in and so there was a massive
spike of interest which was wonderful
but and that was great but the thing is
with with news is it has to be new right
so how if you're trying to raise
awareness of something how do you how do
you keep it up in people's consciousness
all the time rather than you know big
spikes and nothing in between so after
that I was kind of looking around for
ways to try and do that to try and keep
it in the in the public consciousness
and so around Christmas that year I
started playing around with Twitter and
and so gradually started to realize that
actually maybe that was a way to try and
find people that would be interested in
Bletchley Park
and kind of start creating a community
of interest around it so I started using
Twitter and oops sorry I started using
Twitter and within a few weeks various
people got in touch with me saying that
they wanted to help so this guy on the
left here is Captain Gerry Roberts who's
one of the code breakers at Bletchley
Park he's one of the most amazing people
I've ever met he got into he's one of
the people that got in touch with me
after the BBC news article and and since
then I've become friends with him and
his family and he's just one of those
really incredible people that you one of
the few people that you meet in your
life he was just really amazing so I
think he's now he's over 90 now and
still going strong and his mental
faculties are just incredible completely
put me to shame so the people that
contacted me through Twitter are these
guys at the top here he was sighs one
documentary on Twitter and jamila at the
bottom so they I was so they were
interested in Bletchley Park I wanted to
help him to find out more so Jerry
captain Gerry Roberts was giving a talk
at UCL in the January so we all went
along to that and you know that that
really kind of inspired everybody and
got them even more interested in going
to Bletchley Park so I think the day
after that we all went up to Bletchley
Park and while we were there well it was
kind of like my first experience of
taking other people up there so I'd gone
up there and had just kind of just got
very excited about the whole place and
how wonderful it was but this was the
first time I taken other people up there
too and they felt exactly the same way
so so that was kind of a moment that
helped me to realize that if you get
people to visit their kind of bought in
because they see the place they see why
it's important and that they kind of get
bitten by the Bletchley Park bug so we
went up there and they set up Bletchley
Park on Twitter
and talk to him about social media and
took loads of photos and then just
started spreading the word out to their
communities so after that visit you know
that kind of started a kind of chain
reaction of building a community but I
was again I was always looking around
for ways to try and bring more people in
and so one evening there was a Stephen
frat dudes everyone know who stephen
Fry's yes good okay and so Stephen Fry
posted a photo of him stuck in a lift in
London and tweeted we can't get out can
I go and help ok so they depress the
alarm and they were still stuck so I saw
that photo of him and I thought oh
stephen fry he might be interested in
Bletchley Park so I googled Stephen Fry
Bletchley Park to see if he was and
found some quotes from him saying stuff
like if Bletchley Park were to close it
would be like Nelson's column falling
down so I thought ok so he feels the
same way as well so I sent him several
direct messages on Twitter because
luckily he was following me saying
please help Bletchley Park you know if
you were to get involved that would make
a massive difference and that was kind
of late one night and I kind of went to
bed and thought oh well you know he
probably he's got at the time he had two
hundred and twenty thousand followers so
I thought what he's you must get
messages from people all the time asking
me to do stuff we probably won't see it
but I gave it a go went to bed and then
I was sitting at work the next morning
and got an email which was saying that
he'd posted say you know we need to save
Bletchley Park and appointing people at
my blog so I'd set up my blog and it was
getting about 50 hits a day which I
thought was okay and then Stephen Fry
tweeted it and it got eight thousand
that day so it kind of shows you the the
difference if you get the right people
involved I guess so you can see on the
screen this is my
gosh I can't see it I can't see I think
it's my you see the line going up I
think I was like the most retweeted
person on Twitter or something that day
or the most mentioned person on Twitter
that day and course that that will never
happen again but we're talking about
three and a half years ago but it was
amazing because you know it that kind of
taught me the lesson that if you find
someone that is interested and is very
influential it can make a massive
difference to what you're doing so
remember you know like my background
he's not in campaigning really it's all
in like teaching computer science so I
was kind of learning this stuff as I was
going along and so when Bletchley Park
saw that Stephen Fry had tweeted they
phoned me up and said invite him up for
lunch invite him up for lunch we had all
these kind of frantic conversations and
messages going between us with me
inviting and stephen fry up for lunch so
a few months later when he was back from
filming in New Zealand Stephen Fry came
up to Bletchley Park for the day and we
just had the most amazing day and one of
the great things that happened that day
was that there was one of the women that
had worked at Bletchley part when she
was a teenager had come back for the
first time since then to visit Bletchley
Park and we just I think happened to
overhear that and so there was just this
amazing conversation between Stephen Fry
who's really tall and this lady who was
really small I don't know it was just
wonderful that kind of him asking her
all about what she'd done there and you
know she was just it was just wonderful
I can't even explain it but it was a
great moment so here's some of the code
breakers and people that worked at
Bletchley Park now so one of the things
that has been great for me to be part of
his going to the annual reunion so I
went for dinner with some of the people
that work to Bletchley Park a couple of
years ago because they have a in
September every year there's an annual
union and I was sat at a table with what
looked like well what were lots of old
ladies no women in their 80s but they'd
worked at Bletchley Park so I was kind
of desperate to talk to them about what
their time there was
like and we talked about the work stuff
and that was interesting but then I said
so what did you do outside of work you
know if you've got any good stories
about stuff that happened and so one of
them said do you remember the time when
we Nick to the vicar's bicycle to go to
a dance and I thought yeah this is more
like the kind of story that I'm
interested in because it kind of gives
you a rounded picture of of what their
life was like that you know it was hard
and and they were working under extreme
conditions and they weren't allowed to
talk about anything but you know they
were teenage girls and they'd still had
fun and then another one said that um
they were billeted out some of the girls
who built it out at Woburn Abbey nearby
so it was a big group of fun of girls
and they in the summer they used to
sunbathe topless on the roof of Woburn
Abbey and apparently the local RAF
pilots got into lots of trouble because
they would be flying over and they'd
swoop down low to try and get a look at
the girls sunbathing on the roof and I
did I think to start with they did they
couldn't understand why all the planes
with scooter swooping lova lova now
because it didn't make sense and then
they found out that that was why so I
thought that was quite a nice story as
well because they were still teenagers
and you know the guys flying the planes
were you know they were all very young I
think a lot of them so and one of the
things I really wanted to do was
obviously to raise awareness but there's
various ways to do that I come from an
academic background and I'd been to a
conference called museums in the web
presenting about women and the web a
couple of years earlier and so it dawned
on me that may be a good thing to do
would be to try and connects Bletchley
Park into the sort of museums in the web
community because there's lots of
museums and an online presence so with
kelsey griffin who's director of
operations at Bletchley Park and
Professor Jonathan Bowen we wrote a
paper called can twitter so Bletchley
Park so this is two years ago now and
we wrote the paper about how we've been
using social media and the history of
Bletchley Park and all that kind of
stuff and we sent our art paper in and
then found out a few months later that
it had been accepted so when it was
accepted I then realized we hadn't the
the conference was in Denver we had no
money to go to the conference and I'd
now set up a situation where Bletchley
Park were potentially going to have to
pay several thousand pounds to go to a
conference I thought okay no that's
that's not good i'm not happy with that
what can I do so I was kind of wondering
what to do wondering aloud on Twitter as
I tend to do and various people who've
been very supportive in the campaign
said well why don't you set up a just
giving page was that crowdfunding page
and I just ask people for money for you
to go and and give the paper so I was
persuaded that that was a good idea so I
set one up and within I think two weeks
we raised all the money so that was a
massive surprise a very very pleasant
surprise to me in that it just showed
that the community really cared about
Bletchley Park and really wanted
Bletchley Park to be able to go and tell
their story to the community so that was
another one of those moments where we
just got this amazing feedback from
people which showed that they were
really on board with wanting Bletchley
Park to be the place that it should be
so here's some of the people that gave
the money these are their Twitter
avatars and I always like to say a
special thank you to mr. grass head at
the top in the middle because he was the
biggest single donor and I know who he
is but you don't so that kind of brings
me on to the cheering papers so like
Megan was saying at the beginning
I you know I was always looking around
for opportunities an amazing guy called
Gareth half acree had set up just giving
fund to raise money from the public to
buy the cheering papers for Bletchley
Park so the Turing papers had come up
for auction and they were priced at
between 300 and 500 thousand pounds so
they were up for auction at christie's
in November not last year but the year
before and Gareth had done an amazing
job he's managed in a few days to get
20,000 pound from the public which is
just incredible I've kind of been
keeping an eye on what he was doing and
thinking whether i could help in any way
and if i could how that would be then i
went to a talk at Nesta and heard Megan
speaking and so she was from google and
thought oh maybe i should just go and
chat to megan and see if google are
interested in helping Bletchley part 2
by the chewing papers so I talked to
Megan she said she was interested and
that i should send an email and so I
went home and sent an email and and then
I think the next that night or the next
night Simon Meacham contacted me via
Twitter and said I'm from google and I
want to help Bletchley Park so I said
all I've just been talking to someone
from google today and Simon said we'll
send me send me the same email so I did
that and the next few days were
absolutely amazing because I don't know
what happened exactly but I do know that
Simon and Megan managed to get a hundred
thousand dollars in a very short amount
of time to help Bletchley Park purchase
the during papers so I probably never
know too much about that but I had lots
of excited phone calls from Simon over
the weekend with with various some
stages that had been reached and well
that that was a very exciting weekend
anyways so so the next week the cheering
papers r up for auction I think on the
Tuesday so I don't you spoken to Megan I
think on the Thursday before so it all
happened very very quickly
and so I went down to the auction and I
don't know if you've ever been to an
auction at a big auction house but it's
a very kind of exciting place it's very
buzzy all this money changing hands and
I don't if you can see anyone you
recognize up there apart from Island
cheering but I'm Steve Wozniak was there
as well because they were selling an
apple so I walked in and there was kind
of loads of press around the back and
then Steve was next sat at the back and
I don't know it was very um it was like
an electric atmosphere so I SAT there
for a while and there were all these
Lots being sold and then after about
half an hour the Turing papers came up
as the current lot and so I knew that
Bletchley Park had put in a bid of about
100,000 pounds because of the 20,000
pound from gas just giving and 100,000
pounds from google and I knew that the
guide price was 300 to 500 thousand so I
didn't quite know what was going to
happen but I knew Bletchley Park had
beard a hundred thousand or there abouts
so the luck comes up and that the
auctioneer said and we start the bidding
at one hundred and sixty five thousand
pounds so I thought oh no little epochs
and he bid a hundred thousand so we're
kind of out of the water already and
then things people were bidding and in
about 10 or 15 seconds it was all over
and I didn't really know what had
happened and it turned out that the
papers have not met the guide price so
that was it and they just went on to to
the next lot and I didn't quite
appreciate what that meant but I did
know that I was supposed to be going to
meet Simon Meacham for a cup of tea in
know at Google in Victoria so I just
started walking down there to meet Simon
and yes we met up for the first time in
person and that was calling them Megan
was there as well so so that was great
and we had a chat about everything that
had happened and what happened was
they've not met the guide price and
basically various people working
together especially Simon greenish the
previous CEO of Bletchley Park managed
to get the money the rest of the money
from other places and
a few months later the cheering papers
went to Bletchley Park so that was
wonderful it was great to see them there
and you can go and see them there now
there there's a whole cheering
exhibition of which the chewing papers
play a fundamental role and so that was
great that was great something that took
quite a long time to make happen but
lots of different people working
together in different ways made it
happen and that was wonderful so one of
the the funny stroke cool things that's
happened to me is that you know various
people have kind of got in touch who are
interested I have kind of seen my women
in tech campaigning and Bletchley Park
campaigning and I've got in touch
wanting to talk to me and one of those
is robert Llewellyn who has this program
called carpool and it's really funny
because I didn't actually know what
carpool was till I came to to Silicon
Valley last week so I've known about
I've learned this program was called
carpool had a vague idea of what it was
but I didn't really know what it was
till I drove in the carpool lane last
week so you know you learn something
every day so he has this program where
he takes someone in his car from A to B
and so you have to decide where you want
to go to and from so we had this long
email discussion about where we should
go because I had to choose a place and
then eventually it dawned on me could he
take me to Bletchley Park I don't know
why I hadn't thought that straight or I
don't know why he hadn't thought of that
straight away so we had this amazing day
where he drove me up to Bletchley Park
Simon greenish gave us a whistle-stop
tour including a quick sausage and mash
in heart for and and then back down to
London but it was it was kind of so it's
another person in the UK anyway who's
well-known who's kind of techie who is
showing their support for Bletchley Park
which is wonderful so some other people
that you might have heard of I've been
up to Bletchley Park recently so Queen
Elizabeth and Duke of Edinburgh
came up there in July 2011 so I don't
know if I can say I've met the Queen
because I was about 6 meters away from
her but the greatest thing for me about
that day was this which was that captain
Gerry Roberts one of the significant
code breakers and who he has done lots
of campaigning as well to try and raise
awareness of everything that happened
there so Jerry got to meet the Queen and
have a chat with her and tell her about
what he did and for me that was just
absolutely wonderful that he get that
recognition so last summer so so since
since Megan and Simon kind of kick
started the whole google involvement
with Bletchley Park they really worked
hard to to work together with Bletchley
Park to make things happen and one of
the things that that Google have made
happen was a summer garden party at
Bletchley Park last year which was
absolutely wonderful because it was kind
of a really nice way to sort of
celebrate the tech community and
Bletchley Park and just all the kinds of
it's very hard to put into words but but
just just that the things that that
blessed part was going places and that
Google were involved helping out and
that it was a cool place to be and major
stuff happened there and we were all
kind of celebrating that so that was
wonderful and here's a photo of me and
Simon Meacham and Alan cheering at the
bottom but that was really nice because
that was the first time from Simon
getting involved at the beginning and
helping with the purchase of the
cheering papers to them actually being
at Bletchley Park and then us actually
being there together at the same time
and seeing the chewing papers so so that
was a great moment for me it was it was
just lovely it kind of like um that was
like the end of that bit of the story or
something because it worked
since then I've also um so Silicon
Valley comes to the UK that mega
mentioned earlier is a great initiative
from Silicon Valley taking entrepreneurs
over to the UK and that's how I met
Meghan in the first place so as Megan
was saying when that happened last
November Megan got in touch and said
we're going up to Bletchley Park Norwich
once comes was like yes yes so here are
some pictures of Megan and Simon
greenish a previous co along with julie
hannah and reid hoffman and DJ booth
Hill who've been absolutely wonderful
along with Megan in in making things
happen over here and the dinner that I
was talking about earlier this week
we're so John scholar at the computer
history museum though they've worked
amazingly to get some key people
together to get them interested in
Bletchley Park so that's been kind of
part of the continuing story and very
grateful for that so here's the John
Scarlett speaking at the computer
history museum this week he gave a great
talk I think which really brought home
the significance and importance of
Bletchley Park so John was a head of mi6
in the UK and is now chair of trustees
at Bletchley Park and I think it's great
that we're connecting with the community
over here in Silicon Valley and with the
Computer History Museum and I think this
is a start of of a great relationship so
back to Bletchley Park this is a
photograph that I took a few weeks ago
inside block D and that's an amazing
places it's a massive massive block and
there are things in there like there's a
magistrate's court inside the block from
the I think 1980s which is not used
anymore and you just kind of wander
through the corridors and it's very very
evocative you know it kind of smells a
bit
and you can just almost hear the
footsteps of people walking along there
many years ago and so Simon greenish the
previous CEO is now retired and Ian
standin is the new CEO at Bletchley Park
and he's got a great sense of of mission
and the importance of Bletchley Park and
he's going to see it into a very
successful I'm sure future so he's
looking for Bletchley Park to be a
world-class museum and heritage site and
kind of to show the world how important
it was and kind of bring it back to its
former glory so the previous slide was
one of the blocks as it is now but
Bletchley Park have great plans now for
the future and these renovations are
starting now going to continue over the
next few years so that's in five to ten
years time it will be an absolutely
amazing international heritage site and
museum and but i would say because i'm
looking forward to those days but at the
same time I kind of like it how it is
now because it's very eccentric and
looks a bit ramshackle and I think what
they're going to do is going to make it
much better overall but I'd encourage
people to visit now so that you can see
the difference between how it is now on
how it will be it's a great place now
it's going to be an even better place in
the future so as as to what you can do
so we've been talking about Bletchley
Park today do check out their website
which is Bletchley Park talked at UK if
you go over to London it's only 36
minutes on the train from central London
then it's over the road think about
maybe if you're interested how you could
help bring attention or funds to
Bletchley Park if you are on Twitter I
do follow us on Twitter and let's all
together to build a bloody part for the
future that recognizes the absolute
international importance of the site
thank you any questions I'll put the
artifacts for Archer oh don't know from
someone in Canada that's all I know I
know the I now know the the guy that
handled them Julian Wilson that
Christie's so I keep asking him but he
won't tell me he's not allowed to tell
me
what if you could talk a little more
about the future plans for the site is
the vision some kind of you know
Computer History Museum type facility
there and you know how would the funding
model for that work over the long term
into one thing we should mention is the
the teams that came to visit this week
went to computer history museum here
which was terrific and they have the
amazing revolution exhibit that's the
2,000 years and what was so compelling
during Sir John's tour was to see the
Manchester baby which although the
machines from Bletchley were destroyed
because of Churchill they wanted to save
the intellectual property from getting
other places even the work have been won
the team's spun out and so many of the
leadership then went on to make
Manchester baby and then many other
projects came from there so that's kind
of interesting last year I also didn't
mention that there were 300 US military
based at Bletchley Park as well so that
it's one of the key points in my talk
that I forgot to mention being here but
you know so there was a lot of
collaboration going on in terms of the
future the whole idea is to renovate the
site um in a way that kind of takes it
back to nineteen forty which i think is
absolutely the best thing to do because
when I go there now I've been there
probably 50 times every time I walk past
the gate house and walk on site I just
kind of get these tingles of you know
it's kind of like walking back into the
1940s and and so the plan is to make it
even more like that so it really is like
walking back into the 1940s but at the
same time as state of the art museum and
there's also the National Museum of
computing at Bletchley Park which is
there now and so that that's a museum a
bit like Computer History Museum here
which is on site there too so there's
the whole history of computing to at
Bletchley Park yeah and yeah and
Colossus is working so you can go and
see Colossus in fact there's a film at
the computer history museum of Tony sale
who led the rebuild of Colossus talking
about Colossus and showing losses in the
Computer History Museum just down the
road here
yeah I think there's I guess various
estimates out there for how how much
longer would have taken to win World War
two this effort not existed yeah um how
how do they arrive at these estimates I
don't know how they arrived at the mine
but I do know that I'm Harry Hensley who
I think was a code breaker there and as
a famous was a famous historian said
that it's shortened the war by between
two and four years and at the time about
11 million people a year were dying so
that's between 22 million and 44 million
people I mean it's just unimaginable
numbers of people and just talking to
Sir John the other day he was saying
that Eisenhower said that the work done
there shortened the war by many months
so you know it had a massive impact I
think it's it's always hard isn't it to
quantify what would have happened
because you just don't know but but you
know it made a major difference this is
what sorry the convoys we do not i'm
going to click always okay one of the
things that sir john spoke about at the
museum was the u-boats and the battle
atlantic and it's at that point so there
was a period of time that he said and
I'll get it wrong as I but there was a
six month period where we lost the codes
and then we got them back and the team's
the difference in being able to move at
you know to get to the u-boats was
really significant the other one that
you talked about the contribution had to
do with North Africa and really reducing
the supply line access as they were
moving towards Cairo and preventing a
lot of that it's just huge and the
amazing thing is that the the Germans
had some suspicions but not really they
really didn't know I'd the Nazis it is a
really amazing and we often you know one
of the questions that the museum was you
know what what what why didn't they
suspect her what happened and one of the
the questions is actually a humanity
question in some ways for me having
visited and soon I have talked about
this before which is the Nazis their
fundamental idea was this perfection
idea and they were systematically
eliminating anyone from the society you
know that was not matching this ideal so
if you were an intellectual if you were
from particular groups you just the
misfits please go away you know in this
ideal group so they have this idea that
perfection was achievable in some way
and so their belief that nigma was
uncrackable is interesting and what's
really striking about Bletchley is it
was all hands on deck you know whoever
whatever talent and Churchill located a
very strategically right outside of
London and right between cambridge in
Oxfordshire try to pull the mathematical
talent from both and did that and so
even though you know in the 1950s
context you still had you know gender
disparity or Turing was not out as a gay
man but you had the you know to the
Steve Jobs commercial the misfits the
crazies who you know often change the
world and they were there and in fact to
the point where in one of the huts
there's this fabulous little bay window
and one of the stories is about this
engineer who needed windows around him
to work and so you know making that
accommodation whereas i don't think the
nazi world would have accommodated that
talent to let that talent be so
effective so having half women and half
men and and just whoever was going to
show up to execute against this is
really amazing sign it's Megan I'm just
sneaking on for a moment because I read
something recently as well said and that
the Germans or Nazis at a time when
interviewed said they did know that
enigma was breakable they they they knew
that it was brega ball but they assumed
you'd need a whole machine a room full
of a machine the size of a room to do
that that's never going to happen so
that was quite interesting there was
there's one more thing I mean if if you
want to sort of get into into the world
of those days a good book to read is
Neal Stephenson
cryptonomicon which I mean it is fiction
but there's a lot of like science and
historical detail from there and to
speak to that you know like it's
unbreakable or not you like one of the
things is you know like if you break the
code you also need to be able to hide
the knowledge that the code is broken
and that's what they actually did I mean
you know like they they they were very
careful you like to fall within the
Gaussian which is like explaining the
book so I won't talk more about it yeah
you are totally right there it there
were certain there's a certain arrogance
of course that you referred to Megan
where it helps not to send every message
with Heil Hitler at the start
since you mentioned sort of physically
being there you know what it's like and
we got to visit with you which was
amazing and there's this one point on
the tier you go past the mansion house
and your kind of near the gates and you
can the the tour guide mentions that up
on the the tower is where station X was
and station next is the name another
name for Bletchley and it's where the
radio station was and they quickly moved
it because they didn't want to be
discovered but you can go inside of
there but what they then had to do was
bring everything by motorbike and so
when you're standing there they kind of
pointed the gay and say imagine 40
motorbikes an hour coming through the
skate each with a message and cracking
that and years of that isn't really an
amazing image and be one king of it
being in the dark because there was
blackout at night right so the
motorbikes couldn't put any lights on
and they weren't any lights for
Bletchley Park and yet they were still
having to you know I'm sure they weren't
going very slowly go along you know
these alleyways and bringing the
messages in and I'm sure there must have
been accidents and you know it wasn't
straight forward so you notice the
infectious enthusiasts orient but we
sort of grabbing my darkness thing right
here this thing and I ended up going to
the Imperial War Museum and also going
to see Winston Churchill's war rooms
which is also too tied-in and at a time
when Bletchley was building this
computer technology you know the room
that and it was much bigger than a room
actually with the bombs running and
cracking things and later breaking the
Lorenz cipher you just start learning
more and more and more the Americans
actually put a computer the size of a
room into Churchill's toilet in the war
room so that it was secretly encrypting
his phone calls back to back to the
states as well you you saw this for us
computer stuff was happening there that
I was not aware of before getting into
this and we've also it's infectious we
want to infect you with this infectious
enthusiasm yet so go visit everybody go
visit visit has like an Apollo mission
you know kind of feel to it and
with such amazing you know consequence
the other thing that's really
interesting is Churchill the small group
who kept it secret and apparently there
was at one point of long list of who
knew and Churchill came and just cross
that all the names and read with thing
it's like he crossed out all the CCS you
know ever like no one would be you know
included in this maybe five or six
people knew and so it was kept so secret
the other thing that I love is just
being able to see the humanity of the
different people who were there and you
know Turing himself and he'll exhibit
you know his horas because he was a row
at Cambridge are there and and also
astoundingly the 2009 apology from the
UK government for a treatment of Alan
after after the war because
homosexuality was low so misunderstood
then is amazing and in central display
in the area about him which is great for
everybody to see the thing that I loved
walking in was this young woman or this
older woman was there and she revealed
that she was five years old as the only
kids on site she her twin sister her
older brother and her little brother
were all kids there and she is talking
about next door they lived in the
stables next door it was one of the
groups with Denny the name of the famous
mathematician there I can't really know
diddly Knox so dealing ox was in there
and she remembers her mother and talking
to the kids sake Shh the girls are
working the girls are working it is such
a visceral feeling of imagining all
these mathematicians and talented people
had bloody doing their things absolutely
fifty percent women was yeah yeah more
yeah so soon any other questions
