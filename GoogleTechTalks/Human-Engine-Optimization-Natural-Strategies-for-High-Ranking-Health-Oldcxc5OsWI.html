really appreciate that it's a great
pleasure to be here at Google today to
talk about human engine optimization and
with reflection it became very clear to
me that Google is the perfect place to
speak about new pathways to health the
reason is that the search for internet
sites and the search for optimal health
actually have a surprising amount in
common
let's explore well this is right from
your pages and algorithms to determine
ranking and in fact how our health
evolves follows much the same kind of
algorithm for our health is largely
determined in terms of ranking and the
ranking is affected by great content
which is really nutrition what we bring
inside what becomes part of us and also
the quality links that we set up what
are we what are we linking to what are
our bodies linking to and what are we
associating with what is our environment
and just as those are the key
determinants for search placement they
really are the key determinants for our
own health the areas that I'm going to
be speaking about unfortunately are not
front and center in conventional medical
care that is a role of nutrition and the
role of mind-body interventions these
are areas that despite my training and
in top 10 medical centers for residency
and for for cardiology training these
were areas that somehow never managed to
become part of my training nor of
typical physicians so what we have done
was to establish a non-profit The Gables
Institute for Integrative cardiology and
this sole mission of this nonprofit is
to promote education for both healthcare
professionals and to the community to
promote natural approaches to health
natural approaches emphasizing nutrition
and the role of mind-body interventions
unfortunately there are no there-there's
no financial return on investment that's
seen at first glance from this sort of
initiative and it requires a non-profit
to bring this front and center and
that's exactly what we're trying to do
in our nonprofit and I'll speak a little
bit more about it as our talk unfolds
but I really invite all of you to if
this mission resonates with you to to
share this journey and and to help us as
we move forward because I think the the
journey of taking these natural
approaches to health and making them
front and center is going to require a
grassroots effort that will come from
all of you and to help change the system
because it definitely could stand some
change in why because what is it that
we're currently prioritizing in medicine
well I can tell you in cardiology most
people believe that the most potent
intervention that we have available to
us are things as you can see here this
is a stent with a stent is a device used
to prop open diseased and narrowed blood
vessels and many people would consider
it to be the most effective the highest
tech system that we have in cardiology
training but it might surprise you to
know that unless you're having a heart
attack at the moment it's inserted or
have a very unstable sort of chest pain
that when these devices are inserted do
you know what the data shows the
likelihood of either preventing a heart
attack or saving a life would be there's
very clear data on it and the answer is
the risk reduction is zero that unless
you're in the throes of a heart attack
this will not reduce the likelihood of a
future heart attack
or save your life on the other hand what
about the role of nutrition
well nutrition which gets little more
than lip service in typical encounters
has been shown as I'll show you to
reduce the risk of a heart problem by
72% and again this is
in the fringe literature this is in very
hardcore very strongly peer-reviewed
medical literature so my my goal is to
kind of rebalance this relationship a
little bit and that is to still you know
see the value of these incredible
marvelous high technology tools that we
have available but also to put them into
perspective and how much more we can do
by emphasizing the role of nutrition and
lifestyle measures to prevent the need
for these other higher technology tools
that are available so let's talk a
little bit about the data I mentioned to
you the 72% reduction where does it come
from
it comes from this study this
Mediterranean Leone Heart Study and
basically what they did in this study
was to a randomized group of individuals
who had had a heart attack to two diet
groups one diet group was advised just
to be on a low-fat kind of watch what
you read I've the other group was
advised to be a hunted Mediterranean
diet and what does that mean
Mediterranean diet meant try to increase
the number of vegetables and fruit that
you're eating try and reduce the refined
carbs in your diet and eat more whole
grains the predominant well should be
canola and olive oil and to eat less red
meat and more fish basically that was
the Mediterranean type and what did that
Mediterranean diet achieve take a look
unbelievable in terms of the graph it's
showing the percentage of individuals
without a heart problem so you want to
be on the top part of this graph and you
can see that the Mediterranean diet
group compared to the prudent diet group
did much much better over the several
year course of the study that's point
number one made a huge difference in
fact a 72% fewer events rate is by the
end of the study but that's not it
because many people believe that dietary
changes you know take a long time to
happen and then when they do they're
very small but you can see here the
curves begin to display well within the
first year so we see the changes very
quickly
you don't have to wait a long time to
see them and as you can see the
magnitude of change is quite profound
and when you eat a Mediterranean dive
the fascinating thing that's we're just
now uncovering is that you're not only
helping your own health but you're
improving the health of your next
generation why take a look at this this
study shows that mothers who eat a
Mediterranean diet during their
pregnancy reduce the risk of childhood
asthma in their children by 70% isn't
that something isn't it something so
many people believe that you know
diseases are mostly genetically
programmed and that whatever your genes
will dictate is the path that you'll
take but we know now that genes need to
be activated they're kind of a default
they're kind of a set point where you
might normally settle out ooh but that
setpoint like a thermostat the
temperature despite the fact the
thermostat has set a certain way in your
home you can alter the temperature in
your home by doing many other things
opening the window putting fire in you
can feel cooler or warmer by the
clothing that you wear so there is many
different ways to alter the final
outcome apart from whatever is in your
genes and this is a fascinating thing
that we're helping the health of future
generations by the foods that we eat and
so I think that when we kind of drill
down and look more into the components
of the Mediterranean diet that we really
need to start thinking about vegetable
to fruit in a very different way than we
might normally normally you think of
them as maybe a little bit something
healthy or something to eat as a snack
but I actually look at them as nothing
less than than medication medication
changes the course of your health so can
fruit and vegetables and let me kind of
show you a little bit more in terms of
details one of the things that I noticed
in your cafeteria which by the way is
the healthiest spot I have ever seen of
work place to eat so I really commend
all the wonderful people in
volved with that which is wonderful not
only in the type of food but the way
it's displayed which is incredibly
important and also to prove a point that
many people feel that delicious and
healthy are mutually exclusive and what
you have here proves that in fact they
very easily can be one of the same thing
in so incredible benefit not only for
your health but for your working
efficiency and just for quality of life
it's amazing so the thing that I saw in
your your eating place today a lot of
dark green leafy vegetables and for very
good reason take a look at this study
this study showed that for each serving
of dark green leafy vegetables you
reduce the risk of a heart problem
get a lot of this by 23% and when I
speak to doctors I ask are you asking
patients how many servings of dark green
leafy vegetables they're eating my guess
is that none of you have been asked that
by your doctors but you should be
because it's very potent again trying to
get this sort of information more into
everyday practice take a look amazing
so the question is why what is so
special about spinach and can we reduce
the healthful items in spinach to a pill
because it would be you know more more
simple to take a pill and be done with
it and not need to worry about keeping
food fresh the answer is we don't know
how to do that and the reason is let's
take a look and see what's inside of
spinach this is the ingredient list if
you want to make spinach take a look at
that take a look at everything that
nature has provided in such a simple
package that is there for us with all
the incredible benefits is it no wonder
that we can't replicate that all of
these constituents perhaps in the proper
proportion to achieve what nature has
provided for us for the taking it's
really I think kind of a spiritual
journey to see you know when they talk
about Whole Foods this is something it's
actually very complex but yet something
incredible because the complexity has
been sorted out and already been
established to be incredibly helpful
let's go into the element of fruit you
might have heard about the purple pill
but I've got a different version of the
purple pill this is the natural one and
blueberries and strawberries have a very
unique sort of antioxidant which
actually enlarges blood vessels and
helps to lower blood pressure they're
called anthocyanin and take a look at
this this study result this was just
published in circulation the most
prestigious cardiology journal just a
few weeks ago what do they find they
looked at 93 thousand women studied for
18 years so a very long very large study
and they found that women who have three
or more doses I like to refer to it or
servings of either blueberries or
strawberries what did it achieve for
them a 34 percent reduced risk of a
heart attack what a delicious way to
reduce your risk of a problem you know
unbelievable
unbelievable and now we're going to
sample some good medicine after this
talk but how simple it is and how
delicious so just to give you a visual
in the Leon study the Mediterranean
study that I refer to what did they eat
to achieve those results they ate
vegetables which visually in terms of
amount equal the amount of vegetables
that you see here these would be
equivalent to two servings of vegetables
and the size of the salad plate is the
size kind of above side salad that you
might see in a restaurant but you can
see it's not a typical salad of iceberg
lettuce and croutons this is a salad
filled with dark green leafy vegetables
and a whole plethora of colors of
different vegetables to go with that so
you can see it's quite a large stocked
side salad so two of those and one with
lunch perhaps one with dinner and then a
side portion of vegetables that would be
kind of the total that we're looking for
in the course of a day if you don't like
salads it could be steamed vegetables or
some other assortment but in terms of
quantity that's what we're thinking
about and then when it comes to fruit it
doesn't take much to get to what they
in this Mediterranean Leone study it
would be a side salad of a side portion
of berries is shown here you might eat
with breakfast and then an apple to go
with it later in the day that's all you
would need to eat but even this amount
is much more than the average American
is consuming and yet if the average
American did consume this amount our
health would be incredibly impacted so
just to kind of switch gears a little
bit and talk about carbohydrates
although this may not pertain to the
people here in this room the CDC Center
for Disease Control is estimated that by
2050 if current trends continue one out
of three adults will be diabetic so it's
a huge huge issue and I'd love to talk
to you about some of the foods that
we've and how they contribute to sugar
level I believe you'll find many of them
in surprising ways so let's talk a
little bit about a concept called the
glycemic load glycemic load refers to
the amount of sugar that gets released
in the bloodstream after you eat certain
foods and it's indexed for the serving
size of a particular food it's called
glycemic load in foods that will release
a great deal of sugar into your
bloodstream which obviously is
undesirable have a high glycemic load
and the number for high load is 20 or
greater a low glycemic load food which
contributes relatively minimal amount of
blood sugar is a value of 10 or under
and in between 10 and 20 our
intermediate values okay remember those
numbers okay because there's gonna be a
test okay
first part of our test a glazed doughnut
glazed doughnut what would you if over
20 is high and under 10 is low for
glycemic load what would you guess would
be to the glycemic load of a glazed
doughnut 3035 something like that it
sounds right because it's very sweet
sweet as can be well
glycemic load 1414 intermediate
intermediate we'll talk about that why
it's surprising and why it's important
so a lot of people know that a glazed
doughnut is not a super healthy food
right you know whether they like to eat
them or not they know that they're
eating something not very healthy so
what people might do instead especially
if they have a sugar problem is to
switch to something that seems healthier
and that's something very well could be
a bangle right now nearly is sweet not
sweet at all in fact and doesn't seem
fried seems much of what would you think
the glycemic load of a bagel might be
must be a little bit lower than a
doughnut right because it's not sweet at
all obviously a setup and take a look
like glycemic load 33 now if I asked you
a few moments ago that eating a doughnut
will contribute half the sugar load of
eating a bagel you probably would be
very surprised right so the take-home
message is what eat more Donuts no not
the take-home message but the idea is
that this is surprising without the
take-home messages both are not a great
breakfast choice so why is it the the
take home message is something does not
need to be sweet in order to raise your
sugar level why because starches are
just made of sugar molecules arranged
differently and even though they're not
sweet to the taste starches when they're
digested by the body are released into
sugar into sugar and therefore the
doughnut doesn't weigh very much even
though it's sweet as can be the amount
of carb in a doughnut is relatively less
it's it's it's not much in terms of
actual weight the bagel on the other
hand weighs much more there's much more
carb and again even though it's not
sweet tasting that starch gets converted
into sugar so the best choice for
breakfast would be none of the above
you know not the doughnut and not to
switch to the bagel and it's certainly
if you've got issues related to sugar if
you've been told that your sugar is
bordering high or beginning to be a
little bit high even not in the diabetic
range good thing to keep in mind okay
let's look at another example potato
we've got a white potato and a sweet
potato what would you think the glycemic
load of a baked potato might be white
potato take a guess
27 okay let's take a look
how about pretty close 29 29 isn't it
something about the two glazed donuts
and I doubt very many people again
because the the potato is not sweet at
all it's really hard to understand that
eating something like that would raise
your sugar level but it would quite a
bit and that's even before all the
health problems of putting the sour
cream and she is another step up okay
what about a sweet potato now a sweet
potato sweet right so it's glycemic load
must must must be much higher than the
white potato don't you think yeah now
take a look huge difference glycemic
load of 15 it's about half plus a lot
more nutrients in the sweet potato so
again it's not intuitive the reason I
show you this a lot of people think well
I know what to eat and eating you know
is natural well a lot you do know and a
lot is intuitive but but a good portion
is not and the fact that a sweet potato
would contribute much less to your sugar
than a white potato is an example of
something not particularly intuitive but
important okay the other thing that I
saw here in your your food space which
was wonderful was really a predominance
of whole grains but a lot of people
don't know what exactly is a whole grain
they know they've got some vague sense
that it's something healthy but what is
a whole grain well whole grain he has
three parts that are really important
what was what was in the grain to begin
with when it was grown it's the brand
the germ and the endosperm the brand is
the outer covering of the the whole
grain and that's where all the fiber is
or some B vitamins and and flavonoids
which are antioxidants so a lot of
healthy stuff there the yellow shown
here is the germ also very healthy it's
got antioxidants and phytochemicals a
lot of healthy ingredient and what's
left a larger portion
of the grain is called endosperm and
that is really nothing but starch
nothing but starch and when a grain is
refined guess what
it's the endosperm the starch that is
the part that remains and that's why
eating that in in exclusion is not a
very healthy step to take so let's talk
a little bit about what are some
examples of whole grains some of them
may be very familiar to you others
probably not so so we're gonna do our
whole grains on display one of them is
oatmeal so a lot of people know oatmeal
is very healthy choice and that's
absolutely right another one which has
become more popular we introduced it
recently in a group of health care and a
conference for healthcare individuals
and it was labeled and people said what
is this Kanoa no-neck you know it's
quinoa become very very popular very
high in protein among whole grains it's
a complete protein so a great choice in
something I'm sure which is familiar to
you another whole grain I've probably
familiar to you as brown rice brown rice
is opposed to white or sticky rice much
healthier much lower glycemic load than
white sticky rice a lot more nutrients
than other whole grains you might be
accustomed to this one in soup parley
but it can be even steamed very
delicious now others that you may not be
as familiar with bulgur which many
people think will be that in the next
one the new quinoa bulgur very healthy
great whole grain another one which you
may have heard about or not is farro
very healthy whole grain
delicious when steamed just some
examples of things to think about there
is another whole grain that you're
probably eating fairly regularly that
you don't even know as a whole grain
you're getting kind of a freebie I'm not
sure you're eating in the healthiest way
any idea it's a Saturday night food out
to the movies popcorn you bet who knew
it was a whole grain and very healthy
and until you put
all the bad oils and fats and things
that you might find in the movie through
but air pop popcorn with maybe a little
bit of olive oil a tiny be a tiny bit of
garlic or just a pinch of salt a very
small amount incredibly healthy snack
not so in the movie theater perhaps
because of all the saturated fat in the
sauce that's added so my question to you
what becomes of a whole-grain once it's
been processed what are the kind of
products that we can get well we strip
away the bran strip where the germ serf
way the endosperm and let's see when you
look at the brand we can make something
like bran flakes which are truly high in
fiber it might be a good choice for a
cold cereal and the germ if you ever
wondered if you've seen a bottle of
wheat germ and wondered what this is
it's actually a portion of the the wheat
that you can see in the how the whole
grain very healthy it is an excellent
source of vitamin E and folic acid very
healthy thing so what's left the starch
and what do you make of that there we go
this is that this is the industry so I
hate to say but when you're eating this
you're actually eating a mouthful of
there you go so think about that next
time the other thing about whole grains
is now you know the food industry knows
that people are looking for a whole
grain name and they're also looking at
the label of grains very carefully and
what they often will will write is
multigrain this or multigrain that and
it sounds like a healthy thing like lots
of grains but in fact multigrain just
means multiple grains it doesn't mean
that they're whole grains it could be
multiple refined grains so don't be
fooled as rific there was a an item
labeled as a multigrain baguette and
when you looked at the ingredients there
are truly multiple grains but unless
they're labeled whole grains they
typically are not and none of these are
labeled whole grains so again be careful
when it says multigrain not necessarily
a whole grain product what you want is
100% whole grain to be listed somewhere
one or two uh now switch gears a bit to
talk just briefly about nuts nuts are
incredibly healthy for a variety of
reasons they've got lots of healthy
ingredients to them constituents that
you really want to take advantage again
another item that I saw in ample supply
here at Google nuts here phytosterols
they're a natural plant oil that
actually reduces the absorption of
cholesterol from our diet which is a
good thing it's got lots of magnesium
which it has lots of healthy properties
including lowering of blood pressure
vitamin E which again when it's found in
food has been found to be very healthy
but when it's taken in isolated pill
form it has not been shown to be
beneficial and then nuts have a lot of
fat but predominantly there's a healthy
monounsaturated fat which is a good fat
so lots of good things so what happens
when we eat nuts
take a look at this 37 percent lower
risk of heart disease by eating four
handfuls of nuts
per week that's the dose almonds and
walnuts have been best studied but in
this one study they really looked at a
whole variety of nuts take a look at
this for now masculine how many of you
have been advised by your doctor to eat
nuts throughout the week you know my
guess is very few many people are
concerned about the fact that even
healthy fats have a significant number
of calories and they're worried about
the caloric intake well that you know
does seem like an issue but studies
interestingly of people who are
overweight who add nuts into their diet
show that they don't for the most part
gain weight the reason is that nuts are
very CCA ting that make you feel full
and so generally when people eat nuts
even with all the calories they end up
eating far less of other foods so
they're replacing unhealthy calories
with much healthier ones and sometimes
they end up being filled up to such a
degree that they end up eating fewer
calories in net and in losing weight
that way so these have shown you some
examples
the incredible health benefits of fruit
vegetables dark green leafy ones in
particular strawberries and blueberries
and nuts so just a sampling there's many
others that we could share about but in
our limited time together that is those
are them the main areas of nutrition I
wanted to focus on but I wanted to now
kind of return to the mission of what I
talked about to make this sort of
education about nutrition more and and
the practice of nutritional advice to be
front and center in modern medicine and
why is it not now well let me share some
information with you that there are
accreditation requirements for training
programs in medicine and for training to
be a cardiologist a heart specialist the
accreditation document is 32 pages you
can see some of the pages shown here and
of those 32 pages what I did was search
for the word nutrition in this 32 page
document as you can see here the title
the program requirements for Graduate
Medical Education and cardiovascular
disease and as I did my search nutrition
was found and no occasion 0 and the same
for food and all the words that you
could substitute for nutrition so in all
of that that is the issue that we're
seeking to address to put this front and
center and we've started to do that in
our work the capables Institute in
conjunction with other groups we put on
this program for instance cardiology
cooks where we took cardiology trainees
shown here and gave them some nutrition
information and actually put aprons on
them and have them taught by a gourmet
chef how they can actually use healthy
cooking techniques in their own lives
for the interesting reason that when
healthcare people adapt healthy
behaviors themselves they're much more
likely to counsel their patients about
healthy lifestyle behaviors and probably
all of you can sense that when you adopt
healthy behaviors you know as you start
to run aren't you more likely to tell
your friends
about you or or your children about
running you're kind of a role model and
you're excited about it
so that's one of the one of the agendas
that we have to try and get people more
personally involved so no talk about
healthy lifestyle would be complete
without mentioning exercise and we'll
just mention a bit about it the
interesting thing about exercise is that
little goes a very long way thirty
minutes of walking a day will cut your
heart risk by 14% and the more you do
the greater the benefit so but just
walking 30 minutes and interestingly it
even gets better than that because if
you break up that 30 minutes into three
ten-minute blocks you get the same
benefit even more even more in some
studies but certainly the same so how
many people don't have ten-minute blocks
of continuous walking they can do either
tour from the workplace or around your
workplace or before after work you know
it's not really hard to do but it's very
potent medicine now we're going to
switch gears a little bit and talk about
another area that unfortunately is not
addressed in typical encounters in in
conventional medicine and that is the
fact that we know so intuitively that
there's a connection between what
happens in our mind and what happens in
our body and really there's really not
even a separation we tend to think of
them as two distinct areas but they
actually are so interrelated there
really is not a meaningful distinction
we just think of them differently and
even as they show this graphic heart and
the brain and the rest of the body
there's so it's an ecosystem they're
tremendously related so we can't talk
about one without the other and the
studies are very convincing that our
thinking in our levels of stress in our
levels of positive emotions make a huge
impact on our health so our goal is as
much as possible to get to happy room so
the question is how do we do that how do
we do that what's a bill some
interesting things just by way of
background I can't do this study in in
people thankfully but take a look at
what we see in this study the importance
of social interaction and touch do you
think that that would make a difference
for for our health you might think so
maybe in an intangible kind of kind of
more general way but look at how it
affected very specifically that they
took a group of rabbits prone to
developing a thorough schematic plaque
and half of them they just said them
they're Chow and in their water and
allowed them the necessities of life but
the other half they fed the same way but
the rabbits were regularly handled by
the people in the lab and petted
regularly so at the end of the study
period they looked at the bodies they
they looked internally in the rabbit and
what did they find again the only
difference between the two groups was
one group was handled and petted and the
other group was that sixty percent fewer
plaques in rabbits that were regularly
handled so it shows you the incredible
importance I mean you could figure out
all kinds of jokes and dandelions from
this but really the importance I think
is to show you the social interaction
and and you know perhaps the value of
even human touch we know that in medical
encounters that feeling someone even
just touching when people when doctors
examine you part of I think that
interaction is really a trust and kind
of a building of a relationship but even
beyond that the social part the social
connectedness how critical that is for
our health now what can you do to
improve your own health take a look at
this study just published again in one
of the highest quality Corey ology
journals just a few months ago they took
201 patients who had coronary artery
disease and they treated them medically
exactly the same so this wasn't a test
of whether one group of medicines was
better than another same group of
Medicine half of them were randomized to
a group that did meditation twice a day
the other half were treated identically
but no meditation what do they find
at the end of the study period five
years they found 48% fewer heart
problems in the group that meditated 48
percent it's astounding it's astounding
I can tell you there is no drug in
cardiology that confers a 48% benefit in
any category Medicare so just saying
that again not to replace you know
conventional care but certainly
shouldn't this be part of it shouldn't
this be part for patients you know after
a heart problem and more importantly
even before to prevent this you know the
bad things from happening how potent and
again not part of training at all that
part of training you know next you know
again talking about the quality links
that we make again very important for
web searches also important for our own
health again there's so many connections
between what you're doing here at Google
and what we need to do to improve our
health it's to make healthy links
there's a term called biophilia which is
our attraction or longing for things
that are alive for nature you know
though intuitively we have that longing
what are the health implications of it
take a look at this study fascinating
what they did was to look at the
recovery period of a group of patients
recovering from surgery now half of the
patients this is an older period when
hospital rooms had a bad it close to a
window which in this case had a view of
trees and a nature scene or the bad that
was closer to the hospital hallway which
you know didn't have a view of of nature
so they looked at patients were assigned
to either the bed by the window of the
nature view or the bed by the hallway
and they looked to see was there any
difference in how they recovered from
surgery so what did they find they found
that the group was facing the wall
needed far more medications for pain
than the group that was viewing the
trees the window group isn't it
something isn't that something that the
recovery period was affected by the
proximity to nature again it doesn't
affect what we usually think of as
conventional medical care whether
they're by the window or not but and in
fact some people thank you by the
hallway you might get more attention and
so forth but it was actually quite the
opposite again showing the power of our
attraction to nature another aspect of
what we can do that affects our stress
level or impa's ative ly really makes us
more relaxed are things that involve
breathing exercises or breath work much
of yoga does that meditation does that
and there's actually some data showing
that we can reduce blood pressure by a
series of programmed breathing exercises
and in this study I'm going to show you
here this was a study they use an
electronic device to kind of just guide
your breathing exercises but in the long
run this electronic device was just a
guide to help Anna breathing exercise
breathing exercises you can do in many
different ways usually involves being
conscious of your breath ending up
usually slowing down your breathing more
regular breathing but but most
importantly just trying to focus your
attention specifically on your breathing
and trying to filter out other things
but in this study they showed a 15
millimeter drop in systolic which is the
top blood pressure reading in people who
did twenty five minutes per week of
these breathing exercises for eight
weeks this is a big deal it's a big deal
it's a tremendous drop similar to that
that we see with some medications again
may be a replacement for those with very
mild problems and additive for others
but what an important thing to do with
so many other benefits no side effects
from this promise no side effects it's
an amazing thing and so I've given you a
glimpse of some of the things that I
think are so important in medicine but
currently so much missing in medicine
and that is what we're doing in the
Gables Institute we're trying to again
with a single-minded mission to
education there's no services or
products but just to try to get
nutrition and lifestyle measures front
and center in how you're getting your
medical care and how your kids will get
it and also to inform the community
about what they should expect in their
health care and how to drive change so
by doing this as you can see these these
interventions are not minor side things
that you know will add a tiny bit of
additional health but their major and
significant and therefore we really are
trying to expand our reach and by doing
so we think we're doing nothing less
than saving lives and so we invite you
to join us to partner with us in this
mission to access us through our website
through our Facebook site and to partner
we would really welcome volunteer
efforts from all of you both on a
technology side and even from a personal
side from other things trying to get the
word out we're speaking to conferences
to national and international forums and
we would love your help too if you feel
this is important as I do to help
partner in getting this message out and
hopefully I've convinced you throughout
our talk that this in fact is no
ordinary kitchen implement in fact it's
nothing less than a bare-metal
interventional device that with your
help and with your inspiration and your
partnership with us will be converted
into a drug coated interventional device
that looks something like this or
something like this thank you very much
for your time and attention
any questions for dr. DeVries hi
obviously a lot of companies are
catching on to this idea that consumers
are looking for things that are whole
grain or low in saturated fats etc and
and with that comes a phenomenon where
they try to obviously assume that should
mislead you into thinking that something
is how its healthier than it is like
what would you recommend we look for
besides looking for that whole grain
label or are there any like
accreditation or certifications that we
should be looking for on labels when we
pay more of our hard-earned money on for
products that we think are healthier for
us yeah it's a great question and there
are many groups that are looking into
kind of a stamping or a grading system
you might have seen there there are a
whole variety out and now you know many
of them are involved some arbitrary
sorts of systemization and there are no
no agreed-upon one so they're still
working on that it's a very hot area but
I can give you a few very practical tips
of things you can look for them might be
helpful so the one is the multigrain
that I talked about the other one when
it says made with whole grains that's
also another trick because made with
whole grains just means that whole
grains are part of part of the recipe it
could be that almost all of it is
refined grain but at the end they put in
a bit of whole grains and they can
truthfully say made with whole grains
but when people think about it they're
thinking that all of the grains are
whole grains which may not be so again
look for a hundred percent whole grain
so that's one another common thing that
they say is cholesterol free and they'll
advertise things like cholesterol free
peanut butter something like that which
is ridiculous because cholesterol is
only found in animal products so peanut
butter could never have cholesterol
unless they dumped in some butter with
it so you know don't pay extra for the
peanut butter that's labeled cholesterol
free so that's another thing to know a
little bit about food and don't be
fooled into paying higher price for
something that really doesn't make any
sense so those are really key areas I
think beyond that it's - you know you
really need to look at the
- look at the fat content saturated fat
in particular and the salt content salt
is a huge factor and it is in surprising
foods like even even breads will have a
good amount of salt and some breads much
more than others
processed foods and processed cheese
foods even even much more so really is
to look at the labels beyond those and
to know some of the some of the common
ones that I talk to you about very
important and then the other thing you
can't go wrong when foods I always tell
people if it has a label it's not the
healthiest thing probably so the Whole
Foods you know you don't need to look at
the labels for spinach and kale and
vegetables and nuts and fruit and those
sorts of things so those Whole Foods the
foods that are grown you you really
can't go wrong with them but when it
comes to packaging you have to be more
careful you're right hi there um okay so
I come to work and I make like really
healthy choices I'm eating my leafy
greens and my blueberries and I go home
I have a great dinner but like like last
night I had a double stuffed Oreo so my
question is did I undo all the good I
did throughout the day with that you
know questionable choice or can I just
cut myself a break every now and then no
I don't think you did I look good I
think you know in the end it's really
the aggregate of everything that you do
and actually I think you know there's
there's a margin when it gets to be
probably counterproductive but I think
you know to have something small
celebratory that that is really a
discrete part of your week you know I
think is just part of joyful living in
to me makes a lot of sense now when that
comes to be twice a day you know then
there's a problem but no I don't think
you out did it and in terms of for
people again you know who are looking at
calories which I don't encourage most
people to do I encourage them to focus
on healthy food rather than calories but
even for calories you know it almost
just like your budget you know if you go
in and blow a lot of money and
and some luxury that you didn't need but
you really wanted well you know it's
fine but then you have less money for
other things so it's kind of in the
budget so no I think if that's done
carefully I think it's part of joyful
living how do you heart medications
factor and all this like lipitor and
things like that
are they supplemental to a good diet or
if you're on a very good diet are they
no longer useful I know they they can
work together absolutely and I think
that you know whether someone's
cholesterol it's so high and their risk
factors are so high that they need
cholesterol medicine you know the
medicine does not take away the
importance of the diet so it's not like
your situation is so bad that now the
diet doesn't matter and we're going to
switch to the medicine the diet is
always the foundation the most important
because you can even swamp out the
impact of a medicine of cholesterol
medicine by eating an adverse diet so
they really go hand-in-hand now if you
eat a healthy diet will your cholesterol
always be so great that you never need
medicine you know not necessarily there
are people with genetic predisposition
now I was saying that a genetic
predisposition certainly is not the full
story but it contributes so there are a
very small percentage of people who have
a very severe genetic issue their
cholesterol will be high no matter what
they eat but even in those people the
diet can either make situations an
increment better an increment worse so
the diet and again that's what we're
trying to put forward through the work
of our nonprofit the diet and nutrition
are always important they're always the
foundation and in every discussion
whether you're 25 years old and super
healthy and no problems you're just
trying to keep yourself that way or you
know you're 73 and you've had to bypass
surgeries the diet is critical in either
case in one case you want to prevent
further problems the other one you want
to keep yourself healthy and again I
focused a lot about hard issues but the
diet that's helpful for preventing heart
problems is exactly the same diet
been shown to be protective against many
cancers again we can't do everything
with nutrition and diet but you can do a
great great deal so why not and you have
to eat something so why not make it the
most healthful you can eat and again
healthy and delicious is shown here very
much go hand in hand
hello can you talk a little bit about
resveratrol I hear so much about this
and how suddenly red wine is healthy for
you and I was very excited to hear this
but I'm like yeah I think this is
probably not really the case Japanese
come in time the issue it's interesting
there's there's a lot of interesting
data and animals showing that
resveratrol seems to prolong their life
prolong the life of animals in
laboratory studies and it is one of the
ingredients found in higher
concentration in in things like red wine
however the amount that is been given to
these animals is far greater than you
could ever get from the lucious person
you know drinking red wine so it's
really interesting in you know it's a
story that's unfolding so there there
actually might be more and there
actually might be some very interesting
applications but I would say now that
the data in humans is far too limited to
recommend that but keep an eye on it
it's an interesting compound so in terms
of whether wine all of a sudden is
healthy or alcohol well you know it's
interesting there are very good
epidemiologic studies showing for sure
in men that a small amount so this is a
glass a standard sized glass of wine a
standard amount of beer or one standard
serving of hard liquor may be protective
or it looks like it's protective for men
for heart disease and perhaps for other
problems as well as it is for women also
protective one one serving however in
women the story is a bit more
complicated because alcohol is also
related to the development of breast
cancer so certainly if there's a family
history of risk you wouldn't want people
having wine for health and I I don't
actually recommend that
I got to go home any of my wine cuz you
know it's good for my health and so
forth but if you enjoy alcohol and you
know one serving a day for men for sure
for women it's a little bit more
controversial you know may not you don't
be a bad thing health-wise the issue for
women although there's a slightly
increased risk of breast cancer there's
also a protection against heart problems
and for women you know there's actually
a greater risk of dying from a heart
problem than from cancer so it's just a
little bit more of a double-edged sword
but yeah it's interesting with alcohol a
little bit you know may be helpful for
people who enjoy that thank you we have
one more question over here hello I was
wondering I know you mentioned vitamins
and how they weren't able to capture all
of what you know for example with
spinach was able to capture do you
recommend vitamins at all or like to
supplement you know eating healthy you
know I do think there's a role for
vitamins I specifically you know refer
to you're replacing dark green leafy
vegetables with with pills and there's
been no substitute found there are some
instances I think vitamin D is a vitamin
that it's been shown many people are
deficient especially people who live in
colder climates and especially in the
winter and vitamin D is produced from
sunlight hitting their skin as well as
from oral intake and for many people who
live in colder places in the winter
their vitamin D levels just aren't are
insufficient so vitamin D for a selected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
