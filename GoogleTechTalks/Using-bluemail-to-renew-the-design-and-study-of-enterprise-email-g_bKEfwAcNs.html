today I'd like to introduce John town
who's a research staff member at the
almaden research center of IBM Research
and John's interests focus on
understanding the needs of users and
designing new technologies to support
collaborative applications he applied
the mix of qualitative research so
interviews surveys video-based color
observation and quantitative using user
logs to understand people's current work
practices and design new prototypes and
tools to support their work so John's
previous research experience has been at
xerox parc and at Sun Microsystems and
just for all the employees here today
just let you know that this presentation
is being recorded for YouTube so thank
you Joe ok thanks I'm glad to be here to
have a chance to talk about blue al with
the folks here at Google so we want to
talk about how we can improve the email
experience and I'm focusing on two I
think fairly obvious areas dealing with
the volume of email and finding messages
that you've received in the past when
you need it and I'm going to talk about
how blue male tries to address that in
two ways first we're trying some new
things with the design of email by a
combination of conversation threading
folders message tagging and orienteering
and also we're using blue mail to help
us understand how are people using email
currently and what about that usage is
changing in ways that we need to adjust
in our email client design so i'll just
start with a quick overview this is what
blue mail looks like it's a web-based
access to email and in our case Lotus
Notes enterprising email and I'll just
highlight a few things first and we'll
go into more detail we do message
threading so collecting all messages
together into a thread so that each
thread is one line we also do
conventional folders so you can file
messages away in folders as people are
familiar with from prior email clients
and we do message tagging so you can tag
messages and that shows up an attack
here on the left bottom and also in the
thread itself any tags that you apply to
messages or threads appear there and
we'll go through that in more detail in
a demo but first I want to kind of set
up the even that combination of features
create some interesting at least
surprising to us design interactions and
I'm going to show an example that
explains that so let's say I get an
email message in my inbox and it's about
blue mail design so I reply to it which
automatically puts a message my reply in
the sent folder and I'm one of those
people that likes to file things into
folder so I'm going to file in a folder
called blue mail and since it's about
design i'm also going to apply a tag
called design to that okay so then let's
say someone replies to my response and
that comes into my inbox and then i also
get a message inviting me to give a blue
mail taka Chi which was just last month
so this last message I'm going to tag
it's about design but it's also about
Kai so I'm going to apply to different
tags that message so even in the simple
example we've got and the features that
we have there's a couple different ways
to kind of organize my conceptual model
of email so there's conventional folders
and you can see where those messages lie
in in folders and then there's the
threading and the threading cuts across
folders right so some messages are in a
place I've already folded away somewhere
in the inbox summer my scent and there's
tags so those tags connect messages
again that could be in different folders
and those tags also potentially connect
with other tags and so that creates some
interesting design interactions I'm
going to step through how we address
those in blue meow so I'm going to try
to do a live demo guys just
bear with me while I switch over to that
huh
this was working just a little bit ago
blue mail is not it's a prototype I
should say it's a proof of concept
prototype and it's not performance-tuned
so this may take a little while but
there you go okay so let me expand that
to full screen so this is what bloom it
looks like you'll see a list of messages
here and again you see how messages are
gathered into threads so here's a thread
of five messages here's the thread that
I have with Jennifer organizing my
meeting here I think my computer spawned
catching up and you'll also see that as
part of the subject line there's a
little digestive wet the first few
characters or as much as will fit of the
message itself so I can tell this
message says it's done I don't actually
really need to read that any further so
the messages that are not read yet by me
are in bold messages I've seen already
are not Arjun regular texts and we'll
just open this one which is a message
about a baked high meeting tonight and
I'm sorry this is this loads usually not
this low but we are kind of working
through a couple layers of networking
and the message will open up in a
preview pane down below so in contrast
to gmail we're actually trying to keep
everything within the same view of a
page
there we go
so I think this is mainly network
slowness but as you see the preview is
going to show up in the bottom and I can
read the message in context with the
message list so just to point out some
other things about threads we actually
have the most recent message of a thread
at the leftmost in this in this front
position and we preserve the order of
thread so I can see that this message
started from a call I ok response McCall
responded i responded and call so we we
preserve that order up in the message
list itself and i can kind of see what's
new how many messages are new like you
can see in some of the lower messages ok
so that message finally appeared i can
scroll and read through that if what and
i'm going to try to open a thread i see
so firefox's hung up thing ok i'm going
to try to go through as much of the
demos you can but i might revert here we
go so this opens up the thread and again
you'll see a message at the top will
open up in full view and then all the
messages below that are collapse into a
header you just see the digest of the
first line of the message and again it's
in reverse chronological order so the
most recent message is up at the top and
earlier messages in the thread are down
below now if I choose to delete a thread
well I'll just talk through this because
I don't want to confuse the client
whilst doing that but if i delete a
thread it'll pop up a warning message
because any actions deleting or full
during acts on the entire thread not on
individual message so it will warn me if
I'm deleting a thread that I'm not
deleting just one message but perhaps a
whole series of five messages and
confirm that that's what I want to do
and it'll also allow me to drag and drop
a message to a folder to file it or or
to a tag so let me try to show right so
there's this pop-up I'm about to delete
five messages and thread we're actually
going to cancel that because I don't
want to do that
so I want to show moving a collection of
messages to a folder let's say I'm in my
sort of spring cleaning mode where I
want to go through and get a bunch of
messages and put them into a folder
related to some work that i do at
Stanford and let's say I see there well
I know that there's a bunch of messages
about the PCD the people computing and
design seminar at Stanford and I want to
collect them all up and put them into a
folder and I know I haven't done the
spring cleaning for a while since about
January so I want to go back to kind of
the last period last night I've done
this and find a message so here's an
example of one I'm going to select this
one and I know I haven't done this since
January so I'm going to zoom down and as
I scroll I hope I get it at preview see
that preview popping up about where I am
in the in my message store so say I'm
going back to about january i can get
there quickly without having to actually
kind of page scroll didn't quite go back
far enough and i can also preview right
so here's another example of one i can
select that and here's another example
of one I could select that and then I'm
going to as soon as it catches up with
me drag and drop that into a folder we
go so if i drag and drop and into this
stanford folder it should take those
three messages and put them into that
folder furthermore they go back up to
the top this message here this thread if
i hover over the thread i see the
individual messages and i want to show
that in this case i've already folded
some of these messages into a different
folder as the example earlier so those
are shown with kind of a gray background
so messages sorry messages for me
obviously are in the sent folder this
one I had filed in the CSU w folder and
so it tells me which threads are in my
current view my inbox in which I've
already
put out in another view but the thread
still collects them together still
provide you the context of the entire
conversation even if you've put some
things away into another folder and so
it allows you to get quick access to the
context to be able to respond to that
thread ok and I'm going to just show one
other thing is tagging so well maybe I'm
not going to show you tagging tagging is
another way of indexing through your
email it has some different affordances
twofold ring in that you can tag you can
apply more than one tag to a message and
let's say I happen to know again because
i'm doing the spring cleaning there's a
bunch of messages around Kai that I kind
of didn't index so I'm going to go to
round when Kai was which was early in
April and CEO here's one and let's see
if I can get it so to apply tag I just
click in the box and I add a tag and
that gets applied and it shows up in
front of the message and yeah it's see
if I can quickly navigate there's that I
remember there's a few Kai messages okay
so here's one here's another one and
here's another one so I can do a global
tag operation by just clicking multiple
selecting and dragging and dropping onto
the tag cloud on the left here the chi
tag in a cloud and it will apply the chi
tagged all those messages and
furthermore if I apply a tag to one
message because of threading thudding
kind of leverages that it'll surface
that tag up to the top of the thread and
it'll be kind of guilt by association
that tag will be associated with other
messages in the thread and of course
there's also a search box see if I
search for general I'll get any messages
that were associated with her okay sorry
that got a little bit slow but any
questions about blue mail and operations
about how it features and how tagging
and foal during and threading interact
tags are applied to messages but they
are they get associated by threading and
because threads work across fol during
they'll they'll show up in in any view
that you have of a thread oh I should
mention there's a non-threaded view I'm
sorry the question was tags associated
with threads actually tags are associate
with individual messages and they they
by association go to threads there is a
non-threaded view so by clicking on this
icon at the top I get what you might
think of it as a kind of a conventional
view of email one message of the time so
I can toggle between unthreaded or
threaded view might change my view but
sue so there's all the threads together
and then if I click on this again it
will eventually go into enter the view
and if you're in a thread of you can you
be in parts of those folders and all
these parts of a threat or if you're a
thread of you always see the messages
right okay so the question is about how
threading and foal during interact and
threading we are in real time figuring
out threads and threads well all threads
will always be kept together in threaded
view even when it's spread across
folders so any anywhere where I look and
no matter what folder I'm in if I'm in
threaded view it will sort of collect
other messages that are part of the
thread and we reconstitute it in that
thread but it will show in the hover
which ones which messages are in my
current folder or view and which ones
are from another folder hold on just a
second let me kind of reorient where I
am because I seem to have gone into and
threaded view there was another question
yes that's
okay so the question is about can a
message exists in multiple folders side
I meant to say that the message is only
belong in one folder as conventionally
messages can have more than one tag and
so tags and bridge across folders put a
message into a boulder someone replies
joy does it go back in the inbox we're
going to say that right okay so this is
kind of tricky in the sense that it
shows up in your inbox so in this case
this met this thread has five messages
and any message that has a gray
background actually is living in another
folder so obviously the message is for
me or in the sent folder and these other
two from a call I happen to know are in
a CSU w folder so and this message at
the top was a new incoming message that
say in my inbox and so by coming in it
it we collects the messages I've it
makes it easy for me to get to the other
messages in the thread even though
they're living in another folder so it
is creating a kind of a new view from
the users point of view and we'll talk a
little bit about some of the design
tensions around that because some people
use folders to move things out of you
and you have your to-do list what we're
doing here is that we're not taking up
any more space to only one line in your
message list but it is making access to
those other messages in the thread just
one click away of the questions yes to
follow that
or anything for instance if you set up
filters and you wanted to shun things
off the folder exactly she says it to do
and see unread messages only at the
whole box is that ok the question was
about how threading possibly interacts
with filters and so I think the user has
a couple choices there so first of all
if you go into unthreaded view then
you're back into this world where you
only see what's in your folder so that's
one way in which you can get a view that
I think what some people might expect
that view where messages that get sent
by a rule into another folder just won't
appear in their inbox anymore but if you
are in threaded view and you have a
message in your inbox if it's a reply if
it's a thread with messages that have
been folded elsewhere by rule or any
other means it'll show up in the thread
so I'm a little unclear though about
whether if you have a rule how one
message will get in your inbox and the
others wouldn't but if that did occur
the thread will always give you access
to the entire thread no matter what
folder there in but so this is in fact
what we thought could be confusing and
one of the reasons why we wanted to try
this and we did some I'll say a little
bit about we did some interviews with
some users and got some reactions to it
but but this is definitely the tricky
part and perhaps a lie I don't know
gmail doesn't offer folders right all
right because it avoids a whole realm of
design issues if you but by having both
folders and tagging and threading it
creates some design tensions other
questions ok so I think that's it for
the demo glad I survived as well as it
did sorry that it was a little slow okay
so some contrast contrasting blue mail
with gmail so as I just mentioned we're
offering folding and threading and
tagging the combination of those
features together the other thing is
that we wanted to really try to support
orienteering as well as searching so
that ability to kind
scroll and quickly find a place because
people often think of email in terms of
oh I got that about a month ago or a
round chi or certain landmarks of the
beat be able to quickly find those dates
through scrolling and the other way
we're supporting orienteering is you
know using leveraging threads to be able
to take advantage of well a thread will
always keep the context of the
conversation of messages together or one
click away but we're trying to do that
without cluttering up your view without
taking up more space there are a couple
other interface design details I pointed
out that the ordering of entries most
recent is leftmost and top most of the
thread which is I think converse to the
way gmail works and we also preserve the
ordering we don't we don't compress that
down to just who was part of the thread
and we have that unthreaded option to be
able to see messages in a conventional
one-by-one view and another difference
is that Gmail interfaces with lotus
notes which is a different back-end but
more importantly aimed at the enterprise
market so to accept that that might be
differences between consumer and
enterprise blue mail is targeted towards
an enterprise email context so because
of the questions that we had and we were
wondering how we're going to react to
threading and foal during we'd early on
before we had completely implemented
Lumia we did a limited field test of a
small set of people among diverse job
roles and even different sites where we
have them load their own email into blue
mail which is important because we want
to see how they triage their own email
we gave them a demo blue mail and
particularly how threading and fold
during interact and then we asked users
to triage their own email for about one
and a half hours and we interact with
them in terms of what they were doing or
what they expected to happen and how the
design how they were reacting to that
design and we probe for their reactions
and I just want to summarize a few
responses to that but I want to point
out one interesting thing we did with
this test is that the people doing the
interviews come were included people
using in different roles of our team so
there's myself as a user study
researcher there was the designer
who did most of the UI and visual design
for blue me oh and there was an
implementer who was actually located in
Argentina because of the way our team
was located so we integrated different
perspectives on the study and this is
something I think many companies
separate researchers from designers from
implementers but we wanted to get
multiple perspectives on our user study
and it came back with people came away
with different kind of impressions I was
looking for conceptual models how people
were thinking about folding and
threading the designer came away with
some clear ideas about how he wanted to
communicate what was happening with for
example folding and threatening more
clearly and the implementer realized you
know had had a personal experience of
setting implementation priorities and so
it gave us different perspectives of it
and because our team is distributed
among different locations that I think
it also helped integrate the product
team war but so let's talk about the
interactions between threading and full
drinks so as we said we wanted to show
in a thread that contains messages
previously filed in a folder we wanted
to keep that together in a thread and
yet in our interviews many people say
well I you know wanted to get them out
of my view and so we did this sort of
explained smart design rationale that's
why we tried to distinguish in the
thread which messages had really already
been folded somewhere else through the
pop-up we could do more in this regard
actually but we're trying to distinguish
messages that belongs in some other
folder but are being brought together in
your threaded view we also asked a
question well when you're acting on
things in the milk in the message list
are you acting on the entire thread or
on the most recent message and most
people said that they wanted it to be on
the entire thread for deleting and
folding especially if you're doing kind
of spring cleaning this makes it very
quick and so we do that although we
wanted the scope of the operation that
will pop up in orange and you can click
a box that says you know you don't want
to see that again once you get used to
that model and then tagging and folding
so we were very curious how would people
think about tagging and folding and
there are a couple choices we could
imagine tagging could over time replace
fol during once they got used to it as a
different model
or tagging could complement folding and
and in the interviews people would say
things like you know i would use folders
as nouns but the tags will be adjectives
it'd kind of be subdivisions within a
folder but they want to keep the folder
together in part because many email
clients you know their searches scope by
folder not not recent ones but as a
habit it was easier to keep things in a
large folder but add kind of gradations
through tagging other people said that
they would use tags to connect messages
across folder so if you had folders
according to projects but you had tags
for like summer interns or reports or
patents or other kind of cross project
things that would be another kind of
independent indexing mechanism across
folders and some people just said they
wouldn't use either they would only
search to find things or they would use
unread marks or flags other kind of
subtle mechanisms to find messages so
frankly we've got a very mixed picture
about what users wanted or expected in
terms of tagging and folding so our our
approach so far to support both to allow
both folder and tagging to present clear
models about how they affect messages
but we are wanting to observe how they
interact with tagging and folding over
time and I'll say a little bit more
about how much how far we've gotten
there actually so that's sort of
describing blue meal so far any
questions about the design rationale or
how blue mail works before i go into on
the threads if z by the time you
and thread there's 30 entries little one
is it easy to tell which parts you very
much however quite clear pick up and
then also is since you're kind of top
posting is there a way to immediately
get the context from the bottom up okay
so the question was how our threads if
you get lot many threads how can you
tell which messages are unread and part
of that thread ok so the here's an
example this is a little I i made this
artificial i did read this message from
you but this message says that this
there's one message in bold from
jennifer that i haven't read in this
thread and so we are within a thread and
this is another example again this is
artificial but to make the point this
first message for melissa is in bold and
that says i haven't read it but i'm i'm
looking at the other ones now in terms
of if i look at the most recent message
so here's an example so this is well let
me see if I can get this quickly when
you look at the message you see the show
quoted text we're basically collapsing
embedded replies that are included in
the message assuming that you've already
seen that but if you're in a situation
where you've accumulated a lot of unread
messages if you expand that that can be
an easy way to get at the earlier
messages another question yes
we haven't blue mail hasn't yet explored
that right now we're just doing there's
a there's a cache of names there's a
it's a corporate address book that
autocompletes but we're not doing a
personal address book yep sorry yes yeah
good question okay so the question was
this little tile of an icon and other
attributes we are integrating with the
corporate directory and a corporate a
way that you can tag people so these
actually are tags that are applied to
the person that's in the tat and so and
I want to be clear about that there's
tagging of people and there's tagging of
messages in blue mail and I'll say
they're in the process of being
integrated in terms of how we presented
that into the user interface but we if I
look at a tile I can get their business
card happens with me and more
information about them and click at a
click away and their tiles their tags
and other information so that's
integration with the corporate directory
yes a user test were there any spam
folders coming in from from users own
mail or was that just not part of it
SPAD we're not in blooming of the
question was about spam and blue mail
we're not doing anything additional
about spam so span is being taken care
of at the corporate level and we're not
seeing which automatically gets hurt a
lot of spam and will mark any suspect
messages that are kind of up to the user
decide but we're not doing it in
additional in blue mail itself
that messaging bread know this I've read
this message so this message is actually
my reply to Jennifer and if I scroll
down further okay messages to outside
addresses not IBM don't have the
collapsing that we usually do but these
are down lower are the other messages in
the threads so since I've read this one
already it's collapsed but this one was
with contrived to be not read so it is
actually open down there okay so let's
go back to how we've been using blue
mail to study corporate email practice
so blue mail is instrumented to log its
own usage it captures general how are
people using email as well as features
that are specific to blue mail and at
this time we've deployed it around three
plus months we have I think a diversity
of users for as research prototypes go
so over 7,000 users around 62 countries
here's a geographic visualization
obviously mostly from us but there's a
big contingent in India there's a story
behind that some in Europe some in South
America as well so it's it's a broad
range so here actually is a summary
table of research that's been done on
email studies starting from about 20
years ago the number of people involved
in the study the number of average
folders each user has the number of
average messages in their inbox the
total number of message in the email
store the percentage of their email
that's in the inbox and the percent
that's unread and this is just a summary
of research studies on email that have
been taken over the past 20 years and
we're just going to add our line here
which has an order of magnitude larger
number of people involved in the study
and I would say more diverse a lot of
these previous studies have focused on
research populations and us whereas our
data include a range of job roles within
IBM and companies around the world
countries around the world
so if you look at this there's actually
not very many obvious trends as if
emails going one way in the direction or
the other I think this reflects that
emails very diverse the Jews and it's
sensitive to work culture I mean some
cultures use email in a certain way and
so the status of usage will show up but
I'll just draw a couple to your
attention first of all the number of
messages in your inbox or in your total
email store it's kind of going up our
data is actually on the low end and one
of the reasons why I think that maybe is
that IBM actually has a fairly
aggressive email retention policy about
messages expiring and how much email
quota you can have and frankly more and
more companies are instituting that such
policies and so I think that could
account for the difference in particular
between this study which is done at
microsoft and study that we've been
doing at IBM and one of our points is
that although you may think email is
kind of a pervasive old-school kind of
topic the usage of email is emerging and
evolving over time and things are
changing and so it's important to
continue to collect data and see how
that how the usage changes over time so
you know no clear pattern it's not as if
email is growing or shrinking in terms
of what's in their store and there could
be some factors some policy factors why
that's getting lower the other thing is
the number of folders so again it's not
as if folders are going away even though
we have search technologies have emerged
for finding messages without necessarily
folding them into spit into categories
and so our data suggests that folders
are you know it the average has kind of
gone up and down over time and it's not
clear that it is going away even in the
face of search technologies okay now
being Oh Robin question
right okay so first of all let me
explain blue male uses the very same
email store as our conventional client
so this is not messages they've only
received in blue mail this is there in
fact very few people use blue mail
exclusively they can interchange between
blue mail and notes and their message is
totally synced so so the question was
why do we have so few and it's not
because it's only a small amount it is
their entire email store I think it is
more because of email retention policies
within IBM but again I think that's
becoming more common in the enterprise
setting so I think a trend to pay
attention to in terms of how do we deal
with how to design email clients to
respond to that okay so being a Google I
expect you guys to sneeze at seven
thousand users I'm sure you guys are
collecting you know much larger numbers
of data I'd love to hear more about that
or maybe compare some of those data but
that I am trying to put in perspective
with other published studies on email
research okay so here's one thing we
looked at we you know you probably heard
of frequent filers or spring cleaners or
the no filer designations with an email
and we didn't have a way of categorizing
users but we wanted to get some sense of
how much people are still using folders
okay and so we collect asset istics
about percent of their received mail
that is in a folder so it's received
mail not the messages i send out its its
messages that are in your store not
messages you've deleted so what percent
of them are in a folder versus in your
inbox and we created a histogram in
terms of number of users versus zero to
five percent in over on this left side
of messages folder versus almost all of
them it's a question Robin
right okay so the question was about
whether there is a notion of an archive
there is a notion of an archive that's
outside of blue male so this data does
not reflect messages that have been
archived well okay so but yeah so so are
our notion of archive is not the same as
gmail associative archive so for the
purposes of this data messages either
are in the inbox or in a folder and it's
all all this is searchable via via the
search mechanism now shown right so our
notion the question was about archive
our notion of archive is is really i get
i'm not an Outlook user but it's really
kind of off-site you know preserved by
and it takes an extra step to get access
to it right so this is I think of your
working mail you're working email store
okay so anyone care to guess where the
where how the shape of this data looks
like where are most of the you think
it's high on the zeros presentin goes
down any other guesses the other way you
think it is low on the zero upset okay
so this was surprising to us the biggest
amount of the largest pump is in the
zero to five percent so they're not full
during at all but the second largest is
that almost everything is being folder
and if anything the data is skewed
towards having more messages folded and
it's it's quite you know there's quite a
spread of folding amount of folding
activity so again for our data
population which is an enterprise email
population there's there's data that
shows that there's a lot of folding
still going on and people will mention
at least at IBM that one of the reasons
why they don't use gmail's that they
don't offer folders and it sort of
breaks an email habit
have question just I don't know if you
dug down my level on the data like how
much you can be like the ones who didn't
fold it all away coming up coming up
well uh well partially answer that
question then a little bit ok so I think
an interesting data point in terms of
how do we design email clients that
accommodate users desire to folder and
what are they trying to do when they
folder anyways what you know is it just
get it out of sight or or what ok
another question was how are people
using relatively recently introduced
features an email so the Whittaker
insider work initially mentioned that
you should have a flagging mechanism
that says I want to follow up on this
message in the future but I want to
leave it in my inbox so from our data
almost half people use flagging at all
in in notes so this is this is data that
reflects their usage in notes or blue
mail in any client that they have on
average those people who use flagging
have 17 messages flagged but the median
is four so I suggest that that's skewed
by a lot of high flagging users okay so
the message the question about unread on
average about a quarter of people's
inbox messages are not read or are sorry
our marked as unread but I think this is
an artifact of a recent mechanism of
manually marking messages as unread as
another flagging mechanism and so we did
as it's um a histogram about how much of
your email in your inbox is unread
anyone care to guess about the shape of
this graph looks like no no so we're
only we can only log the unread state of
a message and we can't tell whether it
was manually on anyone care to guess on
what the shape of this state this
it's not bimodal it's mostly a zero to
five percent which I think are people
who are not manipulating unread but
there are some people and we want to dig
into this further I mean is it because
they're keeping their inbox so small
that if they get one unread message it's
95 or hundred percent run red or is it
because they're using it as a to-do list
and they're using on rat as a manual
flag so this is actually data that we've
just been collecting so some of the
digger the deeper digging we like to do
and I can hear gears turning we haven't
done yet but this is as far as we've
gotten it's a question I see I see where
are there other reasons why they're
artificially high so I don't know that
answer I don't know precisely of the
seven thousand users what job roles they
are but we could we could kind of
reverse engineer and trace back for that
information yeah yes question it's a
snapshot if the this is a snapshot of
unreadiness at we do I we do several
snapshots a day we averaged out to one
figure per day and then we average those
two one finger per person and then we
collected over the data side okay so
focusing on what I'm going to call
active blue mail users those that use
blue mail more than twice that's a
smaller set of numb users and we did a
survey why aren't you using blue me or
why did you stop using blue mail and
therefore mainly practical reasons it's
slow performance you guys got a perfect
view of slow performance it requires an
internet intranet login still with an
IBM and people mentioned there are
limited times they use blue mail like if
they're working from home or if they're
traveling or if they're working at
another site or a customer side and that
just doesn't happen every day so they
don't use blue mail all the time but for
the people do use blue mail most people
like threading almost 90 over ninety
percent of its people use the default
threatened mode all the time they never
went into non
known which could be confirmation for
not offering that feature but eight
percent do use non-threaded at least
once perhaps to find specific messages
to tag and as fraction less than 1
percent you work largely in unthreaded
mode and so that that features available
for them don't want to use it we also do
to figure a number that we've been
calling inbox compression so if you take
all your messages and you show them one
at a time and you take that all the
message in your inbox and show it
threaded how much smaller is that what's
the amount of compression thats writing
is giving and on our data it's fourteen
percent which actually with surprise
seems low in terms of what what my
experience does a threading makes it
much easier to deal with my inbox but
the numbers say it's only about fourteen
percent and each entry represents a
little over than one message it could be
the characteristic to you know
notifications or certain kinds of
messages were getting but that's what
the data sane and and yet people like
threading obviously almost universally
tagging on the other hand out of the
1822 act of blue mail users about ten
percent used tagging at all and much
less about 1% use tagging somewhat
persistently more than twice so one of
the things says that at least fol during
is important for our users the other
thing I think it says is that we haven't
highlighted tagging or kind of promoted
tagging enough so I had to point out
that in in this case of blue mail you
know people are just downloading it and
trying it and we're not doing a personal
demo we're not actually we're seating
them in box with a message that is
tagged and explains how to use tagging
but I think we could be doing more in an
interface itself to highlight tagging an
email so this is an area for future work
and could again be confirmation for you
know if you wanted to really promote
tagging maybe you shouldn't offer fall
during if you want to kind of change
people's conceptual model off of that
20 more days ya know so it's actually
yeah the two or more days what does that
mean it's actually it's it's naturally
not a very favorable statistic for us
what it is is a count of tags and seeing
that that count increments over two
successive blue mill uses so does the
count of message it's kind of tags on
day one is it less than account the next
time I use blue mail in other words that
the user has personally applied tags if
right right right so it right if if I
use blue meal for five days and the only
change in tagging is between the first
day and the fifth day we're only
counting one instance of increased
tagging so we're this is this is not a
favorable statistic to us but we wanted
some sense of people actively applying
tags and then I actually thing the
reason why this data is I think Lo is
that conceivably you could delete a
message that had tags on it and replace
it with exactly the same number of tags
and we wouldn't notice a change but it's
a little i think it's i think it's
relatively accurate in that people are
not using tagging as much as we wish or
hope but also i had to point out you
know tagging is a new feature for our
user population so even three months is
not necessarily enough of a time to get
over a learning curve of using tagging
yes
subscribe to oh right so the question is
whether tagging would help a particular
and 20 dozens all right so I can't
comment about whether I can't count I
had just don't have a sense of how
popular those email triaging kind of
techniques are at IBM and certainly I've
heard of people ask that or and I
actually have heard someone say oh blue
males great for helping me do this but I
don't have any sense of how widespread
that is at IBM's I I don't know the
answer to that question okay there's no
clock in this room so finishing up
easing email pain we tried to help deal
with email volume logic through
threading which I think helps manage the
volume of email coming in and dealing
with finding messages so the way that
we're doing threading and foal during
ends up softening the folder boundaries
so it's no longer the case that you put
into folders out of sight and you can't
easily get it you know because we're
threatening across folders you can
actually quickly get access to the
messages even if you put it somewhere
else so that's actually lowers the
barrier for putting things into folders
if if you feel like it's not it's harder
to get to and we're also using threading
to leverage any indexing that you do so
either fold ring or tagging so you might
realize that by by keeping messages
together in threads it helps you
actually suggest where you could folder
things because all these other messages
you've folded in a folder and similarly
tags get inherited across a threat and
so you only have to tag one message and
that index can kind of help you get a
whole collection of messages in the
thread and so far we're exploring
tagging as a complementary indexing
mechanism to fold ring but as I said
it's been slow and uptake in this
particular study given the design that
we have we can continue to it early
refine the design work in blue mail
enhancing tagging one of the areas in
particular we want to look and tagging
is right now if I didn't explain this
tagging is simply your own personal
indexing in other words you only see
tags
you apply and that means that it's not
socially viral which is one of the nice
features of tagging and so we've been
thinking about is there a way in which
we could make tagging socially viral
that is other people and it's weird
because email is a semi-private resource
right but nonetheless you do share
messages with other people and can we
think about sharing tagging across
people that have received that message
so we're looking into ways of doing that
we're going to continue to study how
blue males use we're continuing to
collect a usage data and we are
scheduling a round of interviews with
interactively so the usage data tells us
what people are doing interviews often
tell us why or why not or some of their
reactions and some are our research has
identified some new areas of email pain
not that we've solved the old ones
already but mobile use access to email
the notion that people are accessing
email from an ecology of devices how
should that be reflected in the design
of an email client and worldwide access
so in our case we discovered some people
preferred using blue mail because it
helped deal with some constraints in
certain parts of the world so although
everyone in a global company is expected
to you know process email and respond in
a very timely way it's not the case that
everyone in the world has equal access
to email at least in some global
companies so some people in certain
developing regions may not have as high
of network family connection or they may
not have the same computer platform or
they may even have smaller email
retention policies and it creates
unequal access to email in ways that
show up in terms of well how can we
really support email practice or design
a client that supports that and so
that's one of the possible areas that we
are exploring for future work in the
blue mail work blue mail by being
web-based of course allows you to more
easily translate to a mobile platform
and also more easily translate to
regions in the world which may not have
typical kind of IT or constrained IT
resource resource provisioning
just a quick overview of members of our
team developers that are as i mentioned
located in Argentina as well as in the
East Coast and some other folks that are
involved in science study and a list of
papers that have been published on blue
mail the extended abstracts which I mean
Alice ah and I think led to this visit
that's available on the ACM digital
library and some other works and an
email address to contact me if you have
any more questions especially people who
might be watching this tanja late so
thanks for inviting me and for the
questions and happy to entertain further
questions so all the people that did use
tag the question was the people who use
tags were they also using folders and
it's it's the case none of the people
that we're using tags were in the no
filer category and most of them had a
lot of folded and mail so but the
question still is that makes sense of
the level that people who do tags it
makes sense of people that have a lot of
folders that is they are in a personal
habit of indexing mail would also do
tagging and people that don't have any
folders would would not necessarily even
bother tagging as well they're just
going to rely on search so we saw of
those people we saw a mixture of people
that were some people basically said
over time they expect to only use tags
not folders other people said those
stories about you no folders are the
large containers tags of the smaller
containers or tags I would use to
connect across folders yes I'm still
kind of stuck on that average size of
the threads be so small one point yes it
was the rug
I was the standard deviation for threads
high because that seems surprisingly
small um I don't know offhand and that
is that is an area that we want to
explore further I'm pretty confident
that the numbers correct I mean we are
certainly debugging artist uses
statistics so I think it's correct but
it may be it may be low for other
reasons like we have a statistic about
what percentage of your email store is
singleton messages and I want to
understand whether that's sort of
overwhelming the statistics so I think
you're right I don't think it's a normal
distribution I can't off the top of my
head describe it better at the moment
but that's certainly something we want
explore yes yes so that ability to turn
a scroll ahead to people it's one of the
one that often mentioned favorite
features of blue meal and if we're lucky
it may be one of the features that gets
technology has written to the product
sooner rather than later because people
have appreciated being able to find a
message through orienteering as well as
as well as search so it's a
complementary affordance and people it's
popular among users
yes we do yeah right okay so i'll see
i'll try this sorting by name
automatically puts you in non threaded
mode because if you sort by name and
threaded mode you don't get what you
expect i think so this is sorted
alphabetically including punctuation
marks apparently but it's sort of
individually by name at whereas if you
do let's see if this happens huh and
when you go back into time it doesn't
put you back and threaten mode but I
think it should but it's a default that
threads out just this may not be related
but the slowdowns are seeing what
percent can you ascribe to just what
must be a lot of JavaScript and down
versus the server side okay so where is
the slowness in the performance I
actually first of all I want to repeat
deserve a proof of concept prototype not
optimized for performance I think it's
mainly actually that it is using dojo
and some amount of Ajax and JavaScript
and I actually think the what you're
experiencing maybe the layers of
networking between here and the IBM
firewall so it's not as slow for me in
everyday use even when I'm working from
home although I'm not sure I can explain
exactly why that is so it's it's a
combination of networking and some
heavyweight you know browser coding and
that the code is not optimized for that
to be sure
what are some of the other loved and
hated features let me just think a
little bit about that so think what gets
mentioned most is threading frankly
because the threading in the current the
current client that most people use
dozen hat didn't have 30 until recently
and its implementation of threatening i
think is not the best the other thing
actually is search we do we have a
fundamentally different search approach
than our normal client and it it's kind
of interesting blue mail search focuses
on the header information the sender and
the subject and does not do a full text
search are the notes client actually
does a full text search and i think
because of that it returns things that
are more surprising not what the user
expected so in a sense even though we're
doing a less powerful search or users
actually appreciate it as being more
what they want and then I think the
orientation scrollbar is another i'll
just say another point about search the
way we're doing search actually takes
advantage of the fact that in notes this
is actually all a relational database
store so it's cheaper to search just a
header stand the whole full text in
theirs so it ends up being faster more
what the users expect and more efficient
in terms of network traffic then the i
would say the scrolling the orienteering
preview is in another favorite feature
okay so the least favorite features are
those things that i mentioned about why
they're not using it performance and the
other thing is a policy decision so
right now you have to be within the IBM
internet you can't just go to any
internet kiosk and access lumia so that
actually we're hoping to change its not
a technical limitation I'm trying to
think down my other list
sure nothing too exciting just some
individual housekeeping mark as unread
this is a shell only on red is a
filtering mechanism using a conversation
viewer it shows you what kind of that
that is to do with how message threads
appear whether they appear with the
embedded replies collapsed or not
there's nothing really exciting
elsewhere there's creating new folders
and kind of email features questions yes
yes okay so the question was why not
present a hierarchical tree view of
threads it is that right so in fact iBM
did a very elaborate experiment with
visualizing threads so you may be
familiar with the remail work it was
work that was done in Cambridge and it
had a very elaborate visualizing that
showed the hierarchy of threads and it's
a deliberate choice basically we felt
that the most important aspect of
threading is simply the chronological
reverse chronological order and that the
complexity that the threading viewer
added wasn't our users weren't
appreciating that so it was a
simplifying choice to just rely on
chronology so the question was about
long threads and one of the ways we're
thinking about dealing with that is
allowing people to break threads and
also our threading mechanism it's not
simply reply chain we do some metrics
about it is a list of people the same
did something change and so we are doing
some automatic separating of threads
it's not strictly the reply chain so
we're we're kind of breaking some of
those into different threads
and I think you can say me kid sure
