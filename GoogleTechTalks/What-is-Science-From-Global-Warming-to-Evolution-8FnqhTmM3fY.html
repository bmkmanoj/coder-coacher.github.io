is the president of the singularity
Institute for artificial intelligence
he'll be talking about the Darwinian
method and promoting the singularity
summit which is a two-day event
happening August 14th and 15th there's a
discount for Googlers it's very cool you
should all find out about it and talk
with Michael and here he is hi I'm
Michael Vassar and I wanted to tell you
guys some will share some ideas about
the relationship between science
scholarship and some other things that
you mean to do to try to get the right
answers because um well the singularity
is not really a scientific hypothesis
but I believe it is a national
expectation or rather I think it's three
national expectations
it's the national expectation of sort of
an event horizon that prevents people
from predicting certain features of the
future especially the future beyond
certain point it's a rational
expectation of some types of
accelerating change under certain
circumstances and it's the National
expectation of an intelligence explosion
of radical almost asymptotic positive
intellectual feedback at some point in
the future but I you can learn more
about these specific models from the
singularity summit video by elneus or a
few years ago so basically I suspect a
lot of technical people are skeptical of
the idea that there are rational but non
scientific perspectives
you know people it's easy to have
wishy-washy ooh we should all feel good
there are different ways of knowing but
the fact is there really are different
ways of knowing or else there was no
transition no scientific revolution ever
so you know something does seem to have
changed that makes the modern world
different from the medieval world for
instance but in the ancient world which
I would say is a world without science
you have Roman aqueducts you have Gothic
cathedrals I mean can you believe that
the Goths built that
you know I mean not that we have a slide
right now
they had sailing ships before Ben
Franklin and there's a great essay by
Ben Franklin where he says hey guys we
ought to use science when building ships
so that was a big idea back then but
they had reasonably good ships they
could reliably get across the Atlantic
through basically the evolution of
technology you know small changes
imitated when they worked well and in a
very very noisy manner and of course
market prices are a type of non sign
non-scientific rational process that
many people believe in and that's kind
of popular to believe in among people
who are skeptical of the wishy-washy
Ness of national non scientific
processes so I'm going to say that
surprisingly Darwinian Darwinian
evolution and the belief in
anthropogenic global warming or most of
it are also examples of rational
non-scientific beliefs more generally if
you see a controversy that involves a
scientific side and in a scientific and
a non scientific side the scientific
side is probably usually promoting a
rational but non scientific belief at
least in the narrow sense of scientific
according to which science was invented
four hundred years ago as opposed to
science being something that chimpanzees
or cavemen do so there are also possibly
some scientific but non rational beliefs
paranormal phenomena are a good example
of something which is predicted sort of
by something that kind of that looks a
lot like the scientific method and
confirmed by something like it but which
in fact are not real I don't think I'll
have time to go into why the scientific
method gives the false positive but I
have referred to paranormal as the
control group for science you know like
a control group where you know there's
no I suppose Ebola fact of science
itself another example of a scientific
but irrational belief I would say is
that Western medicine doesn't work at
all when you study in aggregate the
effectiveness of Western medicine all of
the studies say the same thing they say
that it doesn't work
people have looked really carefully at
that but basically you have to be a
complete non non naturalist to believe
it it would require something like a
conservation of Medical Outcomes law and
that that seems so wildly opposed to
these sort of foundations of reality
that the scientific worldview leads us
to believe in that well met Western
medicine could be harmful on that it
seems much more reasonable to look at
the individual studies that show that
individual procedures are beneficial and
be disturbed by the aggregate data but
basically assume that there's something
wrong with the aggregate studies which
tell you what's going on these sorts of
things are basically possible because
people don't really know what science is
and science isn't the process that
generates true truth the process that
generates truth is proper induction or
proper deduction so what is science
before the 17th century Europe was a
backwater of civilization with almost no
cities almost no libraries basically
nothing very impressive except some
really good old civilizations had been
rising and falling for a few thousand
years back to the Indus Valley the
Minoan civilization it's not obvious
that the Minoans didn't get found as far
as the Romans they had running water
they had printing they did large-scale
chip geoengineering projects the the
shot I mean if I had to choose I'd say
some of the Chinese day dynasties are
special especially the Sun or song might
have gotten a hare or farther but
there's basically six of one half dozen
of the other you had a bunch of golden
ages interspersed in a period of mostly
are medieval or sub medieval stem
standard of living and even the golden
ages did not provide what we would
consider a respectable third world
lifestyle today although they probably
provided a better standard of living
than that most of the third world did 40
years ago anyway then something changed
so here's what science isn't our
committees did stuff that look
a lot like science he you know famously
talked about cranes he had laws of
physics he talked about precise
mathematical relationships describing
physical phenomena so he developed new
mathematical notation that allowed him
to talk about this volume of the solar
system and make fairly precise estimates
he talked about how far the Sun and the
moon were and did calculations and
estimates and the a lot of these were
pretty accurate estimates the reasoning
was good
he developed processes like calculus and
did analysis to optimize functions
worked out the ratios of the dimensions
of a cone that would maximize the volume
of a sphere that intersected with the
cone these are nifty sciency things he
was doing engineering the lighthouse of
Pharaohs the legendary cranes and
mirrors that he used but he didn't have
much empiricism and he didn't have much
common sense either you know that's how
he died um so why do I not think it's
science well although he had the rules
of logical argument that allowed him to
reason out the arm whether a statue was
made out of gold or impure pure or
impure gold through the logic of water
displacement he didn't you know this is
the famous eureka story with the city
naked after our figuring this out for
the King of Syracuse he didn't test that
hypothesis after formulating it in fact
he was right but we would normally think
that as a good scientist he should have
done something or advocated something
like creating pure and impure gold
statues or gold objects and
demonstrating differential water
displacement
in a sense you don't need to he could be
pretty sure that he was right without
doing that and in fact he was right but
if you give people free reign to make
logical arguments of the sort that he
was making when he discovered water
displacement you're going to have a lot
of them generating nonsense and then
fighting over it and you're not going to
get anywhere um
no hypothesis-testing there also weren't
any organized to literature or
publication standards
he wasn't citing sources in a formal
manner he wasn't encouraging other
people to cite him in a formal manner
there certainly was no priority rule
that allowed that encouraged people to
share all of their knowledge rather than
only showing knowledge as it came up
we're sharing the results of their
knowledge without sharing the knowledge
itself as a result you had a process
that worked when you have an honest
genius doing it but we're non geniuses
couldn't really contribute progress was
not continual dishonesty was basically
unchecked which meant self-deception was
basically rampant and you couldn't apply
the same method to studying human
behavior at all and you basically
couldn't apply this method to figuring
out anything of economic or policy
importance because once you allowed
people to make arguments like the one
Archimedes was making about water
displacement you'd pretty soon find that
the manufacturer of shoddy Spears had
expert Sophists making similar sounding
arguments saying that you should buy
their Spears instead of the better
Spears that your army was already using
and your country would be overrun by the
Romans so other things that the ancients
had other rational processes that were
not science include naturalistic
explanation the Etruscans supposedly
claimed that thunder was not caused by
the gods but was just the sound of
clouds banging into each other this is
kind of silly sounding but it's silly
sounding in the way that our Piaget
talked about children claiming that the
wind was made by the trees waving their
hands it's there's something right about
it which is not right about saying that
wind is caused by the Zephyrs or by some
bag that lets out the east wind being
opened and the east wind coming out you
know the is the type of explanation that
you're using basically sensory
modalities for visual processing and in
order to evaluate and that you can make
concrete result fairly precise
predictions
another ancient art of rationality is
philosophy nowadays we have continental
and analytic philosophy but basically
they boil down to being careful about
what questions you're asking clarifying
your concepts figuring out what you want
to know what you don't know and where
you should still be curious
craftsmanship is something that looks a
lot like science after the fact but on
but not very similar to science
beforehand people fiddle around with the
ingredients that go into their plans and
they fiddle around with how to build a
suit of armor gradually the suits of
armor that protect the people who are
wearing them survive and the societies
that wear those suits of armor expand
and you end up with better suits of
armor you know this is people's
intuitions guide evolution in this case
and their intuitions are based on a
naive physics that kind of works which
is so it's kind of fast through the
natural selection but it's still pretty
slow occasionally once again you get a
genius who has really good intuitions
and they can you know create art that
won't be reproduced again for ten
thousand years like the people who drew
the cave paintings and lasalle may have
been you know who knows what was really
going on but people have been doing
pretty cool craftsmanship and out
occasionally in a non cumulative manner
for a while
another great non-scientific rational
rationality is exploration go around
look for more data see whether you can
discard your old data if you think all
swans are white and then you go and find
a Black Swan you know that's where the
metaphor comes from if you think that
you know animals come in certain natural
types and then you go to another content
continent and you find similar but not
quite the same species
this is nifty it might inspire the right
you know the right sort of thoughts down
the way I've mentioned markets and they
have their counterpart hierarchies which
are also an epistemic process as as much
as people may not like say the Soviet
system of government it really did work
better than a lynch mob and I'll say
fighting the Nazis and then there's
scholarship which is the subject of my
talk
I'm going to claim that along with the
scientific method there's something that
I'm going to call the scholarly method
it consists roughly of these steps you
look around your population see who's
interested in learning explicit data and
applying it to the real world you have
teachers who are excited and pleased by
finding a new student who sees new
applications for the things that the
teachers are telling them or at least
who sees old applications without being
told you teach those people to notice
their ignorance you ask them questions
where the correct answer is
counterintuitive
and you make them see that the reason to
solve their ignorance is not just to
please their teacher but because they
can actually solve their problems by you
know encouraging them through things
like the Socratic method to ask more
questions you have books lots of them
with a printing press idea I have your
scholars read broadly are guided by
curiosity of basically a childlike sort
they see can write about their life
experiences go out in the world live
with the tacit I live in China notice
violations of the generalizations that
they encountered in their early
childhood it takes a long time to do
this you know if you move into a foreign
culture for a couple years at first
every there will be a lot of strange
interesting things after you've sat
there you know been hanging out there
for six months maybe things have seemed
a lot more normal you think you think
you've kind of got a grip on it
you stay there living in the culture for
another six months things get weird
again you start noticing things not only
are there all sorts of surprises and
cool different things there are things
that are different that you couldn't
have thought could possibly be different
if you've ever really changed core
truths as an adult especially between
the first world and the third world or
between basically Western and Eastern
civilization you know what I'm talking
about here anyway
when people do this and then they talk
about it they write about it and other
people look at it then third parties can
walk or they can look for things that
are being said by many people preferably
surprising things
so you know if one guy says maybe we
should maybe we should try to love
everyone even our enemies in one
cultural tradition and another guy says
something similar in a very different
cultural tradition well they may not be
right but there's at least some
regularity in the world probably that
causes risk-taking broadly experienced
people to make this suggestion so they
might be right it's worth exploring it's
worth trying out and seeing seeing
whether it'll work why does this work
well we've got some rationality built
into us otherwise we could never alone
anything would be you know there's some
truth to the idea of a scientist in a
crib rationality requires induction
which is technically Bayesian inference
or a process that approximates Bayesian
inference and edik deduction in order to
build a map of the world a model which
has structure which is analogous to the
real structure of the world human
children of course do this they gather
redundant data sets so the same kid
wants to watch the same movie or see
your the same song over and over again
this this makes being a parent kind of
annoying in some ways because you have
to sing we will read the same story over
and over but it's aw neat because it's
not really the same story to your kid
you've you're discarding a huge amount
of detail they don't know yet what
detail to dis code so they love having
that's what looks to you like the same
thing in front of them over and over so
they can see what stays the same and not
noticing the the different pipes that
don't stay the same since kids hang out
with other kids as well as thought they
can average together their behaviors
imitate one another
and eliminate the errors that they make
in their naive induction that way as the
UM as the children develop better models
of the world models that make fewer
errors they can reallocate their effort
from building models being curious to
actually doing stuff seeking pursuing
goals and does that happens there they
are start learning so much each person
has a lot less three
sources than a society so the optimal
amount for a person to learn is a lot
less than the optimal amount for society
to learn scholarship is basically a way
of making super children a part of
society that can learn like a trial does
only moreso gathering information from
more varied data sets
perceiving weaker patterns etc the
diverse experiments in different
cultures cultivating awareness of your
supplies so that you don't just discard
good data all of these things maintain a
level of uncertainty about what's going
on which is maladaptive for an
individual hope you know a society can
make that uncertainty adaptive by
directly rewarding it basically you have
to subsidize people to notice their
ignorance because it's not all useful if
you admit to being ignorant for your
startup plans you will never ever get
funding even though of course everyone
is ignorant of their startup plans
anyway when cultivating scholar society
gets to use better than average brains
and buy better than average I don't mean
a surly brains that work better
I can mean brains that have better than
average pattern recognition so you can
basically use your madmen which a lot of
ancient societies do pay special
attention to the things that they say
and see if you can make any sense out of
them type two errors can be canceled out
more thoroughly by the data collected by
society of a million people then by the
data that you can collect as a child in
a tribe of 100 people and so if your
type two errors you're false positives
can get canceled out more easily
it's collectively better to make more of
them so you can have use overconfident
people who might once again be somewhat
dysfunctional sorry I mean type 1 errors
um anyway what goes wrong with
scholarship why isn't the super child
solution they are adequate solution to
the problem of knowledge well one
problem is that errors become correlated
scholarship needs to cancel out these
type 2 errors by allowing people to
develop their diff
beliefs independently of one another but
remember we're talking about the kids
who are best at learning most
enthusiastic about using models and once
they get into contact with one another
when they have universities and the
internet then they can all go around
copying one another and and multiple
people saying the same thing even
however smart the people are stops
mapping onto reality stops being strong
evidence another problem with the
scholarly method is that it has a bias
toward surprising theories you know if
you think that the earth goes around the
Sun that could be because it does which
is really weird or it could be because
you just think random crazy stuff and if
you have enough scholars in your
community they're going to start
thinking the same random crazy stuff
just at random and then you're going to
end up with basically anti induction
where you display your wisdom they
display the fact that you're like a
scholar by saying all sorts of random
stuff that is the opposite of intuition
I think that we sometimes see this as a
problem in politics that one of the
reasons why the light tends to distrust
the left is that they suspect them of
reversing morality in order to show how
wise they are it's not the only problem
in politics not even closed but I do
think that this happens there's a
tendency for scholars to come up with
the same wisdom and say it but still be
unintelligible you know if you need very
unusual pattern recognition to notice
something you might notice it and talk
about it and even be able to display
that you know know something special by
doing things that other people can't do
and yet you just babble cliches when you
ask you know I say I know that I know
nothing well okay what do you mean by
that
you know um I know what he means but I
think most people who are listening to
him are just going to ignore it they'll
just hear another cliche and go on and
finally there are the standard biases
that affect human cognition and those
don't cancel out however many children
you have gathering the data there's a
whole literature on human bias and I
can't go into it in a great deal of
detail right now but it's been really
popular as
since the financial crisis in
association with behavioral economics so
what was new in the 17th century what
was different about science one really
big deal was radical skepticism the
Greeks fiddled around without a lid or
there was a philosophical school called
the sceptics but in a sense they didn't
have the radical skepticism that
Christians had of trying to claim you
doubt doubted everything Ducote really
was doing something novel when he
claimed that he was going to discover
God by doubting everything and he was
doing it because he thought it was
really important to figure out things
that were exactly true one of the
surprising positives of dogmatic
Hellfire Christianity is that the subtle
surprising different you know
consequences of counterintuitive
you know differences might really matter
a lot you know if you don't see any easy
way to tell difference between one
Catholic heresy and another but you
actually think that you're going to burn
forever if you don't get the answer
right it might be a good method to try
not believing anything until you see
what you can't escape from believing and
see whether you can get the right answer
that way so I think that that's a big
part of why science emerged the another
thing so what was enlightenment science
basically you try to discard all the
beliefs that you can get away with
discarding and then you make really long
logical chains and work for surprising
consequences of the beliefs that you
can't easily discard and you see whether
these beliefs that you can't easily
discard have surprising consequences
eventually if they do you can test the
surprising consequences and the
surprising consequences can serve as a
proxy for the beliefs themselves if you
find that the surprising consequences
don't hold up then you have to examine
your your reasoning process if ever more
carefully if you find that the
surprising consequences do let hold off
wow you figured out something pretty
cool you know like parabolic motion is a
surprising logical consequence of
well not naive physics exactly but if
you strip down the assumptions in naive
physics if you discard everything about
Aristotle's physics about your
intuitions about the physical world and
look for things that you can't easily
doubt you end up with some simple
assumptions and then if you extrapolate
work out the logic from those you get
things like parabolic motion anyway
if you um if you do this method this
method of extreme doubt you don't need
to be a genius like Archimedes to do
something that looks like science
because you're not doing something that
looks like science you're doing science
and science works with non geniuses
that's what's really special about it
so I talked about this enlightenment
science he basically worked until 1905
when you had some assumptions that were
basically not dis codable and had to be
pretty much transformed into math in
order to discard them rather than you
know that gave better results than the
along inferential chains that come from
dis coding all of the assumptions that
you can dis code I'm going to say 1905
because although Newton and Goethe were
disagreeing not go - go go go - I don't
I can't pronounce his name the guy who
wrote Faust untill Newton and and that
guy uh although they disagreed about
whether light was a particle or a wave
and Scala was following them disagreed
the scale goes basically disagreed
because they weren't following the
method properly you know there was
enough data to discard the wave theory
of light and there was also enough data
to discard the particle theory and it's
pretty easy to discard the idea that
light is a wave and to discard the idea
that light is a protocol coming up with
the idea of a probability function or
probability amplitude that's not easy
but just just coding those two two ideas
and saying well light I don't know what
light is but it seems kind of like a
wave in some ways and kind of like
particle and others people should have
done that earlier that if they were you
know following the scientific method
well and falsifying hypotheses another
thing that enlightenment science did was
for
an intellectual justification for
liberalism Locke didn't invent the idea
that people should be allowed to do
things unless there's a good reason not
to let them do them he discovered that
the Netherlands actually worked with
that idea he didn't know why that idea
worked
he didn't know whether it only worked in
the Netherlands or whether it would work
elsewhere I'm not actually convinced
that it did work elsewhere I think it
worked very well on the American
frontier and I think it worked well in
the Netherlands because in a weird way
the Netherlands was a frontier it was a
swamp and when you mixed your land with
wit mixed land with labour in a swamp
you're actually turning something
previously worthless and abundant into
something valuable because there's just
it just takes so much work to turn a
swamp useful and it becomes so useful
once you do it and it takes so much
maintenance to maintain swamp that
really start separating people from the
land that they mix with their labor just
destroys value which provided the
netherlands with a sort of 17th century
neutron bomb or hydrogen bomb they could
armed they didn't have mutually assured
destruction but they had self assured
destruction
that allowed them to protect themselves
against military threats and preserve
their property rights anyway why does
the Enlightenment science sometimes fail
the simplest reason as I say is that
sometimes these assumptions that you
can't discard that seem necessary are
actually false but this wasn't a problem
until much later the other reason is
that it's easy to imitate the form of
enlightenment science in order to
justify whatever you want to believe
anyway this is more common when you
assume that you have to believe that you
can't discard ethical or epistemic rules
than it is when you claim you can't
discard ontologies and so and you
usually claim you can't disco it up with
ethical or epistemic rules in social
domains so the enlightenment science
ended up being used to justify
liberalism as I talked about with mark
some examples of hell or that you
insists that humans have free will
because the ethical consequences of
people not having free will would be
disastrous without actually examining
whether the ethical consequences of
abandoning free will are actually
disastrous you're claiming that you
can't drop an assumption without really
trying very hard anyway sometimes this
leads to event eventual blatant conflict
with visible reality especially if
you're not careful about your
definitions so you can claim that humans
are not physical material systems
because you're assuming that physical
material systems can't have free will
and humans can anyway another place
enlightenment science fails is when you
have a single point of failure the
cliche scientist who asked who wants to
ask questions and explore thoughts that
no man was meant to know who sees a
button in a Star Destroyer and says I
wonder what this button does you know
science enlightenment science fails if
you have to test things and the test is
potentially lethal or disastrous you
know so at some point ordinary
old-fashioned ancient world logic is
necessary to be rational because you
have to do cost-benefit analysis for
your epistemic tools themselves and
sometimes enlightening science fails
that cut so let's talk about scholarship
and how it relates to science by the
middle of the 19th century people had
factories powered by steam that could
produce goods really cheaply they had
much cheaper steel they had all sorts of
great ways of producing that allowed
industrial labourers to out-compete
crafts laborers that enabled people to
make what seemed like strong logical
chains of inference that showed that the
world was a much much better place than
it had been in the past people could
claim that everyone was much richer this
wasn't inconsistent with the casual
reality that non scholars knew because
non scholars don't know anything about
the past I can remember watching movies
set in the past as a child and sing
architecture and affluence in people
that were supposedly said hundreds of
years ago and
no this is silly there's been so much
economic growth in those past few
hundred years there's no way that people
could live that well but as I can't get
gathered more data I found out that no
in fact people did have those houses and
hundreds of years ago and relatively
ordinary people not just aristocrats a
lot of the time you know the UM non
scholars who have been following the
scientific method and making these long
analytic trains just don't know that
much about the past from highly varied
sources don't know that much from varied
domains and so the conclusions of these
analytic trains may not may seem
consistent with reality to them follows
while scholars who have more data can
just say no that's wrong I know it's
wrong I've seen it well I've read 50
books by different people who did see it
and who had no agenda and they all said
something different okay here's an
example of the Enlightenment thing
falling apart are jean-jacques Rousseau
and Ben Franklin both were scholars as
well as being in Franklin's case an
excellent scientist they both
independently observed that by the
self-interest and freewill assumption of
the Enlightenment savages were better
off on average than civilized people you
know if you can infer people's
self-interest by their choices Savage is
basically never chose to move and live
in civilization while civilized people
very often once they became exposed to
primitive cultures went native this is a
big surprise and there's a you know
biologic this is basically a
falsification of the Enlightenment claim
but if you're playing by the not the
rules of logic but the rules have
enlightenment science that's a chain of
inference that you know multi-step
argument and you can't follow a
multi-step argument without an actual
empirical test so people like Rousseau
reap surprising conclusions that were
obvious by the rules they were playing
according to but weren't acquainted with
the rules that they were breaking when
they reached those arguments
and so weren't able to communicate their
positions if they'd been able to
communicate them more carefully people
would have looked harder if they'd been
better philosophers and if the people
they'd been arguing with had been better
philosophers I'm philosophers basically
are good at noticing what they don't
know what they're not clear about and
non philosophers are much better at
noticing what they do know but they are
clear about what they're no longer
confused about to say it this different
difference tends to make non
philosophers distrust philosophers a lot
but sometimes the philosophers are
useful so basically by very early in the
18th century we had a fairly severe
falsification of a major part of
liberalism the pen Gaussian view of
permanent progress a philosopher could
have looked harder broken down the logic
figured out that that Malthusian issues
were a problem that enlightenment
technology for technology early modern
technology made event allowed much
larger populations and so while the
median person in colonial America was
worse off than the median Native
American the enth best-off colonial
American was better off than the enth
best Native American by a lot and then
there was a huge surplus of excess
when you establish that correspondence
there were huge surplus colonial
Americans left over who didn't
correspond to any Native Americans and
who were transferring into the Native
American lifestyle because there were
niches available there was a unoccupied
Anoosh basically because smallpox and
other diseases had left the population
not decimated reduced by 1/10 but you
know Navas decimated produced by
nine-tenths so they also didn't you know
that logic though bizarrely wasn't
noticed until as far as I can tell
pirate discovered it in 1984 which shows
how very good philosophy is you know
this was a really important discovery
that could have I think basically
prevented both world wars communism and
essentially most of what's gone wrong in
the last 200 years but it took an extra
200 years because when people need good
philosophical insight they don't usually
come up with it they get more intense
and more energetic and the best lack all
conviction the worst are filled with
passionate intensity and the only way to
figure things out is by shedding blood
and seeing who's left standing um anyway
Franklin stayed with the Enlightenment
he said well this is an anomaly
eventually this land will all be
populated
I still believe Rousseau cut you know
went with scholarship against science
cut with the establishment and denounced
it this is basically a fundamental
schism that's haunted us to this day I
guess the next major player in the Indus
Alinea jiz Hegel who talked about these
divides going back and forth and became
the intellectual foundation of both
Nazism and Marxism okay Marx of course
saw the Enlightenment claiming that the
workers were better off saw them dying
by fires been ground up by machines uh
this treaty let know these people just
couldn't possibly be better off than
anyone the people in Ireland you know
that Angus all and he came to the
conclusion looking at what scientists
were saying that the elite were defining
beliefs that were in their interest as
scientific fact rather than using a
rational process of inquiry he concluded
that rational inquiry just wasn't
something that people collectively did
although individual scholars like him
were assumed to be able to do it I guess
the next step from there is to assume
that no one can do it and that there is
no rational inquiry post-modernism
reality is up for grabs a basic problem
with Marxist approach is that while he's
discarding science he's also discarding
the ancient laws of logic and discourse
once you start saying go not trying to
reach the truth to your ideological
opponents there's no more everything
breaks down you stop having intellectual
progress and everything polarizes into
passionate aggressive ideologues
so we still don't have a good solution
to that problem basically one of the
great modern examples of this is
feminism the in light in logic of the
Enlightenment is that we have a group of
people who are a a majority B they have
the vote and C they're oppressed well
that doesn't work if if people are
self-interested in rational well if you
can't tell the difference between their
behavior and their interests you can't
have a group of people who are the
majority and have the vote and are also
oppressed so biologic women don't what
are women complaining about but a
reasonably good scholar or someone who
goes around and pays attention in life
can notice that there is also some
really important ways in which women are
still mistreated by the modern world and
have some sort of a if you choose a
force consciousness and basically you
need to make sense of the fact that well
we've got a problem here but when you
try to do that you have to discard the
Enlightenment and logical rules or you
don't have to but people in fact always
do and as a result you end up with an
anything-goes intellectual bad or where
no progress gets made here's an example
of scholarship years of scholarship
serving science I've been talking before
about where scholarship and science have
come into conflict but sometimes
scholarship can work for science if
rather than using a long chain of
inference from sound assumptions to
generate your hypotheses you just use
scholars to generate your hypotheses and
then you test them that would be
basically post enlightenment science and
the main problem with it is that it's
not intellectually rigorous scientists
don't generally recognize that scholars
exist and think that and tend to think
that they have no legitimacy as
scientists so they're not prone to
testing their hypotheses you can though
do this you I mean pretty much
scientific progress are on a large scale
basically
he comes from there you you know you
have revolutionary science where someone
proposes hypotheses can't justify their
hypotheses still suggests testing and
from Allah it works
the armed liberalism is a mixed case you
start out with unprecedented positive
outcomes from the approximate
implementation of scholarship and
science working together Locke
looks at the Netherlands which is a
weird exotic place if you're a Scotsman
in the 17th century comes up with a
scholarly hypothesis liberalism works
comes up with a way of creating simple
assumptions human self-interest rule of
war fear of God and justifying how
liberalism would work and in fact voila
they tested in liberalism works in
Scotland and on the American frontier
but but because it's really not founded
on inescapable assumptions it turns out
to be not a uniformly correct hypothesis
and ultimately liberalism melted down as
I've discussed earlier the best example
I can think of of scholarship working
well with science is Darwin and Wallace
hence the name of this essay basically
evolution was a pure scholarly
hypothesis net Darwin was pretty much
the best naturalist in the world he
traveled all over the world talk to
everyone who knew anything about living
things had all sorts of long scholarly
discourses with exchanges of letters
then you can walk into and see today and
other people had also done this and a
lot of people had come together to agree
that evolution happened Darwin went a
step further and said came to the
conclusion that animal breeding was as
far as he could tell of unlimited power
that in enough time you could read
anything into anything and that was the
theory of evolution by natural selection
natural selection is just
logical argument if you have
differential reproduction and finite
carrying capacity then you're going to
have a change in your higher-level
traits over time what we're doing here
is confirming a scholarly hypothesis
with a logical argument that's the same
thing that Locke was doing with
liberalism but here we're doing it with
much a much sounder logical argument
rather than assuming free will and
self-interest we're assuming
differential reproduction and it really
is hard to not assume differential
reproduction and in addition you've got
a great scholarly argument tacked on top
because Wallace and Darwin came off with
the exact same hypothesis although later
Wallace deluded it down and added metric
which is kind of a shame the thing is as
good a Scot as it is as both the
scholarly argument and as a scientific
argument it's not a good example of
enlightenment scholarship enlightenment
science the theory of evolution makes
some very broad hypotheses but it
doesn't make precise surprising
hypotheses elite in Darwin's day I
didn't
there were precise surprising
discoveries that strengthened the theory
of evolution and logically that's almost
as good as making a precise surprising
hypothesis namely namely the fact that
the theory of evolution doesn't work
without Mendelian genetics and Darwin
kind of knew that and then Mendelian
genetics was discovered so this is a
solid and argument as we can make but
it's still doesn't quite check all your
dot check all your boxes dot all your
i's and cross all your T's as an example
of enlightenment science and that makes
it harder to win and win conclusively in
arguments about it another good example
of this is global warming we have a
scholarly hypothesis of environmentalism
it really looks like humans are doing a
lot of stuff out there and it has a lot
of unintended consequences they're not
measuring all of those consequences
they're not measuring their costs
there's no reason to expect the costs to
be low and there's a reason to expect
that given the scale on which people are
acting there should be big
changes in general since biological and
cultural systems are optimized adapted
for some particular environment big
changes are likely to be bad therefore
we should be worried about big
unexpected changes then we have the
logical argument that carbon has such
and such a absorption spectrum and
therefore captures heat and because
ecosystems are complicated we don't know
what the consequences of that heat
capture might be this is a really strong
logical argument but once again it's not
making because it's saying we don't know
but the consequences might be since the
whole essence of environmentalism in a
sense is unexpected consequences are a
problem it's very difficult to confirm
environmentalism it doesn't qualify as
enlightenment science and if people have
a narrow conception of science they can
say you're not making specific
predictions when it does inspire a lot
of very good data gathering and when
people gather the data the data seems to
actually exceed the predictions and
exceed it by a lot with respect to
global warming the world seems to be
getting hotter and glaciers melting
faster then the predictions say for then
but that's still not really a good
example of enlightenment science it's
just a good example of a really good
reason to believe something um finally
my topic the singularity here we have
the independent origin of very similar
hypotheses by john von neumann in around
1956 in a letter to send slalom and by
throne revenge in an essay in 1991 both
of them talked about new systems for
thinking causing it to be impossible to
predict to understand what the world
will be alike
once these new systems become mature we
have a logical argument i j good talks
about l think if thinking is done by
material systems and thinking allows you
to figure out what sorts of material
systems think well and how to build them
there should be a explosive feedback
loop once you get material systems that
are
thinking we have a lot of inductive data
the earliest bit is by Georgian Orwell
right back in the early 20th century the
most popular and well-known is cursed by
Vickers while some of the most thorough
is by Bella Nagi but a lot of data
showing exponential or super exponential
progress from our engineering and
scientific development of technology and
finally you have as a scholarly fact
again the by n by a very large number of
credible people with good credentials as
you can see at the singularity summits
in the past if you go online and see our
videos or as you can see at current
summits if you want to listen to the
talks there anyway
as a result I would hold that the
singularity is a valid rational non
scientific hypothesis and given the
scope of the argument deserves to be
taken very seriously and that's why I am
here thank you very much
questions yes I had was the Cambrian
explosions that so there's like likely
there's a lot of data to support
I don't know happen I suppose is that
you know can you consume that as a
singularity has it does it prove that
this thing and happen in the past and
you know thereby you know you morally
credence to this I would say that a
history of large changes in the history
of life in the past provides some
inductive evidence that there are
allowed to changes in the future of the
history of life as well and that
falsifies is suppose it the naive
assumption that there will never be any
really big changes in the future but it
doesn't give us any particular reason to
expect the types of changes that
advocates of the singularity are arguing
for just that it just gives us a reason
to weaken or strong fire against big
changes does that make sense
basically extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence I would say there
is extraordinary evidence for the
singularity but the Cambrian explosion
is mostly just extraordinary evidence
that extraordinary claims are sometimes
true it's very strong evidence that
truly extraordinary claims are sometimes
true because before the Cambrian you
would just have given zero chance
naively to change that big if you knew
the history of earth up to that point
but but it's not evidence for the
singularity in particular is just
evidence that we should be much less
confident than we tend to be that things
will always be more or less the way they
are today
okay I mean my next question was so what
is the nature of the singularity that is
to come so how is that to be I mean like
do you have any like detective like
reason to suppose that okay this is the
way I touched on three different
singularity hypotheses that are quite
related all involve greater intelligence
one involves positive feedback loops
from greater than human intelligence
redesigning itself in faster and faster
timescales presumably one involves just
the different difficulty of knowing what
greater than human intelligence will do
and the fact and induction from the fact
that human intelligence completely
changed the world through the conclusion
that greater than human intelligence is
also likely to completely change the
world and the third is just the
observation that if certain trends
continue to accelerate and there's a lot
of reason from induction from history to
think that many of these trends will
continue the consequences are likely to
be big ok thanks anyone else
any questions from the remote sites
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
