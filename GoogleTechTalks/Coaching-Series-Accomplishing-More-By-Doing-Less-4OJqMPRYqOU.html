out of your busy days to come and see if
we could accomplish more by do less this
afternoon I want to start with a couple
minutes of sitting quietly so I would
ask that everyone put everything away if
you'll bear with me and let's just begin
by arriving here in the room and see I
suggest keeping your eyes open just
looking down and to start by taking a
couple of deep breaths just being here
notice that breathing happens even at
work even here at Google breathing body
where we're all here in our bodies and
just take a quick check in with yourself
where notice gravity keeping you in your
seat feet on the floor
just let yourself feel your heart
beating the flow of energy going through
you
great let's all let's all come on back
thank you for 60 seconds a 60 second
meditation you know this reminds me I I
once was asked to facilitate a retreat
of CEOs who came in from all around the
country who were in a particular they
were in an organization that was trying
to make some really difficult strategic
decisions and I came in during the
middle of this three-day retreat and I
was asked to do to lead a couple hour
session and as I was walking in someone
pulled me aside and said things are
going really badly here there's a
there's a lot of disagreement about the
strategy they just fired the last
facilitator welcome that was my my
introduction and I came in and I I said
we're gonna do 15 minutes of meditation
and I could see about a third of these
CEOs came racing up to the front of the
room and sat down another third and
we're willing to go along and and I
could see I had their attention and a
third of them were in the back with
their arms like that and we sat together
for about 15 minutes and I could see it
the room the room changed a little bit
but then I got them into small groups
and at groups of four and gave them
detailed instructions about talking to
each other and listening to each other
and asked that they each talk about why
they were here on the planet and what
their mission was and and how they were
doing with his mission and if they
weren't doing so good what they were
gonna do about it
and they really I was surprised how much
this this group entered into that
process and about an hour later after
they all I may I went over some groups
people were crying and people were real
they really got into this like why are
you here on the planet question became
in that moment a really meaningful
question
and people came back and there was just
a complete complete shift in the energy
in the room and even the people who had
been sitting in the back like this were
actually I could see they were somewhat
relaxed they were their arms were down
their faces had changed and then I left
I walked I walked out of the room and
people told me that they the rest of the
retreat went really really well
and that they needed to do that at the
beginning that that's what the missing
piece was that they hadn't connected to
each other that they they just thought
they were just gonna completely go and
make things happen well I want to
introduce myself I'm mark lesser and I'm
the founder and CEO of a coaching and
consulting company called zba associates
and the name of the company it's named
after a book that I wrote called zba Zen
of Business Administration that was
published a few years ago by new world
library and it's really about my my
attempts to integrate Zen practice and
business practice which has really been
kind of my my life purpose and and
mission
I took a a one-year leave of absence
from Rutgers and came you know in New
Jersey came to the west coast and then
spent 10 years living at the San
Francisco Zen Center and during my
during my tenth year I was director of a
monastery and resort called Tassajara
down sounds like some of you are
familiar with Tassajara and I I
surprised myself by waking up one
morning this was my 10th year of Zen
Center I was running Tassajara and I
realized that though I thought I was a
Zen monk that actually I was running a
business and and I I loved the two
things and the two things seemed not
only not to be in conflict with each
other but there were tremendous
synchronicities and so of course from
there I proceeded to go to business
school I got an MBA degree at New York
University
and came back and then spent about 15
years starting running and growing a
greeting card and calendar company
called brush dance and since I for 15
years I was a I felt like a big part of
my job was I was a professional boat
collector I thought I would kind of
start this this talk with a quote which
is this is actually a quote from a
friend of Mines book and the quote says
industrious people create Industry lazy
people build civilization right
industrious people create industry lazy
people create civilization and a little
bit of context what I mean by laziness
this particular person who said this is
currently he's in the middle of about
five different books he's one of the
world's most leading translators
calligraphers writers of translating
Buddhist texts and he does workshops he
travels around the world but yet there's
something there's something in his way
that he he really exemplifies for me
this whole notion of accomplishing more
by doing less there's a kind of real
ease and relaxed nough stew in his in
his way of being yes so these images I
was thinking of in a way right even the
word the word lazy and the word in
industrious brings up a sense of imagery
you know and we all we all are in a way
we all are our stories we all are the
images that we that we tell ourselves
about who we are and what we're doing
and usually we don't make those you know
we don't make those images so clear or
apparent and yet those images and ideas
kind of drive us for example I was with
a coaching client the other day and this
woman started off by saying I've got a
horrendous day tomorrow I've got a 7:30
a.m.
this was I was on the phone with her in
Los Angeles and she was describing from
one meeting to another to another and
and I I just kind of stopped her and
said so it sounds like you are planning
on a horrendous day tomorrow could could
you perhaps would it be possible to
change that story like what like I mean
you might you might have to cancel one
of those meetings like that one meeting
that ends at 8:00 and you're going to be
across LA at 8:30 for another meeting
you're just completely setting yourself
up for horrendous day is that is that
really your plan that's the that's the
story that I that I hear you telling and
the image that I I suggested that maybe
she try some other images for example
there's the image one of the images I
like a lot is the image of a river and
seeing your life more like more like a
river and that your job your job in that
image is that you're like steering a
boat on a river and deciding when you
want to be in the deep currents when you
want to move quickly and when you need
to move more slowly
maybe when when you need to kind of
Eddie out when it's time to to rest the
other another image is I think
businesspeople can learn a lot from
athletes and I'll talk a little bit
about some of the some of the
similarities that I see and some of the
ways that are useful from athletics and
business I I was this was actually
something that really got me on this
this path this self-awareness path and
spiritual path was one of the first
things that brought me was I was captain
of my high school wrestling team back in
Colonia New Jersey and one of the things
that I noticed was that good wrestlers
seemed to they were really strong and
quick and they put a tremendous amount
of effort into what they did but the the
best wrestlers there is something there
was something that I was trying to
understand about that the wrestlers that
were the state champions
there was some things odd or so they
didn't seem
to care about winning and losing there
is a way in which there was an
effortlessness and another image around
athletes is that you know like I think
about tennis players there that you know
tennis players play really really hard
during points but in between points they
they have a way of resting in fact the
the top tennis players it's been shown
that they actually lower their heart
rates by 15 or 20 percent in between in
that 15 or 20 seconds in between points
whereas most people in business don't
see don't see that there's any need to
take any kind of rest at all people in
business think that they can just go
full-out all the time and this this I
think has proven to be very unproductive
so one one way to one very easy way to
accomplish more by doing less is to find
ways to oscillate your energy and stress
level during the day so I I don't think
stress is a bad thing but constant
stress is is a bad thing not only for
your health but also for productivity I
want to talk about well there's you know
my my assumption is that you know that
we're we're born into this world to
accomplish things and that our bodies
and minds come pre-installed with
amazing equipment not only for abilities
like language mathematics science but
also we're born with the ability to read
the energy of other people to feel the
joy and pain of others know laughter is
actually contagious focus and energy are
contagious innovation and creativity are
contagious and also fear narrow and
narrow mindedness are also contagious so
one one way that I think about framing
this talk and this idea of accomplishing
more by doing less it's about how
how to be a warm-hearted effective
leader a warm-hearted effective leader
that this is really how we can
accomplish the most because everything
we do is always with always with other
people
very high-tech but this is this is a
model that that I want to talk about and
you know it doesn't matter if you can't
read it I'll I'll describe it pretty
fully but this this is a model that I
think of as a way these are these are
all about ways ways to do less and
accomplish more and so this this bottom
this bottom rung so this this is
something that goes from the bottom up
and you can see there's more more space
here on the bottom so the first the
first layer on this rung says awareness
and meaning and I would add love to that
awareness meaning and and love and and
in order to be aware and in order to
find meaning it isn't about adding
something it's about not complaining
it's about not comparing it's about not
diffusing your energy by making up all
kinds of stories about who you are and
what you know but it's about finding
some ways to drop down into into just
being aware like just appreciating your
breath so this is this is one of the
reasons why I think a meditation
practice and mindfulness practice and
ways of stopping and slowing down are so
important in our day to day lives
because it it it's a way to bring that
awareness appreciation meaning and and
love into into our lives and I think the
the story that I told about working
facilitating that meeting of CEOs what
shifted it was bringing bringing people
down into their own awareness level and
suddenly and and talking very
specifically about meaning right I asked
them why are why are you here on this
planet what you know what what are you
meant to be do
and how are you doing it so it dropped
it dropped them into a sense of meaning
and again it didn't feel like it was
about it wasn't like they needed to add
something they were all they were
already into all this noise so it's
about somehow stopping the noise and
dropping down so it was really taking a
what taking away the noise level drops
you down into a sense of meaning and
appreciation and then the next the next
level up is is about working with other
people is about trust and resonance it's
about how how we you know I mentioned
earlier that we that were born with this
ability to read other people's energy
and how contagious all of these
different feelings and emotions are and
and again it's not a it's it's not about
having to add those that having to
figure out things that we do it's
somehow taking away all of the the extra
noise and ideas that we've added on that
have covered up this very natural very
powerful ability that we have being
quiet enough to notice I mean I think
when you walk into a room you can feel
you can feel the energy you can feel
what the energy is and you're and the
way the way you are the way you show up
will will impact that energy in the room
the way you are like even seeing the
know when you're with another person and
having the conversation with another
person what's what's the space in
between you and this other person doing
is it is it separating you or is it
connecting you what's what's the body
language telling you how are how are you
being how are you being as a leader are
you helping other people to feel their
own sense of ability and power enjoy or
you somehow dampening or or blocking and
just really being aware more and more
aware of of letting go of the things
that cover-up your ability to be a real
a manager with trust and resonance
the third the third level up is about
developing vision and clarity and what
you do vision and clarity and one and
again this is this is about you know
this doesn't have to be effortful one
example that I think of and this is also
from this is from athletics also and
this is very specifically about the
practice of envisioning being clear
about what it is you you want to
accomplish what it is you want to do
this particular example is about a an
Olympic diving champion who just before
the Olympics she broke her foot
somehow practicing and it was it was
assumed that there'd be no way that she
could compete competitively because she
wouldn't be able to practice but she
with her coach developed a way to
practice her diving in her mind she
practiced over and over again just
envisioning what these dives were how
she was gonna do it and she went on to
pull up a tremendous upset and win the
gold medal in the Olympics and there's
real power to actually letting yourself
think about and imagine what what is it
you know what is it that you what is it
that you want to accomplish what what
actually is it and to envision it and
see you know what are the steps that you
need to get there what is the this is
about you know developing a life plan
developing a business plan and and again
for most of us we get we get so wrapped
up in being responding to everything
it's a little bit like I mean this this
piece here is a little bit like you know
making sure that you spend more time
doing things that are important and not
always you know acting in that in that
urgency quadrant of this is dropping
down and knowing having a vision of what
it is you want to do
routines and structure is is what I have
as the as the the next part of this this
graph and you know in a way this
routines in structure there's some very
what I think of very obvious things that
fit in this category I would put a daily
meditation practice in as a routine you
know it might mean that you have to
replace the Starbucks routine or you
know it's me or maybe a little you know
a little lesson both or maybe every
other day a meditation practice a you
know 30 minutes of exercise and some
kind some kind of some kind of routine
about about actually getting exercise
journal writing I would put in as a
terrific routine and and you know
structure structures are really
important a really important point in as
a way you know of doing less and
allowing yourself to accomplish more I
mean one of the things about a route
that I like about this word routine and
this idea of routine is that once you
establish it it doesn't require any
doing at all like I don't have to think
I don't have to think about where I'm
gonna be at 6:30 in the morning I know
I'm going to be sitting in my office on
the cushion I don't have to think about
it it's really it's actually really
quite a relief to have that kind of
routine and I don't have to think about
exercise so much because I have it on my
schedule and when it says it's time to
go for a walk I go for a walk it's
pretty nice in a an example I think of
this was a this was a CEO of a small
media company that I was coaching and
somehow I could see that he was this was
he was in a high growth phase and he was
feeling a lot of stress and I could see
I could see that a lot of his stress had
to do with his cash flow and his cash
situation in this business and I asked
him how he measured cash flow and he
said oh I
measure my cash flow by how much my
chest hurts and I thought this is this
is really interesting and I I asked if
he ever thought of creating a cash flow
projection and he said I don't have the
time for that so we sat down actually I
sat down with them and in two hours we
had a really detailed cash flow
projection for his business which having
just having that structure totally
changed the way that he looked at his
business taking taking that he was
running around just feeling you know as
I said he measured he measured his cash
flow by how much pain and I think if you
think about what what in your life do
you measure by how much pain you feel
about it
what what what could be solved by
putting some kind of structure or some
kind of routine into your into your life
that would make a real difference in
what you accomplish and then this next
next up in this this accomplishing more
by doing less graph is innovation
creativity and and chaos and this is
really this is really about kind of less
less settling right less settling for
what's mediocre or there's a there's a
word that sometimes it's kind of a
made-up word called satisficing right
and this is a a warning of what not to
do in the world of creativity so don't
don't settle for things don't that
suffice don't settle for things that
just satisfy that this is to to allow
for there to be some sense of unknown
since some sense of chaos and innovation
and and again I think we're we're all
tremendously creative innovative beings
and it's and it's allowing it's allowing
ourselves to kind of drop down into that
space and and seeing how how dangerous
it is that you know we we usually you
know we usually like
to tell safe stories and predictable
stories and and we don't even kind of
realize it so it's finding finding ways
to push ourselves slightly out of our
comfort zones and into into a little bit
of the chaos world and I know I here a
couple months ago and I I talked about
how for me taking improv classes was a
big way to do that and actually I find
in some way you know just getting up in
the morning and going to work is you
know I I never I never know what I'm
gonna find when I when I sit down with
you know with a coaching client or if I
walk into a to a group that I'm
facilitating I mean that's that's one of
things that I love about love and
sometimes dread about this kind of work
with people is that you just never know
what you're gonna find and and I think
all of these things you know starting
starting down here with awareness and
building up to trust vision routines
chaos and innovation all lead to a sense
of accomplishment and and results and
and the thing that I would suggest that
that top line is about is less less
effort that that again it's not you know
there's that there's a this famous quote
I think it's a Mark Twain quote right
where he says you know having having
lost sight of our goals we redouble our
efforts so so this is you know this is
for for so many people and I see it in
so many places that that there really is
a culture of busyness and a culture of
doing and so this is really a a model
for changing changing that culture and
bringing our business lives and our
lives into a into a higher plane into a
different way of into a different way of
being and really all of this this isn't
so much about I mean there there are
many many practices that could be done
within all of these there are many ways
many very concrete ways to practice with
these but it's not so much about
Niq it's really about a way of being a
way a way of of living in the world and
one way that I would that I would
describe this way of being is to make
your life a laboratory right to that to
see that your that your life is really
the place to experiment and to to pay
more and more attention to you know what
is it that gets in your way where how do
you get triggered what are your what are
your sore points that what what are the
patterns that over and over again get in
your way where where do you where do you
over and over again find that you're
complaining about something or worrying
about something and and so it's it's
really kind of shifting shifting into
this I mean so when you when you shift
your life into this sense of way of
being you can a pre you know you can
appreciate your worrying it's like oh
look I'm worrying isn't that interesting
what's what is that worrying about and
so it's not about pushing those things
away but it's about really noticing and
and the more the more that you notice
these things somehow this this this
shifts what's possible and shifts to new
possible ways of being I'm gonna stop
there and I want to ask that you turn to
someone next to you find someone who's
next to you can you guys all get in
pairs
this is this is the good part this is
where you you talk you know cuz no real
real learning comes from what you what
you say so we're gonna we're gonna just
spend a few minutes having you guys talk
does everybody everybody found a partner
great
well here's first a little bit of
instruction I'm gonna I'm gonna give a
suggested question and then you're each
gonna get just like I think three
minutes each and I'd like during that
time for the person who's talking to
just be able to talk uninterrupted and
the other person to just listen this is
rare this is really a great gift in our
culture and the other thing that's rare
is that you don't have to look good here
you don't have to look smart you don't
have to look smooth or like you know
what you're saying you might even be a
little surprised about what about what
you say and if you're the person
listening
don't be preparing just listen you know
you'll notice you'll you will I mean
you're probably all preparing right now
even though I haven't even asked you
about anything but you know it's so it's
it's so potent to be prepared and to
want to look good so let's let's see if
we can be cured be a little bit more
curious so the question that I'm gonna
pose for each of you to talk to the
other person about for three minutes is
what's what's something that you do
that's extra that that if you were to
stop doing would make a big difference
in how much you get done in your life
what's something that you should prep
that what's a thing that should probably
be at the top of your not to do list
things things that you probably that you
do now that if you were to stop doing
would make a big difference and this can
be you can take this literally in terms
of something that you do you could take
it as something in turn something that
you do some process or you could talk
about anything you want in your three
minutes because I'm just this is a
suggestion you might
have something burning some burning
issue that you just want to get out for
three minutes let's see I don't have a
watch with a second hand so can someone
be a timer yeah so so just decide who's
going to go first and whoever's going to
go first you've got three minutes well
and I will I'll ring a little bell at
the end of three minutes
no it's on right now but they went to
I'm not sure what the camera the wrong
so I'll I'll just leave this up here for
you right now
so when you want to use it all man the
board they're served with this what's
the suits are using like right now your
unit
okay so the first person should stop and
the second person can start and you've
got the second person will have three
minutes also
you know this is fine
I can I can go with it
not wearing
the other stuffs I was doing
basically it
oh thanks
user interfaces smarter so yeah
okay if you can all finish up I realized
one thing I didn't say at the beginning
is that I'm a coach here at Google and
there's a coach this and this talk is
part of the Google coaching program and
Merrill Blanchard I wanted to thank
who's the person who is making the
google coaching program possible so
thank you we have a few minutes if
anyone wants to talk about how that was
or ask me anything or make any comments
questions at all please oh we have a mic
microphone
Thanks so I really liked what you said
about awareness and meaning and then
trust and I had a question so I've had
an experience where you know you walk
into a room and you kind of connect with
people sort of it's gonna sound very
new-age you sort of energetically you
know have a good feeling about the room
are the people that you're with and then
so you feel good and everything is right
and then there's this one person that
sends you into judgment and like
negativity and you know so you get you
get to the place where you have
awareness love and meaning right so I'm
all happy with everything and then I
connect with people and then it there's
one annoying person mm-hmm
so what do you do about the one annoying
person you just by the eject button
right and am HSP I mean I realize that
may just be annoying for me and might be
just triggering one thing for me and
other people are completely and totally
fine with it you know but it changes the
energy of the room for for me so so what
do you do when you have that annoying
person suddenly I don't feel connected
anymore I don't feel trust yeah and I
know I'm not being aware and loving so
great great question okay well I think I
think that question is or the
distinction is like like what's really
happening in that situation so I mean I
would generally advise to start by right
as you suggested perhaps perhaps there's
a way that you're being triggered what
what is happening in you you know but
also what you're I mean youyou gave
somewhat limited information like so is
is this person acting
are they being critical of other areas
is if it's just is it just the vibe
right yes so that right yes yeah so yeah
I mean yes so that you know that that
reminds me of you know I was in a when I
was running my greeting card company
there was you know I I often you know
people often would say how you know
how's how's business how's my company
going in and the real answer was
generally it was all great I loved it
except for the people but I can remember
a specific situation in which like my
sales manager and my office manager work
on it like they just like they just
bugged each other like and I was I spent
a lot of time trying to get them to get
along because it was important and I
ever having bringing my sales manager
outside and having a conversation and
she was all heated and at some point she
blurted out but she reminds me of my
mother and and but that I mean in a way
that was huge I mean we all you know
this is another it's it's a dirty little
secret about the business world we bring
in our total lives we bring in our total
lives to who we are into our work here
that everything we learned from our
parents anything you know we're all
imperfect incomplete messy human beings
and we bring it and we bring it all into
it so yes we walk into a room it's great
one person bugs us so if we I think what
I was talking about as a as seeing our
lives as a laboratory then the question
is what what's what's going on I mean
what's going on in me I mean the I think
the way to deal with it is what is
happening in me that's that is making me
have this reaction and and then perhaps
again I guess depending on what happens
I could imagine having a conversation
with this person and say you know I
gotta tell you
I don't know I don't know what's going
on but I'm I'm having this reaction here
I don't know what it's about can you
help me with this or I mean I think that
would be interesting to really kind of
come out and really work on it and I
mean this would be a huge risk it
depends on what this person's position
is and you know but but I but in general
I think anything we can do to be curious
go into but again usually it's usually
and usually it's all about them and what
what can they do to change and if they
only did that and and generally you know
you know and it'd be great you know in
any room of people it'd be great if you
could see you know the bubbles of what
they're really thinking and often it
would be it'd be quite quite surprising
to see how bugged
everybody is or why you know why did
they say that or I wish they weren't on
this team or or or they remind me of
someone or so this is this is great
territory so thank you for that question
other questions comments if you could
use the microphone please
I thought these ideas of the pyramid
were very interesting I guess the one
that I want to focus on is the chaos and
an innovation and it seems like for me
that sometimes makes me less productive
like I say here's a bug oh this is
really a design flaw let's redesign this
whole package and first of all it takes
long or a second of all it breaks things
or I'm approaching something I say oh
well everybody does it this way really
would be better to do it this way and
then down the line I realized why
everybody was doing it the other way in
the first place so so it seems like
sometimes you can take this chaos and
innovation too far I would agree
yeah I mean right I mean I think I mean
this is you know that's this particular
one is somewhat of a somewhat of a wild
card in that in that you you don't know
but you know if you if you stay in that
safe range you do know you know you'll
you know that not much is going to
happen so I mean you I think a big thing
in there I think there's two to maybe
contrast
pieces 1:1 is kind of trust in your
heart and trusting your own vision and
and really you know pushing forward and
pushing out those edges and the other
competing activity is getting feedback
from other people and being and
listening so that so that you know
that's knowing if the other other people
and that feedback can help you from
wasting too much time so it's a little
that tension having both of those things
working well are there any specific
techniques you use to not lose sight of
your goals well I think you know just
happy just having goals is a big one
like just like just having goals and and
having enough discipline to actually
look at them like I find it I mean I'm
surprised you know how many people don't
you know don't do it it's hard it's I
think they're they're often you know
holding holding yourself accountable is
a really big thing and and hard for a
lot of people because for a lot of
people they feel like well they're get
what if they fail like what why why have
these goals so so I mean this is
something um you know I was just I was
just with a coaching client and I said
oh by the way what are you goals for the
first quarter what what are what are
what do you want to accomplish and this
was both this person was CEO of a
company and this was like what what are
the goals you know when we're sitting
here in three months from now what what
is it that you want this company to have
moved forward and then what do you want
to have move forward and then what do
you as a leader want to be working on
that we can that we can measure how
you're doing as a leader so in this
particular case this this particular
leader has trouble with has trouble with
conflict tends to avoid conflict so a
goal
to not avoid conflict and to engage even
in things that were difficult and to
actually kind of keep track of of doing
that and start noticing those things so
and I find for me like in in my business
I I have just having monthly you know
projections about customers and about
finances and then at the end of the
month looking to see you know how did I
do its I mean there's a way there's a
way in which business can be you know a
game you know and to treat it to treat
it as a game but you have to know you
have to keep track of the score right so
this the score is what things you're
accomplishing and have and have certain
and have a list of goals that you want
to do and then away some discipline way
of measuring them over over time so
thanks any other comments questions
ideas
great we have one do you want to get to
mic microphone maybe the last question
and then we'll stop yes in the second a
second top item chaos and innovation I
got a good picture of what you were
talking about about innovation but less
of what the chaos is doing there
yeah chaos I think chaos is about being
able to step outside of your usual story
or it's funny I went I went last Sunday
morning to this a two hour dance class
and in which it was on part of this type
of dancing called five rhythms dance and
in the and in the center of it they part
of the practice is what they call chaos
and it's about noticing noticing how
every person you get into a rhythm of
moving you get into a rhythm of dancing
you get into a place where it's
comfortable and there you are doing the
same thing over and over and over again
and and that's kind of for most of us
our lives are a lot like that right we
get triggered by the same thing over and
over or we we kind of think in these
same patterns over and over so chaos is
experimenting with doing it differently
seeing if you can do it differently you
know put your watch on your other hand
for the day see how see how that feels
notice try you know try getting dressed
differently in the morning see if like
there's usually there's so many things
that we pay no attention to that we just
do over and over again in the same way
so so chaos is is shake is shaking that
up is is acknowledging that those Pat
those patterns you know the way the way
that we talk the way that the
assumptions we make or or like even that
you know the question about the person
who bothers us that that that we do that
every day you know for years we go into
that meeting and that same person is
like so to sort of to try ways to shake
it up that's what I mean by chaos thank
you all very much it's been a pleasure
