more for our 2010 faculty summit this is
the sixth one and just about winding to
a close but I'm very glad that in many
ways we have one of the very best
speakers at Google last on the agenda
and that is Vin surf so I get to work
with vent i would say weekly pretty much
we get the chat with each other and it's
always a great joy I think you'll see
some very interesting observations from
vent as he looks at what is going on
both in the network and more broadly so
Vint I always get nervous when people
clap before you said anything because I
figure you should just sit down because
it won't get any better than that I
apologize actually i'm very disappointed
that I wasn't with you yesterday I was
out at UC Berkeley at George smooths
cosmology lab and I came away very
humbled to realize that in as we enter
the second decade of the 21st century we
know less about the universe than we
thought we knew at the end of the 19th
century ninety-five percent of all of
the energy and matter in the universe is
a mystery to us now dark matter and dark
energy are just things we are pretty
convinced or they're certainly dark
matter we don't know what they are so I
came kind of crawling back you were
about to say the protocols you developed
for interstellar internet would solve
all these issues what's gone wrong yes
well we have a few little problems like
the speed of light is too slow if you're
looking for research challenge if you
could quintuple the speed of light this
would be very helpful but let's see
where else we can go one our member that
I'm kind of the plumber guy right so I'm
not up here in a min application space
I'm the guy who's worried about what's
happening and the pipes and the the
roads and everything underneath a lot of
the things that have been talked about
so here's one thing the number of
machines on the Internet we used to
double every year now it's from
be more like five to six years doubling
rate although this is only for machines
that are visible on the net there are a
lot of them hiding behind firewalls that
we can't see so we don't know how many
there are google has a lot of them that
you don't see directly because they
don't have domain names and things like
that so this number is is increasing its
in the 750 million range now plus the
ones that are not so visible this is the
number of internet addresses that are
available we're down to about under
eight percent of the ipv4 address space
so we will run out this year or
certainly early in 2011 which motivates
the need for implementing ipv6
everywhere if we want to continue to
grow the internet ms can you imagine
selling a telephone and saying it's a
really nice little gadget it's great
there's only one little problem it
doesn't have a telephone number so you
can't use it to make phone calls but
otherwise it's a very nice little device
the ISPs have not fully recognized the
significance of this curve but I
recently acquired this little sculpture
from dr. Seuss and i thought this little
remark on top of it was very appropriate
that's sitting in the middle of my
dining room table but in fact you should
be implementing ipv6 if you haven't
already started your late google has
been working on this for almost two
years now it's not a huge team of people
but it takes a lot of effort to go find
every place in all the software that
thinks that an Internet address is 32
bits long and convinces it that it could
be 128 bits long so it the time to start
is now it's not flipping a switch it's
question of getting both protocols to
run concurrently and in parallel that
adds complexity to the operating
environment because now you'll have
error message is coming from both
flavors you have routing systems that
have to be routing for both e4 and v6
you have the possibility of somebody
with a v6 only address trying to get to
a v4 only server there are all kinds of
complexities that are a consequence of
having to run two different non
interoperable IP address spaces at the
same time so the
some rich areas for certainly research
and development there are three point
four times ten to the 38th addresses in
ipv6 and that leads some people to think
they can use those addresses for things
other than simply identifying endpoints
in the network this makes me nervous
because first they may consume more
address space than necessary and second
anytime you overload any particular
identification system you run into
potential serious hazards but that ipv6
rollout is in progress as slowly as it
as it has been the second thing which is
happening in which I think also has a
lot of interesting properties is that
the domain name system is now being
altered to incorporate non-latin
character sets for many years domain
names were made up of letters A through
Z and 0 through 9 and a hyphen now they
can contain glyphs from the much not all
but much of the Unicode character set
the World Wide Web originally used
Unicode and that means that it was very
expressive in terms of the world's
languages now finally the domain name
system is catching up that does lead to
some problems those of you who are
familiar with great Cyrillic and Latin
characters will know that the many of
them look the same they have origins
that are similar and so that can lead to
confusion because the Unicode codes for
these look like characters are different
so the computer doesn't know that
they're the same so there are some risk
factors and some issues that we need to
address some of which could require some
clever rules in order to eliminate or at
least minute minimize some of the errors
that could occur many which would be
deliberate someone deliberately trying
to cause you to go to the wrong place on
purpose that leads to another
observation the domain name system
itself has been fairly weak in terms of
protection so fishing and farming and so
on had been serious problems on July
fifteenth the root zone file was
digitally signed which means that when
you do a lookup for a top-level domain
now if you ask the domain name system to
deliver a digital
answer you can get a digitally signed
answer which allows you to verify that
the IP address and the domain name that
you've looked up have integrity that is
to say they haven't been altered now we
hope having finally got to the point
that the root zone file has been
digitally signed now that the other top
level and lower level domains will
follow suit some top-level domains have
been signed even in advance of the root
but this is a very important new
development in the internet and finally
routing has been a big issue because
it's possible to hijack the routing
system by simply announcing the jewel
and a piece of address space and if
somebody believes you and starts routing
in that direction you can cause traffic
to flow in a direction you don't want it
to an example of that happened in
Pakistan some months ago when they
decided the some officials in Pakistan
didn't like something on YouTube and
they told the internet service providers
in Pakistan to please shut down YouTube
they chose to do it by a black hole in
the IP address of YouTube except that
they published this the in the routing
came global routing tables and
propagated the information to a large
fraction of the internet which cut
YouTube off from more than just Pakistan
they claimed that that was an accident I
don't have any comment on that because I
don't have any further information but
the fact that it's possible to do that
is a serious vulnerability the plan now
is for the regional internet registries
to digitally sign entries in their
assignment tables so that if someone
announces you can get to this IP address
with this autonomy through this
autonomous system namely me the
recipient of that routing update can
actually validate that the table entry
it gives the authority to that
autonomous system to announce that
address and if they don't have that
authority you should not only ignore
that routing update but maybe wave a red
flag and say there are some serious
problems these are all really quite
major changes to the internet
architecture which up until now has been
pretty stable for the last 30 years or
so and the last three bullets on here
just draw your attention to the fact
that there are other things that are
becoming part of the internet
environment sensor nets the smart grid
program that allows smart devices to be
electrically electrical
tricity consuming devices to be part of
the net and finally Mobile's that we're
all carrying around really have produced
the kind of internet or at least an
Internet window in your pocket again a
major change to the Internet's world
this is what some of the domain names
will look like as the IDMS
internationalized domain names are
entered Egypt Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates got the first
non-latin character set assignments for
their top level domains in May of this
year here's something that I'd like to
just try to stimulate your thinking
about domain names are not the only
symbolic way of making references to
places or things in the internet they
haven't been very useful and they show
up in uris your ends and so on they have
the property that they're insensitive to
which version of IP address space you're
using that's an advantage they also are
insensitive to changes in IP address
that makes them useful because it's an
indirect addressing mechanism but they
are not the only ways of associating an
identifier with an IP address and the
reason I want to bring this up is that I
think we have not yet explored some very
interesting possibilities of bindings of
identifiers with IP addresses that we
could usefully initiate so there's a
handle system that Bob com developed at
CNRI which uses almost content-free
strings that identify objects a book a
file on one kind or another an executing
program it could be anything that's
digital that digital object identifier
is intended to survive over long periods
of time here we're talking hundreds of
years as opposed to a domain name which
has the property that if you fail to
renew the domain name registration it
may either disappear and you get you
know the 404 and address not found or if
you go to that domain name thinking
you're going to get a certain kind of
information you end up at a different
place with different kinds of
information because someone has acquired
the domain name so the URL
that was associated with that object is
not stable in the domain name system in
the digital object identifier system the
intent is that it is stable that is
sadies identifiers are not ever
reassigned nor do they ever exit from
the from the system the dictionary that
that points to them or the directory
that points to them the bundle protocol
which is part of the interplanetary
internet work that I've been dealing
with JPL also uses identifiers that are
intended to be delayed bound so for
example if you're on Mars and you want
to get to a place on earth the typical
way tcp/ip works is that you resolve the
identifier first and then you go there
and the problem with that when you're in
an interplanetary environment with very
high delay and uncertainty of
communication is that by the time you
get the answer back the target may have
moved it may have had his IP address
change it may no longer be accessible it
may point to the different thing so
trying to resolve the IP addresses in
ahead of time it just doesn't work very
well so a delayed binding tactic has
been adopted in the in the bummer
protocol this raises a more general
question which is what things what what
object should have identifiers and how
should we point to them and I suspect
that this notion of having persistent
long-term identifier is going to be more
and more important as more content
becomes digitally generated and stored
away and people want to have access to
it over long periods of time in here I'm
not talking about just years I'm really
talking about decades 200 years or maybe
even a thousand years or more so I think
one of the other questions is whether
there is a way to devise such an
identifier system that does not require
centralization if you look at most of
the designs today centralization is used
in order to achieve uniqueness the
domain name system it's a hierarchical
structure and somebody has to hand out a
domain name with a prefix or suffix
depending on which way you're looking at
it that's
unique because it's under hierarchical
control so one question is whether it's
possible to devise an identifier system
that's fully distributed where and you
could go to any of a number of places or
maybe even generate a large random
number yourself and declare that's your
identifier and if the probability of
collision with somebody else is low
enough you might actually get away with
a kind of random generated identifier
which then gets stored away in some very
distributed directory system and can be
used for ever and ever because these
numbers are never regenerated so I I
just put it to you that this is an
interesting space in which to explore
another thing which I become quite
fascinated by and in which the last talk
about social interactions has some
bearing is this idea that we learn new
ways of interacting with the internet
normally we've used keyboards and maybe
touch sensitive screens and mice to
interact with most of the internet but
there was a very interesting Ted
demonstration the URLs are here if you
care to to jot them down which showed a
guy wearing a video projection unit plus
a camera plus a headset plus some
microphones and basically the computer
that he was wearing in effect was
participating with him in the same
environment that he was interacting with
and so suddenly the machine has the same
opportunity to engage in human
interaction with the same senses that we
have we aren't getting to smell and
we're not getting to touch but at least
we're getting to sight and sound
gestures become feasible I think the
most attractive example that he gave he
doesn't have to have a laptop or a
desktop or a notepad if he needs to
project something he just projects it on
the wall or on somebody's t-shirt or in
his hand so at one point he needed to
make a phone call so he projected the
keypad onto his hand you know the camera
that he was wearing could see his hand
and could see the the pad on his hand
and then he touched the numbers that he
wanted to die
and the system figured out that he
wanted to make a phone call and so it
made a voice over IP call for him but
the fact is that he had his computer
engaged in the same interactive
environment that the human beings were
in and I find that a very intriguing
kind of path to follow we sort of touch
on that at Google we have speech
understanding on mobiles and on laptops
and we have the google goggles or you
take a picture of something and then say
what is it we're not too bad at
answering some of the questions like a
book cover for example or maybe a wine
label or a picture of a famous landmark
we're not too good at a lot of other
pictures that we don't know how to
interpret but that's an attempt to get
the computer to be more interactive with
us in normal human discourse now my wife
has two cochlear implants and I have to
admit that one of the things I've been
thinking about is to take her speech
processor which which takes sound in
does a Fourier transform figures out
which frequencies are present and then
sends electrical impulses into her
cochlea into the auditory nerve the
brain interprets those signals is sound
and so she hears essentially normally
she interacts but people listens to the
television or makes phone calls so I
thought well what would happen if i put
tcp/ip into the speech processor so that
she could say something she's got
microphones otherwise she couldn't hear
so she would say a question that would
go in get turned into voice over IP get
sent his packets to a Google machine the
answer would come back be converted into
voice over IP packets again maybe with a
text to speech processor and we'll go
back and it will go straight into her
head because they would never make it
outside anywhere she would simply be
hearing what the computer was saying
thanks to the speech processor and I
haven't gotten onto the way to the point
of doing that but it is an intriguing
possibility it's not the same as doing
cognitive interactions with somebody
it's not like sucking thought out of
their heads but it gets you know an
interesting connection to the net well
that leads to this other thing which is
lots and lots of devices are going to
show up on the net and so you may hear
this internet of things I don't know
really what the implications are of
having billions of devices on the
internet but there will be appliances
that you find around the house in the
office in the car things you carry
around with you
things that are embedded in buildings
things are outside that are all part of
this networked environment generating
information sharing information with
each other sending status information
engaging in control one thing that's
pretty clear is that if we're going to
put our entertainment system up on the
internet for example and many of them
are already you want strong
authentication to make sure that the 15
year old next door doesn't reprogram
your entertainment system and you
discover things on the DVR that you
didn't anticipate there are lots of
reasons why we need better
authentication in the network and
finally a lot of these devices are going
to act as store-and-forward routing
systems in addition to being sensors so
you've all seen these things before
refrigerator is that our internet
enabled their picture frames I remember
my first reaction with the picture frame
was that it sounded like it was
something that was as useful as an
electric 4q but in fact it's actually
quite convenient because you just upload
your digital photographs to some website
the picture frame wakes up every 24
hours downloads the pictures and then
you get up to see what the family's been
doing around the country by just
watching the pictures circulating again
security is an issue here because if
somebody breaks into the website the
picture frame is downloading from the
grandparents may see pictures that they
hope or not of the grandchildren so
security is an important issue here the
guy in the middle is the one I like the
most he's invented an internet-enabled
surfboard I guess he was just bored
sitting on the water waiting for
something to happen and he said well if
I put a laptop in my surfboard I can
surf the internet while I'm waiting for
the other stuff so he put a Wi-Fi server
back on the rescue shack on the beach
and he celsius is a product just to give
you an example of a sensor net I have
one in my house it's running ipv6 and by
the way this is not me in the garage
with a soldering gun this is actually a
commercial system made by a company
called art rock there are a dozen
sensors in the house one in each room
and it's picking up the temperature the
humidity and light levels in every room
in the house every five minutes and
storing it away in a server down in the
basement at the end of the 90 it sounds
like something only a geek would do but
at the end of the year I have a year's
worth of information about heating and
and cooling distribution in the house I
have a real raw engineering data about
how well the system has worked and when
it comes to optimizing I have good solid
information to work from the wine cellar
is instrumented and if the temperature
goes above 60 degrees i actually get an
SMS on my mobile to tell me that my wine
is heating up it actually happened to me
when I was going to visit argonne
national laboratory for a few days I
walked in and just as I own to the
building my mobile went off the wine
cellar calling and for several days
afterwards every five minutes I got this
note saying your wine is getting hotter
I got home and it was 70 degrees in the
wine cellar so you know i reactivated
the cooling system then I called our
truck and I said you make remote
actuators and they said yes so that's a
little project I also thought I thought
about you know that I could tell if
somebody's gone into the wine cellar
when I'm away because I can see the
lights go off and on but I don't know
what they did so I thought well maybe I
should put RFID chips on each bottle and
then I can do an instantaneous inventory
to figure out if anything is left the
wine cellar without my permission before
while I'm away and somebody pointed out
to me that you could go into the wine
cellar and drink the wine and leave the
bottle so so I know I have to put
sensors in the cork okay so here's
another example of what happens when you
have an Internet of Things imagine you
have an internet-enabled washing machine
and and you've spilled the mayonnaise
you know on a blouse or shirt or
something so you go to the web and you
say you know what do i do about
mayonnaise stains on silk Procter &amp;amp;
Gamble website comes back and says I can
answer this question what kind of a
machine do you have what kind of washing
machine do you have and you answer that
and it says well you should use this
kind of soap and here's how much you
should use and then they say you know is
your machine on the net and if you say
yes it says fine no problem and it sends
notes off to the machine fixes the
parameters of the machine for the
temperature and the washing cycle and
what kind of you know how rough or
gentle the washing should be and then it
says to throw your your blouse into the
machine poor in this special soap and
then you're done so what Procter &amp;amp;
Gamble is just done is
to take a product and turn it into a
service because the machine was online
and you can imagine all kinds of
scenarios like that the smart grid is
something which is underway in the
United States the idea is to get
machines to respond to messages like the
cost of electricity is going up maybe
you don't want to heat water right now
or you don't want to want to run the
washing machine but that's just the
beginning that's electricity I think in
the end we should be paying attention
not only to the way we consume
electricity but other resources as well
if we instrument things will get good
feedback to our population about the
decisions that we make in our lifestyles
and how they consume resources and maybe
we can do a better job of careful
consumption you can imagine having to
talk to all those devices new remember
c-3po and its is one of the translating
systems that as part of the Star Wars
pictures and finally to give you a quick
update on where we are with the
interplanetary internet this is a
project that got started at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in 1998 our
premise was that point-to-point radio
links were not a very rich environment
in which to support extensive complex
space exploration with multiple Rover
devices with humans with sensor networks
and the like instead of having a
point-to-point link going from Earth to
the target what we were interested in is
building a rich networking capability in
the same sense that the internet
provides that here on planet earth and
we got some examples of the utility of
the store and forward style networking
the Rovers on Mars which landed in
January of 2004 were intended to
transmit data straight back to earth a
28 kilobits a second with a
point-to-point radio link to the Deep
Space Network and when they turned those
radios on they overheated so the first
reaction is reduce the duty cycle to
keep them from damaging themselves the
scientists were very unhappy about that
because they already didn't like 28
kilobits per second and now they were
getting less data back but the engineers
said well there's an x-band radio on
board each of the rover's it could go at
128 kilobits a second but it can only go
up to about where the orbiters are well
the orbiters were in place in order to
map the surface of Mars to figure out
where the rover should go
and they decided to repurpose those
orbiters which had completed their
mapping mission and make them store and
forward nodes of a little tiny 23 node
Network so all the data that's coming
back from Mars now is going store and
forward back to to earth by way of their
relays in the in the orbiters they
because that worked so well they did the
same thing with the Phoenix lander that
landed in May of 2008 it didn't have any
direct path back to earth they had to
use the rover the orbiters as a storm
forward system so we thought we could
start using tcp/ip and we were quickly
disabused of this idea the first problem
is the distance between the planets is
astronomical literally and the
consequence of this is that you know it
takes first of all it's variable right
because our distance changes as a
function of where we are in our orbits
so it's variable delay and second it's
really long so from Earth to Mars it's
20 minutes round-trip time at the speed
of light I'm sorry 20 minutes one way 40
minutes round-trip time at the speed of
light to get to and from between Earth
and Mars and you can imagine you know
click click your mouse and wait for 40
minutes it's like some of the networks
on earth but then there's this other
problem celestial motion the planets are
rotating and we haven't figured out how
to stop that so if there's something on
the surface of the planet that you're
talking to and the planet rotates you
can't talk to it anymore because it's
disrupted so we have a variable delay
and disruption in the network and tcp/ip
does not work well in that environment
so we had to invent a whole new suite of
protocols that we call the bundle
protocol they've been tested
terrestrially in a variety of
environments including tactical military
where it actually worked out quite well
we've got the protocols onboard the
space station now we have them on a
spacecraft called epoxy which is on its
way out to rendezvous with the comet
Hartley 2 at the end of this year we've
already done some deep space testing
with the epoxy spacecraft it'll snap 14
has a cisco router on board and it has
an auxiliary processor and our plan is
to upload the bundle protocols to that
as well and then we've got an
implementation of the
dtn protocols in android so at the end
of this year or the beginning of next
year it's conceivable that we'll be able
to take an Android mobile and send a
message goes all the way to the epoxy
spacecraft goes to the space station and
then comes back down to earth again and
for those of you who are fans of history
there's a guy named dave mills who did
the first NSFNET fuzzball system and he
always used to talk about martian
packets we're going to send him a real
Martian packet I can hardly wait so
that's the state of the affairs what
we're hoping frankly I'm going to skip
through this because it's almost time to
finish what we're hoping will happen is
not that we build this big
interplanetary backbone and that
somebody shows up they'll including
aliens what we're trying to do is to
create a framework in which people who
adopt the standards can then enter work
whether it's NASA or Jackson or ISA or
any other space agencies if their
spacecraft will use these protocols they
can enter work they don't have to but
they can and second once those
spacecraft had completed their primary
missions they can be repurposed to
become part of an interplanetary
backbone so I would predict if we're
successful that over the next several
decades will literally grow an
interplanetary backbone mission by
mission and make use of it both from and
and for robotic exploration so that's up
to the date on the interplanetary net
it's twelve-thirty I'm happy to take
questions or if you want to go run off
to lunch I won't be insulted thank you
for coming today
