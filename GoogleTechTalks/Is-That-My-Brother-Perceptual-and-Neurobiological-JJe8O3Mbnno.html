pleasure to welcome Linda Robertson um
she is my friend and a professor of
psychology and neuroscience at UC
Berkeley she has pretty much dedicated
her entire life to studying the effects
of selective attention and perceptual
organization on the final outcome of
perception in normal people as well as
people with neurological damage and
today she is going to talk to us about
prosopagnosia which is a specific
deficit that affects some people
cognitive and neural contributions to
face blindness well this is very
interesting to be here and be able to
talk to a group of individuals that are
in business rather than in the academic
culture although I'm not downgrading
that at all i think it's just marvelous
that these sorts of things are happening
and that many people that many of our
students coming out are ending up in
places like this and we have some
something of value to offer anyway my
background I went to UC Berkeley
actually is a graduate student and
shortly thereafter went to UCSF and and
I studied cognitive sciences and Skog
'native psychology at Berkeley I shortly
thereafter found myself in a postdoc at
UCSF and that's where I discovered
neuropsychology so my background is an
experimental psychologist but I've been
amesh my whole life since I got my PhD
at least in a world of neurology and I
was in fact in a neurology department
till 98 when I came back to Berkeley and
now i'm part of the psychology
department this is a fairly recent a
topic for me although i think it's a
natural outgrowth and i'll get to it
right away by saying first there are two
types of prosopagnosia
acquired which can be acquired through
traumatic brain injury or stroke or that
sort of thing many of our vets who are
coming home from Iraq with TBI are we're
finding that they have an acquired
prosopagnosia along with all the other
sorts of problems that they have and
then there's also a developmental
prosopagnosia or sometimes called
congenital frostburg nauseum we'll call
it development of prospective nausea and
refer to it as DP and this is what I'm
going to talk about today is this
developmental type of prosopagnosia
these are individuals who have never
ever learned to discriminate faces so
they can't recognize sometimes their own
family members my face alone it was
considered very rare once upon a time
although we're finding out there's more
and more people with these problems so
for instance if given a pictures such as
this most of us would have no trouble
saying this is Ronald Reagan I'm having
trouble with him Stallone what's his
first name Rocky Bill Clinton's tends to
stand out Charlie Chaplin that's for the
older prospect musics but they would
have difficulty looking at these for as
long as possible and being able to tell
you with any certainty who these
individuals are if you do something like
this and you just have them say yes or
no so is this is does this name down
here match this face here well of course
this is yes yes no no but they may be
anywhere from fifty to seventy percent
incorrect of course they can find
distinguishing features and use those
but if you is this Jack Nicholson maybe
how about this Henry Kissinger well I
don't know I think he wears glasses
things of that nature yet they don't
have trouble seeing a face as a face the
face they say is clear to them as clear
as any other objects and when you give
them degraded types of stimuli such as
these sorts of figures most of us will
see a face over here so we'll
prosopagnosia see a face over here so
it's not really face blindness per se
it's actually a situation where you see
clearly the face you're able to see that
it's an organization of a face and
recognize it as a face but you just
don't discriminate it from other faces
that may be rounded paradoxically
they're better at some tasks than we are
so for instance if these are called
composite faces the top half of all of
these figures are the same but here what
has happened is this has been split in
half so the bottom half is over here and
here it's part of the gestalt the whole
Pacific Nozick's will have no trouble
telling us that these are the same and
that these are the same there will be no
slower here in here yet people who
normally have good face perception find
it much easier to say that these two are
the same on the top then that these two
are the same on the top and that's
because you have to break the
configuration here in order to do that
task examples of some of the statements
that developmental process of agnostic
have told us I avoid places I could run
into someone i know because i may not
recognize them I pretend to be lost in
thought when walking down the street I
act friendly to everyone just in case I
know them and then there's others that
say I act friendly to no one just in
case I don't know them uh an one person
said standing in front of a mirror in a
crowded public restroom I have had to
make a funny face so that I could tell
which one was me so even them their own
face which they see every morning in the
mirror when they brush their teeth if
they're in a crowded a scene with a lot
of people a lot of faces in the mirror
they may have trouble that doesn't mean
they don't recognize people by other
means they do and what they tell us is
they might use the gate they're very
attuned to gate actually mannerisms of
people and often hair or other sorts of
of distinguishing features to try to
determine who that person might be
well this was once as I said this was
once thought to be extremely rare and up
until nineteen ninety there were only
two cases of developmental prosopagnosia
reported in the scientific literature in
neuropsychological in neuropsychology
literature the last ten years there have
been many developmental prospect
Nozick's that have emerged and many of
them have been studies so there's far
more studies and we can thank the
internet for that and it's pi guess
probably especially google sort of
search engines so that someone who is a
little embarrassed about not being able
to recognize faces can sit alone in
their own room and look up prosopagnosia
or face blindness and and and try to
find out something about themselves and
trying to find out there's other people
out there like themselves well so
through the internet we have been able
to place certain things certain sort of
questionnaires and so on those of us who
do research to try to recruit
individuals with this problem ken
okuyama in Harvard estimates that there
are two percent of the population is
prosopagnosia well developmentally we
don't know if that's true or not seems
rather high but the current estimates
are somewhere between a half a percent
half of one percent and two percent so
you can see that in population like the
Bay Area there are quite a few people
who have never learned to be able to
recognize faces severity is an issue and
we'll get to that in a moment oh also a
recent article has shown that but we
always knew actually that it ran in
families but this particular argue
showed that there were 50 prosopagnosia
within a few square miles in the small
German city and this was these were
these are families that have been there
for many many years so again suggesting
that there is probably some genetic
property to it
um well our faces specials because these
people who have development of prospect
naazia don't have obvious problems
envisioned in organizing the visual
world in other ways so they can see the
crowd of people in here and organize
that perfectly well their visual acuity
is fine they have normal intelligence
etc etc so does this mean that faces are
special well this came up many years ago
actually in the 60s or 50s when when
developmental psychologists started
studying faces I started studying up
face perception and perceptual
development in newborns and newborns do
respond to faces rather different than
they respond to other things but of
course newborns this is like within the
first few days or within the month after
birth newborns have undeveloped reins
and they also have impoverished sensory
input and yet if you show a newborn this
or a group of newborns really the any of
these appear just individually if you
show that to a newborn they'll look at
it for longer than they look at other
things they're interested in these three
as compared to these three now here you
have a lot more energy coming off of
this oval of this face and yet they
don't think that's as interesting as
they do these here you have the same
features the eyes nose and mouth but
they rearranged differently newborns
don't think that's very interesting
either but what's really interesting to
me is that newborns don't think this is
very interesting either and yet they
like that one a lot and the only
difference is the two eyes are up here
in this one and they're down here in
this one this is more like what a
newborn would see very very fuzzy world
and if you show them I mean this is what
their semen is you show them a broadband
upright or upside down face they will
prefer to
look at this one so already they're
looking at faces where the two eyes are
up top in the oval and this is what made
people really start thinking that faces
might be special that we may be born
with a bias to look at faces hmm um more
recently however what we found out
through some work of Mark Johnson and
others is that if you put this face here
like this two eyes above what might be a
nose or mouth versus you do it upside
down but put everything at the top of
the oval now the babies will prefer this
over this because there's more contrast
here there's more stuff more energy
coming off of the stimulus in this area
of the oval then over here even though
this looks more like a face so that
makes everybody say whoops no faces are
not special but this may be the
mechanism by which faces do become
special that is we come to the world
this is the other argument we come to
the world with a bias to look at things
towards the top here to look at the
stuff and contrast towards the top here
and part of that is due the claim is
because there's more there's earlier
development within ventral pathways of
the brain the dorsal pathways so this
just holds for the infant more
information above than below in this
oval now you can take that with a brain
of thugs salt if you want it's debatable
and lots of studies are going on in the
developmental literature about it but
for now I just want to point out that
the facts are that something at energy
and the top oval is more important than
energy in the bottom when you're born
this
may be why later on in life we still
continue to have problems recognizing
upsetting down faces so if you look at
these two faces right here and you may
or may not hopefully you will not see
that this one is the upside down version
of this and this one is the upside down
version of this if you look at these two
they're easy to tell apart if you look
at these two they're difficult to tell
apart so these two look like individual
people and these two not so much so what
goes wrong in developmental
prosopagnosia because most of us develop
from these early biases envision that we
may be may come equipped with two being
extremely good at recognizing faces and
but there's some people who just never
are able to learn that ability well this
work was done with Jody Gudas who's
sitting right here who is a is a UC
Berkeley Graduate as well but he's now
doing a postdoc at Harvard in the
Veterans Administration in Boston back
here for a wedding and to to follow up
on some of the work that we've started
doing um what we do to recruit people
with developmental prospec nausea is we
have a a cyst a screening questionnaire
on the net and if you go into my home
page you would find a much longer a set
of questions for you to answer and here
are some of the in here are some of the
examples of what's on this page do you
fail to recognize a close friend or
relative by sight well the answer to
that if you're prosopagnosia is yes does
it happen often when meeting a familiar
person out of context the answer to that
if your roast pig nose eglise yes even
some of us who don't think we're Prosek
nosy but maybe i am have a problem with
that do you also have trouble
recognizing facial expressions or
understanding the intentions or motion
estate of the others
exactly so if you are really pros a big
music you should say no to this if
you're just pretending you'll probably
say yes um do you have trouble
distinguishing other classes of objects
such as cars shoots shoes or coats the
answer to that is no and how do you can
you're an expert in cars no okay he's
gonna keep me honest have you consulted
a position regarding these problems now
if they answer no to this they're
probably a development approach big
music along with other screening
questions we have if they answer yes to
this we would probably still contact
them because if they have gone to a
physician over this they probably have
had some head trauma of some sort so
they would go into the other group the
acquired Proserpine knows yet group
alright because most people with
developmental prosa big nosing don't go
to a physician and say what's wrong with
me I can't recognize faces in fact I
have not heard of one case doing that
and then if they're willing to be in the
experiments and so when they come into
the laboratory we give them a structure
to interview and we also give them
several standard neuropsychological
tests as well as some cognitive tests
that we have developed that are
computerized measuring accuracy in
reaction time here is an example of the
type of thing of performance you'll find
on with a developmental prospect music
don't worry about all this word here
that's too noisy but this is a MZ I'll
refer to her she's a 51 year old woman
who's in our project she has normal
visual acuity normal contrast
sensitivity above normal intelligence
she's neurologically intact she's really
with it and I won't go through what all
of these tests are but just I will point
out that the red one the pink one and
the yellow one are all about faces
whereas the green one is memory for
words so like the word werrington faces
and warrington words it's the same
procedure exactly you're shown a bunch
of faces your ass later to pick out
which ones you saw or you're showing a
bunch of words you're out as to pick out
which ones you saw what you see here in
the normal distribution is
normal is that her performance on the
Warrington faces is down here outside
the range of normal whereas her memory
forwards is fine so we can be pretty
well assured that her memory is fine
it's not a memory problem per se and
then of course on the other types of
face test she's also down here one would
never expect a developmental
prosopagnosia to be very good at famous
faces because if you've never been able
to recognize faces or learn to recognize
faces then you're going to have a hard
time setting up a representation of what
is famous what faces famous ok then we
do some computerized tasks as well in
will show this maybe 45 seconds half a
second ok and then there's a small
length and then you're supposed to pick
out which of these faces you just saw
was that hard no ok it shouldn't be hard
for a person that has normal face
perception yeah it's this it's this one
right here I'm right right guy didn't
look yeah yes yeah so normals are very
normal face perceivers are very good at
this and people with developmental
prospec no seria are very poor you have
trouble telling those four different
people
they date with all look like the same
person to you
they will function here
um well doctors something actually they
are very similar in the sense that they
you know their hair is gone and so on so
the distinguishing features are gone
although this one should be quite
distinguishable from this one given the
nose yeah okay yeah yeah okay okay you
might have a bit um well biological
markers of face perception also have
suggested to people that faces are
special and I'll first go through
electrophysiology I'm going to go back
to that last slide though back actually
slide right here because I forgot to
mention something and that is that
remember MZ and her her performance
because we studied MZ for nearly three
years now and so we have issues one of
our first so we have more data on her
than we have on everybody else and so
I'm going to especially focus on her
results as we go through this it's still
difficult by the way to get a large
group of development of pros a big nose
Ock's I work with a colleague in in
Israel and together we have eight so we
look for people who are in the severe
range we want to make sure they're
clearly prosopagnosia and not just sort
of at the end of the distribution
although that's one question right now
that is in the literature on this is
whether prosopagnosia is actually a
qualitative or quantitative difference
than just normal phase perception okay
so um II geez I don't know really how
much you know about your P's and FM are
all that sort of thing I'm going to
assume not much because maybe someone in
here doesn't know much but anyway what
we do is we this is a top version of
ahead with the nose up here in the ears
out here and we have sensors electronic
sensors
that we attach to the scalp all along
here all the even numbers are in the
right hemisphere all the odd on the left
and we're going to be especially
interested on what comes out of po7 and
po8 and I'll tell you why in a minute um
this that's not supposed to do that okay
um at each of these lead sites what
happens is you show a stimulus and you
get an EEG wave and so for a single
trial things might look like this but as
you go on and get more and more trials
what's happening is that in these bumps
are starting to form a pattern of sorts
and by the time you get down to say 150
or two maybe sometimes 100 trials
depending on how much signal noise ratio
you have you can get a fairly
nice-lookin waveform that looks like
this now what's happening here is this
is being plotted this vertical line here
represents the moment at which the
stimulus comes on the the axis here
shows you timing that is how long after
the stimulus came on in milliseconds do
these waves happen and what you get here
is what's a nice p 1 positive up- down a
nice p1 which is thought to be more
sense well very close to the sensory and
automatic sort of thing and then you get
a very big dip around here and this
happens at about n 17 about 170
milliseconds after the stimulus and this
will happen to any visual stimulus so
you get it two objects or scenes or
phases or anything we're going to call
this the n170 although it can show up
anywhere between 140 and 200
milliseconds but you'll get this pattern
now through a great deal of studies this
has been replicated over
again we know that when a face is
presented that the n170 amplitude is
much greater than when any other type of
visual stimulus is presented so here's
where the stimulus comes on at about 170
milliseconds you see that all these
other types of stimuli even though they
are very different in terms of their
spectrum they have overlapping this is
an N 170 right here because even though
it doesn't go away negative it's going
negative going so these are all
clustering around here but now you show
a face and womp and this is very
reliable you get it in ninety-eight
percent of normal individuals that you
test um no I couldn't I didn't have time
to actually fix this for you to make it
easy for you to understand this but this
is a study an ERP study same sort of
thing they're showing objects and faces
and oh you're just passively viewing
them by the way they're just coming up
one at a time like this objects in
phases and again they're looking at the
n170 because the n170 nap in the normal
literature seems to be a face specific
marker don't know what it does exactly
but it is a face specific marker the
thing that is confusing about this is
that now negative is up and positive is
down and that's medical convention and
these are patients actually these are
people who have acquired prosopagnosia
from a very small lesion and what you
see here is the young this is the n170
and young controls and older controls
somewhat smaller that difference right
there but it is there and it's absent in
both of these patients now those are
patients who have acquired prospect
nausea we do know now though that there
are a number of individuals who have
development of prosopagnosia who show
either a reduced significantly reduced
and 170 or no nuns on 70 at all if you
look here this is the
n170 right going right there that's
control and the left over the left
hemisphere p7 p8 over the right
hemisphere nice and gigantic the faces
are blue the objects are red and here is
a single case called YT where you see
that the n170 is basically absent almost
over here and here it's not it's highly
significantly different very much
diminished in our own lab we have found
this as well these are two of our
prospective Ock's developmental and
here's a control group in this case all
people were doing was looking at a
series of pictures coming in and there
were either faces or watches or other
objects and they were just responding
whenever they saw a flower so they're
not responding to the faces or the
objects in any way they're just
responding whenever flower shows up so
then we can compare what the n170 looks
like when the watch appears versus when
the face appears and in controls we get
the expected nice and 170 because Green
is the watches read the faces there's
the nice and 170 in KW you see none in
MZ the person we saw the performance up
you see none so these are three at least
we have forth who do not show this n170
affect others have not been studied that
well yet to know whether they have
reduced n1 70s or not but at least in
terms of the nerve the
electrophysiological know by marker for
face perception the developmental
prospect Nozick's seemed not to have it
there's also another biomarker of face
processing that has received quite a bit
of tension and this is called the
fusiform face area this is a was
discovered through fmr and if you look
at the brain this is a cut of the brain
very low through here and underneath the
very bottom in the fusiform gyrus
there are a couple of areas that are
very active when faces are presented
compared to in other sorts of visual
stimuli presented so for instance if you
have this in this case actually this
particular scan was just tell me whether
that was the same as that so you're
actually responding to the faces in the
scenes but when you're responding but
anyway whether you respond to them or
whether you don't what happens is you
get a nice FFA stronger usually on in
the right hemisphere than the left so
this is highly active when these faces
show up small little bit over here and
also in the occipital fusiform area
which is posterior to that also over
here and of course the visual cortex is
here and back up a bit if there's
questions interrupt me okay all right
this is the first study that I know of
that had several it's the CP here that's
congenital prospect know so you could
same as developmental Pacific nauseam
because this is a figure right out of
this of this article and this is an
inflated brain so it looks a little
different i don't know if you've been
used to seeing these sorts of things but
what it does is to keep the gyri are
gray and the cell sci are white and it
also inflates it so that the underside
of the brain comes out you can see it on
the surface here all you really need to
know is oh and this is the frontal brain
in the back of the brain all you really
need to see here is here's ten controls
when they're seeing faces versus
buildings so here's a face affect the
FFA right there on the right stronger on
the right as usual then on the left and
here are the four of prospect knows eggs
and you see here this is really quite
normal right so the FFA has generated a
huge amount of interest in terms of its
face specificity and its involvement in
face recognition in normal face
perception and yet what we see here is
in congenital pacific knows
buddy in their life have this beautiful
FFA and ofa and MZ again the one who did
not have the n170 she too has a normal
face FFA and ofa so she so here again is
a replication so what we've seen so far
now in development of prosopagnosia is
that the n170 is very abnormal the fMRI
is normal the implications for that it
are that the n170 and these face areas
that we see activated on fmr are
measuring different aspects of face
processing we'll get back to that later
on because yes those four pictures of
birds up there yes they have other rooms
yes
oh yes so it's important don't know
typically for all for object recognition
face recognition
frontal regions aren't it's important so
they usually don't correlate with the
ability to recognize half these releases
so but there are some there are some
differences it looks it also looks like
for the person because I'm saying get
any more dispersed the in terms of the
activity down face area yeah these these
are significant effects up here and in
here so whatever they're doing with
faces the frontal lobe is acting
differently and developmental post big
musics then controls but we don't really
know why no no one has ever shown any
difference is in the frontal lobe and
when you get frontal lesions for
instance you don't lose the ability to
recognize faces so what do I decide I'm
looking for on person yeah compensation
possibly definitely and we know that
when you're trying to do something or
engaging control mechanisms that you get
more funchal activity and so if face
processing is hard for them perhaps it's
not surprising to find out there yeah
mm-hm earlier in the 170
look at and why it looked like the
problem isn't so much that they're not
respond to the basis is their response
yeah everything else is it the perfect
yes that's very good yes and we don't
know exactly why that is but this is
what we think is going on that what this
n170 is representing is actually the
distinction between objects and faces so
if you're born into the world and you
don't have the category of objects and
faces yet everything is streaming down
the same pathway it's only when you
start recognizing that objects are
special and you need to deal with them
specially that you try to put up this
categorization so we believe this is a
working hypothesis nothing more it's
really post hoc we believe that what's
going on is that yes objects are
actually going into a different in
through a different pathway and
therefore you're not going to get the
the magnitude the n170 year but so it's
an early categorization response so the
fact that they aren't different whether
they're both objects or whether they're
both phases you know if they were both
here or both here it would sort of say
the same thing so you need that early
categorization response in order to deal
with faces in the special way you do
maybe okay here are our questions in the
study i'm going to tell you about why
does the n170 reflect face recognition
abilities and development approach
musics while the FFA does not these
things are coming from the posterior
areas if you had a face specific area
which again is debatable but certainly
things respond more to faces than others
on the whole you need really needed n170
and an FFA why aren't they they
connected what visual information is
necessary to recognize faces and maybe
we can find us out by studying
developmental prospect Nozick's and can
fake face recognition be learned
and I'm going to start with the last
question which is can face perception be
learned because some of the answers to
the other questions fallout from what we
find out about this question can face
perception be learned in developmental
prospect Nozick it obviously can be
learned in children and so on and the
answer is yes and we have tried this
this training program that i'm going to
show you it's a computerized printing
training program it's very easy we've
tried it in five precipitous ixnay and
it has been successful in three we do
not know why it has not been successful
in the other two one of them one of the
other two is showing a trend he's in his
teenagers or late teens and the other
one is just not showing anything so but
we do have three people who have never
been able to recognize faces in their
life now going out in the world and
reporting that they can recognize faces
and I'll show you data that says they
are um well we entered this or we
started week after going through the
literature we just decided to start with
this sort of a task it'll call it's a
configural task that is configurable
training where we know the developmental
prospect Nozick's have difficulty seeing
these two is different you see them as
different okay do you see it as
different yeah yeah okay okay so they
have difficulty seeing these any as you
can see what happens well maybe you
can't see it but if you have know if you
have good face recognition abilities
this looks like a different person than
this but all that we've done here is to
move the eyes and mouth further apart a
little bit and not by very much and
that's what we're going to do in this
training it's configural training we
think that it's very important this the
second-order configural information of
the the small spacing differences
between the features of the eyes nose
and mouth and in in phase recognition
so all we're going to do in in this is
to move up and down the mouth from the
nose or to move the I browser and eyes
move that difference up here and this is
a unit i'll take my word for it right
now there's plenty of evidence and
literature but this particular triangle
here is very important in face
recognition it appears that at least not
not always but appears that the large
part of face discrimination is knowing
the aspect ratio of the spacing between
the eyes the nose and the mouth so we're
going to train that and see what happens
and I already told you that we're going
to be successful so you might as well so
it is successful and if you want
yourself just to feel whether the aspect
ratio is important or not if I give you
these three circles here and I ask you
which of these two on the side looks
most like this well in both cases the
eyes and the nose in the mouth have been
have been moved but in this case this
triangle has become a narrower and in
this case this triangle is it has the
same aspect ratio as this triangle and
almost and most people will say that
this face looks more like this than this
now remember when I told you about
turning things upside down babies well
even we don't do very well when we're
asked to compare these in terms of
upside down faces so now if you ask
which one looks most like this normals
will be about fifty percent of choosing
this one or this one so being upright or
being upright side down really matters
somehow in face recognition so the
trainee program goes something like this
the person comes in and we have John and
Joe or whatever and we say okay these
are the faces that you are going to see
and all of these are in the category of
Joe so when a face like that shows up
press the left hand button and all of
these are in the category of Jim so in a
face like that one of those faces shows
up you just press the right hand button
and what we're burying here again is the
eyebrow height and the mouth Heights and
that's all we're doing so these two are
very similar to each other um MZ I'm
going to focus on because she was the
best subject to do this and she was
willing to go off the training and on
the training and help us out with all
these things I think we've learned a lot
from her was willing to come in first of
all and do 750 trials per day for six
days which equaled 4,500 trials of this
really boring task hmm so all that
happens is this face shows up she says
is a category one or category 2 by
pressing the right button 500
milliseconds later the face she gets a
the face is still there she gets
feedback it says whether she was correct
on that trial or not and it says overall
what her her a percent correct is up to
that point so she's being given feedback
we change the faces each day for six
days so they're a little different hmm
different hair okay um and what you see
here and this is the training this is
over the four thousand twelve six days
this is plotted reaction time here she
starts out at about 13 seconds goes down
over time and asymptotes after about oh
say 2000 trials her accuracy which is
plotted over here starts at around
seventy five percent remember there's
very large differences in their to
seventy-five percent and goes up
gradually until she asked him totes at
about 2,500 on accuracy so you can see
that these reflect each other that
reaction time in accuracy reflect each
other well all right after this training
what happened to her ability to
recognize faces first of all she was
stunned that she could go out in the
world and actually recognize some people
from others and she reported this to us
so it appears to happen in the real
world other people that she knows are
reporting this as well this was before
training remember those faces and words
tests where words were really good and
faces were really bad this is after
training after training for six days
with this thing so here's the here's the
face task right in the middle war at the
memory task right in the middle here's a
matching task the pink one which is
still in the normal range here's the
famous faces still down here and again
famous faces are not famous for her so
of course she's not good at it and then
we just to make sure that this wasn't
due to some sort of practice we added a
new test norm test just to make sure
that that something she'd never seen
before that she would get better at and
that's this blue one right here and
indeed she does
she goes
what happens to her n170 before training
you saw this after training it's normal
here's the controls that's the micro
volts of the controls which aren't on
here this was before training and this
is after so you can see that the n170
effect is within the normal range of
course not much happens to the FFA
because it was normal to begin with and
if you just look at the activity
actually before and after so the open
bars are before the dark bars are after
you can see that there's really no
change in the signal that is coming from
these areas but that doesn't mean
they're normal it turns out that if you
do the right analysis you find that what
has happened after this training is
there's increased coherence between
areas of the brain that respond to faces
now how do you measure coherence well
this is measuring it in the this is an
example of from left and right left and
right cortex and so say you have a
signal here in a signal here now after
the stimulus goes off for several
seconds there's actually fluctuation in
the signal that goes along and until it
dissipates so here the the left side is
in blue so this kind of goes like this
for a while and over here is in red and
that goes kind of there for a while and
they sort of look like they're on top of
each other now if you just correlate
them you wouldn't get much of an effect
because there's this lag here so what
this coherence analysis does is correct
for that and gives you a coherence value
and these are just in the low frequency
the low frequencies and what it does is
give you a coherence value so it's you
can think of that as a correlation with
the time lag corrected and now it's 71
so in this particular case where someone
was looking at coherence between left
and right hemispheres there was 70 1.71
coherence a score of 0 of course is no
coherence one is total coherence and we
measured the coherence between the FFA
and the FA for MZ before and after
training this is the coherence value
before training these open bars there's
some coherence between these two areas
the FFA and ofa it's not very work very
much this is measured in an FM are taken
right after the training you can see the
coherence goes up enormously and after a
little bit of day or two after that it's
starting to go down but it's still
better than baseline gonna get to that
yeah right now actually her subjective
report while she was doing this this is
something one of the things that she
said it's really extraordinary how hours
in front of a computer changed how I
view the world for dab viewed the world
for decades it's as though a process was
started in the lab and it fed upon
itself taking on a life of its own and
the problem is though the effects
disappeared when training stopped okay
now yeah now now you say oh god you put
me through all this and and now what are
you telling me well I'm telling you that
from an experimental point of view this
is a good thing hahaha because we can
retrain and so we do we retrain yeah and
here is the baseline that you saw in
coherence this is when she was poor face
recognition these are the other the two
coherence majors you saw before when she
was good this is when she loses it again
and reports that she loses it and on our
tests she loses it poor it goes back to
baseline here is the retraining starting
up again and here it goes back to
baseline yes
yes there is savings there's definite
savings so she no longer has to go
through four thousand trousers
especially now actually she has gone
through so much training with us and
she's been so sweet because she's
willing to go off of it so that she goes
back to baseline so that we can try
something new the others aren't so
willing to do that but what we try to
talk them into it but you can see here
this I look at the reaction time 35
hundred milliseconds as opposed to 13
and she comes down and it's below 1000
as opposed to two below 2000 and so yes
there is savings and and at this point
actually what we did is I mean we're
done with these sorts of things and so
we put the training program on her
computer at home and every morning she
gets up and for about 10 minutes 15
minutes a day she does the training and
she's good to go for the day so it's
it's the message there is we have to
change our way of thinking about
rehabilitation especially cognitive
rehabilitation and and this is more like
well if you had high blood pressure
you'd have to take a pill every morning
well if you have development prospec
nosy the way she has it then what she
has to do is sit down at the computer
every morning and so it's a maintenance
sort of thing for her one of our others
actually went for 10mm knee three months
a hundred days before she started
dissipating so it looks like there's a
big individual difference in terms of
how often and how long you you might
have to train but this works well why
did training work maybe it's just
exposure to thousands of faces see a lot
of faces like that make it better or did
we really train configural processes as
we thought we were doing and
specifically would it be too upright
faces as you would expect from the
normal face literature um whoops that's
bad or did we train to features whether
they were spatial or not so this is what
we use with our standard training of
course and now what we did to see
whether it was upright
Pacific is trained her for thousands of
trials with upside-down faces and again
we just buried again the distance
between the mouth and the nose or the
eyebrows in the eyes so we did the same
here as we did here and then we took her
off of that and then she trained four
thousand and and we tested her and then
we should train for thousands of trials
here where there's a it's the feature
color difference it's not really color
its brightness there's a slight dimming
or or it's really luminant so there's
this like dimming of the mouth or the
eyes but it's we did it that way to make
it equally difficult and what happens
there you don't have to try to to
comprehend this because it's kind of
late in the day and it's maybe I've
overdone the amount of data I've shown
you anyway but here's in the inverted
face training when we when we tested her
on upright faces this is before training
with inverted faces this is after she
gets worse now if you show her bunch of
inverted injure face is she gets better
but that's not what we're seeking here
but she gets worse here on the future
training there's just no difference
before and after training so it's not
just the amount of time said she saw a
face or that there's some some change
but it's it has to do with the configure
training yes
if we train normal people do well we
haven't we haven't had a normal person
that's willing to sit down thousand
trials is your question we're going for
this test or if you drink well people
become super no I'm just asking that
Richie achieve
oh well you don't know on these tests
for sure we do oh no on the neuropsych
chest because those are normed and
certainly her warrington face memory was
right at normal it's not as good as her
memory for words yet so it probably is
not perfect but it's at least normal
yeah she performed the trade that's
better than anybody else she and she
could also do as well so she's but every
measure that we have she looks
there were times early on before we did
any of this that she would come into the
lab and not recognize people and you can
almost tell whether she's on her
training or not and whether she's
recognizing people in the lab she
recognizes you now even when she's not
been trained right you don't know yep
between a normal person on the upside on
faces yes yeah you would predict from
this a patient right that they should
get worse at recognizing upright bassist
a better recognize New Bern yes are you
at really looking at first addiction yes
because there are just to create the
other brain systems to girls yeah I
agree that is really got a question
right now that is oh I'm supposed to
repeat the questions this question was
whether we're really training or the
circus or are you training some other
circuits that are still abnormal but
acting a little differently but allow
face perception ok so I'm almost done in
summary individuals with developmental
process of Manoj it can be trained to
discriminate faces the new skill is not
dude Ameer exposure not due to learn
strategies change his fate up it's not
doing mere exposure and it's not due to
learn to strategies because you lose it
and the Train changes face specific
neurobiological markers both the n170
and at least the coherence between areas
in the posterior part of the cortex that
normally are our respond to faces and it
fades without training I told you that
I'll go on to the next one and i'll come
back to the questions the questions that
we were asking when we started this
study why does the n170 reflect face
recognition abilities and develop an
approach Nozick's while the FFA does not
well thanks extra face recognition
requires coherence among many face
sensitive areas
in the in the cortex and we saw that
coherence measure in the fmr and it may
be this coherence major that will
actually correlate with the n170 so it
may be the coherence that is required in
order to generate that n170 phase
specific effect what visual information
is necessary to recognize faces at least
one big important one is sensitivity to
aspect ratio between the features of the
face or what I'm calling configurable
processing and cam face recognition be
learned in adults with developmental
prosopagnosia the answer is obviously
yes and these are two other of my
collaborators this is shlomo benton from
he's a professor in the Department of
Psychology at Hebrew University and he
was very instrumental in getting me
interested in this while he was on a
sabbatical at Berkeley a few years ago
and this is Mark despacito who is
director of the brain imaging center at
Berkeley and part of the hell on wheels
neuroscience center and if you want to
go online and answer our questions and
if you're interested in being in
research that's the address okay thank
you yes any other differences in the
abilities of you were like subjects like
differences in language recognition or
we looked at differences other
differences differences in language or
differences in what was that like just
when I see people my boys recognizes
people by voice we have not looked at
recognizing people by voice although the
literature reports that people do not
have that problem in fact development
across big no.6 rely a lot on sound and
the voice and in language we haven't
done systematic sorts of studies with
language because all of the thing all
the neuro psych tests we has ever given
anybody and as far as the literature is
concerned they always are in the normal
range or even better than normal
sometimes say yeah sometimes whether
there are anecdotal reports that they
were slow readers slow and learning
reading and that sort of thing so there
might be something now we have look at
other perceptual abilities and we're
looking at reaction time we're looking
at really subtle differences but we have
found when you when you when you have to
organize something on the basis of a
configuration what we have found others
have found like for instance if there's
moving dots a congenital prospec nose
exhale a little harder time with that
than the other so that again is a
configurable processing type of of skill
and we found a bit of that too just in
stationary stimulant yeah
okay so that thing the statement is and
it's a good one that expression should
also be deficient in these individuals
because that requires configural
information in fact it doesn't you can
what you can look at I mean you don't
need to to configure the mouth with the
eyes in order to see that the eyes are
smiling and so you can look at features
and this is really what we think is
going on when you're not trained up is
that these these individuals the
development of postage nosey are looking
at individual features in your face
they're not making the gestalt like you
and I do so when you're looking at
individual features then if the mouth is
down and the eyes are smiling you're not
going to have the influence from the
mouth to the eyes so they they end up
then scoring as well as normals and
being able to differentiate expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
