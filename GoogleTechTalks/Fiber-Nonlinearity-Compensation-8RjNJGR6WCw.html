professional life at Monash University
working predominantly on the topic of
fiber non-linearity so today I'll be
presenting some methods of how to
improve one of the key parameters that
will enable kind of faster optical
communication speeds so the overview of
my presentation I'll start by giving a
rather quick description of the fiber
non-linearity model and how to model
these how these links have been modeled
over the years then I'll go into some
digital fiber non-linearity compensation
techniques so these are techniques that
you would use using using DSP either
before the trends before the electrical
to optical conversion at the transmitter
or after the optical t electrical
conversion stage at the receiver and
then at the end I'll present some
optical non-linearity compensation
techniques so these are techniques that
are done entirely in the optical domain
without using electronics or digital
processing so that in the context of
this presentation is mainly in the kind
of limit it's gonna be limited to
coherent systems so these are the
systems that are really becoming more
and more used in optical communications
less so ten years ago and only started
probably 2006 but into the future these
are the systems that will drive or
enable the capacity limits to keep
improving and by no means do I try to
make this presentation sound like it's
kind of all-inclusive these are methods
that kind of I've considered I haven't
done research on all of them I've gone
broader than my own research but
yeah by no means do I pretend that this
is an exhaustive search of all the
methods available okay so I'll start by
talking a little bit about this curve
anyone that's people in this curve is
probably more famous to the information
theory people for being the Shannons
capacity so there's some bound that
limits the maximum bit rate or the
maximum spectral efficiency that can be
achieved in any link and this is
governed predominantly by the by the
noise which is usually modeled as or
what additive white Gaussian noise
however in the optical channel because
fiber because optical fibers have a
nonlinear property which increases with
increasing signal power you cannot
indefinitely increase the capacity limit
by simply increasing the power so
original eventually you get to some
point where it kind of plateaus or
curves off and then if you try to go
higher than that you actually lose
performance and you have to play some
tricks to try to get your performance
back where exactly this falls off
depends on a lot of parameters such as
the type of signal you're using or the
optical link that you're using and and
various parameters that I'll be
discussing a little bit throughout the
next 40 minutes or so so looking at the
the fiber model any span of transmission
fiber so this might be some let's say 80
kilometers piece of fiber can be modeled
by initially a nonlinear step which
applies this phase retardation to the
signal that's proportional to the power
of the signal so that's proportional so
a a with respect to T is the optical
signal here and P is just a T squared so
here we have a phase shift which is
proportional to the intensity of the
signal now next we have what's called
chromatic this
version and this is the fact that in
fiber the different colors of light
travel at slightly different velocities
and in from from a forth first order and
the predominant effect is causes this
quadratic phase shift across the
different frequencies so we can see here
I've got these equations this equation
here written in the time domain and this
equation here written in the frequency
domain and that's just for ease so this
is the simplest kind of domain to
represent these effects and then all
this can be in any domain so I haven't
doesn't really matter it's just at the
attenuation of the fiber so you have
this attenuation parameter multiplied by
the length so as the signal goes through
these three steps you gets a nonlinear
phase shift you get a linear phase shift
that's dependent on the color of light
and then you get a some loss of power
and to accurately model a single piece
of fiber you need to do this
repetitively over and over again so
there's no general solution yet that
will let you model this fiber for any
arbitrary signal and get a correct
response at the output without doing a
numerical and iterative approaches so
you got to go round and round and round
now in an optical link of course they
are often thousands of kilometres etc
Kaz already mentioned you clearly cannot
go there with no amplifiers so we have
these things called optical amplifiers
in the link and so you can add these to
the model so every few every few steps
so when you get to when the when the
attenuation is such that the loss needs
the signal needs amplification we can
model with an amplifier and then we go
into the next band and we start the
process again so you have this double
two nested for-loops kind of thing in
your
non linear modeling so on that how this
is kind of a good leader or a good
prelude to describing some of the
digital techniques which were used which
is somewhat related to the nonlinear
modeling so here what the inverse fiber
model entails is that you have four you
could do this at the transmitter or the
receiver in this particular case it's at
the receiver so you have a key here an
optical receiver which Maps the optical
field into an electrical field and then
you have analog to digital converters
enabling you to generate a digital
representation of the signal and then
you can basically spin it through a
fiber model so you would have n would be
negative n of your real fiber D would be
the negative value of D of your real
fiber and attenuation would actually be
the negative attenuation so in this case
the power as you propagate will go back
up so this is of course a digital link
so you can do anything you want such
fiber parameters are clearly not
possible in reality so now this these
fiber models are very computationally
intensive they take a long time to run
and you need a supercomputer to that's
very very powerful to even cope with or
one link in real time so these this kind
of very elaborate method of
non-linearity compensation is clearly
not feasible for any real links so what
we can do here we can start well all
right so let's consider the case of a
dispersion compensated link now these
are predominantly delete how links
looked up at least to about the Year
2005
so we have what's called dispersion
compensation fiber this is a fiber with
the parameter that's got negative value
of D so it compensates for the
dispersion of the link so in effect each
fiber span has its dispersion
compensated and in such a link we can
approximate that all of the non-fat the
dispersion is equal to zero and all of
the nonlinear effects collapse to a
single module like this so therefore
were able to Martin we were able to kind
of approximately guess the nonlinear
products with only a single step and
that's and because it's only one step we
call this single step non-linearity
compensation
so once we've reduced it to once that
the computation becomes trivial and yeah
so the this is really a very small
overhead on the system on the digital
equalizer so the first time that this is
this was presented or proposed was for a
dpsk system using in a dispersion
compensated link and this was done in
2002 at Bell Labs so of course as I
mentioned before it completely ignores
the effect of chromatic dispersion so
full non-linearity compensation is
clearly not possible anymore as this is
a very big assumption but the benefits
were observed in the experimental lab
nonetheless so it's shown to work well
for low chromatic dispersion links that
is dispersion compensated links or links
or five links constructed with fibers
with very low dispersions okay so next
we talk about how to implement this in
the digital domain which is kind of more
practice
for here modern more modern coherent
systems so this is a I've effectively
swapped the optical Fae
optical circuit diagram for more kind of
signal processing things where this is
the signal multiplied by the conjugate
to get the power then you scale it by
this sum factor and then you apply this
to e to the take the original signal and
multiply it to e to the negative I X
where X is the compensation signal
coming through here and then that's
followed by a linear equalizer so this
method was first proposed by Professor
Kikuchi and by Arthur Lowry now because
the channel is memoryless the
computational complexity is very very
low and it's trivial compared to the
linear equalizers that are you that are
used already used in these coherent
systems so just like before it's only
good for low dispersion links and later
on we show that by placing a low-pass
filter here that improves the
performance of these single step methods
okay so to quantify kind of the benefit
that you can get we can we use we can
use numerical simulations for example
where the optical link is simulated in a
very elaborate method to guarantee or
with very short steps to guarantee as
good accuracy and the compensation
methods are done with this very coarse
single step method so there's the link
there it's quite it's a typical
dispersion compensated link 800
kilometer link with some pre compensate
dispersion pre compensation and then a
typical link with some residual
dispersion per span
so you can see here if we look at
optical power and we look at on on the
on the x-axis and the received quality
on the y-axis we can see here
so at low powers the signal is
predominantly predominantly limited by
noise or amplified spontaneous emission
and here the these the system with we've
been without pre compensation work about
the same because there's no fiber
non-linearity as you start to reach high
powers the signal without pre
compensation falls over and the
compensation gives you your benefit so
it lets you reach a higher power before
it falls over because it's approximate
it does fall over and when it falls over
it looks exactly the same shape as an
uncompensated case now that works very
well if you only have a single
wavelength channel but most optical
systems operate of course in the you
know top WDM regime where you have lots
of neighboring wavelengths space let's
say at 50 gigahertz apart and in such a
case the benefit that you can get so
that's the original graph is shown here
in green faded not to distract you and
the red is what you can get from this
method once you have kind of eight WDM
channels and clearly it's not very much
because the system is limited by cross
phase modulation so this is an effect
where to illustrate this effect we take
a modulated signal with an Aussie
modulation so this is the modulation
that typically used prior to 2005 just
for comparison it goes on and off and if
you take a fiber if you go through a
fiber or a link without any dispersion
the
signal is mapped completely on to the
probe and if you apply this phase
modulation that I talked about earlier
you can complete completely clean up the
signal again
so what then we propose is in order to
just like compensating self phase
modulation or the single carrier effects
we propose to put this method at the
front of the demultiplexer and
compensate for cross phase modulation
now in a dispersive link the mapping of
cross phase modulation is actually very
narrow band so therefore we need this
low-pass filter to be rather narrow from
on the orders of hundreds of megahertz
for 10 or 100 to Giga signals so you can
see here by using this low pass filter
we can clean up the so this should be
just a nun modulated probe and we can
see this signal here cleaning up the UM
modulated probe a little bit so we're
going to quantize the benefit of putting
this single step non linear compensator
at the front so here we see a single
channel performance and here we see the
performance if we put some legacy
channels in the system and we can see
here if we have cross phase modulation
we can improve the performance by around
by almost 2 DB and likewise with an OFDM
signal for example we can still go get
around 1.5 a 1.3 DB now in both these
cases I've kept the single channel
performance as you can see we're still a
long way away from single channel
performance so this cross phase
modulation compensation technique works
a little bit but by no means come kind
of gets close to compensating all of the
cross phase modulation
now because we can compensate for
chromatic dispersion with digital
techniques these days often people are
proposing to remove all of the dcs so
you can be and to compensate for
chromatic dispersion using using digital
signal processing this decreases the
cost of the link also so it decreases
the initial outlay and it's also been
shown that removing the d-caf actually
generates better nonlinear performance
for for high bandwidth systems so in
such a link it was proposed by Kelly and
Tim Roberts in 2005 2000 and 2006 to use
this step split step model at the front
of the link so you generate your bits
and then you pre distort the signal
before you go to your DAC which drives
your optical modulator so you pre
distort the signal for the link and
later in 2008 it was proposed by dr. Lee
and dr. it that this system was moved to
the receiver because at the receiver
you're in a better position to estimate
the link that you've just gone through
so in such a system tip the typical
implementation like the model before or
the equations that I showed before it's
easier to compensate for chromatic
dispersion in the frequency domain so we
use an FFT
to convert to the frequency domain
compensate for chromatic dispersion is
an IFFT convert back to the time domain
and then compensate for the fiber
non-linearity
and oh that's that sorry that about that
that's kind of stuffed up the slide a
bit but that is pretty much like the
previous slide so this is squaring of
the power scaling factor and phase
modulation okay so now this system here
allows requires rather at least one span
once backpropagation step per span and
in some of the estimations on the
computational power it was still
estimated that around somewhere between
50 to 100 times the computational
complexity of a linear dispersion
equalizer is required for once that to
compensate for one step per span for
let's say a 20 span link so that's a
little excessive and beyond the current
capabilities of DSPs so we need to
further simplify that and one of the
methods that was shown to be capable of
this is to use this low-pass filter
again so once again we introduced this
effect of a low-pass filter so to only
encapsulate the high sorry to remove the
high frequency intensity fluctuations
because they are suppressed by chromatic
dispersion anyway and this allows you to
compensate for multiple spans per step
so in a numerical in some simulations we
we did here while I did we can see here
that you can take your system so here on
this gap here is 0 steps so that means
just linear compensation and as you
increase the number of steps the
performance improves now what's
interesting to see is that the
performance improves almost on this
linear line if you have a
system without the filter but once you
put the filter in these performance
improves very very quickly as you reach
so sorry this is a forty span link so as
you reach let's say ten or even five
spans so that's only requiring so that's
a reduction you know by a factor of
around four or five the performance
starts saturating around here so that
and and the performance there is
comparable to one step per span so you
actually you can reduce the the number
of steps that are required by a factor
of around five to ten by adding a
low-pass filtering and here again you to
quantify the the benefit that you can
get this is in a single wavelength
system we can increase the nonlinear we
can increase the nonlinear threshold by
around by over three DB and the same for
qpsk okay so so we've talked a bit about
how you can model and and ways of
simplifying this technique called
digital back propagation but also it has
its limits now you would think that
since chromatic a chromatic dispersion
and fiber non-linearity are both
deterministic effects we should be able
to fully predict everything that happens
and if we did that if we encapsulated
the entire optical signal and we built a
very accurate model of a link you know
with all the computer with unlimited
computational power we should be able to
compensate for all of it and the
performance should just increase an
increase and that was not found to be
the case so it's found that the
performance did increase a lot further
maybe by 10 DB or so but then it
eventually felt fell back down again and
this is detailed in the nest Rafiq's
paper in optics express way he he
basically back from
entire signal through a fiber and this
can be this effect can be drawn to the
fact that you can have a ASE beating
with your signal and that effect
eventually becomes stronger than your
signal and that's why your signal starts
falling over again even if you have all
the deterministic effects covered so of
course the ASE component is random and
there's no way you can predict where or
how much or what kind of there is he
looks like so digital back propagation
has kind of a large potential especially
as the power in digital techniques and
signal processing is forever increasing
but in order to compensate for cross
phase modulation especially you need a
large number of interconnects and you
need a large number of stem so but even
then assuming that we can we eventually
overcome these issues it's a big if but
assuming that we do this this this
method is no not suitable for mesh net
networks because the wavelengths can be
switched and your neighbors may change
so we have a look at this pilot based
method which i think is quite
interesting so the preload is that in
2008
sandy Hansen proposed that we can use a
pilot to compensate for initially laser
phase noise oh sorry the format scan
Chuck my symbol there so that's that
book square is your signal so what you
do is you transmit a pilot with your
signal you remove the pilot with a
low-pass filter and then by doing that
you take
it's very becomes very easy to get the
phase information on that pilot and then
you compensate you multiply rather the
phase information of the pilot with your
original signal and that
compensates for the phase noise on your
signal because you assume that the
sidebands have the same phase
information as the pilot now so the
initial proposal was for laser phase
noise and laser phase noise is typically
a very narrow band effect of maybe three
or five megahertz so the filters use
were very very narrow however we can
also extend this to fiber non-linearity
fiber non-linearity is a much broad much
more broad band effect so therefore we
needed to move the signals further away
from the pilot to give the pilot more
space to allow our filter to properly so
I select the nonlinear products or the
nonlinear phase shifts however the the
initial performance improvement that was
achieved with this was not huge and this
was mainly due to the fact that you have
this self phase modulation effect and
that's a very very broad band effect
over several gigahertz and there's no
way you can leave a gap around the pilot
of that much without kind of completely
destroying your signal or your spectral
efficiency rather so you can see here in
a single wavelength case the pilot or
the carrier there is not very broadened
all you have this is big pedestal of
noise and in a multi wavelength case in
seven wavelengths here you see this
pedestal of noise is still there but the
pilot also has phase modulation so here
we this is what we recognized and what
we say is well we need to somehow clean
up this pedestal of noise within with a
different technique but we should be
able to take out the phase modulation
which has been caused by the neighboring
channels on the pilot and also the
signal are fairly well with this method
so we're going to compensate for only
the cross phase modulation and not the
self phase modulation
okay so this is this is an experiment
that we did to kind of prove as a proof
of concept to show that this method
works I won't go through all the details
of the transmitter but basically we
generated seven wavelength channels and
we're mainly interested in the middle
one and we're trying to kind of
compensate for the phase noise of the
middle one getting the interference from
the three either side of it
so this is the the optical spectrum that
we transmitted through the link and
that's the receiver setup so we use this
optical filter here to select only the
middle channel and this is a single
polarization experiment so we didn't so
we only need two outputs of the optical
hybrid
okay so the offline digital processing
comprised of firstly this single step
intensity based self phase modulation
compensator which is kind of like the
single step inverse model approach and
then we use this pilot based approach to
compensate for the cross phase
modulation and then we used a typical
always one tap equalizer to equalize out
the the phase response a little
chromatic dispersion response out from
all that from the channel so with no
compensation that's still with the one
type equalizer but without the without
any non-linear compensation we get this
line here it's so this is the kind of
the noise limited performance at low
powers and if high powers we have the
nonlinear limited performance now if we
only use the intensity method to
compensate for our self phase modulation
we'll get around a two percent
improvement in the nonlinear limit and
if we only use the pilot based approach
we get around also get around 2 DB
improvement about we lose a DB on the
noise side because we need some power
and some spectrum in order to send this
pilot through however if you lose both
if we use self phase modulation and the
pilot approach we still lose this 1 DB
because of the pilot being there but we
gain actually 6 TB on the nonlinear side
because now we're able to compensate for
both self phase modulation and cross
phase modulation and this actually gets
us around 3 DB away from the single
wavelength situation so so that shows
that we're compensating or for around
half of the cross phase modulation in
terms of intensity
so this is kind of like a summary slide
you get one DB so you should get three
but you actually get five so this MPB
improvement in the total margin so this
shows that this meant these these two
methods kind of have synergy benefits so
using them together is better than using
either is better than just the simple
sum so it's a case where the whole is
more than more than the sum of its parts
so that was for a dispersion managed
link there and this is for a dispersion
unmanaged link these results were done
at Nokia Siemens Networks so you can see
the power curve here so it shows a
similar thing where so these are not
dispersion managed though the self phase
modulation technique was changed to a
multi-step inverse fiber model or
digital back propagation the digital
back propagation curve improves the
performance by roughly around that much
the cross phase modulation chose the is
shown by the orange curve and that
increases it but less and the sum is
above all of them so here we can see
once again in a dispersion unmanaged
case you still have synergy benefits
with an inverse fiber model okay so now
I'll move on to the optical techniques
and this will incorporate here I'll
discuss some mid-span spectral inversion
some end link compensation and
subcarrier symbol ring okay so I'll
start with optical phase conjugation so
optical phase conjugation is where you
use you set you go halfway and then once
you go halfway you conjugate your signal
and then you go the rest the second half
so the idea here used to use so that's
inverting the spectrum so the idea here
is to use the second half of the link to
compensate for the first half of
so here in this particular experiment we
tried to go through a ten span link of
just 80 kilometers without any
dispersion compensation as the reference
link and then we went through a case of
an optical phase conjugate ER so we went
through five spans your optical phase
conjugate Oh using highly nonlinear
fibers and then a second half of the
link so here we see just two back to
back here so this is without the link
itself just the back to back performance
and then followed by the back to back
performance with an optical phase
conjugate so this shows here the
degradation caused by the phase
conjugation process and this is the link
performance so here is launch power
through the link of course it's in the
not relevant when you're not going
through the link and there's the
performance for optical phase
conjugation so we see here because the
phase conjugation causes some power loss
in the middle of the link we see a small
penalty on the noise side but we can
gain a very large amount on the
nonlinear side so on the high powers we
can see here the link is if the second
half of the link is effectively
compensating for the first half and for
this particular signal we can see in the
OSA it's probably too small for you guys
to see the signal was a hundred and
sixty gigahertz in bandwidth carrying
1.2 terabit per second sorry
600 gigabit per second signal on a
single polarization and so supposed to
respect results for a single
polarization you can actually replace
the optical phase conjugation module by
this by a module that looks like this
with a optical recirculate er and this
loop here which makes it polar
insensitive and use unusable for a
polarization but kind of polarization
multiplex signal that's kind of more
commonly used and we've got experimental
results to suggest that as very similar
benefits to their work to those shown in
the results previous are capable is
simply by changing the signal to a
polarization multiplexed signal and
changing subbing this in for the
conjugation module okay some some good
previous works this paper here is a very
kind of detailed paper that goes through
and quantifies if you if you had an
ideal optical phase conjugate oh how
much benefit can you get in terms of
non-linearity compensation threw out the
link akka thority I've flashed up
quickly on the slides before the
compensation is not perfect because it's
impossible to fully match up or phase
match the second half of the link to the
first half so you're not going to get
full nonlinear compensation and this
paper here quantifies how much benefit
you can get in a very kind of rigorous
mathematical way and the second paper
here it's also goes through this is
actually done by our lab this goes
quantifies the requirements on your
optical phase conjugation module now the
I don't have this is this is a piece of
work that was never done in our lab but
it's interesting nonetheless so I've put
it in and if had a kind of look at it
briefly now you've got in this case
rather than using your optical phase
conjugation module in the middle of the
link which might be in the middle of the
ocean if you're in a submarine link it
might be in the middle of the desert if
you're in a long haul terrestrial link
so my point is it might be in a location
where power and
and servicing might be very impractical
and so it's not really desirable to
build a link with a complex optical
module out in the middle of the field so
alternatively you can try to move that
to either the transmitter or the
receiver where you're guaranteed to have
an abundance of power now because if no
longer got the second half of link to
mitigate the effects of the first half
you're gonna have to artificially create
some nonlinear module that's going to
create some both some chromatic
dispersion and some non-lead fiber
non-linearity that's that will
compensate or at least partially
compensate for the link that you're
going to go into now the challenge here
of of these methods is really to go in
to this the module that you're going to
add at a very high power to minimize the
effect of amplified spontaneous emission
or optical noise because if you go
through this the same link then you're
getting no benefit at all because what
benefit you gain in non-linearity
performance you'll lose in noise
performance yep so of course the second
challenge is also to have the nonlinear
distortions and the chromatic dispersion
very matched to your link to maximize
the potential to maximize the benefit
that's gained from these methods I don't
have any results to present on that but
some papers that are interesting
so I'm aqua Lucy that's clear hasn't
happened yet so this might not be
available online yet but he has a paper
at at Clio this year them experimentally
demonstrating a polarization multiplex
dpsk that was a very twitchy that's a
very twitchy system I know because it
wasn't coherent so he actually had to
play with polarizations a lot but a lot
of fun for him anyway and another paper
this is a simulation paper in an optical
backpropagation
so this is an interesting kind of
hypothetical paper because it proposes
that you could use a very high
dispersion some or some very high
dispersion sections and some very highly
nonlinear sections to mimic the actual
link so almost to do back propagation
but do it optically so in in this case
you could easily run through multiple
wavelengths all single wavelength or a
band you know any bandwidth you wanted
with these optical techniques they're
not bandwidth limiting and nor do they
consume a huge amount of require huge
amount of multiplies so he proposes
using some exotic fibers and some fiber
Bragg gratings some other materials or a
mixture of a whole lot of things but the
challenge is kind of there of course it
was you could do anything really because
it was simulation so the challenge
really is the find suitable set of
materials to do this with okay so this
is the final method thank you for being
so patient is okay so these papers here
have shown that the nonlinear limited
performance is somewhat somewhat
dependent on the symbol rate of the
subcarrier so in this particular case
I'll go on here
so there's summary of the results there
so in this particular case this is what
we're talking about so you've got let's
assume that we want to fully load up the
optical band that with a maximum amount
of signal let's say for a terabit per
second a channel or beyond we have to
use multiple optical carriers so in this
particular case I've just put the
transmitters next to each other and I've
put and I've made the symbol rate equal
to the subcarrier spacing so this is
users effectively uses Nyquist pulsing
and has the zero gap so in a practical
system probably you need five to ten
percent
but this is an idealized kind of lab lab
test that we didn't need them and what I
did was I changed the subcarrier spacing
and hence also changed the board right
so I maintained the spectral efficiency
to be constant and they used QPSK
modulation format this is a numerical
simulation by the way so we can see here
that this is for 800 kilometers if you
go a very low subcarrier spacing that's
slightly less than 1 gigahertz then the
performance is very poor and that
improves and gets to around optimum at
around 6 or 7 gigahertz and that falls
off again now for a long the link we can
see that obviously the net performance
is worse but the interesting thing here
is that the peak of this curve is at a
different point so the peak at this
curve is now only at 3 gigahertz so for
along the links or for more dispersive
links you need a lower simple rate
rather than a higher simple rate as some
intuition may suggest so for the case of
3,200 kilometers actually if you wanted
to go 100 Giga board that gives you
quite a large performance penalty so you
don't want to do that so it's not this
this simulation set here shows that it's
not optimum to perpetually increase the
board rate and this like I said seems
rather counterintuitive because you
would think with a larger board rate you
would get kind of a shorter correlation
length nonlinear color or correlation
lamp and the performance should improve
but this kind of these slides here show
tell a story in that if you have a very
high board rate you have very low
intensity fluctuations at low
frequencies but
if you once you go through some
dispersive fiber your high baud rate
signal increases gains a lot of
distortion because it's so dispersed so
you your signal becomes very quickly
looking just like noise whereas if you
have a low baud rate system the signals
kind of hold their form they keep
looking like what they did originally
and they do not increase significantly
in in intensity fluctuations at
particularly at low frequencies so here
as we go through more and more fiber we
can see the low frequency intensity
fluctuations actually highest now at the
100 Giga board case and lowest at the
6.25 or the yeah on the six point two
five Giga board case so that's why the
six point two five and for the longest
link the three point one two five
systems operate the best or have the
best performance okay so that's the end
just to summarize non-linearity
compensation is is needed to increase
the capacity Times distance product but
no readily implementable kind of
non-linearity compensation techniques
have really been used each have kind of
have their advantages or show promise
promising results have been generated
but are not necessarily very practical
in a real system and in the future we
may need multiple multiples of these
techniques to give you some performance
in significant performance increase
having said that this Google people
might know this better than me so I
might be wrong here but to the best of
my knowledge non-linearity compensation
has never really been used in any
commercial systems
apart from kind of using intelligent
link design
like in the case of nrz or indeed
incoherent case where you're using more
taking the DCF out for example apart
from that you really we really haven't
specifically looked at how kind of
implemented specific techniques to
improve the non-linearity performance
and that could be because it it's quite
hard and it's quite hard to get
significant benefit so maybe a good
starting point is to take the links that
we have and to look at optimizing the
signal like changing the symbol rate
like in the final demonstration there as
a first step to building kind of systems
which are more tolerant to fiber
non-linearity thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
