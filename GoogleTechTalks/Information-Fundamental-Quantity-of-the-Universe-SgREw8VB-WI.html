here this morning today I we have a very
special guest especially very close to
my heart I'm originally from from Mexico
I grew up in the border and there is a
college in the border area that about
eight years ago I had a chance to meet
one of a professor of engineering there
even though I did not take class with
him directly a good friend of mine was a
student of him an apprentice and through
him I got to know professor Cardinals
Garcia he is retired now so when I asked
him how what should I highlight and what
I should and he said well mentioned that
I'm retired with people sometimes take a
different ways but the part that I
mentioned is he had a long career in
mechanical engineer he has his masters
of engineering his his undergraduate and
his doctorate from the University of
Maryland at College Park and he has over
a hundred fifty publications in
mechanical engineer after that he moved
to the united states patent and
trademark office and in the last couple
of years he has a kind of explore some
of the interest during the last few days
that we interact with him we got to know
that this is kind of one of his true
passions that is one of those things
that you said a win when you have the
time and you don't have kind of the
expectations of what you ought to be
doing what are the things you want to do
with with your life and for him his
intellectual curiosity was exploring the
topic that he will uncover today his
main objective when he wanted to come to
Google I told him a little bit about our
culture of tech talks then the wide
range of topics that that are presented
at Google and I encouraged him to to do
it the common present here and the main
objective today is is for all of you to
get it back to ask the hard questions
and I think he is looking forward to
that type of feedback and intellectual
stimulation and conversation so
officially the top will go maybe for
about 30 to 35 minutes and that will be
Q&amp;amp;A but but please feel free I will have
a mic if you have questions throughout
the
rather talk and we'll pass it around as
these talk is being recorded so just
raise your hand I'll pass on the mic but
again feel free and encouraged to if you
have any questions or any any sort of
feedback to engage in the conversation
the topic itself is about information
and what information is at a very
fundamental level there the code that
Professor calendar Garcia brings is from
somebody else's information is the
difference that makes a difference but I
don't want to kind of steal his thunder
and so please welcome a professor at
high makuraners Garcia it's great to be
here and address this select audience so
in terms of an outline I'll go through
an introduction which will introduce a
lot of thing in information and then
he'll look at the organism in the
environment and that allows for two
things one is how is cognition generated
in an organism and then also what those
information I have to do with that
organism and again you know everyone
talks about the information age and of
course this is the place where
information is looked at in great detail
you know information shapes human
society and then of course as time has
gone on different things have happened
in terms of technology that have
furthered they I guess the the sparrow
information information whether good
accidentally wrong or deliberately
deliberately false with their
educational artistic entertaining or
erotic as we come a trillion dollar
business so it's important formation
isn't gonna transform censored
classified securely preserved or
destroyed information lead nations to
prosperity or into power
they create and sustain life or destroy
it information processing power
distinguishes humans from our ancestor
primates and other animals and then he
formation processing machines are
getting faster cheaper better smaller
yet I guess in a sense we are the the
most exquisite information processing
machine our own self-consciousness
without which we would not be humans
involves and interplay in real time of
information on the past from the present
and about the future an interplay in
comprehensively complex yet so totally
coherent that it appears to us that's
just one process we live in a very
analog we live a very experienced ok so
again I think tall this requires in a
explanation I've there's a fellow named
roeder from which I'm taking some of
these quotes and effectively this talk
is about understanding how human beings
we interact with information and in that
sense we have to ask what is human
cognition what is information and if you
go back and say just well what are its
origins the Latin origin refer to two
fundamental meanings one is the action
of giving a form to something material
the other is the act of communicating
knowledge to another person and again
the trivial meaning is what's in the
paper today to code nor where Norbert
wiener he says information is
information not matter or energy no
materialism which does not admit this
can survive in the present day the
question is does he know what
information is I would argue that he
does not I'm effectively do we know what
information is an effect
Google know what information so what is
this powerful your ethereal something
that resides in CDs books sound waves is
acquired by our senses and controls our
behavior sits in the genome that's what
people say and directs the construction
and performance of an organism it's not
a digital pits on the CD the font in the
books the oscillations of air pressure
the configuration of synapses and
distribution of neural activity in the
brain or the bases in the DNA molecule
they all express information but but
they're not the information shuffle them
around or change their order ever so
slightly and you may get nonsense on
this or destroy and intended function
information can take many forms and
still mean the same what counts in the
end is what information does not how it
looks or sounds how much it is or what
if it is made of information can take
the form the same form and mean
different things to the same person or
two different persons information has a
purpose and the purposes with our
exception to cause some specific change
somewhere sometime and these last a
couple of things that I don't
necessarily agree with but the last
statement is the information may lay
dormant or for eons but you do it is
always intended to cause some specific
change and and here's where it gets
interesting information always has a
source or a sender and a recipient it
must be transmitted one to the other and
for the specific change to occur a
specific physical mechanism must exist
and be activated we usually call this
action information processing
information can be stored and reproduced
in the form of the original pattern or
some transformation of it for the
transformation to embody the same
information is it must somehow be able
to lead to the same intended change in
the recipient again I think this last
statement is questionable information
may be created transmitted through space
and preserved or stored throughout time
but it also
may be extracted so some questions its
information reducible to the laws of
physics and chemistry does the universal
in its evolution constantly generate new
information or information and
information processing exclusive
attributes of living systems related to
the very definition of life as you'll
see it's true that information is tied
to life and cognition is tied to
information unaffectedly to life there
is a historical process that has to
precede the creation transmission
preservation storage and extraction on
information this historical process I
choose to call distributed cognition or
the eminent dialectical relationship
between life and information that's a
mouthful but one interesting thing is
that information is physical
if somehow you can identify information
it's always engraved in something you
could talk about ideas information is
synonymous with an idea and ideas are
engraved in our neurons and so it is
physical
information causes some specific change
somewhere sometime the discussion should
be about the origin of life and how
information came into being as a result
there is an imminent dialectical
relationship between life and
information again a month therefore
there is no purpose to information
except in the context of life and
cognition an organism is in constant
recursive interaction with information
from inception so from the time that we
become living beings we're one cell then
we are dealing with information this
emphasizes the dynamic nature of life
and information I chosen to bring up
some principles of dialectics dialectics
is something that really doesn't get
talked about very much but one aspect is
that matter above absolute zero is
always moving and changing so change is
a constant of life if you look at an
atom zero absolute nothing moves a
little above zero absolute things move
matter moves and changes in a sequential
dynamic of continuous development again
that's something that you can I guess
you can experience matter moves and
changes in a contradictory dynamical of
continuous development and then I site
pieces antithesis and synthesis again
what's the dynamic of life of an apple
clearly there's a seed you planted a
tree grows you produce apples you
produce seeds and then the cycle start
over again and again it's sequential
it's predictable some extent we all are
born and we all die then the more
interesting thing is quantity
quantitative changes in moving and
changing matter lead to qualitative
changes this might seem counterintuitive
but consider something like water um
what do you do
we let's say it's frozen you are heat to
it which is the lowest kind of energy
that you can add so quantitatively then
it becomes water at a certain
temperature the quality is different
then you add more and more heat then it
becomes vapor an atom you simply add
energy to it the mellotron jumps quanta
and of course you the same thing is you
can remove energy and again the the the
electron goes to a lower orbit uh now
what I what I want to say is this is the
typical way we think about things um
well here I define a motion and and
cognitive and sometimes people think
they're very different you know we we as
living beings well are naturally
emotional but but I guess eventually but
but but somehow people look to a to
explain emotion differently then and
then being cognitive or or being
rational I I believe that there they
they they come well they come from us
they come from the same I guess source
Hodgins he coined the term distributed
cognition and what he was doing is
seeking to understand the organization
of cognitive systems by observing human
activity in the wild so and then he said
well cognitive process may be
distributed for example if you are team
here in Google clearly different members
do different things and so this
cognition is distributed across that
social group it also it's distributed in
the operation of the Caliph the system
involves coordination between the
internal external material and vital
environmental structure and finally
through time in such a way that the
products of earlier events can be can
transform the nature of Labor events he
has the perspective that somehow I guess
we have emotions and also we're
tional I don't have that perspective I
think you can find both elements in in
any human being and and again I my
definition of distributed cognition is
different and emphasizes this which is
the ability of an organism to interact
with its environment that's something
that we do every day since since I guess
we can remember and our purpose in doing
that is simply to satisfy our
physiological and social needs and
something we that really comes later is
simply survival and sustaining ourselves
so I think what's primary is as we sit
here we're breathing if we didn't be
that I mean somehow we would not be able
to to do what we do but that's something
that motivates us to continue doing what
we do and again I don't see
physiologically that's a static they
tend to develop sometimes you develop a
flavor for a tesla vehicle right again
it could be a physiological need if you
want to view it that way and and here's
a the photo op array autopoietic hum
static organism or iesous is simply
self-production
so if you're looking at at an organism
interacting with its environment this is
the basic unit of analysis that we
should use so you have the entire the
the environment and the organism it
interacts with the environment this
interaction is not is let me say it goes
both ways but but it's not symmetrical
now eventually this organism initially
it's just a it just has a protective
layer that is all that that exists in
the environment and of course in it
resulted from the environment and its
really a separation that that that is
achieved from the environment but
eventually of course it it senses the
environment in some ways and again here
you know I you're looking at the five
senses that we have but of course
depending on the organism you would have
different senses and eventually we
become I da ting organisms and and here
I want to talk about the PSR view which
is the personal subjective relative view
each of us is a subjective being so
therefore we have a unique personal
subjective relative perspective of the
world we do now the question is some
people say you know if you if you
achieve science or scientific thought
and then you're totally objective and
again I'll clarify that in a minute but
the question to ask those scientists
that think so is how a subjective beings
they evolved to being objective that's
what I would ask
if they have a good explanation then I I
think they'll find that it's not so
simple now if you're looking at this PSR
view this personal subjective relative
you so what type of behavior should we
expect if we're all alone well I would
argue that we can thank any thought that
we want we can believe anything that we
want right if
in the middle of nowhere okay that's
what we we can be leaving anything but
what is the one thing we cannot believe
good answer but but I would argue that
it's something that will lead us to our
demise that it is the thing that we
cannot believe because then we die and
it doesn't matter anymore right but
we're not alone right when we're born
we're born into a community of human
means everybody has a mother so we're
always relating to to other human beings
and mainly this is the the world that we
live in now if you look at any of these
two beans I da ting beings you notice
that of course the environment is at the
bottom and then there's another being to
the side that can all also be considered
as part of the environment right so so
when we talk about distributed cognition
that definition that i gave you
previously also relates to there being
other beings other beside you that are
part of your environment and there's no
really there's no difference between
let's say inorganic or even animals
plants and another individual in certain
ways now as you can see also there's a
PSR v1 and there's up here PSR view to
denote it there now and i and i have
some circles that denote the universe
that each each individual has but then
there's a shared universe that you need
to develop a consensual space
you are going to interact with another
individual and that's always a
negotiated space but I mean we're
speaking I'm speaking in English and you
understand okay that's our consensual
space you might not agree with the idea
that I present and again we some of this
with some of them you might agree with
some of them you might not agree and so
therefore there's a shared universe
what that share universe provides you is
is is an impersonal objective absolute
perspective which is sort of the area of
agreement which is is a little more well
a little more impersonal it applies to
both of you right it's a little more
absolute it and and it's a little more
objective and you can argue that science
is in that space
right we make discoveries on a personal
basis but then we share it and I agree
on things on a consensual basis
religion is also there there's an
intersubjective subjective space right
and so so again here you find your
agreement with other people but there
there might be different spheres in
which these agreements take place of
course it's if it's in the scientific
sphere you have to clear about what that
means right if it's in a religious
figure again you have to be clear what
it means and and if the thing is that
they be let's say the PSR view has to
coexist with the IOA view they coexist
and they develop historic
right now the question is if you look at
the the interrelations on the sides do
we have this same relationship let's say
with inorganic matter let's say with our
iPhone or the google phone
and I will arrive you that we do we do
develop a consensual space but it's a
consensual space that we dictate
yet in the end we forget that we
dictated it if the son is a God but
after a while we sacrifice things to
that God
but it's not
somehow we we gained an agreement that
the Sun has anything to do with it it's
it's a reflection of us in gaining that
perspective
you know in developing that shared
universe okay and sometimes we look
loose track of that and again this is a
nice picture to sort of emphasize that
point you know and then you can argue
whether those two PS the beans with a
PSR view one and two are collaborating
or not right so this talk I in general I
said was about defining a basic unit of
analysis which is the autopoietic oh no
static organism and its environment that
interacts with its environment and
cognizes with a purpose to satisfy
physiological and social needs and this
is the personal subjective relative view
and that leads to survival and
sustenance which basically reflects more
the impersonal objective absolute view
and the basis for distributed creation
to occur is information
now it's interesting also if you start
looking at us from from an embryonic
perspective what you find what you see
here is that we one of the there's an
embryonic plate that that of course
after conception and it has three layers
one is the ectoderm the other one is the
mesoderm and the other one is the end
odor initially it's flat but then
eventually it it it becomes it coils
right and the the ectoderm is on the
outside the endoderm is between our
mouths and our angels and all ancillary
organs related to that and then the
mesoderm is our bones and our muscles
that's what we are now the ectoderm has
an interesting aspect and that is that
it it's not only our skin but it's also
our senses and also our central nervous
so clearly there's a direct connection
even from embryology between our senses
and brain and and so again to talk about
the the brain in a jar I think it's a
waste of time you have to get the the
census involved in some way now what
what do all our senses have in common
and again this is a pictorial view of of
the senses well what they have in common
is that all sensorial elements end up as
as biochemical and bioelectrical signals
to the brain it doesn't matter where
they come from it's interesting to note
that sight smell and hearing are
directly connected to the brain well
I'll touch on taste are indirectly
connected maybe that just reflects
historically that torch and taste were
more primitive senses and sight smell
and hearing are more recent the other
thing is sight smell and hearing are
long-distance senses the other ones are
direct senses and so sense of c2
is an interesting thing can you imagine
seeing with your skin this is a work
that was done back in 69 and basically
that individual picture there is holding
some basically a matrix of electric
electrodes which he puts them against
his skin
and then those are connected to a video
camera and then a person with that
equipment in one afternoon could be
trained to grab a ball that's going
alone a new client and that individual
being blind okay so that tells you a
little bit about our senses and our
brain and this is another individual I
guess he climbed Mount Everest you can
see the the video camera that's on his
head and of course in this case the
sensing or rather the transduction I
guess is done through this phone I'm
electrode to let you know that tells you
about I guess that we we can be trained
in different ways and it doesn't really
matter where we get the the electrical
signals going into our neurons but we
are sensitive enough that we can
accommodate that on and their sin
substitution so in some of the world
with regard to our senses at least the
world between have it and discover why
way or census is dynamic right our
senses are bombarded with a never-ending
barrage of parallel stimuli which I call
sensorial maps if you put your hand on
an object that's a sense for your map
but honey and again that's in soil map
last until a split second later there's
another sensorial map right and again
with regard to the stimuli their
multi-directional in origin varying an
amplitude and duration and multi-source
you know the universe consists of
spatially and temporally distribute
matter and energy a sensorial map
results from the response of our senses
to the matter and energy of the universe
a comparison of two sensorial map
separated in space and time leads leads
to a discernment of a defense in order
to get a difference you really need to
compare two things in our case these two
sensorial maps they lead to a different
information or an idea is a different
that is a difference that makes a
difference to a living being
and again you know I want to go back to
sort of the principles of dialectics and
matter moves and changes in a
contradictory dynamic of continuous
development and and really we're
assessing differences and and then
building on them and to show how that
might occur in this particular case you
can see there are two sensory Maps the
two yellow and which end up into an
information map and then in the orange
the same thing occurs and these could be
sensorial n elements that are either
next to each other or or in or in a
sequence of time now of course you could
have many of them and again the same
process occurs or you know you can have
I mean this could be site this could be
a sound this could be torching whatever
so so again the point is that you end up
with these information maps all over the
world now and then you know you can say
okay here's sensory map a since we might
be okay the information map is the one
on the right I mean it could be as
simple as that now what if you compared
to information laps
then you might get a pattern of some
kind what if you compare two patterns
you can get a meta pattern as you can
see that it can become an exponential
process with regard to acquiring
information related to your environment
and then of course this can go on right
and and we can become very sophisticated
I guess processors of information so the
environment which we inhabit may be
characterized as consisting matter
energy expressed as continuously
changing and radiating fluxes our senses
limit the consciousness and unconscious
perception and processing of this
never-ending and infinitely radiating
fluxes of matter and energy which are
multi-directional in origin varying in
amplitude and duration multisource our
senses detectives radiant heat fluxes of
matter and energy as sensorial maps
since oil maps reflect the structure of
these radiating fluxes of matter and
energy the sense of touch 2d three
reasons for maps occur over our whole
body because of the nature of our
container sensors a comparison of two
sins for your map separated in space on
time need to determine of a difference
which is an idea a difference an idea
that makes a difference is information
so basically sensorial maps lead to
information apps here
I just want to emphasize again going
back to looking at an organism for you
to notice a difference somehow you have
to be motivated to notice it if you're
in a room or even talking to someone
really what motivates you can't really
absorb everything that in the room what
motivates you is is that moment right
nothing else the rest is you don't
really care about and and I argue that
physiological and social needs are
really what drive you're looking for
these differences for this information
that's in the environment and this
process oriented to the discernment of
information maps is the learning process
the process of the sermon of information
labs is the process of learning in the
process of learning also leads to the
sermon of patterns in our environment a
pattern results from the comparison of
these two information apps in the same
way that an information map is the
result of the comparison of two
sensorial apps a meta pattern results
from the comparisons about these two
parents and so on right so basically
that's what how we acquire information
now the question is when does it become
meaningful it's one thing to have a
machine that is capable of doing this
the question is well how do I get
meaning out of that and
let me summarize this this last well it
is slides in the following way my
daughter was recently trying to train
her little girl to go to the bathroom
and so there's a method whereby you you
follow the child for during the weekend
and as soon as you see them going to the
bathroom you basically you sit them down
I'm supposedly after a while they get
the meaning of what what one thing means
with regard to the other this is
basically what it's saying what these
things are saying and that's a result of
James Gibson and he says I'm being
information is always up always
available Flo is created by the movement
of the observer alright the shapes the
pic the underlying invariance the
structure of the optic array if we move
around the room there are things that
remain more or less the same they're in
my environment right and we can say oh
that's the same I'm looking at the same
thing visual perception is panoramic and
over time the panorama is registered the
conveying of information about the world
by ambient light sound and older
structure distribution of energy in an
ambien array that specifies event or
aspects of events in the environment so
so again the point of all of this is
that you know if you if you look at
something long enough right you'll find
meaning in especially if it relates to
satisfaction all of physiological needs
and social needs this is just a
schematic or basically the organism and
the environment and a flow diagram
relating of how sensory data gets gets
processed
let me let me get to information this
Wilkins in the 1600s talked about a
difference that makes a difference I I
won't dwell with it this is the original
book and this is sort of the translate
or the they just copying what he said
but he talked about for in general we
must note that whatever is capable of a
competent difference perceptible to any
sailings whereby to express the
cogitation so he is aware of a
difference that makes a difference which
is basically what Bateson said and I
guess I'm more current version of what
his information came out of a
mathematical theory of communication by
Shannon and he said that the fundamental
problem of communication is that
overproducing at one point either
exactly or approximately a message
selected and at another point frequently
the messages have meaning but the the
semantic aspects of communication are
irrelevant to the engineering problem so
he wasn't concerned really with a
meaning of a message it was just
concerned with sending or communications
and this is really the jest of what he
what he did you know you have a min
formation source who generates a message
of a transmitter you have a signal that
we're noise is added you know through a
channel then the signal is you see by a
receiver and then it is sent on to to a
destination right after its transcribed
you can look at telegraphy from this
perspective right somebody writes on a
message gives it to the to the
telegraphist that person dots and dashes
sends it over the wires there's more
easily to the wire there's a telegraph
if that receives it write it down then
hands it over all right I mean so that
that's basically what that is and this
is applicable to any kind of
communication any any kind of
acquisition of information from the
environment this this applies and as you
can see this is a version of that beta
to that original diagram and again that
both cookbook it goes both ways right
and again the same principles apply let
me not dwell too much but
we just well here on on the mathematical
theory or communications assumes the
ability of an individual to compose a
message and then it also assumes the
ability of an individual or machine to
encode the message also machine to
transmit the message or a machine to
decode a message or a machine to
interpret the message which we're seeing
now and then
you can do a sort of a self-referencing
exercising where I asked how are these
cognitive abilities realized it did how
did we get to where we are now this is a
application of what Shannon did if
you're looking at just throwing a coin
and again the formula for calculating
entropy which is H is given there and
depending on the coin tosses and so on
you can calculate entropy this is
basically the the entropy calculation of
this is a sentence and again you can see
that a you know I I can reorder that the
letters and this is a sentence and then
calculate the entropy related to that so
so it's just a mechanical process that
you can engage in to assess the amount
of information that anything can have so
you know we can ask whether we find
ourselves in the communication system as
the source of the message as the encoder
of the message as the messenger that
helps transmit the message as the
decoder of the messages messages
interpreter of the message and well you
could even argue information is also
right how do we achieve these rules
basically arranged transition from the
state of not going to the state of
knowing our brains transition from not
knowing to imagining and the drives and
motivations are either ran into one
transition or the other so a message is
the receptacle information potential
which may or may not be realized
information potential may be realized by
maximizing the amount of possible
information given the message structure
by including and maximizing me which is
the reason for its existence which may
or may not be realized depending on the
living being that said the recipient or
set information
can realize different levels of meaning
which is a function of content and our
interpretation of that content you know
the content may not have different
levels of debris or it may may even
require different levels of
interpretation on the part of the
recipient for example that one bit
message of yes or no is clear to anyone
that receives it but what is not clear
is that what it's informational content
means it could be answer to a large
proposal or to a business deal for it
could be even be an unexpected piece of
information that has no meaning only the
recipient will be clear as to what to
make of the information this message
another example relates to the message
where something might be said or not to
understand the message and information
requires learning to have taken place in
the context of information gathering and
interpretation the part of the recipient
here Shannon and at different levels of
digitization the original image is the
8-bit image and then of course you can
reduce the amount of information this is
Shannon again at different levels of on
you could say magnification of the area
depending whether it's two pixels or
four pixels or eight pixels or 16 up to
128 and you can see what what you can
say or not say depending on on what's
what's in the image again this is a tit
notice that the 8-bit images is clearly
tells you a little bit more informs you
more and again the exercise that you
might go through is simply if you're a
few of being of some kind you know where
should you be in terms of your
development here's another image of
shannon except you take the 8-bit image
and of course then you reduce it to one
bit along the vertical scale and then
you add either light or well you either
lightning or darken it along the
horizontal scale and then you calculate
the entropy turns out that that central
image which is
the original image I mean the
photographer was good and also so that
it's at the maximum in terms of its
entropy which which is quite interesting
and again if you have lots of
information 8-bit image again you you
know you can reduce the information and
well at least you can do something with
it now if you start with a 1-bit image
nothing really changes and again you
don't you cat gain any more information
than what you had to begin with right
and again consider it in terms of the
context of a living being where are you
better off are you better off having
this capability were you better off
having this caper in terms of assessing
your environment so basically I've gone
through an introduction we've looked at
the organism in its environment from a
commission perspective and information
perspective the universe consists of
spatially temporally distributed matter
and energy the world between have it and
discover by way of our senses is a
dynamic our sensor are bombarded with
never-ending barrage of parallel stimuli
which are multi-directional in origin
varying amplitude and duration
multi-source a sensorial map results
from the response of our senses to this
never-ending barrage of parallel
stimulus as we're maps from the matter
and energy of the universe what
motivates our search for the stimulus
our physiological and social needs a
comparison of two sensorial up separated
in space time leap to a discernment of a
difference information an idea is a
difference that makes a difference to a
living being two conditions need to be
met for information to exist one is the
existence of a detectable difference and
again they are here there are two
extremes if you have matter at Absolute
Zero you have basically no information
right then you have a matter as a black
body that's a one in a binary world I
guess I and again is there information
you know if you just have a white screen
not really all right
so again you go from one extreme of no
information to another extreme of more
information the real world is somewhere
in between a living being being
motivated to find recognized process and
utilize differences ideas in here into
the existence of matter these are the
two conditions that you need to meet for
information to exist distributed
cognition is the ability of an organism
to interact with its environment for the
purpose of satisfying its physiological
and social needs to survive and sustain
itself the use of this definition this
was to assert that information is the
basis for human cognition and I would
even argue that information there's no
life without information rather life
really from the first time that it came
into being really was dealing with
processing information and so rocks
Korean or alive and well anyway thank
you for your kind of tension I'll be
happy to answer any we have questions I
can pass a micron hi thank you for your
talk I'm a bit hazy on on the aspect of
universality of this idea it seems to me
that it's very entrepot centric your
kind of shying away from from talking
about what it would mean to a less
perceptive living creature for instance
and I mean sort of the title being sort
of the universality of this and if you
need a human being or something with
those sensitive capabilities to actually
define this how does this go from that
to be in truly universal well as you can
see there's a ! and a question like I in
mation well if you have matter above
zero absolute matter is in motion if
matter is in motion they're basically
there are differences the question is if
we are not there to look at those
differences and by we are not there I
mean any organism even the most
fundamental organism literally the
information might be there but we are
not there now it's true that this is on
its centered on us and the reason its
center or loss is because I I can't I
don't know what a Paramecium is thinking
or really i would have to study them in
detail to know what's going on but some
of these things are are much applicable
very applicable to any living being sure
i'm a bit concerned about the the need
for something alive it it kind of makes
a duality between alive and not alive
that i don't actually think exists I
mean you're you're right and there you
have to go to a topic that I in cover
and and basically what the difference is
between something that's alive and nor
alive and many people argue that the
line is very fuzzy right and so so again
yes true so so I would agree with you
that really the line is not there I mean
people argue talk about emergent
properties I don't think those that I
mean that's not a good thing to argue
because then you're arguing a duality of
things with with other words one example
that that I can give is simply let's say
rstp conditions you have oxygen and
hydrogen right and what are they they're
gases now you combine them you get water
wow that's an emergent property you can
say but it really is it really and
people
about human beings or beings that are
alive as if somehow there are some
emergent properties that I qualify us to
to be alive I don't believe
so again that sort of goes along with
what you see a very interesting
discussion of image scaling in astronomy
we often take an image and map that
scale of pixel values using a function
it might be histogram equalization it
might be square root mapping and you
made the proposal that the image of
highest entropy was the one that had the
greatest depth of perception and a
Gaussian distribution is the
distribution that has the highest
entropy for a given mean and variance
and so the takeaway I'm getting from the
slide year which is great is that one
should map images using a Gaussian
transformation to map the original pixel
distribution monotonically onto a
Gaussian distribution so that's that's
actually an actionable trick I'm going
to take away from this so I wondered if
you had experimented with a an
elaboration of this where you're
shifting it by one bit throughout the
image to like an image stretch to show
what a Gaussian distributed but
monotonic greyscale would would look
like or what it would be I have not done
that and simply because my interest was
other than that here I I just wanted to
see that the interesting to me of the
the interesting thing to me of this
image was that let's say you are
developing organism you know where do
you really where did you start in terms
of detecting what's around you you might
have started maybe on the left side of
the image or maybe the right side of the
image but then eventually what happens
is you have to move up to the that
center image there at the top
you know I and interestingly enough I
mean it's an observation that I've made
after the fact is that the photography
and what's have been very very good
because as you can see that Center image
which is their original image that I
picked off the internet is basically the
one that has the greatest entropy that's
an idea i can use thanks well we are
doesn't that always hold i mean if
you're just doing a linear mapping to
heart to darker or linear mapping to
lighter sort of the range of things the
distribution you're not changing it
you're just squashing it right so every
single image has to be by definition at
its most entropy in this graph well
that's not not what you see here right
because you see the entropy falling off
on the on the two sides and again the
extreme is if you add enough white then
you just have white that that's right so
you start at the maximum and then you by
linearly transforming things you squash
it right but it's possible that I mean
what if the photographer was not very
good and he gave you a dark image or a
live image and then as you added light
on dark maybe the image gets better so
it depends on the mapping certainly some
mappings which would do that right so
some some nonlinear mappings would
stretch the range through to other
things and by linear whatever something
that but if it's a Idol a well cake so
it depends on the on the darkening and
unlike nning algorithm let's say you
start out with e with the one image from
this from the edge and then you add
either lighten or darken the Sailor is
not going to be at the center of the
image so it's going to be shifted right
calculate Lindsey so where are Tom ODS
is a further announcement we do have
launched in BigTable if we want to
continue the dialogue with dr. Cardenas
Garcia but thank you very much for being
here with us tonight and sharing some of
your work thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
