the future we have three speakers in
this panel discussion chip Elliott Nick
McCune and Paul Sappho who will present
in that order chip has been at BBN for
longer than he wants to admit and is now
responsible for managing the genie
program which is part of the National
Science Foundation's initiative to help
support research on possible future
internet architectures chip I'm not
going to go into all the other
background that you've got you feel free
to do that if you want to but what I'm
more interested in finding out is what
you want to tell us about Jeanne so
let's go there well thank you very much
it's a it's a pleasure to be here and I
should point out we have two of the
genie instigators in in the crowd here
so guru and Nick well I hope you will
jump in and it's already going that
badly asleep okay I have really only a
very very few slides I'm kind of just
trying to open a discussion about what
would be interesting and useful things
to do but I'd like to give you just a
little status update about where we are
it's a pretty non technical talk this is
the the space that Genie is trying to
open up for research and so you know all
of us nowadays live in the Internet
whatever that means right we conduct our
lives all parts of us are in the
internet and I think it opens up a
number of very very interesting research
areas there are some what you might term
science issues which is it is it is very
very hard to understand these networks
and how they're behaving especially if
you're a researcher generally you can't
get your hands on any instrumented data
it's very hard to just see what's going
on in this space let alone to kind of
have a theory you know if you if you
build a bridge you have pretty good
theory about how to build it
doesn't fall down if you build large
distributed systems you know just good
luck I hope you're really good at it
okay so that's one area research that
enables another is innovation and I
think for a lot of the academic
researchers in particular there's kind
of a sense that first of all you know
academia and Industry have been kind of
drifting apart from each other in this
particular space for most professors
it's very hard to gain any kind of
toehold or really kind of make a good
contribution in the space and I think
many people have the perception that the
the barriers are getting harder and
harder to enter in some sense innovation
is being forced higher and higher in the
protocol stack because you can't really
kind of get in that lower layers the
price of entry is actually very high
there and the third is really societal
issues that you know we are all and I
think this has come out very clearly in
the past day um as we live our lives
within this space this really has very
profound effects on society and vice
versa right so you can't really divorce
the technology and the social aspects at
this point so the goal of genie is not
to solve these problems it is to open up
a space where people can actually try to
do useful and productive research and
innovations in the space so here here is
the kind of the three things that we're
trying to do let people understand
global networks and how they interact
with society so this is not a pure
techie gearhead we need to make optical
networks go faster right this is much
more kind of an understanding of social
technical systems let people innovate at
the frontiers right and that's going to
be kind of tough to let people in
universities all across the u.s. have
have a way to get in and start doing
those innovations and finally to
transform research
because right now a lot of the research
is not at all data driven there are no
instrumented measurements that people
can get their hands on and so if you if
you read a lot of the papers they are
it's extremely hard to compare one
scheme against another there there are
no results in some sense and so this is
to my mind profoundly unscientific you
would like to have repeatable
experiments that are well instrumented
so people can actually have a discourse
about the facts rather than kind of
hypotheses this is genies conceptual
design and the conceptual design was
created by kind of a gang of about a
dozen professors and a cloud of a
hundred people around them of whom I was
one of that cloud I'm sure the
conceptual design will change
considerably over the next couple of
years but I think this kind of gives at
a sketch the the technological idea at
the top left is the idea of what about a
network in which every part every last
little bit of the fabric was
programmable let's let's just say user
programmable so we have seen a lot of
innovation in the internet space because
the edge was open people could program
the edge but it was really hard to
program deep into the network so what if
you could program all the way through
the network every part of it deep into
the network so that's kind of concept
number one in some sense you know let me
let me say you're kind of loading your
application program or your service all
the way through the network right not
just in your end hose not just in the
cloud but everywhere number two is let's
try to keep these things separate by
using virtualization or the equivalent
of virtualization end-to-end so from
your handheld device through the base
station through the network into the
cloud the whole way is kind of one long
virtualized thing
in the genie concept this is where you
run an experiment so it's called a slice
you're given a slice through the network
you pour your software in you run it
hopefully it's well instrumented you
collect your data and so on and oh by
the way a key part of this is lots of
real people can start using that
experiment you'd like it to be open
because people are very fundamentally a
part of what the internet or
next-generation networks are about so
you can create a long-running experiment
and have real people opt in and begin to
rely on it so what we in Jeanne call an
experiment and the rest of the world is
called a service and this is a way that
you can kind of compose new services
start gaining early users instrumentet
see what's going on and then ideally if
this all pans out you kind of spin it
out as a real service some of them right
that's kind of the innovation path the
third part of this is down at the bottom
it is it is envisioned as a federated
different kinds of technologies system
so people often when they think of
network at least where I come from they
think of a router well this one has all
the things that you would use to compose
kind of a modern global system Computers
transmission and storage and of course
the technologies are going to keep
changing right they don't stop so you've
got to have some way of constantly
incorporating whatever the newest stuff
is so it's a system that's composed out
of a bunch of different kinds of things
in the earlier stages in kind of the
conceptual stages of Jeannie it was cast
as if you know people are going to think
really hard and then build for five
years and then use it for ten years and
I think anyone that uses computers
thinks I don't really want to be using a
10 year old computer system right so
this has been reformulated as I think
the way many of us do things when we're
doing big computer systems we're going
to build really fast rapid prototyping
and use it based on kind of what we like
and what we don't let like we're going
to do it again so that this is called
spiral development for those of you who
are into those buzzwords and each
spiraling genie is one year long all
right so everybody get together make
something happen integrate it which is
very tough and then use it we'll try
running experiments and those things we
like will do tomorrow doesn't like we
won't do more of right and we're just
going to kind of keep up if we can this
forced march the other major part of
this is that Genie is going to grow by
gluing together or federating different
things again in the conceptual stage was
the idea that some organization will be
started and we'll build this monolithic
thing I think that's called Google
actually that's not the way Genie is
going to work it's going to grow by
Jeanne enabling a lot of stuff that
already exists to get up and running and
then gluing more stuff in as the time
goes on an explicit goal is to have
things that are not NSF partner to
Jeanne and so this year actually we're
starting to federate with European
projects Japanese project probably
Korean projects and Brazilian projects
to kind of start a shakedown cruise of
Federation because that's actually going
to be very very hard primarily because
of the organizational problems
we also envisioned there are things very
much like this probably in the corporate
space and so we would like to be able to
federate Genie with those things so that
researchers can use some of that
infrastructure probably on some deal
basis you know back and forth as new
technology becomes available it will be
federated in so that's the way Genie is
going to grow and there's a little crowd
down in the corner that says well this
looks kind of familiar you know I've
seen pictures like this actually quite a
long time ago so yeah this is
deliberately copying you know at least
how we perceive things grew when they
were growing well okay here's the the
current state of the world prototyping
began about six months ago and so we got
very generous donations from national
lambda rail an Internet to of kind of
national footprints so together it comes
to it's a little bit of apples and
oranges but together we've got 40
gigabits of national footprint which you
know we're using kind of lightly now the
prototypes aren't really up and running
yet and then we have a number actually
29 different research teams that are
creating parts of prototypes on their
campuses so we've organized this whole
thing into five competing clusters so
rather than try to integrate 29
different projects we've organized it so
we're integrating much smaller things
that are competing against each other
who can get the most stuff up and
running the fastest and there's two
basic goals for this spiral 11 is it's a
great idea this control framework that
can kind of create these you know
virtualization things inside but we've
never actually seen one of those right
we haven't seen one demonstrate it right
produce it and demonstrate it goal
number two is we love the idea of
virtualization in in den slices but
we've never seen that either so make
that work
so in particular we want layer to
virtualization Ethernet level
virtualization from say campus Wi-Fi
through campuses through regional
networks through these backbones and so
on once you create one of these Ethernet
slices then you can run IP in it or you
can run non IP Anna as you like or if
you like doing minor variants of IP you
can do that so that the earliest
versions of this are now up and running
they were demonstrated in March and I
think we'll have some fairly solid
systems by mid fall one of the key
reasons we want to go to the campuses is
that's where the early users are so
we're very interested in getting
wireless genie to a lot of people Wi-Fi
is the first way to do it we're also
very interested in wimax because of the
spectrum issues so we would like to have
campus wimax that starts reaching out
and covering the areas around the
campuses oh actually completely
meaningless you know this is this is a
mapping and it's an eye chart you know
but other but they're primarily Academic
Teams right a lot of the if you're in
this field you know you've got a lot of
the researchers you know who are busy
building and trying to integrate these
prototypes and then we're actively
trying to engage companies because this
thing if it actually starts to be useful
if people actually start running
experiments / services we would like to
be able to build it out and that build
out stage is not going to be done by
graduate students and it's it just can't
be it's too big a project so it'll be
done by people who are in the business
of doing this kind of thing we'd like to
have them engaged kind of from the
beginning right so if and when we start
scaling up they'll know what to do they
will have contributed to the mix going
forward and so on
okay this is a kind of my closing thing
this is a very open project i would
encourage everybody in the room to come
to the next genie engineering conference
that's july in seattle i think this is a
real opportunity for for a while there's
been kind of a drift and to some extent
of marginalization of networking and
distributed systems research in the u.s.
we would really like to start getting
people engaged in a much bigger project
than have been doing for quite a while
and with a very heavy industry
participation back and forth between
academia and industry and that's it
thank you very much oh I'll take
questions now and later yeah Tony if you
come to mind out who are the
international participants what kind of
sensor applications or platforms do you
envision and lastly when you use the
term Federation you mean that in the
identity management sense in which case
what Federation platform alright guys
i'm not sure i can remember all the
questions in the right order I'm
hampered slightly by the fact that we've
just ended the solicitation and we're
sending a proposal to NSF on Friday as
it turns out so I can't say too much
about half of the stuff that's going on
because it's it's still confidential so
what I'm sorry Oh was the first question
international I wasn't the first class
oh it was the first question so so the
people who are explicitly identified are
there's a European future internet
quote-unquote project called fire fi re
i don't remember what that stands for
research and something that's out of the
EU there's also the germans who on the
national level are doing glab so they
will very likely become partners if you
drill down even farther individual
places i won't name them are actually on
some of the Americans
games so at several different levels
that's going on in Japan it's primarily
nict which is a quasi-governmental
organization and in Korea yeah exactly
yeah so those are the obvious ones and
then down in Brazil it's a bunch of you
know regional research networks and the
university is associated with sensors so
we have several different kinds some are
the small mote like sensors so we've got
a field of about a thousand mote like
sensors in Ohio and in Detroit oddly
enough they were there's several other
sensor projects to me you know one of
the really interesting ones is actually
a big distributed radar system that's
doing real time meteorology so with a
whole bunch of radars and that's
basically not only a source of kind of
you know fairly substantial volume of
information but they can be controlled
and so you know in real time you can
imagine programs that are kind of
looking at this data and controlling the
radars as well so it kind of ranges so
Federation here means this is kind of a
high level of Federation how does the
North American NSF thing interact with
the Japanese thing how does it interact
with the European thing so that's that's
the meaning of Federation if you drill
down one layer how do all these campuses
manage researcher identity and so forth
there are multiple competing schemes
right now my personal favorite happens
to be Shibboleth but if you if you know
a better one
thank you very much so while Nick is
getting his computer connected up he's a
professor at Stanford University and
he'd been there for actually quite a
while since 1995 he's responsible for
managing the clean slate program at at
Stanford which is basically a program
sponsored by the National Science
Foundation to look at what an internet
might look like if you were starting all
over again knowing what we now know from
30 some-odd years of exposure he has
some business background as well a
couple startups a breezy oh and nemo so
i think Nick brings a pair of interest
in perspectives to all this one a
practical one from business experience
and the other of course a very
interesting academic view of starting
all over again with the design of a vey
an Internet like or maybe even internet
not like system so go for it that's it
okay good so they put this up start with
I'm going to be talking about something
that term that I stole from somebody
else which is software-defined
networking it followers on nicely from
what chip has been describing and
essentially what we're trying to do is
to build a substrate or an underlay to
help chip and Jeannie happen you'll
it'll it'll be clear that there's a
bigger goal and that everyone is trying
to work towards which is how do we help
the the network innovate and keep
innovating and keep moving forward and
we're trying to put a piece in the sort
of an underlay into two to help Genie I
put this light up with a the team that
we have here so this is me over here I'm
six foot tall whatever reason I put this
up is just to say that like
is really tall and I don't understand
why I feel like feel very small there
amongst these people the things I'm
going to be describing have come out
from a lot of them came from the PhD
work of Martine casado who some of some
of you know and he and scott schenker
and Iowa sort of talking about this a
while ago and so I'll try and just sort
of describe where all this stuff fits
fits together but my background was in
building the router in designing routers
and trying to make them faster and blah
blah blah stuff like that and the ship
did a great description of sort of the
top-down goal of Jeannie and we're sort
of trying to come from the underneath
and say ultimately the networking piece
needs to go on boxes it needs to go on
the boxes and the question is how do you
get it there because there's a huge
number of boxes out there and if they've
all got to be able to support this
underlay for Jeannie then how do we get
that in place so when I say router I
mean something like this you will know
what these look like they've got a sort
of a management and the routing
protocols the stuff that sits on top and
then the per packet stuff that happens
in the in the the forwarding paths will
look up the switch and the buffer and I
don't think I'm saying anything that's
particularly surprising but when viewed
from the bottom up I think it's safe to
say we're kind of lost our way which is
this thing that was supposed to be this
dumb simple data path turn into this
monster routers today typically have 10
to 20 million lines of source code on
the and you know they're bigger than the
five ESS switch operating systems that
that we use to mark they provide a huge
barrier to entry for innovation and on
the hardware side if you take a big
router these numbers are actually pretty
conservative a packet going from one
interface to another interface on a big
router will encounter somewhere above
500 million gates of processing and
encounter about 10 gigabytes of theorem
of Rome and this makes them bloated it
makes them power hungry so this simple
thing this thing that was supposed to be
this streamlined data path
has itself become the inhibitor of
innovation inside the network so we tend
to think of the network having enabled
innovation and clearly it has but in
itself has become stuck and on top of
that all of this extra stuff has been
baked in all right all of these other
things every single one of them for good
reason you don't think of a good reason
why all of this stuff got peg baked in
but it's made it more and more complex
more and more heavy heavy weight over
over time so the question that is what
to do personal regret this is me getting
my sort of my chess plane here I wish I
had said a long time ago I mean I'm part
of the problem right which is part of
making these things more and more
complex I should go to these designer
reviews for routers and I used to
understand what they did and then one
day I realized that ninety percent of
what they were talking about in these
design reviews I didn't understand the
features and the things that were in
there so I wish I'd said it sooner and
louder this dumb minimal data path
turned into everything in the kitchen
sink everything piled onto the edge so
the essence of what I want to say is
this that that in order to allow
innovation innovation happens
wonderfully when things are defined in
software right the the open source
community software developers in general
have shown us that innovation can happen
at a phenomenal speed with very little
standardization if there is a clear path
to getting stuff out there people using
it seeing what works the bad stuff dies
the good stuff continues and people
adopted so there is a hardware substrate
that the pc industry has an ugly jealous
of it it has this x86 substrate and it's
a it's an instruction set not a
particularly good one it's not a
particularly ideal one but it's good
enough and it's being chosen or it's
been just used and widely adopted and
this allowed software definition to
happen on top the innovation exploded on
top applications and in the
infrastructure the thing that we think
of in the interest is allowed for huge
innovation in the operating system it
didn't for a while but then alternative
operating systems popped up and allowing
for huge innovation in the
infrastructure itself operating systems
and then the virtualization layer and
then of course open source tied onto the
side of that hundreds of thousands of
developers that's probably more than
that to
blew apart the whole standardization
process and an innovation happened at a
phenomenal rate so what is it that it
takes to do that well how do I substrate
software-defined Network open cells open
source culture boom like this this is
where we're trying to get us to I think
it's up to us to make it happen and I
think until we or someone does then the
network itself is going to be very hard
to change and it's I think it's
important to come at this from both
directions top-down driven by the desire
to open it up and bottom-up trying to
figure out how and these two things
together gets the problem and surrounded
so then the question is how do you
define the substrate or do we already
have one maybe we already have a
substrate that's perfectly good it just
isn't being used in the right in the
right way so let's go look at the
computer the first time I programmed was
really before operating systems existed
in much of a recognizable way and when
you wrote an application you took over
the whole computer there was much of an
operating system to help you and so then
the operating system came about and lo
behold lots of applications came along
because now there was a substrate upon
which to to to do this so the OS is
abstracted the hardware substrate and
innovation took place in applications
windows came along and that's had in the
middle on top of the what was probably
no x86 at that point but you know a
developing and emerging substrate lots
of applications and then there are other
other operating systems that came along
after that and there's BSD and blah blah
blah and of course Android as well and
but you know you chose one you put it on
the hardware but they could evolve and
develop because there was this common
substrate upon which to develop so
simple common stable stable hardware
substrate below programmability people
knew how to program because it was well
defined in competitive environment and
it created innovation in the operating
system and the applications the next
stage in this sorry very simplistic view
but the next stage in this with was
virtualization VMware etc and now not
only you didn't have to choose a or b or
c you
running at the same time and multiple
copies and this obviously creates a
phenomenal environment for for
innovation not only in the applications
on the top but also in the
infrastructure so here I the
virtualization and the operating systems
think of that as the infrastructure this
is the equivalent of something to do
with the routers in the internet right
that's the kind of the analogy here is
is that infrastructure here there are
well-defined boundaries well-defined
abstractions they are themselves
changing and evolving they are defined
in software innovation is helping
improve it over 10 carry it along so
simple Commons sable hardware substrate
below programmability now a strong
isolation model that's being put in
place through virtualization lots of
competition innovation is taking place
in the infrastructure lots of innovation
in the operating system and the
virtualization layer itself so it's
allowed applications to flourish what
what what is the equivalent in the
internet well the stability of ipv4
allowed the web to happen there was a
stable there was a stable substrate
right that that allowed huge amount of
innovation to take place in the
application layer so in the internet
what was it that allowed the
infrastructure on top to be defined in
software well the routing protocols the
management there was enough
standardization and stability in that
that you could assume it was there you
could assume that it worked it allowed
the innovation to take what is it that
allowed the rapid innovation of the
infrastructure itself I actually didn't
write the infrastructure itself has
moved I mean it sort of had to and I
think we will understand and it's sort
of needed to and part of his excessive
stable for a while but that success has
turned out to be the problem because
it's now very hard to change and evolve
itself so what what is the substrate you
might have a picture in your mind we
have that hourglass picture rated is it
IP but what is it about IP is it the
packet format that's the substrate is it
the packet format plus the ipv4 RFC
is it the that plus ospf and bgp and
what actually is the substrate is not
actually clear we don't have a common
idea of precisely what it is that you're
programming on top of to allow this to
happen and I think that we struggle with
us in the research community for a long
time and you know in the mid 1990s there
was a matter of paraphrasing here
although I think I took this out of a
paper to enable innovation in the
network we need a program on top of a
simple hardware we need to program on
top of a simple hardware data path this
was the mantra of active networking I'm
not arguing that there was a good thing
but it was an indication of sort of a
struggle to trying to find what this
substrate was you know put more fragment
fragments of code into the network let
them carry along with packets yeah that
wasn't the right answer it there was the
problem of isolation performance
complexity there was what was the sake
stable substrate that actually wasn't
clear what that was but we're sort of in
search of that the later 99 is to enable
innovation in the network we need the
datapath substrate to be programmable
that seems to be getting closer is what
led to network processes well that what
processes haven't really happened either
they're kind of happened for a while and
then they all got canned and and and
people gave up on that because the thing
is it's it's it's a little bit of a
cop-out you don't want quite the same as
the x86 you need a little bit more
infrastructure than that no one figured
out a common instruction set a common
development environment and it
essentially accelerated complexity of
the data path substrate itself so
perhaps statement of obvious we've tried
this before I'm not the first person to
suggest this we're not the first people
who suggested people have been looking
for a canine's separation between a
simple common hardware substrate and an
open programming environment on top and
this is sort of being been many many
attempts to do this and what I'm going
to describe is sort of the lead-up to
one that we've been we've been promoting
and working on is it not to say that we
think this is the right answer
but we're trying to move the whole
discussion on the debate in the
direction of how do we define this
simple common hardware substrate one
thing that's interesting is that things
are changing fast in data center
networks whether it's and into some
extent they've already changed in data
center networks whether it's Amazon here
and plenty of other other places the
it's there's been an awful lot of work
because the economics made sense if you
are let me just offer you some numbers
imagine that you were building a data
center and imagine that it had about
half a million servers in it and imagine
that you were building it from switches
with roughly 50 ports you have 10,000
switches 10,000 switches is an awful lot
of muscle and buying power and when you
go out and look at and see that ninety
percent of the price that you're paying
is in the software and the margin etc
there's a huge economic incentive to
take it down to the bare minimum that
hardware substrate down to you know
whether it's five hundred dollars a
thousand dollars for the hardware and
use the rest of that save money to just
define it yourself and clearly that's
happening all across the industry and
it's happening in non-standard ways but
it's happening fast and the buying power
is tremendous and it's essentially
creating two separate networking
industries there are those who are going
with the with the conventional approach
which I think will be around for a long
time and there are those that are going
their own way and out of sheer necessity
and economic economic pool and this will
create a very interesting dynamic what
will be interesting is if all the people
that are going it on their own can come
together because if all the people that
are going on around the on their own can
come together then this has an enormous
potential for change and creating that
substrate so the prior attempts to do
this so generally this is a
generalization I understand either
assumed that the current IP routing
substrate is fixed and try to program it
externally there have been many attempts
to do this so in other words provide a
an interface to the that sits on top of
BGP and ospf and things like that as
soon as
they are sort of god-given and fixed and
so the routing protocols which you know
in the end a kind of part of the problem
right because you know why is it that my
packets are routed the same way that
yours are why is it that everybody has
to use the same thing this is part of
the infrastructure that in itself needs
to evolve we've lived with BGP the
tyranny of BGP not because it was right
not because it was good but because it
was too difficult change and it took a
long time even though there were many
problems to in order to be able to
change it and prior attempts have
generally defined the programming and
control model up front in other words
they're defined not only the substrate
but how you use the substrate now ATM as
an example all of the effort went in how
you describe all the signaling mechanism
well what's the chances you're going to
get that right first time course it's
got to be wrong you need that itself to
change it evolved Intel didn't define
the operating system it created a simple
substrate that allowed many operating
systems to evolve and change so if the
substrate itself defines how it's used
that's a path to failure that can't
possibly succeed so in other words we
need something which is simple that does
not define what goes above it enables
but it doesn't define doesn't constrain
what goes above so I argue that what we
need is a clean separation between the
substrate and an open programming
environment so a clean separation
between the two a simple hardware
substrate that is going to generalize
subsumes and come back to this word
because this actually seems wrong here
it subsumes and simplifies the current
substrate so how can it simplify an
subsume but it has to subsume otherwise
it has no chance of adoption unless
cities backwardly compatible that's why
we usually call it that's what subsuming
is right unless it's backward compatible
with what we have then there's no
toehold it can't it can't you can't get
in in the in the first place and this is
the really the bane of networking right
it's the it's the problem but Genie
faces it's the problem that innovation
faces is how do you at the same time
enable and be back with Lee compatible
and it must have that substrate must
have very few pre conservative ceived
ideas about how the substrate will be
programmed and it must have a means for
introducing strong isolation so all of
these there may be more but these are my
my shortlist of four needs I'm going to
start with number one I want to try and
be very quickly i'm not going to spend a
lot of time on all of these and at some
point will I like the run out of time or
will sort of peter out so the first one
is and again being said many times
before but I do believe this is very
important in networking is we need to
get the intelligence out of the data
path we need a simple hardware substrate
in the data path and we need to remove
as much intelligence as we can because
so long as it's tied into the data path
it's very hard for it to change so I
don't think that the solution is open
sourcing the ramen people have tried
that there'll be many attempts to do
that but anything that's the right way I
think it's actually to take the
intelligence out and then open source
the intelligence that's different if we
can do that and figure out how to do it
after all this would just be a PC a
server in a data center or a PC and the
closet then we can put new function into
it and we can do that in software IE new
routing protocols new mobility managers
new energy managers innovations in the
network but put them you know write them
in Java and put them on a server
somewhere in or whatever so this would
allow operators of networks users even
the application itself third-party
developers researchers to be able to add
new function into the network so that
step one is separating the intelligence
from the data path okay number two a
simple hardware substrate the
generalizes and subsumes that's so step
two once we've removed this intelligence
is how does this control the data path
well we need that substrate to be dumb
and simple run that substrate to be
really dumb and simple so that it gets
out of the way as much as possible so
our particular approach is once this
controller this thing outside this brain
has made its decisions then just think
of it caching its decisions
you were cashing its decisions into the
datapath it's not giving up its
decisions it's just cashing them and if
it can cash its decisions of the
following form I saw this packets that
looked like this before and I decided
what to do with those so if you see them
again do the same thing and in
networking this is a flow of destruction
I've seen packets that belong to this
flow where flow could be a TCP flow or
it could be all the packets going to
China it could be on a small scale it
could be in a huge aggregated scale so I
mean to encompass all of those
definitions of flow so if I've seen
something like this before do the same
thing so if I can describe it in those
terms then do the same thing again if
header in this is a simple in the
hardware as if header equals x then send
to a particular port or that type of
thing this relies on there being a flow
table and lo and behold every every
single commercial hardware switch
ethernet switch router sold today has
something that looks like a flow table
they didn't put it because they thought
of this they put it there because they
needed to implement a firewall and if I
wolf has to have access control lists in
the access control lists low and pole
there are flow entry they say what to do
with packets that match a particular
flow so actually actually the substrate
is kind of there already and it's
sitting out there in the wiring closet
it's sitting in the top of racks which
is it sitting in the aggregation points
it's sitting in the LAN routers so
actually it's how could we just switch
this stuff on and that's actually there
was the realizing the sort of the
realization for us that not only is it
there but the firewall capabilities are
having to improve over time so there's
flow tables they're getting bigger and
bigger there was an immense effort put
into building bigger and faster T camps
and actually the tkm guys are kind of
waiting for the rest of us to catch up
it's a little bit of an exaggeration but
they've been working like gangbusters to
try and make bigger and faster and lower
energy t camps and so the technology is
there to have hundreds of thousands of
flow entries if we want to use them and
so all of these the pieces come come
together and I'm actually going to stop
it
because I don't want to go over my over
my time I could carry on talk about this
for hours and unfortunately many of you
have heard me do that and I don't want
to out but will you again with the same
with the same story but what we've been
doing with this is from this sort of
these these nuggets of ideas we created
this thing called open flow and we have
been working to put this feature or this
capability into as many switches routers
access points base stations as we can
and so we're working with you know HP
and cisco and juniper and etc and
getting this put in there it's
essentially the open API into this flow
table here to enable this substrate to
to emerge and this really is all this
thing open flow is what we've been
trying to i'm going to allele eep to one
last thing excuse me if i'm going to go
through a bunch of slides here to get
there there's one sort of last point I
want to get to excuse me that were I
didn't mean to go through all this there
was a animations don't emotions if only
knew oh no this is where you fall off
the end this is when you okay all right
excuse me I'm going to learn the end
sorry matters and in the end what this
is all about for us is take is getting
to this figure here and that is the
image on the left is of that substrate
with the virtualization the vmware or
Zen or whatever with all the operating
systems what we're trying to do is to
get to this point over here where you
know the the moral equivalent of that
x86 is this thing called open flow you
know it doesn't need to become a
standard it just need to get adopted or
something like it or better than it
right we just need something that we've
been developing a virtualization layer
that sits on top so that you can then
have multiple of those brains that they
themselves can evolve and improve and be
open sourced or not that wouldn't sit on
top and there is one that's sort of an
open source one that's that's evolving
right now and we hope that there will be
more and then on top the user the the
researcher
the service creator the routing protocol
writer the network access control
creator all of those will write their
application sitting on top for their
network whether it's a data center and
enterprise a service provider and that
they'll do that outside of the network
and on top okay uh-huh yeah so in that
that flow table that sits inside that
that's which that flow could be all of
the packets belonging to a TCP
connection that would be a legal
definition so I can put in something
that says all of the all of the packets
belonging to the flow of me going to
google to do our search right that could
be a flow or it could be if I just
change the definition of a flow by
changing the bits I match on all of the
packets going to Google from Stanford or
all of the HTTP traffic or all of the
multicast traffic so in other words I
just mask on whichever bits and that
defines the flow and I'm free to do that
in this flow table potential layer
crossing kinds of questions and things
like yeah so in in the first version of
this we're with that we've been trying
to work pragmatically with the
constraints of the existing hardware and
that generally allows us to look at from
the first bit in the packet through to
the top of TCP that's because they have
to do firewalls so they really all need
to be able to do that and so that's a
fairly straightforward thing to do
that's common to all of this hardware
we're we're in the process of defining
what we we hope will be version 2 for
about two years time where we hope that
progressive chip vendors and the
equipment vendors will come along and
say I will now design dedicated Hardware
because I would like to change the
status quo and I would like to do this
where they will allow more bits
of course if you if you match on some
earlier bits like you know the ethernet
header because it's going over ethernet
it doesn't mean you have to interpret
the higher order bits as ipv4 or TCP you
can define them however you want so it
allows a lovely way to have a you know
introduce new protocols at higher layers
just by matching just by matching it
also provides a very simple isolation
model which is if you think of all of
those bits in the headers of
representing a space isolation is just
making sure the spaces don't overlap
between two experiments it provides a
very simple and strong isolation model
as well k good that's that's helpful I
think other questions before we move to
yeah Kevin had a question yeah so on
that picture you said this open flow is
kind of like the x86 hard right and so I
guess I would say why not just use the
x86 part would be would be one part but
another one is if I want some processing
that I need to do that's more
complicated that I think might be more
complicated at one of those nodes even
to look at a packet or to decrypt it
whatever transform it how do I do that
in this kind of model what's the if you
will the breadth of the API that you
have to use into the into that switch
node yep so there were two questions
there why not use the x86 itself well
you know the starting point today is
boxes that process a terabit per second
right so you know that's would be a core
router we're quite a long way from being
able to do that we will get that right
in software but actually it's it doesn't
mean that just because one instruction
set worked in one domain that it's
necessarily the same one it's clearly
that the whole numbers and the aggregate
numbers are different right and that's
how the whole you know asics and
hardware development sort of emerged for
doing that so that's sort of on the of
the substrate and the abstraction that
seems to make sense is something that's
to do with packet forwarding plumbing
right so it's a plumbing layer so in a
sense what we do is defining the copper
pipes to do the plumbing which takes me
to the second question is what if you
want to transform something well you
need a way of steering the flows we're
trying to build the copper pipes but
we're not trying
bill the toilets and the things that the
things that then process the packets you
would plumb you would plumb your flows
to it so let me take an example imagine
that you know you're in we build a
network like this that's fine for a
quarry thing imagine that you're
connecting to that Network and you're
you're a good guy we've seen you before
we trust everything that you're doing we
just plumb you to the outside world
however imagine that you're someone new
or you're using some unpatched version
of Windows then we will plumb you to
something that will do intrusion
detection we don't define the intrusion
detection you just plumb it to a
middleware box to do that it might drop
it might transform it might change so
you can think of it as a way of plumbing
to the things that do the transformation
and then you know that thing that does
the transformation it could be using x86
processor it could be a network
processor it could be whatever or
whatever you want what we're trying to
do is to do the very lowest plumbing
layer that's all question in the back so
it sounds like though the classification
of the routing would be deterministic so
I'm wondering if there's an option for
probabilistic routing there's many
situations where optimal solutions are
stochastic rather than deterministic so
one of that's available in this system
yet I mean what a good example of that
is load balancing right so where you
want to load balance over or several
several paths so in the in the sort of
the version one we deliberately chose
not to do that because it was hard to
fit that onto the existing hardware
that's one of the things that were we're
currently debating for the version two
because we agree that there's that's
kind of something that you want in their
questions how to do it in a really
really simple way so that it doesn't you
know our fear is that we don't against
to get bloated right now we're back to
square one how to keep it very very
simple so I want to follow up on
something that I'm of your answer to to
vent in a modern large service provider
network one of the one of the artifacts
that you create that maps to this
concept of flow is the label switch path
and you decide at one end of the label
switch path what kind of traffic you're
going to forward into it and then you
place the label switch path or
on the network using a variety of
mechanisms the there are rudimentary
control systems that are very much like
what this vision of the shining city on
the hill is in the form of systems that
you analyze yesterday's traffic pattern
and plan tomorrow's LSP mesh throughout
a network based on anticipating what the
known factors of demand are going to be
I'm hoping that as we evolve this system
we will look back on that time fondly is
when and we managed to the network with
bearskins and stone knives any other
questions one more let's this will be
the last one in this round and may need
to go under palm go ahead and it's
always the last question that brings
everything crashing down so I i think
back in the 90s right there's a
definition of forces and growth networks
and the other thing that happened but i
try to define the control plane separate
the control brain from the data plane
and try to commoditize this thing how
would you characterize this how is it
different than approach does it clearly
been many attempts to do this you could
remember epsilon and IP switching and
there were sort of several attempts to
do that I think there's a couple of
differences in what one is to a large
extent the hardware substrate has
already emerged its commodity switching
and flow tables already built in right
it's it's kind of happened those things
as commodities weren't around at that
time and the second thing is that open
source has happened and so the need to
get it all right up front in a spec is
no longer necessary you just need enough
to get going and then bring your friends
along too and enable many many other
people to do so at the same time and
then together you will work in it
because you know the first attempt at
Linux it was attempt I'm it was just
what sheer arrogance to try and create a
whole new operating system to change the
world the first version was horrible but
it was the movement that created around
it and the first version of this will be
horrible to you bound to be and we'll
look back and I think Howard the waiver
get started on that if you can bring
along enough
sort of create that community and bring
it on and improve it and i think the
research community that the genie is is
bringing together is that is a an
important key an important part of
important part of this and then there's
the open source community that has
formed around linux and mozilla et
cetera as well so if they can all be
marching in the same direction wow I
know just to take advantage of the fact
that you're walking away so I'll make a
comment what one thing I didn't detect
from from your discussion is whether and
how this particular substrate will help
us attack things like scaling problems
in connectivity and routing and things
of that sort is still a big issue so I'm
seeing substrates for experimenting with
different packet formats and different
ways of describing endpoints and so
forth but this is done criticism is more
question yes what do we do about the
scaling problem ya know I actually I
think that so I would I think it's two
answers to that one is the complete
cop-out answer which is if we can get if
if we can get the the substrate right
then it becomes somebody else's problem
to deal with how you program it right
you read that the compound but the the
second part of this is that the there is
a I think there was an inevitable
tendency towards more local separation
of the control from the data I don't
necessarily been centralization it kind
of crudely looks like centralization but
if you know for example I take our
building at Stanford or us that the
Stanford campus are our administrators
would love it if they can manage the
network more centrally not necessarily
entirely in one box in one place and the
thing that enables that is Moore's law
that you we have more than a thousand
CPUs on Stanford campus sitting inside
switches and routers yet you could do
everything that they're doing probably
inside 12 hundred dollar pc goodbye a
phrase right because of the and next
year you'll be able to do twice as much
and put half a dozen of those in the
strategically placed locations then
start programming on top and people will
figure out really clever ways for doing
the for doing scaling how you connect
those you know management and control
planes at our campus with Berkeley with
other places and I think the scaling
will come through innovation right and
through people figuring that out I see
Kevin really wants to say something but
we need to get we need to get Paul you
can attack privately I'm sorry well oh
alright well so what Paul is getting
ready and it's um maybe it's quickly
answered but the routing scaling problem
we hear this a lot but when I pushed the
next layer and asked different people I
know what is the routing scaling problem
you never get the same answer yeah my
answer is very simple Kevin it said how
do I build extremely large scale systems
with large numbers of termination points
and large numbers of components in such
a way that I can keep growing it without
essentially running into a barrier that
makes it not work anymore it makes it
impossible for me to figure out how to
get things from point A to point B you
know I'm running going to run out of you
know router table entries or compute
power for moving topological information
around or some other barrier how do I ok
I see ok well stop let's let's stop
there and and find out what the answer
from Paul Sappho right Paul is an old
friend of mine and so I have imposed on
and basically dragged him away from what
might have been a more interesting day
to give us the benefit of some of his
ideas and thinking Paul you know the
little bio i have here doesn't mention
an institute for the future but you were
there for a long i was at the institute
for the future for a long time i left
there in 2006 and right
have nothing to do with them anymore but
but now he's at Stanford University he's
had all kinds of connections with World
Economic Forum he's a columnist futurist
his his opinions have been widely
distributed and often appreciated the
thing I like about Paul and the reason I
wanted him so much to be here is that he
has a tactic for looking at the future
which i think is quite effective he
basically says into the words in your
mouth you look to see where things are
not sustainable anymore and or where
they are things that are trending in a
direction where they're not sustainable
anymore and then you ask what happens
when they break what futures want what
outcomes might occur at those bright
points and I found that to be a really
powerful organizing principle around
which to think about how the future
evolves so Paul I'm hoping that you will
make use of all of your various tools to
help us see you what might happen I'll
do my best nothing like putting pressure
on someone and I'll do it quickly it was
interesting as I was thinking about
because this is my chance to to get
ideas from you all and one of the things
I'm obsessing on at the moment is some
policy stuff around the economy i just
finished a paper talking very
specifically about what it's no longer
the next economy it's the current
economy because i think the consumer
economy we had for 50 years ended on sep
tember 14 to last year and we're into
something new but i realized i've
already written about on the web and if
somebody's interested you can find it so
why talk about that do I will make one
plea this is like pleading for Esperanto
and I know it we desperately desperately
urgently urgently need a global
micropayment system that has reach I
have no idea how to get there so I just
thought I'd mention that because you all
actually know how to make stuff and I
talked about later somebody's interested
yeah something well time it's a
distraction so every talk should have a
mystery you can come back to it
what's the answer we using minutes on
mobile phones as a medium of exchange it
comes close but not quite it's not quite
global enough that I said it was like
Esperanto here's here is something I
want to go back to a forecast I actually
made in the earlier part of this decade
and as a futurist I look back a lot I'm
here to tell you rearview mirrors are
actually really good forecasting tools
if you use them in the right way and if
you're going to be a forecaster you
better go back and look at your forecast
and ask yourself what you get wrong or
what did you underestimate and I have
had this sinking feeling that something
that I was thinking about and have been
five ten years ago I've underestimated
what's going on by a very significant
order of magnitude a common problem and
we all do it in this business so the
background here is about every ten years
a new technology arrives on the horizon
becomes newly inexpensive and powerful
and then we find what the hell to do
with it so cheap micro processors in
late 1970s led to the personal computer
revolution of the 80s and it was a
decade preoccupied with processing or
anything would get our hands on the
personal computer was the poster child
of that decade we know that story the
next decade the 90s was shaped by the
advent of cheap lasers and it was an
access decade profound shift away from
devices defined by what they processed
for us to device is defined by what they
connected us to and what made it
possible was newly an expensive laser
diodes as start appearing in the 1980s
the poster child for that was of course
the World Wide Web the interesting thing
about what we do is that we see the
chipped coming but we always assumed
that the next innovation is going to be
a marvelous accessory to what we already
have so remember in like nineteen
eighty-six the cd-rom revolution you
know cheap lasers were going to give us
optical discs or
go down the computer store to buy and
load onto our machines and everybody
else was walking around going what are
we going to do with all this optical you
know fiber optic band width because we
were thinking about laser enabled
bandwidth as an accessory to our
personal computers but what in fact
happens is an inversion the accessory
becomes the central thing in the next
decade and the thing that was the center
in the last decade becomes the accessory
so the shift from processing to access
meant that the personal computer went
from being the center of the action to
the marvelous accessory to the network
so we have that inversion going all the
way through well I know we already know
what the key technology of this decade
is in its sensor technologies which have
been leaking into our lives you know
cheap video cameras and you know
whatever picture sensor technology it's
out there whether you've got an
accelerometer in your running shoe nike
running shoe that talks to your ipod
whether you know if you're like me i
almost got caught by the sebastian runs
you know google street cam one morning
because i was literally walking out get
to get the newspaper and i saw it coming
down the street and i literally jumped
behind a bush to miss it actually wasn't
sebastian's it was the Microsoft one I
didn't I wouldn't mind if Google had me
on at Microsoft to have problems being
in their pictures so I know it's nothing
like I couldn't say offer on right so
the sensor revolutions here is happening
it's all around us but the thing that
has dawned on me in the last couple of
weeks is gosh darn it you know I've done
it again I haven't realized how big this
is and sensors I mean think about how we
think about sensors with the web and the
Internet today they're marvelous
accessories are an additional source of
information and I think we're right at
that point we're approaching a point
where there's going to be a reversal and
the sensors are going to stop being the
accessory and they're going to become
the main event
and i think the poster child of this age
of interaction is going to become robots
you take a personal computer yet network
it together you use sensors to hang eyes
ears and sensory organs on it all you
need to do is put wheels on the damn
thing and you got a robot and they're
robots everywhere you know they've been
around for a while we had the Roomba I
robots device the first person was it
was killed by a military robot in
February of 2002 and Yemen and the
Roomba is is a good one because it
actually has anybody had taken apart a
Roomba it's not really a robot yeah it's
a bunch of you know it's a bunch of
electronics pretending to be a robot but
as a forecaster it's an interesting
indicator because way back in 2003 when
this came out I noticed a funny thing I
had a whole bunch of engineer friends
here in Silicon Valley who were totally
stoked about having a Roomba and they
were engineers in my recollection they
had never owned a vacuum cleaner in
their lives and I noticed that they were
giving their robots names and I checked
with iRobot and they said yeah it's a
really weird thing two-thirds of our
roomba owners are giving their robots
names and one third of them confessed to
having taken their rumbas on vacation
with them or over to a friend's house so
as a forecaster to me that was a clear
sign whatever was going on here was not
about clean floors and it's scratching a
much deeper itch so Rob robots are
slipping into our lives in all sorts of
directions or what you know twenty
thousand or so UAVs in the Iraq military
space right now and robots are now
headed down the curve of Moore's Law
quick example remember may 2000 for the
first DARPA Grand Challenge 150 mile
course 21 entries most of the robots did
what this one did it came out of the
jersey barrier looked left it looked
right at thought for a second hung a
hard left and died in the coyote bush
ten feet outside the fence the robot
that got furthest was carnegie mellon's
sandstorm here headed just you know
why did the robot cross the road well to
drive through a fence it which it did
moments after I took that picture and of
course sandstorm ended up as the lower
picture shows a mere cell seven
kilometers into the race stalled out on
the side of the road having burned out
its differential because it lost where
the road was I was sitting halfway
through it the race with a bunch of
folks we were supposed to be doing
support for the race and we felt pretty
stupid because there were no robots so
only five robots got any distance the
lead Roebuck at seven kilometres
everybody looks stupid jump ahead
fifteen months almost one doubling
period of Moore's law and you have the
second DARPA Grand Challenge five robots
finished 22 out of the 23 entrance got
further than sandstorm got in the first
race starting to look like an s-curve
jump ahead two years to the november two
thousand seven urban grand challenge
which my hat is off to the volunteers at
that race there were brave people in
cars and pretending to be pedestrians
walking around as these robots are going
astoundingly they had 11 finalists five
finishers and it was a pretty damn
impressive example of a race because it
wasn't just distance they also had to
understand the vehicle code primitive as
these robots are an interesting
coincidence that same morning proved
something very important about the
evolution of robots 30 minutes before
this race began this is what happened
250 miles to the north just outside of
Fresno drivers driving through heavy fog
bumper-to-bumper too stupid to slow down
had a hundred eight vehicle crash 18 it
was 15 18 wheelers I talked to one of
the paramedics working this and he said
it was the damndest thing we were
working on victims at the front of it
and we could hear the cars smashing in
the back you know people are like salmon
in the fog well what does this have to
do with that well this race the urban
grand challenge proved that robots
stupid as they are already understand
the california vehicle code better than
99
% of Californians and of course
Sebastian's run has a forecast that half
of all vehicle miles driven in this
country by 2030 are going to be driven
by robots here's the thing to think
about I think this moment relative to
robots is like to 1988 when everybody
said oh lasers are really important
we're going to have CD ROMs you know and
there were a couple of people running
around waving their hands saying no no
no no and that's a really stupid idea we
need a global ubiquitous hyper document
system you know that we can access
everything in real time I mean remember
how often we made fun of Ted Nelson and
we said CD ROMs are the training wheels
for that elaborate vision of the global
hyper document system and of course the
web arrived just a couple of years later
and cd-roms never happened at all I
think we're doing the same thing with
robots and I think we're headed into a
future where all of our estimations
about the volume of information coming
in off of sensors into the web is low by
an order of magnitude it's going to
happen faster than we thought the
volumes are going to be greater and it
ain't going to just be sensors pumping
information in its going to be sensors
talking to other sensors it's going to
be robots requesting information and i'm
not talking about super-intelligent
robots mean we've proven that stupid
robots like the Roomba can win over
people's hearts but imagine primitive
machines with some a level of autonomy
depending other Lee on the web to
communicate to other devices and so the
web does the next jump of what has
happened multiple times before remember
one that a long time ago when most of
the traffic on the phone system I think
we still have a phone system I can't
recall but when we had a phone system
both of traffic was waste conversation
and then voice became you know below 1
percent and the same things happening at
the web today we do not appreciate just
how big a difference the arrival of
autonomous machines is going to cause in
turn
of the demands for the kind of
architectures and data flows and stuff
on the web and 11 microphone oh and a
wireless sensor I can't I can't excite
if I I violently agree or disagree with
you okay could you just define the term
robot for me perfect yes so robot is I I
have a very low definition here of robot
it's it's got its got some sort of
processing power it's got connectivity
it has the ability to sense the
environment and ideally to manipulate
the environment as well yeah i think
they're getting towards there but the
point I'm making is you're going to see
these things you know the Roomba is a
very primitive device you know it's not
not a robot in the sense that would
frighten us all but these things are
moving up the performance curve a lot
faster than I think we realized sorry so
why to you and I am so with Deborah the
pieces of makes sense pieces that I go
hmm now one question I have for you is
why you're making robots into these very
distinct stupid independent things when
all the trends I'm seeing with MEMS and
other things say that in fact we're
packing dozens and dozens of what you'd
call a robot into something the size of
a PDA in within the next few years so
the answer is you know other than the
fact other than an actuator to change
its environment all at least the
receptive side of it the things that
sense that recognize what's going on
around you or around wherever the thing
is it's becoming incredibly cheap I mean
I'm sort of expecting to see a collapse
of all of these inputs at least where
where where I think all three of us are
in agreement is that robots aren't going
to look anything like what we all
expected in the same way that when
lasers first came in the late 80s all of
our expectations were around cd-roms and
electronic books and all that and the
way it played out was completely
unexpected
also is a good point because it wasn't
just the lasers it was determination
technology for the fibers on the receive
side and so the next question is what
other enabling thing has to happen to
unleash the robots that we should be
looking at well it's well on that way
then my job here is to provoke thought I
would like we could have a much longer
conversation I'd love that let me just
leave you with one last idea maybe we do
get in two decades or so we get really
totally surprised that we actually get
general layout I'm agnostic on this
subject you know we may or may not but
if we should and we actually get scary
robots I have a forecast if we are very
lucky they will treat us as pets and if
we are very unlucky they will treat us
as food Wow yeah another kind of
prediction robots where we're going we
don't need robots I want you to think
for a minute all of you don't just Paul
I want you to think for a minute what
happens when the network is truly
ubiquitous when every appliance and
every device we have is networked there
are sensors everywhere there are
actuators everywhere the ability to move
around maybe less important in some
respects than trying to to imply and you
may not have intended to but one
inference from what you said was somehow
the explosion doesn't happen until we
have mobile devices that are
participating and I would argue that
even without mobile devices a network
which is filled with sensors and
actuators and the ability to both
generate and absorb information is going
to make a huge difference I completely
great and again I in this you know
because of the shortness of time I don't
intend
to mislead I agree a robot doesn't need
to have wheels there's there's a
definition around autonomy the point i
would take is it goes with what you're
saying the sensor is no longer the
accessories they become the main event
and the platform for wildcards think
about Doug lenet and the psych project
all the attempts to create artificial
intelligence is you know maybe all those
science fiction stories come true and
hanging all the sensors on the web give
something in the net enough awareness
that you know it happens by accident I'm
not saying it will just saying there's a
lot of uncertainty about our assumptions
here okay so they're into the formal
interactions on this future topic let me
find out whether you want to have some
discussion with any or all of our last
panel numbers I see Andre and I see
Kevin so let's start running microphones
around maybe it would be easier if we
got Paul and chip and Nick back up here
equipped with microphones so we can have
that discussion we'll see where that
goes for the next day 15 minutes or so
the Christian through cheap how does the
your work on the quantum communication
fits into the GE project like I read
your papers every once in a while and
see that you are making progress yeah
and I spent I don't know five or six
years actively doing quantum
communication and entanglement and
teleportation and I think the one thing
that everybody agrees is that genie is
not a quantum network which to my mind
almost ensures that it will be right so
just stay tuned okay other questions are
Kevin I guess my question is almost a
little related to that one oddly enough
which is a little bit there's a number
of activities going on around the world
a bunch of money being spent future
internet this that and if we look at how
the current sort of internet
there and we have the representatives in
the room it seems that there was a
pretty relatively crisp vision of what
to do and there was an agency in funding
to go get it done and as the way I
understand it you can correct me if I'm
wrong if you sort of didn't do it you
didn't keep going it wasn't a millions
of flowers blooming it was we're going
to go get this thing we're going to
interconnect it we're going to make it
work so collectively the future if there
is another future internet architecture
or whatever it is that this name is
being used in a number of research and
development activities is it going to
come out of this of this investment in
this direction or is it going to come
from some other place let me give my
view of the answer and I think there are
many different views when BBN was part
of Verizon Verizon was spending 15
billion dollars a year on building out
its part of the infrastructure and
engineering we're spending four million
dollars a year so I don't think we're
gonna kind of replace what's going on
but what I do believe is we're in a
planning phase where we're kind of
milling about trying to get a sufficient
critical mass of people to say yes yes
yes we get it now we want to do this and
that's going to take maybe a year two
years you know that kind of time frame
where you could be doing all these
different things but you're going to get
to the point where you say we got it and
we're going to do this and we're gonna
build it out that's my belief i would
agree Thanks I mean it I think it will
that there will be a bunch of ideas that
will come out out of that and just like
I mean because there's already an
Internet it the chances that ever wasn't
sort of latches onto one right early on
a 2 0 that's that seems that that seems
no longer possible but that there will
be a handful of good ideas that will
just get adopted and use and then it'll
be the sheer weight and buying power of
people like google and AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
and that will just you know if they're
good idea good ideas that they want to
take and run with and they were the ones
that will make
and so as always is like the ultimate
transfer of technology so there can I
jump in for just a second and try to
amplify respond to Kevin's question one
of the things that we could see happen
as the internet evolved was that when we
moved away from router defined by a
computer with a graduate student wrapped
around with his arms around it that's
what routers were they moved in as soon
as they moved into a more commercial
setting the set of people who understood
things about routers and were free to
try new ideas out was reduced in some
sense a meal or at least confined in a
proprietary environment it's a little
bit like the early stages of VLSI where
you had to know a lot about the physics
of the material and process before you
could put a an integrated circuit
together when Tarver me and lynn conway
put their ideas together for VLSI design
that removed dependence on the
underlying production technology a large
number of people learned how to do VLSI
design so it's possible that what Nick
is suggesting and I think what what chip
is suggesting is that we might reopen
opportunities for people to learn more
about an experiment with stuff at very
low levels in the architecture of the
network there was a whole generation of
people who didn't get to do that as the
network became a commercial entity and
so there may be I'm not I don't know for
sure whether that will naturally cause
you know some interesting thing to
happen but it feels like it opens up an
opportunity that we didn't have before
part of the driver that made Internet
successful I think were some
fundamentally new ideas one of which was
packet switching and the other one was
that networks should be able to cope to
be federated that it didn't have to be a
single uniform system that multiple
parties could build their own networks
and then had a
a kind of organizing principle that
allowed them to be interconnected if we
discover different and maybe better
organizing principles we might end up
with something dramatically better than
the internet and it's opening up the
opportunity to explore those possible
alternative organizing principles it
might help some of the things you're
doing Kevin for example when you play
around with the address space in the
namespace and the ability to be more
flexible about that are pushing in
directions that the current network
struggles go ahead I was just told to
other people were ahead to when I was
going to come under here be less like
when later well my question is a little
off base it's about the future of energy
and what I wanted to ask you guys about
was your opinion on the computer
scientists that are now saying let's
take an internet approach to kind of the
grid in the future of energy management
and all this kinds of thing and I just
like your thoughts on that thinking does
that sound correct to you does it sound
like that kind of you know approach
might work or is that just lucky I guess
I suppose Sanjay let me offer you some
data points because I I think the fact
that people have been thinking about
that is really interesting because I
think it's a subset of a couple of
things it is showing the influence of
you know we're right in the middle of a
shift from an information-centric
electronic centric view of the world and
shifting to a bio centric view of the
world and so you start seeing people
looking at the electrical grid not just
in terms of the internet but saying you
know are their biologic models for how
this works and its leading to people
talking about energy generation
differently three examples my good
friend Stuart brand has a book coming
out Stewart Brand Whole Earth Catalog
you know top environmentalist in the
book he's making a strong case that we
must use nuclear power which is going to
shock as environmental as friends then
you have other people looking at solar
saying wait a second at the rate solar
installations are doubling it'll only
take eight doublings before solar
collectors can deliver all of our
energy but that's a distributed system
and it requires a new kind of
distributed architecture and then you
have the third set of people saying well
if it's if we're going to have solar if
we have distributed how do we store
energy so there's a retired scientist
from Lawrence Livermore labs who's
saying we need to create a whole new
kind of battery for solar because
today's power batteries really at the
level of what we're talking about for
electrical power only store for what
three to six hours or so even if you're
talking about fancy supercapacitors made
out of unobtainium and so he said well
why don't we use it come up with a new
catalyst to more efficiently split water
using electricity to generate hydrogen
to make natural gas and the natural gas
you create is the battery that you then
feed into the existing natural gas
distribution system so I and those three
examples of everybody in the energy
space is starting to flip backwards on
their assumptions environmentalists are
saying we need nuclear centralized
people are saying we need distributed
solar other people saying we need
radically different approaches to
batteries and underneath all of that is
an electrical system that is vastly more
heterogeneous than it is today you know
it's not a monoculture of power stations
and it's going to need a radically
different kind of architecture so the
folks working on that it has a smell of
a nap ability all right so thank you um
actually this this is following up on
the energy question at some level and
it's coming back to Vince point about
the lsi and then pointed out that the
VLSI programming was when we managed to
abstract the physics fast enough that
somebody could deal with it in a digital
world more conveniently and it seems to
me that one of our crashing problems and
I'm going to be interested to know how
the guys up front field because because
they've been dealing with someone to
know with quantum from chip and and so
forth that the issue is we seem to be
running to lots of places where have to
program physics we are running to a
situation where suddenly we need
programmers who understand the physical
world that they're trying to program
because the sensors give them actuators
the physical world in wireless I mean
I'm you know you talk with van who boss
and the number one thing he says is like
an hire a computer scientist and it
takes me 18 months to teach them enough
RF physics a usual do me I've higher in
our a physicist and I've spent to use
teaching them and of programming that
they useful to me in dealing with a
software radio similarly in the energy
environment at some level when you start
building more sophisticated contributed
control systems for energy you have to
start understanding what goes on and the
fact that i'm told i know very little
about the energy system they're insane
nonlinearities that start to show up you
sort of tip a tiny bit and suddenly
everything goes ape wild you know the
current starts running the opposite
direction or whatever you know nifty
things that go on on the different power
circuits I don't know how are we going
to do with that are we going to manage
to find new digital paradigms because we
don't very hard to teach a whole lot of
people to do analog programming and
where are they going to come from
actually I'd like to respond to that and
say that you're right on target a number
of people who teach electrical
engineering have told me repeatedly that
people come in who are perfectly good at
designing logic circuits but we're down
at you know the sizes of the circuits
are down at the point where quantum
effects are an issue they haven't the
foggiest idea why stuff doesn't work
because they don't understand the
physics of it they don't understand the
analog world and that's a huge issue in
fact you suggest to me that there's some
serious opportunity here for you know
educational curriculum reform if nothing
else it also suggests Craig that there
needs to be a real effort to tear down
disciplinary barriers I mean I now hate
the word disciplines not discipline but
disciplines because it implies that
things are segregated and we know
they're not and they're becoming more
and more conflated because of the places
where we're operating either and they're
also small or the ultra large so your
question I don't have a good answer for
where are they going to come from except
for the fact that we got to start
thinking about what people should be
learning in order to be ready to do the
right things in the next 10 to 15 years
Logan is one problem is that the
we look to the universities to do that
and you know to some extent the
wonderful at accomplishing it on the
other hand they are the most
conservative slow-moving bureaucratic
organizations and so you know you think
that computer science departments in
really exists in 30 years ago no roads
in that time around but you imagine
getting rid of them now over there they
forever even if they don't make sense
anymore and you know that and what's
happening with electrical engineering
and computer science departments is that
they are being forced right now to
rethink their existence they are their
curriculum I think it's wonderful and
you know our own Department have been
doing it but clearly it's happening at
it at every school real rethinking of
the curriculum because I think everyone
understands knows that there is a
problem of which you speak is you know
it's not enough to teach someone how to
how to do logic design plus a little bit
of low-level programming anymore on call
them an electrical engineer or a
computer engineer it's as you need to
give them access to be able to learn in
those new skills very quickly and
familiarity with them and that that
really will transform the curriculum and
i would bet that no one's about it right
yet i'm going to say a real big
transformation in the next next few
years I think it's a good place for me
to stop I don't have a question I'm
getting a strange sense of deja vu in
the skin in part of this conversation
especially from craigs remarks because I
remember hearing the story in the 60s
about whether one should hire people who
could do numerical analysis or people
could program computers and which was
easier to turn into the other one and we
heard issues about modeling and whether
it was easier to tire somebody who
understood the insert field and teach
them about the computing or hire
somebody who knew about the computing
and so on so this is an old problem with
without the presence of computer science
departments which I agree may
contaminate things further uh the other
thing I I'm hearing
in in pieces of this conversation and
would like some thoughts on is is the
echo of wiener claiming that digital
computers were really going nowhere and
he never really got digital computers
and was basically claiming that that
when we started getting to what we would
now described as as the limiting end
game of this digital stuff we would go
be back the discovering analog computing
analog processing no no response that
was a provocative I am the only thing I
would say is I am I completely agree you
know sensors are analog devices and when
they started appearing I mean when MEMS
came on to the radar til pun intended
you know in 1992-93 everybody started
asking the same question and if you
think about in my rather inarticulate
way what I was trying to say is this
moment relative to sensors is the same
as 1988 was relative to the arrival of
lots of optically enabled bandwidth and
we were all scratching our heads and had
the sense that something big was about
to happen and all of our forecasts were
wrong and the think that we think we
thought that was really far away turned
out to show up in the early 90s and the
thing we thought that was right there
cd-rom never really showed up at all I
think the same thing happens with sensor
technologies and and not only in terms
of its impact on how we use the network
and how it affects our lives but how we
think about this relationship between
digital and analog
I think that's that all that part I'm
fine with when you go and then say and
the thing that this time I i we are
going to protect right is robots the
problem I have with is that's only true
if you define robots to be so general
and that I that i'm not sure why we're
using the term robot agree to thoughts
one I think robots will be nothing like
anything that we imagine today that the
second point in my defense is and I'm
you know I'm sharing an idea here in the
spirit of this meeting that is not a
complete idea and then the only other
thing I would say is recalling Herman
Kahn who in the early 60s wrote in the
front of one of his reports warning
portions of this report are
intentionally misleading in order to
provoke thought in this case I'd be none
intentionally misleading because I don't
have the answer yet myself Tony one of
the things I love about coming out to
the valley is basically hearing and all
a future of the way things could be
ideally most other venues are decidedly
not quite cevapi so I'd be curious to
hear if each of you describe the worst
case prognosis for the future and maybe
what we will actually see is somewhere
in between well I tell you what my worst
case scenario is with regard to the
internet it gets locked up the the
incumbents control everything they
succeed in avoiding net neutrality and
non-discrimination they become sole
suppliers of access to broadband
facilities they throttle innovation they
prevent competition for higher level
services and we end up with a kind of
wasteland where
the access to the internet and its
applications are kind of like television
there channelized they are monetized
they are controlled in a way that simply
stifles any contribution coming from the
the general public or from you know the
universities or anything else it would
be the antithesis of the kind of future
that I would like to see you know evolve
Jim let me let me give you my Genie
version of the nightmare which is a nick
and other people working on geni build a
beautiful infrastructure on which people
could do experiments in research and no
one has the desire to do it I really
myself personally feel the American
education system is having a lot of
troubles we've never been particularly
interested in education in this country
and I don't think the level is going up
so it really could turn out quite badly
if we spend a generation or so not
really training people how to build
these systems so and month it'll be a
little bit more like Vince sort of 55
things one is that I do I fear what the
centralization of data means because
it's I I feel as that we are all giving
up something by the centralization of
our data and the loss of control that we
have over over it the second one is that
once we have lost control of our data we
use control over how we process that
data and you know the the services and
applications that we run again and I'm
hoping that right now is a temporary
we're going through a temporary phase
where someone figures out how to how to
do that just just as a visitor I come
into this complex and notice that you
have a statue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex and
a shark fin what if google went bad yeah
so I i think that's that's worrying i
think that something will happen to to
stuff here the third one that I worry
about is very similar to what they are
saying is that the the the closed walls
of those who own actually the wireless
infrastructure will keep those walls
closed and that whereas as I sit here
and we all sit here there is huge amount
of wireless capacity around us from many
providers Wi-Fi several operators that I
can't harness it all why can't i harness
all of it why can I nihon as one at a
time maicon announces seven of them at a
time I go had as many of them at a time
and use that it is not a capacity bro
it's a contribute say it's a contractual
problem its walls that are built there
why can't i connect to five or six of
them and five or six Wi-Fi at the same
time and the fourth one related or what
saying only I I fear that the network
infrastructure will stay fixed and
closed I think that we have to say the
emperor has no clothes and that we've
allowed it to stay ossified and that
needs to change the fifth one little
unrelated is there are many talks like
I'm sure you have where people say you
know this new technology with jeet with
GPS built on it these handheld devices
it means that when I walk up to someone
at a party we're both going to see
something on the on the screen that
tells us what we have in common one of
the things actually fears me that I fear
is that we will forget that it's fine
just to walk up to someone and say hello
and you know it's there are we going to
be driven by our geekiness to sort of
forget or our selves that worries me too
oh I'm just so grateful we all gave up
trying to be my business cards to each
other with our palm so I I'm with you
know pessimism is the new black and so
they're all of these apocalyptic
scenarios is a forecaster I love
collecting these things my favorite one
at the moment it ain't going to happen I
can promise you that the there are a
bunch of people who believe that the end
of the Mayan calendar is in 2012 and I
can state with some Authority I used to
be fluent in Maya I actually worked on
Mayan hieroglyphs I can count and
modified vajeza well so I'm a
sophisticated consumer the experts in
the field and these these superstitious
folks have
all wrong but their nightmare is is
going to consign with the peak of the
next solar cycle which should start up
in the next couple of months it will all
be screwed so that's the negative one
let me give you the middle range
forecast so I actually think this will
happen this is a likely outcome you know
it's not hell it's not heaven you know
it's not cyberspace it's not cyber hell
it's sort of cyber BIA this world have
been perfect networks and information
you know we all worry about losing our
data famously I forget who said it first
it wasn't me said information in digital
form last forever or 45 years whichever
comes first so we all worry about losing
our data I'm with you about the cloud
but here's my forecast we're going to
end up inevitably in a world where we
will in fact lose the information we
most want preserved but it will also be
a world in which the information we
you
her colleagues energy you find what we
want and we can't shed what we really
hope would go wow god ok last coming
last comment I spent my time and a lot
of international fora where the few us
people were there basically advocate
Vince worst case vision who is also
there are lots of brilliant innovative
PhD young people from China Korea Japan
who are looking for innovation
leadership from the United States and
it's not there so I think one of the
things we need to think about as we
leave is taking all this marvelous
vision and creative energy and realize
that this is now a global business if
the extent anyone wasn't aware of that
but that it is decidedly less us centric
and think of ways basically to engage
and to be effective on a global scale
with all those others that are out there
that are yearning for this kind of
creative interaction and then clearly
needs to fly more if they're lacking in
leadership over that thanks a lot ok
actually you have microphone did you
want to make a comment I just wanted to
just point out that what's great about
the valley is that we're internationally
optimistic and I hope we don't start
thinking about like worst-case scenarios
because you know instead of just talking
we're just doing you know when to when
to graduate students like go and say oh
we're gonna organize the words
information that's kind of you know it's
irrational but they went ahead and did
it so I think it's good to keep like you
know just thinking positive but I had
one comment to Nick because in your
presentation you you mentioned i mean
the the status quo sounded like you know
ninety percent overhead that you have to
pay to Cisco
other companies because of the that you
know those 20 million lines of code that
you have that like you know probably
like very few people are in taking
advantage of and I wonder if that kind
of like you know that kind of like
disruptive technology that you want to
improve that you want to implement
should be competing based on price
because that was the you know the TU to
begin at the beginning of your
presentation you talked about the fact
that like in ninety percent of the money
was just being lost on like that code
that overhead I think that that just
means it's inevitable the fact that you
know the underlying hardware costs you
know Tim I know what the right number is
about ten percent of what they that just
means it's just a question of time if
you're looking for cracks in the wall
there's a crack that it'll just open up
and it's kind of it's already open done
right it's it's so that's in the process
of happening I don't think that's
necessarily the reason to do it but that
just makes it inevitable what will then
happen on top hopefully is that once
that has opened up that you get that
power of that open source or developers
community of the world that will
innovate on innovate on top but i don't
think that price alone is the right
reason to do it it just means that it's
it's not sustainable alright so the
comment was you look for those things
that are not sustainable they weren't
there for they're not sustainable and so
what happens when they break down and I
think it's just one that just waiting to
happen to some extent I think it already
has are there are some applications that
you're thinking about that would be
enabled by your architecture like you
know I'd at the at the top layer sure we
could I be listing I don't want to
disrupt time because I mean this could
take we can talk about this offline but
yeah so I i'll be happy happy to I mean
before I leave happy to a bit Spence
them sometime doin my thing is you want
to get can I just say one last thing
about the at the education and that is
that as as like many people in the room
as a non-american
that I actually I think they're thinking
about it as American leadership is has
often being wrong and I think it's still
wrong that the leadership that we think
of as being American is a combination of
American born and trained plus an
enormous ability to harness those people
that come here and that that leadership
though is yes it's physically located
here and the actually one cynical way of
ever think about is we don't necessarily
need a great education system here we
just need to be able to keep attracting
as many people as possible so I wouldn't
I don't look with so much gloom and doom
and the K through 12 like what with more
gloom and doom the the college and above
because it's still a phenomenal magnet
now in the u.s. maintains if ya how many
of us would consider living anywhere of
those living areas considered living
anywhere else I think that will continue
in the same so I don't think it's quite
so scary ok oh alright Carla reminds me
there are several things that we need to
do first of all let's thank the panel
thank you you may stand down second I
want to make sure that that we all show
our appreciation for Carla and Denise
and all hard work that they did
organizing this thing so where's me
Denise not here well she'll get to see
it on the camera oh there you are i'm
sorry i didn't know where you weren't
all right the last thing I wanted to do
is to borrow another quote from my
friend doc brown because we've been
talking about the future and if you
remember the back to the future three
where the paper is blank and the reason
the paper is blank is because the future
hasn't been written yet that's your job
