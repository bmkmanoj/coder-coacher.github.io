Esperanto is I can probably say it
question because I always wanted to
learn it but only about one year ago I
found that you start somehow triggered
by don't know about okay let's start
so what what is Esperanto
Esperanto is a constructed language it
was designed by a single person
oh look in the late 19th century and it
has a purpose of uniting people and
relating them you could communicate
freely on the home grounds where nobody
gets an advantage and what's interesting
like in in contrast to say your Nokia
technical is not a linguist he's just
just okay he is a optician so he is eyes
doctor but he was very good with
languages he used something like hand of
them with all five like good level and
last but he was worried to the high
polish and he was as he said himself
from his childhood he was tortured by
the idea that people are divided by
languages and his town went where he
lived in Prague
there were for any groups Germans
Russians Jews and Papa punish people and
every member of each community
considered everyone else to be Amos and
that was just intolerable and the bluebe
promised to himself but when people lose
up he fixes that problem that's comfy
so the history uh he started working on
it very early in
seventies of 19th century so he was I
don't 12 14 years
at the time by 1878 he was saying that
the language is almost there it's mostly
finished it's good but as he was very
young at the time he was only and he
will he had problems publishing a book
was not very possible which turned
around to be a really good thing because
one year later volapük
started volatile was the first
constructive language it's from
it's bleeped oh it was glowing very
brightly for few years but it was a
disaster for example uh yeah in in five
or six years after announcement book and
first conference people came to it and
it was immediately obvious that nobody
speaks it people will demolish in like
five years or six years to just learn
look nobody can speak it it was it was
very flexible if there is a depletion of
mobility
that's volatile it's every word has
every possible like declinations flexing
every single verb had more than help one
and help thousand firms so a tank of
learned on the mistakes and desperate
was works hope it works
but eventually went into just history so
in 1887 the first book called first
libro was published it was the desperado
it was very similar to what it is now
but there was still some changes
afterwards the Engler how much in seven
years there was first conference where
people were actually conversing in
Esperanto next year the conference was
converted to actual I don't know
Congress and it was held every year
since then except for old works in the
same era there was a book published it
was called fundamental Esperanto the
fundament of Esperanto and it was
declared that from this point on the
language does not change so the language
we know as of now is the language most
published in this book and the purpose
of it is to ease the learning and to not
let different communities three weeks
apart
in 1919 there was a proposal in the
League of Nations to make the Esperanto
language of scientific community there
was temple voices for one voice against
the voice against was by French
representative and French was losing the
status of international language at this
time the English was winning and they
were not very capable but anyway in two
years they decided okay let's go and it
was recommended there were actually
scientific papers published in Esperanto
at the time and the growth was very
significant in order of the end of 19th
century especially it was the time of
scientific breakthroughs and people were
extremely excited about the bright new
future that awaits them and people
joining together coming on common
grounds on a single language which is
scientifically today was very natural
however the first and second world wars
didn't really show that people tend to
unite
also are many countries especially
Germany and Russia words simply content
Esperantists they were declared like
spies the kind of unit of informational
spy network that are fighting against
the regime and it was like red libel you
know you speak Esperanto
let's let's give you and the cold war
zone also not why she can't repeatedly
but still thousands and century it's
broken again at the moment there are
like that estimates are very vague
because it's hard to estimate speakers
we're not single nation speaks it the
the estimates are about like thousand
people for whom the language is native
so it's usually China father but just a
couple which speak as ground to each
other and child also start speaking or
and
there are like 10,000 people who speaks
it's really good ten hundred thousand
people solution more or less speaking
and like millions of people forget to
try it no ed already alphabet
it contains each dimension obviously or
it contains 28 letters pipe I think
marbles and five letters have deputies
what's interesting more people was
heavily criticized for framing umlauts
this progress in mobile it's not doesn't
seem to be a problem oh the in android
keyboard the whole sound is on like you
need to impress but it's the turn
maybe thousand of words that actually
have it so yeah it's and they support
smile to what to include since few
months which is nice oh the writing is
poetic there is a one-to-one mapping
between sounds and let letters if it
spell correctly you can pronounce it
correctly if it's pronounced lightly you
can spell it down currently the sounds
put apart in such a way that excellent
doesn't really matter it's explicitly
said that it's fine if you speak as far
as what exit the only think you have to
do is to make sounds perfectly know for
some people certain sounds my problems
like for me distinguishing between woof
and who is sometimes a program some
people confuse on the dot it's like
English H and the Russian itself I think
there are some for for it is pronounced
horse always close to what Swiss people
using like pink that's prob'ly accent
like I speak in English with the Russian
it
so it's easier to tell them apart when
somebody's the same you here what is
this out that every person can Semites
it okay so and just every letter reads
as you probably can expect it
except for so it is sir as a pizza or
Russian sampler
but this is should should do and what so
Oh sounds operating once familiar and
yeah ah okay and then in the bouquet I
was written there was actually
definition for each sound where you can
talk where it come to open the coffee
yourself differently what is in the
dictionary
most of the okay the size of the tissue
occurs in the very first like in new
liberal that was the lesson than a
thousand roots is a instruments measured
by roots no my words because each group
can produce every possible part of
speech like but now in for objective at
work whatever as long as it makes sense
in the when the spirit was frozen at the
first Congress there was almost three
thousand words or two more thousand
ports were added over last century in
comparison okay not not worth root in
comparison this is the data from summer
time from summer like native English
four-year-old operates about five
thousand words and adult operates like
twenty to thirty five thousand depending
on how educated the person ate so
obviously it's easy to learn if there
are less words in a language so the the
roots themselves roots were chosen from
different languages I think there was
French and German as
or primary goals French Open because it
was international language in German
probably was considered to be Mexican
today with English and and several other
languages in a control group and the
routes were chosen in the same in the
way that the move languages contain this
rule then more likely to get into the
language obviously not with every route
it's possible so here for instance
so please is a route so freezer would be
preserved frizzy would be to work on
somebody's here and so on so
internationally if the translation says
to come to use at home sometimes route
contain contains reference just to
single image in this case it's French
so if this is French German no English
German version polish yes okay um so
this is example of just the German oh
this is this is very very close to
Russian co-host so only once on this
mission and one are extracted at the end
and this is an asshole
duck this is this comes from way to
nature here are some so more of the
roots it's in the title and here's some
more examples in other roots I something
but frankly every all of the three scene
seemed very Russian to me small words in
Esperanto there are two kinds of words
words which which declared his roots and
worst which whereas words already with
over almost press cow that would be
small word so they are written without
this apostrophe at the end which means
that they are complete words still
people can use them as
roots so you can add endings and produce
new words out of them
for example post which means behind if
you say pasta which is a pronoun which
means it would be it would mean later
words put together cool means together
meta means and ash means product so
llama means man who who came to who
lives basically a lot of our smaller is
a device that helps such person walk
cortana means the the court a flank them
is the curtain curtain which is to the
side dae-su fixes and practices the real
power of Esperanto when you harness the
power of stuff it is you to really see
how powerful the languages for example
the suffix R means product so Bobo is a
cow or Bo Marshall is beef onions member
ragdoll means the state the girl yes the
country regnal who is a citizen our
connection our PO 1/3 of our forests in
this candle so Bobo is a cow Boveda
would be called and Bobby Darin would be
middle time though for Bommarito would
mean a scandal of beef which something
that amazes a mark new kitchen so dextra
write more text relate and basically
anything can be negated it's a sweet
hello next place right
mild excellent sweet will be Deutsche
and mine my torture is really on sweet I
don't know this hour
no no so this means like 2d sector small
pieces to to fall apart
pasta means place once because this has
to spread so you put something into the
pieces and distribute it to big
territory and each suffix means to to
make something so if I say move et
cetera i if i fighting them whatever
movie just it's moving by itself so
Civic Sedan prefixes offices they can be
used by themselves so for instance or ad
is so fixed which makes things smaller
so I know say Joe is the chair say Jetta
would be small chairs in say Jacob would
be really huge well but you can just
take the suffix and also a means
adjective attack small angle would be
heat to fix is together unless a member
are is connection so this is a truth
that I always provided Bobby Darin yes
yes means yes as an English yes it is to
confirm so you make something yes
don't worry that we need to continue to
Ricky to extend to make longer grumpy to
break all wrong be to fix
tablet with them the table works those
are another Myrtle there are five
prefixes and the ten different endings
and you can combine them in any possible
way he means question she means like
this it means some unknown many known
and cheap all
so the question killer what data respect
to that or GT or at least specific 1q
nan you know 1q how much so those five
and those ten combined in any possible
combinations you can just take any of
them and take any of other and even get
a word topics ah yes I did go to the
summit services who means person or
means object onions quality as in
adjectives I'm inside the own means
quantity place direction or reason
method of doing and possession who loses
level so he s whose lease my is it thing
as is MIA and the last example Kia where
everywhere how does look how does this
process look like
here are two small text one is an
English it goes I believe it's about the
child and dragons several white and this
problem somewhat smaller because of I
think this is because exactly of those
suit exist you had the words mean more
so it's about 10% see whether I need to
say the similar comparison on and it was
30% smaller because of more information
density sound of it
you
keya Vega Patrick that citizens through
AVS Branton
to an idea but wailing continues for
Esperanto camp ioss plantain Connect I'm
the oldest astronomical to follow me on
spelling for check on me Jamie Lenny's
Mia Petrino SS hunger a me a Patrick
Franta and Kylie pants is care who knew
Esperanto Kapusta me have a stamp on let
me me Italian anything going on - so -
to some people or this sound that's not
their language but they know that this
is probably this one in the during the
Second World War in conservation comes
that reason is were actually teaching
each other is pirata and they were
telling to Germans that they teach in
Italian and personal introduction was
accepted I fight using in Italy like do
Cosmo baby no one balloon they
understand they think it's Spanish words
the parts of the speech so verbs have
the most endings there is so he means
indefinite form means quality so it's
like imaginary situation but you
actually actively want this to happen
and if past past present or future
so me more force that naturally means
that I will move it
whose is just imaginary situation hey
what if all nouns and in all there are
additional so it can end in ie if it's
plural or even if it's a positive there
are cases nominative and accusative
adjectives and our end and so on there
are so many participles so passive and
active which many of them don't have
direct translations
languages they were very easy to add but
like positive future participle I think
don't really exist in natural languages
Omega gentle no the antics aren't means
the person not person person is my aunt
means actively happening expiry means to
home so Esper and or means the some
someone who hopes there was a single
remote sample and it was a transfer to
to the name of the language okay yes
there are fixes variety and gauge why is
it easy to learn the primary reason is
that there are six ten rules and exactly
zero exceptions the most of the time I
don't know maybe fifty to eighty percent
of the time when you learn natural
language you spend learning exceptions
here all this time is removed the
structure is very regular if you think
that this can probably put together
that's right it can be put together as
long as you can make sense out of it and
obviously the roots were careful picked
from different languages so that it's
easier to memorize critics during some
critics of Esperanto or I found this
article it's in Italian but the Google
Translate does a really good job there
are like open proponent and the
scientific approach basically out of the
whole list the only one is really
acknowledged like yes this is there
which is the suffix in which means
feminine hero man theory and the people
say I look this is not balanced this is
like this is 19th century it's like as
balanced as you can think this is the
imbalance is not in the language it's in
people's heads as as soon as you
understand that this is actually adds
more than it takes away
it's it's really not a program it's just
cool oh yeah so feel free to who to read
more so the example understand this is
my own experience I learned really
intensively over December in January
then I figured out that my gerbil really
suffers so I promised myself to not do
anything about Esperanto so I I spent
six months just German alone it's to the
site in general and then I started again
maybe and here is some example I mark
the words that were not cleared so none
of here means that I wasn't hundred
percent sure that I understood them
somehow
I did notice boots on Sam we were kind
of understandable from context so that's
how much you can basically understand
after two months of studying language
here's why three it's almost over it I
know Russian I know English and I had a
little
I am I don't know I know that there was
a primary group of languages and a
control group where for picking up the
roots I know that certain things that
are always easy to learn will be picked
from some language like the definite
article na and indefinite article which
is absence of the article was taken from
Peru the flexsim or like combining of
words and affixes were taken from Slavic
Languages where they proved already to
be really powerful the verbs that was
not changing like with first second
third person was taken from English
there and so also it was I know how
scientific is that actually frankly but
it was carefully studied what pieces of
the language of different languages
Mikey
but then easy to learn and that was
brought in yes over how it works in
drifted away
how about Esperanto this protein is
frozen by decree it does not change
which makes is actually far too early
because at least for me I use the
dictionary that was published in 1905
and I can see actually the meaning why
this specific Russian word means this
now like why is it used because there it
has different meaning but it is clear
how this transition so from
starting on history perspective it
actually breeds more and most likely it
does the same job for other languages
other pipe that I mean d'etre so what's
about he means there are news words oh
yes there was a slide that they added
more than 2,000 words so from time to
time it's like once in 10 15 years
Edition Kindle is printed the here are
new words that we agreed that everybody
uses so they just confirm that yes those
words already used without don't reduce
them it's it's a matter of fact mr.
Russo Cruz yes I same words but angles
geographically people are all clustered
it was somewhat through before First
World War there was a small triangle I
don't know where 200 meters which was
declared declared to be a separate
country and this brother was an official
language early and everyone the First
World War started the troops actually
went around for some time but it was
just like okay this is something this is
our now and no more of this country
anymore
ok so why why study the biggest I think
at least for me the biggest reason is
that it is just fun it's sort or
immersion when you study a language like
I think about Nazi Germany language here
you understand that you might progress
it makes you feel good here you tell
they get here you get exactly the same
thing from like one tenth of a price
one last whisper Otto's like one year of
facial language study this is
so it just works it's the same reason
why people play computer games just for
to have fun but if it's not there are
some smaller things so there were some
experiments and which show although the
study misper on the first or easiest
study of other language there would be
some data later it
as I already said as other languages
drifted away but you use the old Eternia
you can use the dictionary as well they
are available but you can see the
history of going which of your own
language of other languages counting
drifted for example English or to browse
means to makes noise make noise
I don't whites you the played for this
particular case I don't see what where
is the bridge there was probably some
intermediate point which I don't see but
the the minutes mostly unchanged
economics there are some studies that
for Europe Europe the I'm over time
that's better
in Europe there is a huge economic
losses because English is the
international language and people have
to study it and translate everything and
it benefits english-speaking community
more than it benefits here so there are
some proposals to make it or
international language and yes it helps
you to communicate you get understanding
of languages that you don't normally
know so this is some research in Germany
they did they took a group of French
students and compared how it compares to
other languages
given the numbers that is something like
a 100 maybe a 2 but yeah it is fraud is
great so you can get the certificate
in other study which is so yes noting
one year is permanent ironic learning
French versus four years French gives
better results and another observation
was on only Keith which was I think
approximately the same two years has
brought the years French and actually
ended up with better French there for
Pierce eight years so meets its
brother's death it's not that it was
almost killed during world wars but no
it isn't partly it failed to achieve its
goals the goals were claimed to be like
everybody involved uses it only at least
as far as the formal it didn't fail
because there was a facility it might
take several teachers this is just like
its I love how the person come to the
but it's it's all regular it takes a lot
of roots from European languages however
its most popular in Europe and Asia
yes it has certain bias towards your
filming and I thought yet another very
pure myth that there is a community if
you want like to learn part lighted in
and want to find the real Buddha started
you can go and Luke Inspiron community I
don't know why these can be rated okay
and doing that that's how I learned it's
there it's really good if you want to
get grammar there it gives you
everything also the level which is which
means go alone it's all the resource
thanks in Surrey the three Buddhist who
have this page my practice is mostly
original and sometimes writing I'm
trying to find a beer in my own language
exchange so that we can like chat over
Skype but it's the density of speakers
they looked at no no I did not
I know that either way this content of
Esperanto it means the scandal so ego is
and is candid I don't know what's inside
it what have changed
so yeah so yes it's hard to like so I
don't really use it I study but I think
it is easier I cannot just say four
hundred percent but that's my opinion
because the boundaries between work
minute they are much more pronounced and
it is easier
to say what what exactly and stay
not-not-not week I actually have an
impression that this brand is more
flexible on delivering the meaning than
Russian which is my native language so
it might be that except it is actually
more flexible and more precise than any
other part of the crater when it was
that Ukrainian language do they ride I
mean I know poetry doesn't have to wrap
it like a song yes there are songs I
haven't listened to them yet but I know
they exist
so I try it would be approximately the
same as bad as I memories in German she
captured snare for Bella Bella Navin
capillary Paulo near them tight this is
not poetry this is just frozen yeah no I
I heard that points in Esperanto
sometimes try to bend the rules it's
like if there is one to one
correspondence with sounds and letters
yes accent which is not enough in other
injection but where you put the stress
yes it's always the second to converse
too big
the original set of letters and sounds I
think that the sounds were choosing so
that people are more less confident with
the set of sounds and also the the
primary reason was to put put them apart
so it's easier to recognize yes that
could be as well though when routes were
transferred from other languages
sometimes the pronunciation was
preserved sometimes the Spanish preserve
parts and it is actually easier to lower
Xfinity preserve heavenly creation or
given stream of sounds there is one
unique way to split it into words it
also is it's small as the case yes it's
when I was marking those words sometimes
I was working just a part of the work
like here
reiji's it's it's clear that it's clay
and each is just inserted into it and as
is so this is verb in past which is
something happening to itself and the
Cree clay is as I know now this is to
create so this is creates some fears
maybe
