here at Google on web performance and
this is the fifth Tech Talk speaker that
I've brought in and for various reasons
I've decided to give a name to this
speaker series and so I'm calling the
web exponents where exponents is in the
sense of people advocating a cause we're
here the cause is raising awareness of
web technology and innovation and I even
have a marketing tagline for this I
don't think I sent that out in the email
the tekkit so its web exponents and the
tagline is raising web technology to a
higher power yeah it's not too cheesy
okay it's pretty cheesy and so we're
gonna I'm gonna do a blog post next week
that will you know talking about this
speaker series and some of the future
speakers coming out and it will also
have a link there's a YouTube playlist
that mark chou who works here at Google
and who does most of the video work
that's required to get these talks
available he created a playlist on
YouTube and so all the talks videos of
the talks will be there and just as a
reminder some of the past speakers we've
had our John Resig Doug Crockford last
week PPK was here talking about mobile
web I had a talk in there we've got rob
campbell today and i'm lining up some
other speakers going forward feel free
to send me an email with other
suggestions of speakers you'd like to
see here so today we have rob campbell
so a couple years ago myself and a few
other folks started the Firebug working
group after Joe Hewitt had started
working on other projects to try to keep
Firebug development alive and prosperous
and about eight months ago Mozilla
contributed some people to work on that
project and one of those folks is
rob campbell and he's kind of in my mind
become the ringleader of the effort so
we have weekly con calls and he's always
driving the concall and driving the
schedule and tracking the critical bugs
and going back and working with folks at
Mozilla for other connections that we
need and I feel like something he's
really contributed to that effort that
was needed out of the you know like 11
Firebug releases was a lot of stability
and testing and so I think you would all
agree with me that you know now we're on
13 and it's very stable I mean of course
there's always going to be issues but
you know to me it's it's night and day
the difference in stability there so I'm
really thankful that Rob is riding herd
on that effort and so I invited Rob D
condors you know 14 is out now we
actually had a meeting yesterday with
the Firebug working group talking about
15 and 16 in future directions and so I
invited Rob to come today and kind of
give us a walkthrough of fire bugs and
new features and then I think he's going
to talk a little bit about some of that
perspective on stability that he's
brought to Firebug and some lessons
learned there so without any further ado
please help me in welcoming rob campbell
from mozilla thanks um do I have to
actually talk into this Mike can you
people online hear this ok have to talk
from the mine ok ok so thanks for that
introduction Steve it's good to be here
and meet all you find Googlers so the
topic is debugging the web it's really
going to be mostly about Firebug 1.4 I'm
going to demo some of the new features
and the layout and show maybe a couple
examples of some little tricks that I
picked up along the way and
there's time permitting an interest as
Steve mentioned I'll talk a little bit
about open source projects like firebug
and how I've contributed and hopefully
helped and see how that goes so first
thing and this is sort of project
related we're going to do something
called a test day next week which are
Mozilla QA people have decided to set up
to help us it'll take place mostly in
IRC that's our our IRC server there so
if if anybody's interested in that i'll
be blogging about it probably this
weekend early next week to try to get
the word out a little bit and we'd
appreciate anybody that can actually
show up and help run through some tests
so I'll just skip over this a little bit
as Steve mentioned Joe Hewitt is the
originator of Firebug and for whatever
reason he decided to move on to other
things a little later John Barton
started picking up the code Steve joined
the Firebug working group and then
versions 1.2 and 1.3 had the
introduction of a bunch of other
contributors to it I came around at the
beginning of about 1.3 so that was last
year in July so what is a debugger we
typically when we think of debuggers we
think about debuggers for our computers
or desktops and they're generally pretty
ugly they're often terminal based
sometimes I'm just wrapped into an IDE
and they look a little better the web
looks a little different so I imagine
most of you are familiar with Firebug so
I didn't actually include a picture of
it this here is a picture of our new
context menu on the status bar so when
you right-click on that now you're going
to see a menu like this pop
and there's a couple of additions to it
that weren't there before these are all
tied in with our new activation model
which we're hoping is going to be a lot
simpler than the previous version before
I don't know how many people are
familiar with Firebug you turn it on
before you typically have to enable or
disable a bunch of other panels console
the script panel the net panel these
things were disabled by default and
there were good reasons I think for that
initially but Steve and some other users
have found that to be unnecessarily
difficult so we rework that for version
1.4 now when you turn it on everything
should just be enabled the first I think
tip that I wanted to point out and a lot
of people don't realize this that little
bug up in the top left corner of the
panel is actually a menu if you click on
it these magical things appear and I
sort of highlighted this open with
editor option because it's a pretty
useful 14 for dealing with changes to
your web page and and and saving those
for for later this is another type of
menu the console menu HTML menu panel
these things all have them and we we
used to have an options menu that was
down in the toolbar area which is down
here I'm going to actually stop here for
a second and just mention we flipped the
tab menu around the tabs around at the
toolbar the toolbar used to be on the
top Curtis rightfully pointed out Curtis
Bartley is I actually sitting off camera
you probably can't see him but he was
instrumental in pointing out the
wrongness of this orientation and then
proceeded to implement it not once but
four times to get it right and we're
pretty happy with the results but these
menus appear off these little triangles
on each of the tabs and they contain a
bunch of
different options related to each one of
those tabs so you can see here I've got
a bunch of stuff and this error message
in the background is actually because
I've got chrome errors turned on one of
the other extensions that I'm running
with had some poorly initialized button
so it it showed up in there the other
new feature that I think is going to be
a huge hit is something John Barton did
for this release and you'll see two
instances of this when you go to the
script panel you'll see one of them down
here on the toolbar with the other
debugging buttons and we've also added
one up to the top it looks like a pause
button and that's essentially what it
does it enables break on next debugging
which means you turn it on when the next
JavaScript call comes through the
debugger stops and it will bring you to
the line of code that is trying to
execute and then you can step in step
over do the usual debugging tricks this
is going to be great for tracking
listeners on web pages that you can't
find otherwise the other area that's
seen a lot of improvement is the network
panel and this is directly related to
steves inputs and helpful suggestions
and implemented by our rock star yawn
oddvar Co he can't be here he's doing
rock and roll things elsewhere he did a
lot of work cleaning up the the images
the the colors the gradients and he's
worked really hard at improving the
timing on the network panel it should be
much more accurate in version 1.4 than
it wasn't version 1.3 and 1.2 and all
versions before that not sure how
visible it is we've got these two
horizontal vertical lines running
through this timeline here these both
represent loaded events that are
propagating up the first one is dawn
content loaded that I'm hovering over
here that's a message that the browser
sends up when it has enough
content to start to start building the
dom and then the next one is your usual
loaded event which I'm you're probably
used to seeing over the next little
while we're going to try to augment this
panel to include more of these types of
events so you can see what's happening
on the webpage reflows have been
something that have been asked for and
there's a new event in in Firefox now
that actually notifies the user when
reflows are occurring sorry paints are
occurring we're hoping we can do the
same for reflows and the HTML and CSS
panels haven't really changed because
they're perfect so I'm going to do a bit
of a demo and before I do that I just
wanted to make a quick note about using
profiles how many of you here or out in
the world use a separate profile for
testing their web pages in Firefox okay
how many people were aware that you
could use separate profiles for Firefox
good that's pretty good yeah I'm not
going to say you're you're gonna need to
do this all the time I myself use
Firebug with a bunch of other extensions
installed often just in daily use and I
don't have any problems once in a while
you run into some funny little
interactions with other extensions that
you might have installed it's just the
nature of the beast I so for heavy duty
debugging you might and if you start to
see things get a little weird I would
recommend visiting this page and setting
up a debugging profile specifically for
doing this sort of work so okay hola
flip out of here
set up so
oh you mean the screen hasn't been
broadcast this whole time well that was
probably a lot less interesting can move
the pad you think that's so look we've
already got an error
I don't know which wireless network I'm
on I'm on Google guest sir see there we
go so as this is loading
there we go
so is this stuff is coming through you
can see all of these individual gets
showing up in the network panel there's
our load event hmm didn't get dumb
content loaded that's different Oh
couple 405's so the interesting stuff
here well there's all kinds of
interesting stuff but and see these
green lines here connecting sometimes
those will be waiting waiting for
response depending upon the quality of
your network connection I enjoy looking
at these things over slow connections
because it's a kind of interesting to
see where all this stuff is coming from
okay but I want to show the break on
next feature so I'm going to click on
this hopefully that'll work markets oh
here's a google ad and there we go so I
just moused over my teeth aren't yellow
and it popped up into this I presume
this is google analytics and it shows
you where it's coming from on the screen
people see them do I need to step off
this thing to zoom out I hope so because
this is really cool so this thing we can
do whatever I just stepped over it and
we I think return to null
I got a beach ball hmm ok so that's
excellent so the other thing that I
wanted to mention was this open with
text editor thing I've configured mine
to use textmate because I like it this
looks like bookmarklet style JavaScript
a bunch of stuff I'll try try a
different site
oh very good and I get to login sure
there we go so one of the cool things
with this is I've got this
it's not as cool if it doesn't get all
of the files so I'm still using an alpha
version of this we should be shipping
beta 1 next week and that will hopefully
have a couple of these final things here
we go so if you've got some minified j s
like this it's generally pretty
difficult to see what it is and opening
it up in an external editor can
sometimes help that if you're trying to
see what's happening you still don't get
any variable names but for actually
inspecting what's going on you can get
maybe a better sense of what's happening
there another thing is this profile
button if you want to see what's
happening when you're typing that's
update and now you can see all of these
functions that have been called while I
was running that bit of JavaScript and
you can hopefully click in these things
so we know that it's an init function if
you're lucky you might be able to find
the area in your JavaScript code it
corresponds with that particular in it
could be this one
I'm not saying it's perfect but it can
help you I think find your way around
some some scary JavaScript one of the
other things that I find is kind of
useful for just running for doing a
little bit of web experimentation is
often times you'll see stuff that you
don't really want on a web page it's
more probably more useful in CNN when
you've got all these banners and stuff
flying around an alternative to add
block is to just remove stuff or you can
delete a node delete an element
so that's that and it's for the
activation model I can press this button
now and it will drop Firebug back down
into the status menu and you'll see that
I've got a minimized page here in this
this hover help and I'll tell you what's
running you bring a buck bring it back
up the same way you usually would now
the close button will actually disable
Firebug if it's gone off the screen it's
not doing anything you won't get error
messages on the console so that's just
something to note and hopefully the the
open and separate window will still work
if you want to you know monitor network
traffic on a web page for an ongoing
period so that's pretty much my short
demo of new features does anybody have
any questions about any of that or yes
the flashlight that's our new inspect
button when we when Curtis rearranged
the tab strip in the toolbar and
everybody see that this is a flashlight
is it temporary graphic we were we're
hoping to replace it with something else
but that's the inspect button so it's
the familiar way to navigate through the
HTML I would also I would also recommend
just as another point visiting the
documentation on get Firebug com we'll
be updating that for 1.4 and it has some
excellent keyboard and mouse shortcuts
over here which are really handy f12 to
open command shift C to use inspect that
is probably a quicker way than using the
inspect button and it's something that I
forget all the time but it's really
handy so definitely when you're playing
with the new version of Firebug look
around in this menu and see
see some of these these sites these
links anything else ok so I wanted to
next talk a little bit about extensions
that are available for Firebug you can
see extensions the current list of
extensions on they get Firebug com
website under extensions it hasn't
really been updated in awhile there's
there are some new additions and we'll
be adding to those in the next little
while one contributor KP Decker he's
built something called fired if which we
think is going to be really valuable if
you've ever been editing CSS or changed
values in a Dom object and you were
wondering what they were before this
captures all of that and it happens
either within Firebug or within your
application on the web itself so it will
keep track of changes that happen and
then report them back in a panel it's
still a little crude but he's active
actively developing it and we can think
of a few features that would be really
handy to implement being able to like
take snapshots of CSS or dom replaying
the state of a web page all kinds of
cool stuff so we'll be we'll be
highlighting that on this page in a
little while another one is fire cookie
it lets you track cookies that are being
asked for bye-bye website so you can see
what what we're feeding back to them
what data is being stored fire PHP is
another big one it's excellent an
excellent extension for doing PHP
development and then there's a couple
others like live coder and why slow
which recently had an update so all of
you here are probably JavaScript
developers and that's a safe bet
if there's ever something that Firebug
does not do that you would like to do I
would highly recommend checking out
extension development for Firebug you
might be surprised that it's fairly easy
to cook something up that can do exactly
what you're looking for and the Firebug
working group discussion group on Google
Groups contains links to documentation
on how to do that software is hard i
believe is the name of jana de barcos
blog and he's written up some
comprehensive tutorials on how to start
writing extensions and it's good stuff
so that's pretty much all I had it's a
little short but I can talk a little bit
I think about some open source stuff
related to the Firebug project I think
it's safe to say that we the reason
we're doing this is because we want to
make web development better period and I
think Firebug goes a long way to doing
that so I guess yeah do I have any
insights I don't know I think
consistency is important having people
that can reliably be there to sort of
steward the project through through its
various phases planning obviously is
helpful yeah open source is funny and
that it often demands people do things
there's always going to be unpleasant
tasks in an open source or any
development project for that matter you
know infrastructure that needs to get
built you need to run unit tests you
need to test things and I think having
willingness to do all of those little
things as they come up and do doing them
hopefully in a timely fashion is is good
does anybody have any questions about
Steve sure I can do that so we realized
that we had a need for to test Firebug
the software and and doing that in a way
that didn't necessarily involve human
interaction so one of the things that I
had done it Mozilla initially was set up
the unit testing infrastructure for
Firefox and that has turned out to be
immensely useful for the Firefox project
we wanted to do the same thing for
Firebug so John Resig went off and came
back with something called fire unit
which is an extension to fire bug which
allows you to write small test cases
that interact with Firebug itself and
then can report the results back we've
since gone through I think two sets of
changes to two morphs of fire unit we're
now using something called FB tests
within the fire bug project because fire
unit was a little deficient in some ways
for some of the things that we needed
still useful for other things and I
think John is actually taking a fire
fire unit to a place that will allow web
developers to test their own websites
and you may start to see some
integration with tests warm over the
next little while which is another one
of his projects so the end the end goal
for us and FB test or fire unit is going
to be to have it automated and reporting
to our various bits of infrastructure at
Mozilla so developers can see when they
break things immediately
future roadmap for Firebug yeah so we're
looking at the next two versions I think
version 1.5 is going to focus heavily on
extensions we want to to sort of clean
up what's in there already make
extension development better for people
clean up some of the events I mean
because it's a nice synchronous system
it's all event-driven and that hasn't
really been I guess cohesively looked at
since the beginning so we want to clean
that up and make it better for extension
developers in 1.5 which will be our big
focus 1.6 we want to change the
underlying JavaScript debugging
mechanism in Firefox to support some new
features what those new features might
look like is hard to say right now
possibly remote debugging it it will be
the first major overhaul of that
particular service since the Firebug or
Mozilla sweet developed a JavaScript
debugging environment so we're anxious
to see what that's going to look like
yes
javascript debugging has changed a fair
bit over the past couple of years I mean
it's rapidly evolving we're starting to
see more and more minified javascript
the length of javascript files changed a
lot over just the past three or four
years we've had to modify Firebug John
Barton has had to modify Firebug so
you'd be able to support tens of
thousands of lines of code in the script
editor which is something that just
killed it before we're also seeing lots
more evals eval JavaScript and Steve as
a proponent of using xhr to eval large
chunks of JavaScript without blocking
stuff can tell you it's it's important
to be able to deal with that stuff an
eval d code looks a little funny when it
comes into the browser you'll see these
in the script drop down you'll see these
eval and then they'll be like a long
string after it show up in the menu not
always clear where these things are
coming from so I think having better
insight into where those bits of code
are coming from and dealing with them in
a better way I think is going to be
important increasingly in the next while
that answer anybody anybody had anything
else yeah
yes it is it's sort of a precursor to
that work we're just looking to see
what's in there right now to find all of
the extension points and to document
them better and hopefully from that
we're going to be able to clean those up
name them a little more consistently and
and ultimately make it easier for
extension developers to do to do what
they want to do I should also that's
actually a good lead into some of the
stuff we'd like to do with with
extensions we'd like to bundle to start
releasing bundles and extensions like we
could have a performance bundle which
might include things like why slow or
fire cookie and in various things that
could be performance related to help you
analyze what's going through we haven't
figured out how we're going to do that
just yet there's a couple of couple of
potentials but um yeah anything else any
other question
can you talk about chrome bug can I talk
about Firebug chrome chrome bug oh yeah
so chrome bug is kind of funny it's it's
John Barton's sort of personal project
to be able to debug Firebug development
and it was started as such I don't think
he ever really intended it to be product
per se but it's fantastically useful
when it's working properly and he's had
a bit of a struggle maintaining
compatibility with with Firefox changes
over the past release cycle which is
sort of hindered chrome bug development
but I believe he's he's in the process
of cleaning it up and making it work
better so we'll be able to use that so
for anybody that does any actual
extension development on Firefox are
there any extension developers here yeah
cool it's an invaluable tool for for
being able to debug crip scripts in
chrome user space is it's pretty unique
and we'd certainly like to improve upon
it so I don't know where that's going to
go I'd like to I'd like to see us put
some resources on it and actually try to
make it into a product I zabal extension
yeah any other questions yep this
besides chrome bug I'm sorry this chrome
bug is there any other way to debug
extensions that's yeah looks terribly
there's lots of little tricks you can do
and a Firebug itself can can be kind of
useful you saw that this console option
to show chrome errors show chrome
messages so if you if you use if you hit
errors one loading chrome and your
extension is a chrome chrome URL you'll
see those things show up you can do
other little tricks like similar to
printf style debugging but there's
there's really no
tool that exists right now to really
help and that's it's a deficiency for
sure sorry you had a question the topic
has been brought up sorry the question
was pertaining to improving or changing
the way firefox deals with javascript
debugging and were we planning on
working with other browser vendors to
standardize or unify that that sort of
model so and the answer I think is it's
been discussed it's been raised and we
don't really have a plan I don't really
have a plan with in Firebug it's
possible that some other people within
the organization have looked at it but
if it's if it's something that is it
would be useful I think that it's
certainly something that we should
consider yeah
sure yeah so Steve Steve asked he first
wanted to point out Firebug light which
some of you may have heard of it can run
as a bookmarklet should really fix this
up there this so we can run this and we
get something that looks a lot like
firebug rid in a browser window the
follow-up question was what do people
use to debug web pages in ie6 and ie7
and I am asking you people what do
people use sorry visual studio yeah
sorry developer toolbar okay HTTP watch
yeah so we have this this tool here
Firebug light which works in IE various
flavors and it as you can see it's got
an inspect button you can click on any
area and it'll highlight it in the HTML
you've got a computed style vo over on
this side CSS that's a so yeah it's it's
a lot like firebug so if you're looking
for an alternative tool by i would
recommend checking that out that we've
actually had some renewed interest in
development on it Mike Radcliffe has
done a lot of work we've seen some other
community effort just sort of
materialized and and a zarko salut who
has been maintaining this I think for
the past year and a half two years maybe
has done some fantastic work so
this is awesome debugging Firebug light
and fire bug that's kind of kind of cool
so anybody have anything else thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
