this morning to introduce the speaker
for this talk online privacy industry
self-regulation in practice I met Alicia
while we were both undergraduate
students at Carnegie Mellon University
we quickly became friends she spent a
decade working in Silicon Valley before
deciding to go back to CMU to your
masters in public policy she's currently
a PhD candidate in engineering and
public policy at Carnegie Mellon
University we're finding seven featured
in media outlets such as the Washington
Post ARS technica and free Press's media
minute and have contributed to testimony
before the Federal Trade Commission
please join me in welcoming elite
McDonald thank you kevin kevin has been
very patient and tireless in making this
happen today thank you so much for the
opportunity to come and speak to Google
and thank you for all being here today
this Kevin said my name is Alicia
McDonald I'm advised by Laurie faith
cranor at Carnegie Mellon and i'll be
talking about some research on online
privacy today so just as an overview for
today's talk will be first going through
a little bit of background on industry
self-regulation for online privacy just
so we're all talking about the same
thing and then two different areas of
research that come from the cups lab and
that is the cost of reading privacy
policies and also a study comparing
different formats for online privacy
policies and those are both available in
full on the cups website at cups CS CMU
edu or you can also find them from my
website at Alicia calm and we'll wrap
the whole thing up with a discussion of
some public policy options of where we
go from here so first by way of
background the fair information
principles originated in the United
States in the 1970s and these were in
response to all sorts of credit
databases that were being stored on
mainframes people started to get
concerned about the breadth and depth of
information being held about them in the
United States most of our laws however
are about privacy threats from the
government rather than from private
industry so these Fair Information
principles really took hold
international
and then migrated back to the United
States so at this point they've been
adopted by the Federal Trade Commission
and they have picked up five of the
eight original fair information
principles so notice choice access
security and enforcement and just as an
example of one of those access is the
principle that there should be no secret
databases and you should be able to find
information that is held about you so
you can go to any company that holds
information about you and ask them what
is the record and they will give you
that record about yourself and the
online privacy policies are part of the
concept of notice that you should have
notification of what information a
company collects how they use it and
what's going to happen with that data so
we're all fairly familiar with online
privacy practices if you look this is
just the bottom of the New York Times on
there I'm sure you very quickly spotted
the link to the privacy policy so if you
clicked on that you would get
information about what in what the New
York Times collects about you and how
they use that information that's the
idea and the motivating problem behind
all of this is called information
asymmetry this is sort of an economics
term that if you have a company aware of
what information that collect about you
but you don't know what they're
collecting then there's an asymmetry in
what's known and the classic example of
this for a market failure is called a
lemons market where if you have a car
owner knows if their car is fantastic or
it's a lemon but as a buyer if you don't
have that information about the car
you're not going to pay top dollar even
if it's a fantastic car because you just
don't know as much about it so there are
ways that you can address that from a
market perspective to give information
so that you're able to have a more
efficient market and the FTC solution on
this was that there would be industry
self-regulation rather than say
congressional action or FTC action
rather than laws that industry would
regulate itself and the way that
industry would regulate itself would be
with these online privacy policies so
privacy policy is when they started
their
optional that's still mostly the case
today there are some additional laws now
the content the appearance the structure
the whole framework for these online
policies is in the hands of the
companies that's part of the
self-regulation it's up to the companies
to determine how best to communicate the
information to their customers however
once companies post their policies those
are legally binding and the FTC can
bring a deceptive practices or a fraud
action against a company that violates
the promises they effectively make in
their privacy policy as to what they
will do and how they'll collect data so
this theory of industry self-regulation
is that website owners will voluntarily
post their privacy policies if there are
any problems with them the FTC will
bring enforcement actions and then
consumers will come along and they're
going to read the online privacy
policies for different websites and
they're going to compare them between
websites so for example if they're
purchasing something on amazon or barnes
&amp;amp; noble they'll go read the privacy
policy for amazon and read the privacy
policy for Barnes and Noble and decide
which company they were prefer doing
business with and then they'll buy only
from companies that have at least an
acceptable level of privacy protections
and so what this does is it creates an
implicit marketplace and we're back to
this industry self-regulation economics
marketplace concept and so this
marketplace will then efficiently reward
the optimal level of privacy protections
so that's the theory behind all of this
and in practice website owners have been
posting their policies sometimes with a
little bit of coercion but they are
posting them and the FTC is bringing
actions when people violent when
companies violate their practices that
they've posted in their policies
consumers are visiting new sites and
buying from them right study after study
shows that people don't actually read
the policies let alone compare them and
make buying decision based on an
implicit perfect level of privacy so
that's the background on sort of how we
got where we are today
of industry self-regulation and now I'll
talk a little bit about the first study
where we looked at the value of the time
to read online privacy policies so
there's been this concept I've okay well
we have this chain but it's falling down
because people aren't reading the
privacy policies and why might that be
and so the privacy community has
responded by looking at better ways to
build privacy policies and we'll talk
about some of those in the second half
of the talk and there's still this
economics approach so one was well
instead of having an implicit market for
privacy what if we make it explicit so
you have a bundle of information about
yourself and you offer a lease to that
information to a company for a set span
of time and loudoun was going to suggest
that we do this on a national basis that
obviously hasn't happened so why hasn't
that happened either Simpson garfinkel
suggested that perhaps there's no zone
of negotiation for privacy market which
is if the seller and the buyer have no
overlap between the prices that they'll
accept then there's no deal so for
example if you would require ten dollars
to sell your name and address but right
now the going rate is seven cents then
there's no way there's going to be a
deal there so another concept that has
been studied also alessandra okie state
looked at the concept of inter temporal
discounting and what that is to kind of
put it a little bit glibly is look shiny
right people want things now but the
harms from privacy are diffuse and their
later so people will tend to discount
things that happen later in favor of
things that happen now so all of those
are possibilities as to why people are
less likely to read these privacy
policies and maybe suggest ways we could
go about getting them to read that but I
sort of step a little bit to the side
from that stream and said we'll wait a
second rather than trying to get people
through the privacy policies let's look
at what would happen if they actually
did read them so Carnegie Mellon is
based in Pittsburgh we are mr. Rogers
neighborhood
and I'm inviting you for the next few
minutes to join me on his trolley as we
go to you know make the leave land here
we're going to have a wonderful time and
look at what would happen if people
actually did as the FTC envisioned and
they read all of these policies how much
time would it take them to do that and
what would the value of their time be
worth so to estimate the time to read
privacy policies there's a little bit of
math but it never gets harder than
multiplication we're going to be fine
we're looking at this time to read T sub
R which is the population the number of
all people who are online and we need
the average time it would take them to
read one policy and then we need the
number of policies they read how many
websites they visit so the population is
estimated as about 221 million Americans
in this analysis is limited to Americans
we're looking at just a us-centric view
so to estimate the time to read one of
the policies that's going to be the
average time to read a policy is going
to be the number of words in that policy
/ the reading rate so reading rate is
pretty simple that's 250 words per
minute on average for high school
educated people that may actually be a
little bit optimistic it turns out that
people read words on screen more slowly
than print and for variety of factors
these are difficult texts to read but
then we have to figure out how long is
the policy itself so we went and
measured the length of the 75 most
visited websites since that's where most
people will go there's the long tail on
the Internet most people visit these top
75 websites and this gets just some
estimate of the length of how long the
policies most people would read if they
were going to read policies would be so
if we look at this graph across the
bottom that's the number of words in
these popular privacy policies and the
blue bars are just a histogram the
frequency so you can see that the most
frequent with a count of 12 is in the
zone of 2500 to 3,000 words
and then the red line is a cumulative
percentage so you can see that all
hundred percent of the policies were
under 8,500 words and that about fifty
percent on that line puts you up again
around 2,500 words so okay we have a low
estimate for the number of words in a
policy as just over 2,000 a medium
estimate as about 2,500 and a high
estimate of a little bit over 3,000
divide all of those by 250 words per
minute and we have a range of times from
about 8 to 12 minutes per policy
figuring that people would take about 10
minutes per policy if they were to sit
there and read through word for word so
the third thing that we needed to
estimate to put this all together was
how many different sites Americans visit
every year and Nielsen has a nice
estimate monthly on that that if you
look at how many sites people visit they
visit a hundred and eighty-five unique
sites every month there is some overlap
between the sites they visit at work and
at home which is how Nielsen collected
this data and so there are 14 sites for
example Google people might visit at
work and at home where people are going
to be looking at them in both places now
it matters where people visit the sites
when we get to estimating the value of
their time and I'll step through that at
the end but we do have this problem of
how do we allocate that overlap of 14 so
one way to do it is to say okay well
let's do a lower bound estimate we're
going to take all of those 14 and assume
that they go into the home bucket that
every time somebody views Google they
view it from home for the first time and
they read the privacy policy from for
Google at home the other is we can take
the middle and just sort of split the
difference and say seven of them are
read at home seven of them at read at
work and then the last one for the upper
bad estimate is to assume all 14 of them
are viewed at work
so then we have a monthly estimate from
that but that doesn't get us an annual
estimate yet now naive you it'd be just
x 12 but that doesn't work people go
back to the same sites again and again
over time however we had also from
nielsen data a sense of persistence of
which sites people visit on a weekly
basis versus monthly basis and so we
will able to observe that overlap and
there's a scale factor there that ranges
from about two-thirds to three-quarters
and so we used that to estimate how many
sites people read annually and just
multiply that through to get a total
estimate from about 1300 to an upper
range of about 1500 unique sites people
visit per year so coming back to the
beginning of why we were doing all of us
we have these three variables we're
putting together the 221 million
Americans that was the easy part
estimating the time it takes to read for
a policy by measuring the length and
dividing by 0 words per minute and then
this last estimate of how many unique
sites people visit per year so
multiplying that through for just
individuals we're looking at a medium
estimate of about two hundred and forty
four hours per person per year if it and
you're yawning which is fantastic that
is exactly what people would do if they
had to read privacy policies for 244
hours per year and a lower estimate
there of about 181 an upper estimate of
about three hundred and four hours per
year to read privacy policies and if we
multiply this through by the population
of 221 million Americans we're looking
about fifty four billion hours a year
for United States Internet users but
there's a question here right who would
sit down and actually read every single
word in a privacy policy even if we're
going with the FTC's model is that
people should read policies there's no
reason to think that they would sit
there and read every single word what if
instead we had them skim the policies
and look for specific information that's
responsive to the concerns that people
have that they would try to use privacy
policies to answer that might be a more
realistic approach
so this is still a little bit of never
never land here because you know people
don't skim privacy policies on a regular
basis but perhaps a little bit more
realism than reading every word so to
estimate the time to skim two of the
three variables stay the same the
population of internet users doesn't
change and the number of unique sites
they visit every year doesn't change we
just need to know how long it would take
to skim a policy so for this we
performed an online study of 221 peep
about 212 people and we asked
participants to find answers to
questions about the practices that
companies have and these were based on a
prior study of what their concerns what
people's concerns are reading privacy
policies and we asked them multiple
choice questions so that the act of
answering the questions wouldn't take
them that long and there were some
pretty basic questions like does the
website use cookies there were also some
that were a little bit more complicated
so we looked at six different policies
that had different lengths there was a
very short policy to a very long policy
and then four of them clustered in the
middle right around that 2500 word mark
where we know is about average for for
the policies we looked at and to answer
those questions we had medium median
times ranging from 18 to 26 minutes
substantially larger than the earlier
estimate of about 10 minutes so there's
a problem with this which is that you
can manipulate the length of time by how
many questions you ask so that was a
little bit uncomfortable so we took a
different approach which was to look at
the training question that we asked them
we asked them a warm-up question and
that question was what is the business
address for the company and in all of
those we had it at the end so they would
look for that information and for that
we had time estimates from from four to
eight minutes from these six different
policies this is a very conservative
estimate you can imagine that anyone who
clicks on a privacy policy link is
looking for more than just where are you
located but it at least doesn't have the
problem that we can ask more
questions and change the length of time
so for this we had a low estimate of
about three and a half minutes a medium
estimate of just over six minutes and a
high estimate of about eleven and a half
minutes for time to skim through a
privacy policy and just get the basic
information so again multiplying this
through again the only thing that we've
changed is this s that the time to skim
policies and it winds up with about 150
4 hours per year per person to skim
privacy policies for all of the sites
that they visit during the course of the
year and across the United States it's
about 34 billion hours so now that we
have some sense of how long this would
take what would the value of that time
be worth in dollar figures and there's
some economics behind that a fair amount
of literature Becker argued in 1965 that
the opportunity cost for anything is
also including the time as an implicit
cost of of goods because you could be
doing something else instead so rather
than getting my PhD I could be on a
beach in Maui right now right there has
to be some value for the time that I'm
spending on the PhD and not just that I
could be earning a salary instead of a
stipend so for economics literature we
found that time should be valued as
salary plus overhead which in the United
States is twice the rate of salary so
that's the cost of the lights and the
electricity for the computers and all
sorts of other things in your office and
for leisure time through some studies on
revealed preferences and willingness to
pay other studies have shown that people
value their leisure time at about a
quarter of their take-home pay so if we
look at the value of time by location we
have two times wages for work and a
quarter times wages for home with a
national average for just under eighteen
dollars an hour brings us to a value of
work time is about thirty-six dollars
and home a little less than five dollars
an hour
so multiplying that through again the
estimate for the amount of the money
that it would be worth for your time if
you were to read these policies
personally it's about 2,200 to skim
3,500 to read and nationally we're
looking at about just under 500 billion
to skim and 781 billion to read as the
middle estimates so that's a lot of
money and to put this all in perspective
the time itself is greater than the
amount of time people currently spend
handling spam and it's actually right on
par with the amount of time people
currently spend surfing the web so we
would ask people to spend as much time
reading privacy policies as they do web
surfing and that value estimate
personally is several times larger than
the cost for broadband access every
month and that's been seen as one
barrier to entry of getting people to
come online and the overall estimate was
right about online with some of the
early estimates for the stimulus
stimulus has gone up since then so if
companies aren't able to make privacy
policies more readable then we have a
problem and one possibility is to look
at regulation to change how disclosures
are done but if we just have regulation
of give people more information then
we're actually possibly making the
problem worse instead of better so it's
not quite as simple as just have a
regula of you must provide this
information so transparency is good but
it's not necessarily the only concern
another question is is this out of
balance a lot of people's privacy
concerns stem from advertising and the
FTC has questioned whether consumers
currently understand what information is
being aggregated about them for
advertising the value of online
advertising was estimated by the IAB to
be about 21 billion in two thousand
seven that since gone up but does it
make sense for Internet users to be
asked to give up almost 500 billion of
their collective time to protect
themselves from a 21 billion dollar
industry it seems a little bit of out of
out of whack now obviously online
advertising has more value than just the
ads right there the good soul there are
all sorts of other things that are part
of that value chain and for example in
direct mail it's been found that it's
it's an order of magnitude higher all of
the value that comes out of direct mail
advertising so that would mean you know
about 200 billion dollars of value
through the entire value chain that's
still a little bit out of whack so the
balance between the costs that are being
put on internet users versus the overall
benefits to targeted ads for industry
may be currently misaligned so that was
paper one and paper two looks at
standardized privacy policies so there
is a conflict between the legal
liability companies have and the goal of
notice and transparency the less
companies say the less they can possibly
be on the hook from the FTC for any sort
of enforcement action meanwhile from a
customer perspective privacy policies
require a college reading level and they
have technical jargon and they have
legal terms and so they're very
difficult to wade through and understand
there have been also studies of textual
ambiguity called weasel words so for
example at at Acme bank we care about
your privacy that's why we sell your
information at every possible
opportunity that's the sort of thing
that you see in privacy policies it's
very confusing to people and it's hard
to reconcile the emotional tone to the
content for people also every single
policy is different there like
snowflakes so people have to start from
scratch when they pick up a new privacy
policy and try to understand what's
going on
many many many people have documented
that there's low readership the
estimates vary from two percent to
twenty percent of the population read
privacy policies yet it's not as if
people don't care for example there was
a wonderful study Janice cited looking
to find that people actually will pay a
premium for sites that are targeted
tagged as having better privacy
practices when they go to purchase
things online and that was something
they were doing with their own credit
cards their own money in their own data
and we've also seen some backlash when
people have their expectations shattered
so the the Facebook beacon backlash is
probably a really good example of that
people do care about privacy but they
really don't want to read these online
privacy policies so can we reduce this
burden of time that people would have to
go through them yet also improve their
comprehension which is a problem and so
one possibility of how to do this is
standardized formats for privacy
policies so we could highlight the most
important information people don't have
to start all over again every time they
look at a privacy policy and it would be
a lot easier to compare between privacy
policies if people wanted to do that so
a look at three different formats a
natural language which is not
standardized at all it's what most
websites have layered and privacy finder
and I'll show you what those both look
like before getting into more detail
about them so most of us have at least
at some point seen an online privacy
policy it's a lot of text you can see
from the the scroll bar up there this
goes on for quite a while and it just
explains how the company collects
information and what they do with it for
a layered policy the idea is to have a
quick one page summary these steel boxes
with the arrows pointing to them those
are standardized every layered policy is
supposed to have a scope personal
information uses and four other headings
what appears within those categories is
up to the authors just as natural
language is completely free form up to
the authors but those boxes are fixed
and the idea is that this
only be one page you can see the scroll
bar is much shorter the other thing
that's required is all of these policies
must have a link to the full blown
privacy policy for more information and
the third one I was talking about this
is much more standardized this is the
privacy finder report and all of the
information here except this bit circled
is actually automatically generated from
an XML representation of a privacy
policy this yellow bit that's circled
that's freeform text and so that could
be you know many paragraphs it could not
be there at all but all of the other
bullet points and the ordering and the
putting the most important things first
those come for free as part of the the
format that's designed for this so to
put the two standardized formats side by
side so the big idea for layered is it's
a one screen summary and for privacy
finder it's a summary from p 3 p which
is an xml representation of privacy
policies and it's a bullet point and it
puts the the most important information
up at the top the parts that are
standardized differ in layered it's just
the headings and the link to the policy
that are standardized and a privacy
finder the text itself is generated from
from the p 3 p behind it so the inverse
for the flexibility where the authors
can change what they're right and then
adoption has been different two-layered
was really picked up in the EU there's
article 29 guidance and several of the
fortune 500 companies in the united
states have picked it up as well and it
was developed at hutton and williams
which is a US law firm privacy finder is
available for any company that has
implemented p3p through the privacy
finder search engine and it was
developed first at AT&amp;amp;T and development
now proceeds at cups at Carnegie Mellon
so for the research behind this we
looked at a few things first we wanted
to see do these standardized formats
that people have been very excited
out actually work are they an
improvement and the three areas we
looked at to test whether their
improvement were people's accuracy
answering questions the time it takes
them to answer questions we want that to
be low and psychological acceptability
and we'll get to that at the very end
but the basic idea here is that people
won't use what they hate most software
engineers in the room are familiar with
that as a concept right so the other
question we looked at was how much
variance is there in online privacy
policies between ecommerce policies
privacy researchers tend to talk about
online policies as a block does that
make sense and so we looked at six
different policies and deliberately set
them to be pretty readable two pretty
dreadful so on the pretty readable side
we have text here that has bullet points
it has headings it's fairly clear on the
worst side it's one big block it's
really difficult to even know where to
start like you're I just sort of skips
over it in terms of the text itself we
do not rent or sell our email lists okay
I know what that means for the worst
policy moreover the acne family of
companies will not share your email
address with third parties for
promotional purposes except when you
consent to such sharing in the course of
your participation in a sponsored
activity as described below just once I
would love to say that one breath but
even reading that I still have no idea
what's the sponsored activity that's
capitalized that has to mean something
as described below okay now I have to
scroll down and what's a promotional
purpose so it just leaves me with a lot
of questions still you can also see that
that in the first line there it says CA
for below this particular policy sends
people up and down the policy several
times to figure out what's going on so
we can have sort of this sense on our
own as researchers having read a bunch
of policies of which ones are better or
worse but we can also add some metrics
to that
and we looked at these six policies the
worst one on top a and the best one at
the bottom f and if we just print out
the policies the the worst one was 13
pages long the best one was only three
pages long there's also a standard
metric of reading ease and this applies
across a wide variety of texts and the
idea here is that the greater the
reading is score the easier it is to
read something what we found was that
within this range they all come up with
what's known as difficult now they span
from the very bottom of difficult a
score of about 32 that's right about on
par with Harvard Law Review it's just
not the sort of thing that you would
generally read for fun and then the one
that's the best of the six that we
looked at and that one is closer to Time
magazine not quite that easy to read but
at least closer the other thing we
looked at is the percentage of passive
voice sentences so passive voice
bringing you back to seventh grade
that's where instead of saying I did x.x
it happened right we've heard
politicians use this mistakes were made
not I made mistakes so passive voice was
one indication that we could look at
that maybe people weren't being as
transparent in their policies it's not a
guarantee there's some people who just
do this as a stylistic choice but it was
also interesting to see and because that
policy had so many see section a4 we
also looked at the number of cross
references and you can see that the the
one that we found to be the worst policy
really has a lot of cross references and
by the time we get to the better
policies they're very few so the last
two things to note are the word count so
privacy finder had a very standardized
format but the amount of text people are
providing in addition to that
standardized format varies so you can
see the low here for policy d with 554
words that's a policy where the authors
did not
choose to add any words at all and then
four times that much for policy see with
two thousand words so there's some
variety in there as well for the natural
language policies the word counts map
fairly closely to the page counts
they're not one-to-one but they're close
as you'd expect so the way we went about
studying this was we used a
between-subjects design and that just
means that every person who participated
in this study saw exactly one policy
they didn't see multiple policies and
then we asked them stories of questions
about that one policy and we tested the
questions beforehand and pilot tested
all of this and this study was my my
winter of 2008 we recruited participants
from blogs and craigslist and it was for
a gift certificate drawing and we had 15
conditions we had the six different
policies and the three different formats
which multiplies through to 18 three of
the policies did not have layered
formats so we weren't testing the
formats they didn't have and we had
about 750 people with about 50 people in
each condition so just to talk a little
bit about the sample we had people who
were younger better educated and more
confident with computers than Internet
users as a whole so you can sort of
think of this as another optimistic view
it probably doesn't get a lot better
than this we also had to remove some
outliers so because we were entering
people in a drawing we had people who
weren't interested in answering the
questions they were just clicking
through to put their name in the drawing
so we admitted people who were obviously
too fast and we also had people who were
interrupted they might take a day and a
half to answer a question something had
come up in real life they didn't get
back to it so we kept their answers but
we emitted their times for the questions
we started with that training question
that I'd mentioned before of looking at
a company's address the reason for that
was we found in lab studies that
sometimes people read through the entire
policy and sometimes people don't we
wanted to normalize for that before we
got to the
questions and then we asked for
questions we asked if the website uses
cookies if there's a way to opt out of
email marketing and if the company will
share your email address with another
company and then we also asked if the
company is able to use your phone number
for telemarketing we also measure the
response times people had to those four
different questions so for the court
first question does the company use
cookies this had a very high accuracy 91
% overall of people who are able to
answer this question correctly and all
policies in all formats mentioned
cookies explicitly so that made it a
much easier question for people to
answer and in fact in most cases they
didn't even need to know what cookies
were they could still figure out the
answer was yes even if you know you
change the word cookies to mumble frog
right they didn't need to understand I
just could still answer yes however the
layered policies fared worse with a
seventy-eight percent accuracy overall
now looking at this graph across the
bottom we have the six different
policies a through f and then up down
the left side we have the percentage
answer correctly and for these bars in
blue we have natural language that's the
unformatted text in pink we have privacy
finder which was very structured and in
red layered where the sections are
structured and there's a link to go back
to more information so we found for
layered that it was worse and part of
that was these blocks with the the
standardized formats in layered there's
no standardized cookies header but in a
lot of the text policies there was there
would be something that specifically
said cookies that people could skim
through find cookies find the answer and
they'd be good to go but in the layered
policy for f it was actually listed
under personal information which isn't
where a lot of people would look for
information for cookies and indie it
says you may also turn off cookies in
your browser so you have to figure out
from that that that means cookies are
being set and every time people had to
make some sort of inference
see that again and again through this
the accuracy scores drop so the times
for this we're also really good these
were the shortest times for anything we
saw with two point three minutes to
answer this question on cookies overall
and there were no statistically
significant differences between the mean
values and companies right so yes the
the the different times were different
but it could have just been chance but
format we did find statistically
significant differences and privacy
finder and layered were both a little
bit faster than the natural language
however the layered had more incorrect
answers so that's not necessarily a good
thing to be fast but wrong so the second
question was about finding a link to a
web form to remove yourself from an
email marketing list we deliberately
didn't say opt out to avoid having
jargon in the question there is a huge
range on accuracy here natural language
goes from ninety three percent to thirty
three percent and we were giving people
three options so thirty three percent is
equal to random chance that's a really
bad score how did that happen well it
required finding a single link buried in
13 pages it's kind of like an Easter egg
hunt so it was very difficult for people
to find that link privacy finder we
would expect a lot less variance but
there's actually still a fair amount
here from 91 % to 51-percent what's
really intriguing though is that in
privacy finder we had two policies with
the exact same policies here right they
the same practices and yet we had a big
difference in accuracy and the
difference was not from the privacy
finder format it was from the freeform
text the policy authors added and as if
that weren't interesting enough that
freeform text was then copied and pasted
into the layered policy and there's a
difference in accuracy there too from 90
to 91 up in the layered policy and it's
likely that part of the reason for that
was that layered was just shorter so it
was easier to find the information for
people as an information so
task and finally the range for layered
policies was all over the map from 92%
accuracy to eighteen percent accuracy
and if you look at the accuracy for be
in particular which was dreadful it
required people clicking a link to find
out what the link did it was not well
labeled you had no idea what page you
would go to when you collected it wasn't
quite click here but it was close to
that so people had a very difficult time
knowing what was going to happen and
they didn't click the link to find out
so we look at the times for this and
what we would have expected would be
sort of a very ordered curve right we
would expect that the longest policies
would have the longer times for things
again is this concept of an information
search but that's not what we found it
sort of Wiggles all over the place and
instead what the main factor was was
that when there was no link to find
people took longer to answer they
probably got to the bottom didn't find
it and said oh well I should go back
again and look but if they find it
they're done they can you know click
their answer and move on so the
underlying policy had more effect than
the length of the policy in this case
and we find that layered in privacy
finder again are faster for people to
answer the questions the natural
language and accuracy is all over the
map for these so the third question of
for was to ask if the company can share
your email address with another company
that might put you on an email marketing
list so basically will you get spam and
the overall accuracy rate here dropped
at sixty percent this again is one of
those times where things required
inferences so as just an example for the
natural language policy for B it says we
may provide your contact information and
other personal data to trusted third
parties to provide information on
products and services that may be of
interest to you now if you're reading
that you understand that okay contact
information can include email address
and information on products and services
that may
you have interest you yep that's going
to be some sort of marketing and trusted
third parties ok that's a company other
than this one but it takes putting
things together a little bit more
carefully and so people had a harder
time answering questions like that and
we would have expected that the more
readable policies would have higher
accuracy scores but again we don't have
a nice clear pattern here the data are
all over the map and there were no
significance between the formats no
statistical significance so yes their
differences but could just as easily be
random chance for the times for this
there were no significant differences
for company or for format we did see
that over all the times to answer this
question were much longer at just over
five minutes so this was a more
difficult question for people to answer
and the fourth and final question was
can this company use your phone number
for telemarketing so this question was
really difficult for people and sort of
like a jigsaw puzzle one of the policy
states the information you provide to
acne on certain acne websites may also
be used by acme and selected third
parties for marketing purposes plus then
there's another section elsewhere in the
policy that talks about phone numbers so
you have to put the information together
from two different places to draw the
inference that telemarketing is allowed
and that's a really difficult task for
people to do the accuracy for layered
was down at twenty-eight percent
remember random chance is thirty-three
percent part of the problem is that the
layered policies don't mention
telemarketing on the first page and what
we found in lab studies is that people
don't click the link to go to the full
policy so they see oh well the
information isn't here and then they
guess as to what the status is and they
have their impressions of whether the
company is going to tell a market to
them or not and that's what the answer
based upon rather than based upon the
text for privacy format privacy finder
that was the only format that actually
requires some notice
about telemarketing because that's part
of the p3p spec the xml spec that the
privacy finder format is based upon so
further there is a statement yes or no
for telemarketing and privacy finder in
the pink did much better for accuracy
than the others 61 percent overall
versus natural language at thirty-nine
percent and some of this again has to do
with this jigsaw kind of approach that
the natural language policies took so
for the timing there were no significant
differences for companies only for
formats and the layered and privacy
finder were both faster than natural
language but again layered the accuracy
was dreadful so for this one privacy
finder did better than the other two
formats so I said I'd come back to this
concept of psychological acceptability
and we asked eight different questions
on a 7-point likert scale so you know do
you strongly agree mildly agree strongly
disagree with statements about how much
they enjoy the process of reading
privacy policies and at a high level
that the results are in the paper it
didn't matter which format it didn't
matter which company people don't like
reading privacy policies a lot the
difference between these policies in
many cases weren't significant but when
there were significant results they
tended to have small effect sizes so
that means you might have a
statistically significant result between
2.1 and 2.2 but that point one really
isn't something you're going to write to
New York Times about as a result it's
just not a very important result so
people did like the layered butter and
they did trust the privacy finder format
a little bit more but in general when
they didn't have these policies side by
side to compare remember they only saw
one policy the results were amazingly
similar between these so to discuss this
second paper all of the formats we found
to be unsatisfactory
there was low comprehension especially
for synthesis questions and people
disliked reading them there was better
readability the better readability for
natural language the policies that we
thought were the best didn't actually
improve comprehension in some cases at
all and in some cases when they did it
was barely we found a much larger
variation between the standardized
formats turns out that even when you
have the same practices you can get
different results because there are
these free form text blocks and the
authors have a lot of leeway in what
they present and how they present it
even with very standardized formats the
current standardized formats are not all
that different from natural language
privacy finder was better for complexity
especially with the topic that was
included in p3p so if you could imagine
being able to cover every topic anybody
ever cares about that's a great approach
but that's a difficult thing to do and
Laird was faster people were able to go
through it more quickly but because
there's the linked for more information
that actually hid information and people
wound up not understanding the content
of the policy it actually did harm so
the policy implications here are before
unveiling the next best format test at
first we do not suggest regulation
requiring standardized formats they
don't offer that much benefit and in
some cases can be worse but
standardization does remain a promising
idea we saw places where the
standardization really did help people
and the more complicated it got the more
standardization helped so perhaps
different standardized policies would be
better than the ones tested and in fact
there's one that's being looked at right
now in the cups lab which is a nutrition
label approach and this is under testing
right now so okay we've talked about
this sort of situation where nobody
reads privacy policies and if they do
they can't figure out what they say
anyway now what do we do and there's
sort of a few different policy choices
that are immediately obvious one is we
could do nothing at all we could keep
self-regulation but modif
yet somehow we could move away from
self-regulation or we could have all of
these approaches attempt to happen at
once so to just kind of go through
whatever your beliefs are I will
probably say something you don't like in
the next two minutes so for doing
nothing proponents on that say well we
need more time for industry
self-regulation to work in particular
there's been a new approach for
behavioral advertising that's come out
of the niii and some other groups and
that hasn't even rolled out yet so we
need to see how well that works before
we do anything and other people stay
well there's no need for action at all
privacy is bad it separates people it
reduces community that's one view that
I've heard the status quo is fine nobody
has a problem with it just because they
don't read the policies fine you know
this FTC vision didn't happen but so
what another approach the Scott McNealy
view privacy is dead get over it why
would we change anything there's no
problem and the last one I heard was
that all you have to do you see is just
wait for old people to die because it's
just old people you have to worry about
privacy so this is a cultural issue and
the opponents to the do-nothing view
counter that actually right now there is
harm being caused especially to people
who are vulnerable for example people
who have stalkers people who have issues
with oppressive governments there's some
real privacy harms right now being
identified especially by location could
be a real problem for some of those
populations also as mentioned before the
public does tend to get outraged even
those old people on Facebook
self-regulation isn't working as many
studies have shown another argument came
from Microsoft they believe that they're
losing potential customers on their
health fault product that people are so
concerned about privacy but they won't
read to see how more protective
Microsoft is of their medical privacy
and so this is back to that lemons
market concept at the beginning that
people don't understand that this
actually is different and so Microsoft
thinks they would have more
customers if things were better conveyed
and there's also the argument that
privacy is a basic right and so a
deserves full protection and that doing
nothing is not acceptable so a second
approach was to keep self-regulation but
change it and some proponents there say
well companies are really innovative as
soon as you threaten them with
regulation so all we have to do is keep
banging the drum that there will be
regulation and companies will figure it
out for themselves and they'll be better
at it than government would there's a
entire community on building privacy
enhancing technologies so I've heard
people talk about basically reinventing
p3p not knowing that it already exists
reinventing privacy sales not
necessarily understanding privacy seals
were a concept that you would you would
have an outside group say yes this is
good privacy or no this isn't and from
industry there are opt-out cookies so if
you don't want to be tracked from a site
you can indicate that now quite what
those do in practice is a different
story and taco is an attempt at a very
good attempt at making opt out cookies
permanent through a browser extension in
Firefox so another possibility it would
be for the FTC to publish sample
policies if we know that text can make
things better or worse for people well
let's go write some good text and make
that available to everybody in one place
and sample policies have worked very
well in other areas with similar issues
oh we could also mandate better formats
rather than content we don't seem to
have solved that one yet but maybe that
will be solved we could also redefine
success and so well policies weren't
really designed to be widely read these
are more of a legal document rather than
providing notice and transparency and so
we don't have to change it too much some
opponents to keeping self-regulation but
tweaking it slightly view that well
privacy protections shouldn't be a
burden on the user instead the users
should be less encumbered and feel less
concerned online
also people mistakenly believe that the
link for privacy policy at the bottom of
a page means that they're protected by
law there's a wonderful study about that
so user expectations are violated when
it turns out that they're not being
protected I would argue having worked in
documentation for many years and
software companies that we've actually
effectively trained users out of
clicking the privacy policy link that
they found that they have a bad
experience when they do that so even if
we improve what's behind it it's going
to be difficult for people to decide
that now they want to go click the
privacy link again better privacy
policies may in fact be a necessary
component but not sufficient to cover
this area and then there's that view
again of privacy as a right that it's
not a commodity that we shouldn't even
be looking at this from an economics
framework in the first place so the
third big idea is to just try it's
completely different approach instead of
industry self-regulation and there's
some legislation coming out of Congress
for that right now regulation possibly
from the FTC they have basically said if
industry can't get it together we will
become far more regulatory the first
rounds of this may not be terribly
strong much as some of the environmental
protection laws were not very strong but
it's possible to then go back and make
them stronger once the laws are on the
book it's a lot easier to amend them and
the right to anonymous speech is
constitutionally protected there's a now
general opposition to the concept of
industry self-regulation Enron banking
collapse it's kind of gone out of
fashion a little bit and another
argument is that we've tried everything
else already that we could do with
industry self-regulation now the
opposing view on that is that getting
the government involved is just never a
good day that government will only make
the situation worse whatever they do
that actually you run into
constitutional issues around free speech
and that passing laws to limit how
advertising works
runs right into free speech protections
there are other arguments that the FTC
does not have authority to do much more
regulation than they are right now that
will have to be hashed out in court if
the FTC steps up the another argument is
that there are quantifiable economic
benefits to advertising and to the
online ecosystem excuse me they're
quantifiable economics harms to limiting
that right and the benefits delimiting
it are uncertain somewhere somebody
might not have been stalked that's a
very difficult thing to really put your
finger on how much value that should
have another issue is that it's
extraordinarily difficult to say well
whose privacy level should we regulate
to mine yours somebody else's we'd
probably have different views as to how
much is enough privacy and how much is
too much privacy so where do we draw
that line if we're writing laws that
cover everybody and the standard claims
the internet is too young industry is
too strong so we should take a different
approach even if we do want things to be
different and the last question was
whether regulation would create a floor
which is everyone must be better than
this regulation or a ceiling that there
is now no incentive to do any better
than minimal but I think in real life
what we have is all of these approaches
coming together at once it's sort of a
great privacy scrum it's a very
political moment so we have new
regulation being proposed their industry
associations involved standards bodies
the privacy enhancing technologies
communities privacy reducing
technologies at the same time privacy
principles like the fair information
principles I talked at if we talked
about at the beginning human rights
treaties the u.s. is a signatory
claiming that privacy is a human right
and a whole bunch of social changes it
not just that old people will die off
but as we get used to using the internet
so all of these are happening all
together at once thank you very much if
you have any really quick questions I'd
be happy to take them or talk to people
offline afterward
okay thank you so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
