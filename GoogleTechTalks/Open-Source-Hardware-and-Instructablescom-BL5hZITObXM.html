you present this to a bunch of say press
folks and they get really panicky and
right nervous stories about people in
trench coats um so this this fellow I
think just turned 13 and he's hiding
behind this enormous this is this is a
screen capture actually from his video
and so you know it shoots and you see is
a little dog run by and freak out and
run away but this is these these things
are big so this is this is a one of our
top users again McCain and this is his
SH Eiffel and its enormous and
cumbersome but cool in the sense when
you're thinking of it as open source
hardware he's gone through and says you
know I had the barrel style from this
person's this person's previously done
weapon I have the magazine style from
this one the trigger system from this
one the pump system so he's integrating
parts this is this is the classic way to
go about doing open source right and and
so he's referring back referencing crust
and then things are publicly available
so here we have we even have release
versions and so you've got the version
history oh and and in fact this is the
fellow who made the shy fool who said
they've been they've been sort of
self-regulating saying we don't want any
more of these boring boring guns we want
really cool innovative stuff so he
actually put up how to really make an
awesome connects based weapons
instructable steps seven steps lots of
pictures how to how to engage with the
community and get some feedback they've
got a whole set of forum topics on
excuse me yeah a whole set of forum
topics about it too so this is a ball
machine that one of our users put up
this this is the fellow that you saw
hiding behind the enormous wheel yeah so
this is this is one of his other
projects I put a link in the forums two
there's a ball computer made out of
connects that some students had put up
at I forget which college
long but he saw that and said oh that's
so cool I can build a simple one of
those and this was up the next day oh oh
yes also connects transformers I thought
this was the coolest thing ever these
are not from kits these actually
transform and he went through and and
built these from scratch so here you
have your your your transformer connects
version and regular version but they
actually do transform this is insane I
was really impressed um so we're trying
to get it apparently it's fairly hard to
document these and so we're trying to
get this guy glitched to put them up on
the site proper right now he's just got
a lot of pictures up but they look
awesome um let's see right so he's got
he's he's doing a video to test the
difference between two different
stop-motion techniques so in terms of
documentation this is getting kind of
kind of advanced um and here's a here's
a discussion about whether it's okay to
put up connects versus Legos so there's
there's a discussion about which toolset
you use and here's another transformer
just because it's awesome oh and here's
one of our users selling a knex gun on
ebay but just just in terms of taking
taking something sharing it going
through modification product that i took
this shortly after he had put it up I
haven't actually it's still up probably
if you'd like to bid probably a good
deal for the connects involved but he's
actually trying to sell a product I
think that's so cool um so again just
going through the way that these kids
are using the site it's really hard to
do this um people are trying to do
sustainable open source hardware for for
products for adults and it fails and
these guys have been going for something
like a good solid year now and we keep
thinking they've maxed it out and then
they come up with something new like
connects transformers
and they're really just blowing my mind
so at any rate there doing the
recognition part on their own we're also
enabling them to put their stuff up on
the web so that they can they can get a
large enough community to feedback
because connects has some websites where
you can post a final picture but I guess
that doesn't really feed back into the
desire to really show everybody how you
did it and they don't have forums and
whatnot like you do on our site so
motivation recognition and then people
like me pain who put up the instructable
for how do you interact with our
community are doing a lot of the
community maintenance you have these
awesome threads 800 800 messages long
where they discussed their their gun
designs so again suitable tools and
we're providing some of those but mostly
this is these kids just doing it on
their own this is what they'd be doing
anyway in extremely isolated situations
around the world but now they finally
have somebody to talk to about how
insanely cool this hobby is that they
hide their basement with which I can
completely get behind um so that's all
I've got in terms of prepared prepared
stuff um I've also brought a two of our
as I said two of our our major users who
have been interning with us and figured
that we could ask them a couple
questions about how they use this site
in general and also um you know how how
that fits into their their greater web
usage because you guys are probably
interested in that since you're all
building building that type of tool and
I'm happy to answer I do community
management basically I do anything it's
not coding all right so I do a lot of
community management on the site and I'm
also happy to answer any questions about
that or how we run contests or whatever
so before we go on anybody have any
questions yes
how long has been around ok so i guess i
should have given that bit of background
at the beginning so instructables is a
project that came out of squid labs
squid labs was founded by a collection
my friends from MIT I I had a real job
at this point um but a collection my
friends from MIT graduated and said we
don't want to stay in academia let's go
do something fun once they got their
PhDs so they all came came to San
Francisco and found in squid labs which
was a designing consulting firm took in
the consulting work to essentially fund
the internal projects and then when the
projects got legs they spun them out so
instructables was something that was
started for internal documentation
purposes things like everyone at squid
labs was a kite surfer and so they put
up their their designs for homemade kite
surfing kites homemade plywood kite
surfing boards and we're putting them up
on what was the name of that 10 prestes
org which doesn't really exist anymore
because now we have instructables which
because we were getting all sorts of
feedback saying can you put up your CAD
files well yeah but then can we have a
discussion about it yeah but then I have
to do all this work on my personal
website so we decided that there is
clearly clearly a useful purpose served
here put this up and then it launched
within squid from within squid labs with
maybe about 30 projects based on things
like LEDs and bicycles and kites in
august of two thousand five and then
spun out into its own company about six
or nine months later so we've been we've
been a proper company for about a year
yes so as a long time user of
construction
you spend a lot of your design energy
try and figure out how to make it strong
enough you can try to feel the trip she
out of Lego however you can do it out of
82 in structural aluminum which is which
is the equivalent toy for adults values
are there any good construction toys
that are really strong that you could
really build some robust envisions I'm
going to say that they're probably
intentionally left weaker than they
could be because you can do a you can
you can do a fair amount with say
plastic parts like connects and i think
that there's an intent to rein that in a
little bit um also plastic is cheap but
i think that's where we are right now
and if you want if you want the better
toys you really have to move on to some
of the ones that are aimed at adults I'm
sorry engineering tools right oh right
PVC and structural aluminum get you a
long way anybody else what's up
anyone
yes actually um so one of my friends
lemoore freed runs Adafruit which is all
open source hardware projects she sells
kits and then you can mod her kids and I
should since the set that I showed you
was a fairly small one because it was
designed for five minutes speed talk um
but but l'amour stuff is what you're
talking about she sells kits for a
synthesizer for she's even got things
like a dig button yeah well so these are
yeah actually let's if i can if i can
successfully I don't have a mac where is
it where's the doc ah yes um so but that
that qualifies more readily as open
source hardware because it's easy to get
the kit and then you can take the kit
and you could mod the kit for many of
the other projects are available on the
site it involves things like go find
your nearest dumpster dive and you know
maybe you can get your hands on the
parts maybe you can't um but part of
that one of the things that we're trying
to do is make it easier for people to
gain access to the plans once you gain
access the plans it's a question of how
simple are the materials how simple are
the tools you need and so while some of
the projects that we've got up our
aspirational in nature because there are
some that say things like take the sheet
of aluminum and put it on your water jet
we have a water jet most people don't
have a water jet we understand how that
works but but then you also see things
like we recently ran a ran a contest
where we gave away a laser cutter and
the winning entry was how to turn a
dremel tool into a 3-axis cnc machine
and yeah I at first glance i thought
well that's kind of boring but that's
because i have access
to water jet nuh C&amp;amp;C machine and if you
have a dremel and none of these other
things then then all of a sudden that
starts looking really exciting let me
see here if I can find you
let me see if I can find you that one
so as you can see here we have multiple
3-axis cnc machines um this this one
here Stewart MacFarlane's is the one
that was that one the one Himalayas or
cutter but it is in fact a dremel
strapped in but but again that's that's
the that's the idea of trying to trying
to democratize innovation through
sharing designs for tools so and let me
see if I can pull up let's see if I can
pull up beta stuff
somebody wants to ask me more questions
I can keep talking while I roam around
through the internet all right ah right
so she's got these are all kits and she
sells her well except for the dyeing her
hair um but she's got more kits on her
own site we have here minty boost is a
battery powered USB charger that
apparently does fantastically um I
really like these these are big hit at
Burning Man
so again these are these are
programmable kits that you can then go
hack does anybody else want to see any
particular videos or any the guns
alright we can we can show you gun video
'he's oh oh sure yeah they've got
soundtracks for this oh also I've got a
collection robot stickers if anybody
wants one of those before they head off
at the end don't let me forget about
those oops and i apparently can't type
and perfect space duck okay and we'll
see
all right fine
I
oh man
five
Oh
what
so let me see if I can find you train me
into thousands but there there's some
pretty good ones on here um any any
other questions while I'm well I'm
looking this up um well we honestly
haven't paid a huge amount of tension to
our ads right now in the sense that we
kind of just set up google ads and let
them run but we get I think in the last
month we had about 17 million page views
and maybe one and a half million uniques
something in that range um and yeah the
the google ad the contextual ads are
working reasonably well we'd really like
to have the most relevant dads possible
because I'm not a big fan of ads and I
really only want to see something up
there that I find useful here we go
but right now we're we're mainly viewing
ourselves as building a fraction of a
Webster of a company working on the site
itself so the thing that I find
exceptionally cool about this is that
not only is this is this providing an
excuse for showing off the toy it means
that this kids learn video editing he's
playing with every single fade he can
get his hands on the super slo-mo but
but it's actually getting into basically
all the all the associated toys this is
what this is what little proto engineers
do right so any any other questions the
moment yes
oh well so it does a couple of things um
it means that it's a little bit of a
joke right and but it also implies that
we're taking a little bit more seriously
than pat you on the head and and you
know rubber band gun category um there's
a lot of stuff in that liable that
doesn't that's not projectile weapons
but basically anything that is
potentially dangerous goes in that
category when I the one that I put up
this morning about about preparing a
roadkill snake went in food and not
liable for example but but the basically
the idea is to OOP can't spell my own
name but basically the idea is to oh
yeah here we go food and not liable so
there we go I that one's also in that
level and obviously that doesn't convert
it confer any additional defense against
liability but but it it's a good signal
of intent for I'm going to give you a
list of safety precautions and no really
you should pay attention to them so I
say things like you should know the
cause of death and the time of death for
your road kill if you're going to eat
roadkill you know I went through and I
went through and I checked and made sure
that it had a tire tread mark on it so
even though we had seen it die we we
went and checked to make sure that there
was a tire tread mark on it to actually
is our people okay with potentially gory
pictures okay um alright so just
yeah there we go well there we go that
is a tire tread mark you can see you can
see this is what normal healthy sorry
normal dead snake not healthy dead snake
looks like but then there is a tire
tread mark about this wide so i went ok
if i didn't see that i would potentially
worry that maybe it was a snake who had
gotten into eating a poisoned brad or
something and died by the side of the
road but at that point you have a you
have a second so so usually if something
goes in the not liable category that
means feel careful there's something
there whether that means don't burn eyes
out with lasers which hopefully is is
something people really adhere to to
don't eat poisonous roadkill but we're
trying we're really trying to work on
that category and make sure people
understand it because it's it's kind of
a fuzzy thing any more questions yeah
sure
hang on we've got a got a mic stand up
stand up so this is Billy he's
tetranitrate on the site and that was a
nice picture of Billy breathing fire you
saw and there's a there's a little bit
of a focus to his projects which one's
your favorite um it might be the
fire-breathing one just because of the
great picture that I was able to get
from the video for it it's me standing
behind like a 15 foot long fireball that
I'm spitting out in my backyard in
Queens um I have the giant match which I
put up recently oh there's a nice video
with that I'll go play that it's one of
my newer favorite ones um yeah this had
a nice little run on Boing Boing I think
okay this so we run a we run a
show-and-tell down at instructables and
this is what Billy dimms was his
demonstration at the last show and tell
so if anybody wants to be on our mailing
list we do bad movie nights too we're
currently going to host a mob movie
drive-in at our place on Saturday night
so I have a mailing list for that kind
of thing if you're excited to join just
just drop me your email address okay so
you got some posing here's the people
gross gross yuck okay here's more people
there's more people so we're out on the
old naval base at the north end of
Alameda that San Francisco in the
background
I wasn't expecting it to be that big of
a flame as you can see we have
appropriate safety precautions heavy
gloves and now he's lighting your
lighting flash powder you know some
gunpowder on the in a bowl on the right
smoke powder in the middle and some more
black powder on the left
yeah yeah so it's an eight-foot-long
match oh so just in terms of sizing I
think that there you go you can see how
tall Billy is up standing on the ground
oh yeah that's that's what we do during
show-and-tell oh how about how about
Josh um I don't know well the project
that I've been working on for like the
longest amount of time is a cotton candy
machine Ivan work on that for about two
or three years first version was with a
soup can and using sterno as a heat
source that resulted in a huge flaming
plastic mess all over a driveway and lon
but um yeah it's one of my favorite ones
I did this last year it's working
although I'm gonna make another version
on X here in school but uh yeah it's
pretty awesome machine and it's not a
video on this yeah there's no video
because it kind of I broke it but um I
guess my other I mean all of them were
my favorite in chuckles I put so much
time and effort into all of them yeah
writer jaw with light that's a great one
um so I found this website pika pika
they do animations so I figured out how
to draw it's light it's just long time
lapse exposures and use a flashlight to
draw and I brought it my camera's
science olympiad and we all had a party
and started drawing stuff like people
trying to make smiley faces you know
it's a really cool way to uh to just do
really cool stuff in
and then eventually you know I started
taking pictures on the airplanes and I
started the guy from pika pika actually
came up to instruct bulls joined and
Oates me right there technician I gotta
and yeah so it's really cool when you
get people from half I think he's from
Japan we get people from across the
world telling you all right let's get
together and you know do something
that's really cool I other instructable
on the LED beating heart t-shirt a guy
from sweden i believe just recreated it
on a PCB board and gave it to his
girlfriend and she told him to tell me
that she thanks me for coming up with
the project but uh yeah yeah this guy
Evan if you scroll down there's actually
pictures I think yeah one of the things
that I think is completely awesome is
when I discover somebody's made one of
my projects that I never thought they
would they would do like i have an LED
throw erat which is a taxidermied rat
with glowing LED eyes rare earth magnets
on its sides and you know a little
switch button on its heart and someone
actually came up to me at the last Maker
Faire and said yeah I made it and I said
no you didn't you said well yeah and
actually here's the problem i had with
the fur wow you did I don't believe this
you know put up pictures so he hasn't
done that just yet so I'm not positive
but who would come up and tell me that
and also know about you know for fur
problems unless you really tried it but
I never thought someone was going to do
that one and actually the LED throw a
rat and the mouse mouse I've been
published in fhm twice I've had two fhm
photo spreads involving you know like my
hands and and mice so fhm netherlands
and germany i think for mouse taxidermy
which i think is completely weird but
cool so some and then some of the stuff
we we end up cross pollinating with Make
Magazine a lot so a lot of people from
squid labs right for it and then they
pick up stories from instructables and
vice versa so that's kind of a that's
been kind of fun let's see yes
hmm
well I don't know help me is a
degeneration I think that's actually
beneficial and we end up with an awful
lot of things like that we've got a
forum section that is literally devoted
to I'm trying to build X help you know
I'm trying I'm trying to you know I can
pull that up but we actually try and
keep a pretty close eye on things and so
when win things like discussions of the
ethical nature of mouse taxidermy
degenerate into discussions of American
foreign policy which they always do for
reasons that I don't understand so yeah
we're looking for some more interns
since these guys are going away but
first post I need help um talking about
here's a discussion of connects or Lego
favorite connects guns and then also
things like I'm on holiday talking this
this is a set of connects builders a
discussion of how do you design your
connects guns you can see who has a lot
of time to spend online at the end of
the summer right before school starts oh
yes pictures of your connects injuries
and but at any rate so so there's a lot
of discussion Joshua fact on the way up
was talking about how he uses the forums
pretty heavily you want to talk about
that a little bit so in my recent
projects I having a lot of trouble doing
all the electrical engineering so I you
know post on the forums I ask all right
so I did this why isn't it working or I
did this and it's working but just not
in the right way how do i fix this and I
get you know responses I did something
stupid I'm using the wrong potentiometer
and there's all these guys like ec
tightenin tight matt gutman kettunen see
he's a smart he's like uh I think he's
actually a high school science teacher
in the UK right so nacho mama
and um Las Vegas these are all like guys
that know what they're talking about and
they'll help you and you know they've
you know they've just like yeah the most
valuable information that you can get is
while you're building it because after
you've built it I mean it's like okay I
built this you could have done this in a
different way rebuild the entire thing
know when you are when in the process
you can just change something easily you
don't have to rebuild the entire thing
which is why I find the forums like
really really useful oh this is all so
this is just random since I saw it we
put up all of our logos for people to
play with and so our instructables robot
has gotten ooh I hadn't seen the ninja
that's awesome but sort of in the in the
spirit of open sourcing as much as we
can unfortunately we're on a proprietary
system but but we try and hand out as
much as we can but they've been making
everybody's been making a robot icons
for themselves this is kite man so at
any rate this is uh this is the sort of
thing people have been doing in our
forums
that's actually kind of hard to get so
we have we have an age breakdown because
we have to ask for age when people sign
up right and there's a big difference
between the people who for example post
all the time on the forums and the
people who view and the people who
contribute you get an awful lot of
contributions from people who are i'm
going to say college age and shortly
thereafter and then you get another
bubble from people who are sort of in
the semi retired age group aside from
aside from the the connex projects which
are largely teenage however we have a
pretty broad demographic for viewing we
started out with tech projects so we do
kind of skew male but we've been we've
got an awful lot of food projects we're
running a contest with real simple which
probably half if you don't even know who
that what that is but it's a and Etsy so
we've got a lot of craft stuff and are
getting a wider female audience but it's
really hard to estimate that sort of
thing unless you specifically start
asking because everyone presumes i'm a
teenage boy if they look at the
taxidermy i get all of these comments
about how dude is she stiff he keeps
that on his refrigerator he's never
gonna get a date so so it's it is kind
of hard to tell but we're getting we are
we are expanding from our core
competence competency which is a male
tech geeks into into all these other
spaces anything else up yes
we've got a filter system setup flag
words so we generally managed to pick it
all up it's a question of how much
that's going to scale if we start
getting I see your shirt youtube clearly
is going to have a little bit more of a
if we start getting up to that size
because because we do we go through and
and catch everything and then we'll will
filter the ones that we catch
inappropriately but we're trying to put
in a decent flagging system and automate
some of that but so far i guess the
barrier to putting up to putting up a
project keeps people from putting up
things that are too inappropriate so far
we'll see where we'll see where it goes
from there all right well one of the
other things I was gonna do is just have
these guys maybe talk about Billy you
want to start off why do you why do you
put your stuff up what what does that do
for you um well I started posting a
little over a year ago and I found the
website through a link in make from Make
Magazine and I saw these really cool
technical projects like Lady odd is um
bicycle povs and the mindy USB charger
and I'm like hey cool i can post some of
the things that i did except I didn't
know too much technical stuff all I knew
is fire at the time so um if you can
show a couple of my earlier
instructables
yeah hang on keep talking so I started
posting a lot of fire related
instructables and things that interested
me and I noticed a large influx of those
kinds of projects on the site shortly
after I began posting so I kind of feel
like I've stolen the focus from those
really cool technical projects that i
saw in the beginning to a lot of
different fire projects not always being
the best ones um but uh that's not there
yes I can see like Mike early on ones
are mostly fire centered he had to make
fuse how to build the talk how to build
the torch and do fire-breathing that's
one of my favorite ones just because of
that picture I was able to get off of it
um well we're here yeah might as well
so that's me my backyard in Queens so so
far he hasn't said anything on fire at
well that wasn't intended to be at squid
labs but I should I should pull up the
hope / q yeah that's another well that's
pretty good um yeah so uh so Billy's
kind of got a theme here yeah OOP one
more um the LED floaties were cool i
actually got that from the well I saw
the LED throw is and thought it'd be
cool if I put him in a bunch of balloons
filled up with helium unfortunately the
helium i had was really low quality so
they mostly just floated around on the
ground but actually uh I'm gonna I'm
gonna go to those so so the LED throw
ease are sort of one of the early
classic instructables that a group in
graffiti research labs in new york put
up and it's just an LED i'm at a rare
earth magnet and the battery just taped
together and then you've got light
graffiti you can throw it any throw it
any metal structure and so that's kind
of cool in the sense that it's a again a
very small kit of parts and we've seen
lots of variations we've seen people do
ones that blank ones that talk turn them
into rats yeah that one I actually
because I had a mouth taxidermy and then
someone saw that and said dude you
should totally combined it with LED
throwies and make an LED throw a mouse
one someone suggested you have to do it
oh but so there I don't even know how
many permutations we've got off of that
first basic project but again it's a
real
no barrier to engines so this is at a
Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan I was
able to contact some people from another
website and they helped me set it up and
then I posted the instructable on it
yeah that dog loved them
but so what else what else do you spend
your time on besides besides
instructable so we know you've got to
spend a lot of time there I like to see
what impact my projects made on the rest
of the intertubes um I'll check out digg
every so often see if my projects get up
there I'll just also go around looking
for other projects that are really cool
and people have documented and see if
they'd want to post them to
instructables since we have lots of
contests and things going on that's in
your official capacity though yeah
actually what's your homepage when you
when you heard up Google
you guys are taking over the world um
all right do you have have any other
questions for Billy or for Josh here um
that's a good question i used to use
YouTube mosy in my earlier videos
because they had the browser-based
uploader and then Google Video had that
so I've started using google video a bit
more um I don't know I can't really
think of anything off india business
tips for you guys off the top of my
editor here alright so youtube's pretty
awesome but it's a little too awesome
because you know how you have all those
links to all the other videos that are
also really awesome so i end up spending
about three hours every time I visit
YouTube wasting my time and not being
able to spend it on instructables so if
you could just kindly please take this
down so I don't stay on YouTube that
would be awesome well one of the one of
the things he was saying earlier is that
when he uploads the video um that
doesn't happen because you don't have
all those those links available and so
at that point he could upload and run
just just to let you know in terms of
keeping things sticky missing an
opportunity yeah this this is the hobo
Baku which is exactly what you see a
shopping cart that Billy and dumb this
here is a trebuchet of three one of our
previous interns who had to go back his
school start a little bit earlier in
Florida and this is a this is they took
it in went shopping at the albertsons
right up the street now Amida and we're
barbecuing in the parking lot
and the fire department came and had
more fun than they've ever had
apparently they offered him they offered
them food and I'm going to just show you
one more of Billy's so these yeah he
made these for for a party and I'm not
normally a late night person so um I
think I had one of the 50 milligram
caffeinated jello shots and then I think
it was wired still at 2am app because we
went out dancing afterwards like okay
let's go I'm gonna drive you home what
do you but but these these were these
are fun this is a good nerd toy to UM
any more questions either for me or
these guys because I think we're coming
to the end of our time here all right
thanks a lot I have fun
