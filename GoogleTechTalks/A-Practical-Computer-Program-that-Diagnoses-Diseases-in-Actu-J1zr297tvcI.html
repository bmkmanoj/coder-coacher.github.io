Carlos feather and too much better to
give the talk today at Google and
they're going to talk about a practical
computer program that diagnose diseases
in actual patients and before we start
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
colors and to us so callous father was
born in Vienna Austria he graduated from
the school of medicine university of
bruno's aires argentina in that country
he practices internal medicine for 30
years and at the same time taught the
specialty at a university hospital for
the past half century his obsession to
invent and improve an algorithm for
computerizing medical diagnosis that him
to review recent to reveal existing
relevant literature published papers and
secure research grants from numerous
pharmaceuticals in 1983 he immigrated to
palo alto california where he practiced
his specialty for another 19 years
before retiring in 2002 since then he
dedicated most of his time organizing
his experience and novel ideas and
describing his medical diagnostic
algorithm that promises to be a
breakthrough in the field he's the
author of two books computerized medical
diagnose a novel solution to an old
problem published in 2006 and a
practical computer programs at diagnosis
diseases in actual patients published in
2008 and this book is closer with too
much better who is our next that our
second speaker of the day Tomas father
is sung of cuddles was born and grew up
in bruno's aires argentina he obtained
with honors his bachelor bachelor degree
from the French school in the mentioned
city in 1983 he immigrated with his
parents and
sister to the United States where he
received his PhD in computer science
from Stanford University he was one of
the outstanding students of his pretty
proceed prestigious advisor Don Knuth
Tomas worked for several years as a
researcher at IBM his career cooling
includes over 120 publications personal
and with closers around the world with a
massive rd as co-author they published a
landmark paper in nineteen eighty
nineteen ninety three conference version
and 1998 journal version that created a
now a new specialty of computer science
named constraint satisfaction crossroads
of mathematics logic and computer
science which became important in the
field with congress's held worldwide to
which Tomas is always invited and
without further ado let's welcome
carlson Tomas thank you can you hear me
everybody so good morning and first of
all I want to thank anzu the adhan
buoyant garden I eval in Google for
providing us with this opportunity to
present our ideas first of all I want to
call your attention to this title
essential need for an efficient computer
diagnostic program because why is this
neat substantial well there is among us
an under-recognized killer that kills or
disables a great number of victims and
this killer is called diagnostic errors
diagnostic errors are extremely frequent
much more than you can imagine because
most doctors are unaware about
committing these mistakes and if they
become a word later
on the last thing they want to do is to
publish that so therefore we don't have
a registry for diagnostic errors and
therefore we don't have statistics of
how often their occur the good news is
that the majority of these diagnostic
errors are inconsequential because
mother nature takes care of them most
diseases let's face it Cleo
spontaneously in spite of the doctor so
but still a minority that can have this
mal consequences like long-term a life
term disability or even death and in a
world that has more than 6 billion
inhabitants this minority could
represent a very tragic number this and
diagnostic uncertainty leads doctors to
order an excessive number of futile
tests and procedures based on their
imperfect memory limited experience or
feeling of the gut instead of all on
this test based on a probabilistic
determined benefit and this is very
harmful to patients and it's also
harmful to the socio-economic system
because it's a waste of already limited
medical resources
why are this diagnostic error so
frequent well there are different
opinions in my view there is no human
brain able to remember several thousands
of non diseases that we have now and the
several thousands of symptoms science
lab results x-ray results etc etc that I
am a witch which with these diseases
manifest themselves and by the way we
use a term clinical data on singular or
clinical data or data for any as a
generic term for any of the symptom sign
or a result of some kind of procedure or
test doctors are not even a capable to
learn all the diseases that exist
nowaday perhaps in our area in the Bay
Area these errors occur less but they're
still occur very frequently because we
have excellent hospitals we have
prestigious universities in medical
schools we have easy access to
specialists but imagine what happens in
an underdeveloped area even of our
country or in developing countries where
sometimes not even a regular doctor
available let alone a specialist at the
time of the diagnosis if the doctor
doesn't remember the disease or has
never learned it this means then that
the diagnosis is missed or misdiagnosed
this problem is compounded by the
ironically called health maintenance
organization HMO managed care you know
this company's press the doctors to see
a patient in a very limited
time perhaps in 15 or 20 minutes and it
is impossible to do a good job in such a
limited time so how can we expand our
memory how can we increase our speed to
diagnose well I understand that you're
mostly computer scientists here and
engineers so you know more about
computers and I do but computers have
changed the way I shall change the world
and they can change the way medicine is
practiced to with a tremendous storage
capacity speed of processing and
portability of knowledge we are at when
we give a talk like this we're
frequently asked whether such program
diagnostic programs do not already exist
well I listed here the ones that are
best known so far and we challenge these
programs with actual real patients with
real cases and the results were quite
disappointing what happened with this
program is that they're excellent
remainders reminders of unusual
diagnosis of rare diseases but they are
unable to pinpoint exactly the disease
that is afflicting the patient therefore
they'll consider it more like
educational tools for medical students
or for young doctors that are not yet
very experienced but not actually
diagnostic programs and the authors of
these programs recognize that in the
disclaimer that appears at the beginning
when they open the program therefore
these programs are poorly accepted by
practicing medical doctors and
seldom-used actually so let's now remark
what are the advantages of our program
compared to a previous existing programs
if you provide a computer with a
clinical data or I mean symptom science
etc of the patient they will retrieve a
long list of potential diagnosis perhaps
50 60 70 diagnosis and some programs
stop there so they put dr. effect on his
own to find out which of this 60 or 70
diagnosis will be the actual one that
corresponds to the disease of the
patient our program also at the start
offers a long list because each clinic
at that that that imprisoned in the
patient evokes one or more diagnosis but
our program goes further it rules out
the non viable diagnosis until only one
or more than one that the really
afflicted patient are left in the list
so clinical data present rule in
diagnosis bring it into the so called
differential diagnosis list and clinical
data option in the patient rule out
diseases and that is a principle that we
use in our program the other problem of
existing program is that they don't have
a method to accurately determine the
probability of each diagnosis they use
base formula or they use some scoring
system but none of these systems are
accurate and so I suppose also that you
know better base formula than I do being
computer scientist but anyway it's a
conditional probability of a diagnosis
given
a clinical data based so much used in
medicine however in diagnostic
application has two flaws too important
flaws the clinical data must be
independent which is not the case
embarrassing ameritz in all the symptoms
of a single patient are interrelated
because they obey a common cause or a
common vision so they cannot be
independent I give an example suppose a
patient has a cancer in that obstructs
the biliary duct that takes the bile
from the liver into the intestine if
this duct is clocked then there is a
substance in the body called bilirubin a
give this yellow color that spills over
with a whole pile into the blood and
that produces what is called the
jaundice the yellow discoloration of the
patient that has such an abstraction and
then the excess of bilirubin is
eliminated to the urine and the urine
takes this dark brownish color like
coca-cola and as the bank and not
reaching testing because of the
obstruction the stools are very light
colored like clay so we have here for
different I mean for symptoms increased
bilirubin in the blood in the blood we
have a dark urine we are very light
stools and the patient is hotter
jaundice so Venice considers the status
in the independent and they are not they
are all closely related to the point
that are almost like synonyms or like I
redundant so if base gives a value for
one of them then the next one and the
next one the total probability reaches
an improper high value you know same
with scoring systems are given a kind of
rate to each symptom and then adds up or
that we have
same problem that we have with days so
we created a actually Tomas our son
created a minimax procedure to
accurately determine the probability of
the diagnosis of each diagnosis and this
minimax procedure based on clinical data
present and what's called a positive
predictive value of this clinical data
impression that we cannot explain in
detail today because it is a separate
talk of one hour maximizes a probability
raises a probability until reaches a
confirmation threshold where this
diagnosis is accepted as confirmed and
final and not the other hand it
minimizes at the same time the clinical
data the probability based on clinical
data absent and based on what it's
called the sensitivity or a clinical
that tattoo maps and sensitivity simply
the frequency with which each diagnosis
manifests a symptom for instance a
patient that has bronchitis we have
almost always cop and this code is very
frequent as soak offers a high
sensitivity for bronchitis so if cough
is missing from the page and when the
patient this is a powerful reason to
rule out this disease so this is more or
less in very broad terms how the minimax
procedure works the other drawback of
base is that the diagnosis must be
mutually exclusive
that means that one in diagnosis in this
long list will be the winner and all the
other diagnosis will be the losers and
that is not correct because patients
many times are afflicted by more than
one disease I give another example the
patient can have a myocardial infarction
that weakness the heart muscle so it
develops another diagnosis another
disease called congestive heart failure
which is a complication of infection and
then the the injured muscle starts to
beat irregularly so there is an
irregular heartbeat that is called an
arrhythmia and this is not able to
discriminate that the basic try to
explain all the symptoms of the patient
with only one diagnosis our minimax
procedure is perfectly OK in diagnosing
but we call concurrent diseases
cost of obtaining each clinical data is
also a very very important concept not
considered in any of the existing
programs that I had a chance to to
review and the cost in our context means
not only the expense in dollars you have
to pay the insurance company has to pay
to obtain that the the clinical data but
also the risk for the patient and the
discomfort and based on these three
elements we consider for cost categories
no cost small cost intermediate cost and
great cost and I give an example of each
no cost our clinical data obtained
simply from the history of the patient
or from the physical examination that
the doctor performs at the office we
call it no cost because it's suppose
that is not charged extra part of the
cost of the consultation small cost will
be a blood test for instance how your
cholesterol is doing and this doesn't
cost so much the discomfort is only a
prick in the vein but that's okay right
and the risk is essentially inexistent
unless you go to this crazy woman that
you have heard in years ago in important
laboratory in Palo Alto that instead of
discarding the syringes reuse them
washing them with soap water and that
created a mess because hundreds of
patient had to be checked for HIV and
hepatitis virus to see there were
infected or not but that isn't an
exception of the rule right intermedia
cost would be for instance a colonoscopy
it costs more it's not a pleasure to
have introduced in your ear tube long
like this like four feet and it's there
is a small risk in that because air
cases reported with perforation of the
in testing with the instrument so that's
a pretty nasty thing to happen and
finally great cost would be a test like
laparoscopy to look inside the abdomen
with an optic instrument to see the
organs inside and that is of course more
expensive needs general anesthesia and
has some complications also so but cost
is very important for the patient for
the insurance companies and also for the
entire socio-economic system on the
other hand costs must be contra balanced
by the benefit of the test and how do we
define the benefit of a clinical test
the more it increases the probability of
a diagnosis the better benefit because
it brings the closer or to the level of
the confirmation pressured and also how
much it reduces a probability for those
diagnoses that has to be ruled out
because they approach them to the
deletion pressure where the diagnosis is
definitely rule out now we can establish
the benefit of a test virtually before
or during the test simply by running the
minimax procedure and see how much it
would increase a probability if the test
comes present or positive in the patient
and how much it would reduce it if this
symptom is absent now knowing on 100
cost of the test and knowing on the
other hand the benefit it produces we
have the best chance to select the best
test next to investigate in the patient
we always order the less cost category
test first before escalating to a higher
test if necessary hyah contest and
inside this cost category the lowest
possible we choose the of course a
clinical data on that will most increase
or decrease
the probability of the diagnosis now
here comes another problem now the
computer looks at all the diagnosis in
the differential diagnosis list and
looks all the clinical data that has not
yet been investigated in the patient and
that is a tremendous long list that you
will see in the demonstration of a case
and I will show you so we had to devise
heuristic strategies to reduce this huge
amount to a manageable amount of tests
to be ordered without compromising the
accuracy of the diagnostic program for
that we devised some parameters that can
be set at different values and this will
retrieve then that's what we call a
bridge a breached output files that
showed is reduced in number list of data
but that I will understand better when
we do the demonstration also for now
have a little patience please and here's
another problem many times I as I said
before the patient is afflicted by more
than one disease and what happened with
existing programs perhaps some program
will diagnose from these three diagonals
I told you myocardial infraction
congestive heart failure and irregular
heartbeats perhaps it will diagnose
correctly the congestive heart failure
but we'll miss the diagnosis of my
current faction which is a cause of all
that and that is very bad because both
the complication and the disease must be
treated simultaneously so our program to
solve this problem creates we created
this what we call complex clinical
presentation models were
have all the diseases are connected in
some way statistically or by mechanisms
pathophysiological mechanisms are listed
together it's only a list of diagnosis
that used to be connected in some way
and if one of these diagnosis is
confirmed by the computer then
automatically all the other diagnoses
are transferred into the differential
diagnosis list to be processed like any
other diagnosis with a minimax procedure
to be confirmed or to be ruled out and
then there are another problem there are
interactions between diseases and drugs
I give an example to illustrate that a
patient has a myocardial infraction the
landmark symptom is an intense
oppressive chest pain in the middle of
the chest but if the patient is at the
same time diabetic this diabetes can
cancel the chest pain and that is very
risky for doctors and for computers
because if an important symptom oil
frequent symptom with high sensitivity
like chest pain for myocardial
infraction is missing then the doctor
and the computer tend to rule out the
diagnosis of myocardial infraction so
while our program does automatically if
diabetes is confirmed the symptom chest
pain is removed from the disease model
myocardial infraction and the computer
is forced to recommend a better test
more reliable like an electrocardiogram
or perhaps the increase of troponins in
the blood which is a marker for acute
myocardial infraction
steerer nums is easy to handle with our
program and the program is also easy to
update but as we are getting short of
time which we'll skip that is not so
important and let's summarize what we
said now by underscoring the socio
economic advantages of our program
number one it is it is expected to
significantly reduce the current
numerous diagnostic errors and the
dismal consequences of these errors a
second it will say specialist
consultations which is important in some
urgency situation for especially not
ready available or in underdeveloped
countries where the specialist don't
even exist it will reduce significantly
the number of these futile tests and
procedures that harm the patient and the
socio-economic system on the other hand
if the test is really necessary proven
by this program that it has to be
obtained to confirm a diagnosis then
even if it's costly it will be an
argument for insurance companies not to
curtail that not to diss authorized it
and let's sit down it will protect
health care providers against unfounded
malpractice liabilities because if this
program hopefully someday become
state-of-the-art for diagnosing if the
doctor follows the correct steps and
that is locked in the computer that
would be a powerful prove in court that
the doctor proceeded correctly and it
will help also I'm sure if it works fine
to overcome the current well-known
resistance of physicians to use these
programs as an 88 for diagnosis well
let's do the demonstration now this is a
real case
modern fabricated case it's a real
patient and this is a 32 year old white
female great school teacher with recent
onset of palpitations six months ago she
lost her job followed by nervousness and
depression at that time a complete
physical examination and basic lab tests
were normal she was treated with an
antidepressant without improving her
medical condition gradually worsened and
recently they mentioned palpitations
added to the clinical picture motivating
the present consultation the medical
examination revealed the following
clinical data excuse me a minute my
mouse is getting dry so our momentum our
program has among others to input files
one for clinical data present in the
patient and one for clinical data absent
the patient showed this following
symptoms she had palpitations
nervousness depression she was fatigued
she was sweating more than normal she
lost weight and she had diarrhea and
some shortness of breath and the
examination showed tachycardia which
means a accelerated heart rate her skin
was more delicate than the usual for the
age then also the hair she had
exophthalmos which is protruding eyes
and with a larger opening of the eyelids
and the partition of the neck showed an
enlarged thyroid gland here which is
called the goiter and also she had some
auscultatory phenomenon with the status
quo when you listen to the heart I don't
want to waste more time with that she
also the muscle weakness and
she had tremors like me now is this
presentation okay so and please notice
that these symptoms are sorted by cost
category these are all no cost clinical
data and they are soup classified by the
procedure to obtain them this is the
file for clinical data absent I don't
recommend at the beginning of the first
diagnostic ground to put the clinical
data absent because doctors document a
lot of clinical data absent and if you
enter all the data it's cumbersome and
some most of the data don't even
correspond to the diagnosis already
ruled in you know so let's not for the
next round when the computer tells us
better which test to order next we put
only one symptom here that is a gender
of the patient by putting male up absent
we rule out from the beginning on every
disease that afflicts exclusively males
like a prostate cancer women have no
prostate so they cannot have a prostate
cancer I apologize instead of putting
female present the way Thomas wrote the
program he was more practical to put
male absent which means that the patient
is a female right okay we run the
program and we obtain I thought you can
read that is it large enough doesn't
matter anyway there are 20 diagnosis
that this clinical data present brought
up you know and these diagnoses are
sorted by decreasing probability and I
apologize again because instead of
putting the probability in decimals and
or percentage Tomas decided to put it in
per meal without the zero and the
decimal point in front so you will have
to do a little exercise the first
diagnosis has a probability of 818
permian so that means 18.8 percent right
okay 20 diagnosis now we open the output
file that gives all the clinic has a
very busy so I don't worry about that
don't read it I only want to show your
home in this is an incomplete list how
many clinical data were not investigated
yet to clarify which of these 20
diagnoses are the actual wonder they
confirm one this I it says a number here
242 tests you cannot order 242 test in a
patient will kill the patient and you
will kill the socio-economic system
right so I show you now what happens
when we use these parameters and again
we have no time to explain that that
corresponds to another talk of one hour
as i said but trim parameters as those
that eliminate from the beginning on
draws clinical data that increase on the
very little let's say ten percent or
twenty percent the probability or only
reduces a ten or twenty percent so we
can disregard it from the beginning on
and we can also manipulate the
confirmation to a short or the deletion
threshold that will also have an effect
on the number recommended anyway if you
use these parameters we set them to
their what we consider the default
values then the list of 242 clinical
data are now reduced to only 85 that
still sounds quite a lot but if you
consider that most of this test are in
the no cost category yeah then the
doctors the only thing he has to do is
to go back to the examination room where
the patient is still waiting in her
examination gown ask for more questions
he forgot to ask in the first place and
also to complete his physical
examination paying attention to these
physical science that he omitted to do
the first time now and then
I highlighted in yellow the only symptom
that the patient had present that is a
hypersensitivity to to heat and all the
gray highlighted clinical data were
absent in the patients so we what we do
now we copy the yellow present data and
then paste it into the clinical data
present list he is the only one that we
have to add to the previous listed
symptoms and we do the same with a
clinical data absent in the clinical
data absent file and here all this
actinic and data absent and now we
pasted that we save it and we run the
program again and see what happens from
the 20 diagnosis we are at the beginning
now only two are left the first one is
hyperthyroidism when the thyroid gland
produces too much hormone with all the
symptoms that you have seen and mitral
stenosis is a lesion of a valve inside
the heart called mitral valve that gets
narrow because of a scar a disease so my
question is hyperthyroidism has now a
probability of sixty-seven percent and
mitral stenosis has a probability of ten
point three percent are we satisfied
with this result or not well we are not
satisfied because in order to confirm
hyperthyroidism we need a probability of
ninety percent that is our confirmation
threshold and mattress enosis is almost
ruled out 10.3 percent okay we need ten
percent but let's do things properly and
let's try to be more specific so we look
again at the average that across
procedure that's established that before
had 85
data recommended now this list
recommends only eight of course less
diagnosis let's later to investigate and
for that we have now to prescribe some
tests to the patients and our test here
are the ones that we are ordering and we
order also a ultrasound of the heart and
echocardiogram which is non-invasive and
shows us evolve if it's really narrowed
or not and the result is this this to
test that we add now to the clinical
data present are sure that the thyroid
hormone production is really increased
and as that absent we put here that
basically the patient had no mitral
stenosis as one of the potential
diagnosis and now we run the program
again and bingo we have only one
diagnosis left hyperthyroidism with a
probability of one hundred percent and
that ends this demonstration now I want
to finish up because we are very close
to the end of time what happened so far
with our project and what are we
expecting in the future in 2006 after
many years of research and grants and
publishing and teaching we had together
the theory behind our program in this we
published our first book that was
already presented to you and in 2007
Tomas our son Tomas father wrote the
program that executes all this program
and that provided as a prototype and
that was really a revelation because it
confirms essentially all of our theories
it dissipated about 20 answer
this we had were completely dissipated
we challenge the program with real cases
and it was diagnosed beautifully you
know so so many were the improvements
the simplifications of the algorithm
etcetera that we decided to write a
second book and publish it which is the
same title as today stock and or our
prototype includes so far 60 diseases in
the database and as I said diagnosis
correctly about hundred real cases we
challenge the program with now what next
our program in order or a system in
order to be really useful must include
all non thousands of non diseases and
all the clinical data that we know
currently that are manifested by these
diseases and that a single person cannot
do it we need a team of specialists that
provides this that estimates the
sensitivity only the sensitivity of each
tag symptom for each diagnosis and the
rest is taken care by the computer so
it's not a difficult job but it's a long
job that the steam has to do and they
have also to put together these complex
clinical presentation models that
associate in some way related diagnosis
we hope that Google or somebody else may
help and support us with this project
the program of Tomas is very good it
executes all requests needed functions
but it's not a glamorous program that
you click icon so you click a menu and
this colourful windows open that also
should be done by a professional
programmer
because Thomas is not a programmer
Thomas is a computer scientist
theoretical computer scientist but the
program works perfectly well and is
pretty use user friendly what next and
that is our last slide our diagnostic
system once implemented with all non
diseases and clinical data is expected
to provide invaluable diagnostic
benefits to patients physicians nurses
health insurance companies malpractice
lawyers malpractice insurance companies
to and I would say the entire medical
establishment so thank you very much and
we have a few minutes left for questions
and answers right so any questions
sorry yeah
oh sure people speak up so my question
is it maybe this part is an envision yet
but it seems like one thing that would
on that inconsistent would be if the
updates you said that it is adapted it
updated with any mistakes but suppose
that opposition confirms in particular
receptive in a patient and it turns out
system ends up getting a diagnosis and
then later it turns out diagnosis
perhaps this user error in position
ms specified the center or perhaps
patterns of change in the population an
sn2 no longer
in fact that we used to have and so it
seems like they're the opportunity to
feed back into the system as changes in
the population that caused the
probabilities to change if this is to
update itself would start updating the
yeah the chain differential diagnosis
basically is there any idea of doing
that and with your privacy implications
for the patients whose data is okay so
far I understood the question it has two
parts how do you update the system
number one and the other question is how
reliable the system is now regarding the
reliability of the system so far with
this hundreds of cases we challenged the
system it worked very well it was the
diagnosis was essentially correct every
time no of course we have to see what
happens with a larger number of diseases
and clinical data and all that now
update I I jumped over that because of
lack of time but this is a very very
important and good question you know
let's see if I can show you another
slightly that is quite curious you know
existing programs I would say there are
three types of programs one is based on
like ours I would identify it with
pattern recognition there are only list
of symptoms that matches symptoms in the
disease model and bring it up etc then
they are the type of programs that are
based on mathematical formulas and you
see the most crazy and sophisticated
formulas one Patrick created a whole
book full of formulas from the beginning
of the end and I'm convinced that such
programs are completely divorced from
clinical reality from the daily nuances
of the diagnosis now and then many
programs are like trees or like networks
you know that this cause produces this
lesion this region produces the symptoms
many of these links are not
known in medicine and some links jump
over a no then go to more distant nodes
and these programs take months or years
prolly implement and then after two or
three years they're obsolete because
medicine change you have to start again
from the beginning on I would like to
show you one program is a internist
program which was very popular among
researchers and still today they try to
fix it in some way but let me show you
this light because it's a little funny
one second please so I have to go here
to the corresponding slide it's if I can
quickly find it one second please
here
yeah can you see that on the top of the
slide there is this relation the course
of the disease produces a lesion by
pathogenesis is called the mechanism the
lesions produces clinical data but this
is a simplistic line then a one course
can produce more than one lesion and
each lesion produces many symptoms you
know so then the network becomes more
entangled of tangled the same author
called Stanga and look what happens i
want to show you this light here this is
only a very small portion of medicine
only a very restricted look imagine the
whole medicine put together like that is
impossible you know it will never work
our program you only have if there is an
update let's see new test is embedded no
then the only thing you have to do you
have to add it to the disease model with
a corresponding sensitivity how
frequently this test is positive in this
disease right and if necessary you can
add this with a new diagnosis you add
the new disease you add the new disease
with all its symptoms and the
sensitivities and perhaps you should
still add this disease if it's connected
to other diseases in the complex a
clinical presentation model but that's
all what we have to do the computer
takes care of everything else you know I
don't know if that answers your question
yeah
and on what charge it relies on
22 everything that
and yet it relies on
to say however it is
in particular
what we really like kind of
crowd with many many hospitals
more excuse
the question is you correct me if it's
not so how to establish a reliable
sensitivity of a clinical data for a
specific disease sensitivity also always
depends on the datum and and the
diagnosis of course both ports well
there are three methods to determine the
sensitivity of each clinical data for
each disease I call it first the
retrospective model you take like in
this book that is an old book but I I
used it a lot that tells you the
sensitivity of each technical data 450
disease 50 diagnosis you like these guys
did they say that took 1000 charts for
each of these 50 diagnosis and did a
statistical tabulation to see how often
this data happened in the corresponding
disease this one made retrospective one
the other method would be the
prospective method to say from now on we
will tabulate each patient and if you
have bronchitis will look in 100 patient
or 200 prospective patients how often
cough shows up right that will be a
better metal because the doctors who do
that should be trained specially not to
miss to document click add attributes
it's not documented in each other's as
the patient didn't have the symptom you
know and that is an would be an ongoing
process only in two or three years we'll
have a good statistic right in this
sense well this but we now there is a
kind of rebirth of universal electronic
storage of medical charts that will help
a lot you know the government is very
interested in that Google come
out I believe with Google Health where
patients can storage their clinical
history at Google and ND talk talk who
needs that can retrieve it and Microsoft
came out with elseworld same program so
if that materializes that will help the
prospective metal insert it can be
estimated by doctors doctors know how
often more or less a patient this prong
keitus had asked off how many times a
patient was myocardial infraction has
chest pain you know I did I I didn't
trust very much this metals because you
are two doctors there will be a big
difference sometimes of twenty percent
or so however our program showed that
the accuracy of the sensitivity is not
so critical it accepts pretty large
discrepancies and also what was I going
to say something else I want to say
about that yeah the discrepancy is more
with symptoms taken from the history of
the patient as you mentioned and more at
the physical examination but as soon as
you go to a more sophisticated tests
like the one I mentioned troponins in
the blood increase for myocardial
infraction we already know because
inventor of this test must have
documented how sensitive the test is how
specific the test is so for that we have
pretty exact numbers and at the end what
confirms the diagnosis are this kind of
more specific characteristic test so I
believe that will not be a problem but
see ya
but was it about the Moscow minimax
bottle the 11 question that I have is
the model take into account disease
prevalence when it makes the diagnosis
the other question is could you just say
a little bit more about the minimax and
what the problem is I wanted an extra
hour to explain how the program works a
technical aspect and unfortunate is the
first time I'm coming I understand i
couldn't get more than one hour you know
so did they talk in itself but i will
leave to Tomas to explain that but let
me tell something about prevalence that
is in our two books and that is a very
very good question prevalence is very
important from an epidemiological point
of view if you want to fight AIDS in
Africa you have to know how many
patients prevalence for those are not
doctors means how frequent a disease
happened in a population you know so
then you need to know how many cases
have in Africa so you can allocate the
proper resources for that but for
diagnostic purposes it's not only not
useful icons late could be harmful
because the patient of the disease that
happens only in 1,000,000 of cases
though and then the base formula and all
these programs that use prevalence will
push down so much the probability of the
diagnosis that there is a risk that this
diagnosis will be who's out you know and
for the patient is not one in a million
for the patient is a 100-percent the
decision now so we purposely and that is
describing a whole segment with
disregard prevalence and that has a
fringe benefit that I didn't see at the
first moment but from the base formula
prevalence is called a prior probability
right it takes off I mean no by
disregarding prevalence you assigned to
each diagnosis the same probability did
rare orbit not rare and I think that
it's fair because
that gives a chance to the diagnosis to
prove its existence by itself as proper
symptoms you know and then you can
simplify the bias formula if all the
priorities in the formula non nominated
in a mirror i equal you simply eliminate
that and that creates a new equation
that we call positive predictive value
which is no well the way we determine it
and that the greater the positive
predictive values the more it will raise
the property of the diagnosis you want
to see something to must talk to the
microphone about the minibus easily so
suppose the patient had only one data
present wonder absent in that case we
just a thought base formula and that's
it without their prior probabilities
that is you assume the data present that
are absent are independent there is no
problem with that and the properties
will add up to one but when they are
more than a present or murder absent we
created table where you maximize in the
x axis in the y axis of data present a
minimize in the y axis of data absent
the probability given the base formula
for just one pair so if you look at the
various tables for various diseases the
corresponding entries will add up to one
of the various tables because it'd be
just one present one absent but when you
do minimize in this direction and
Maximus than in this direction the final
results made up to more than one so that
we allowed the patient to have more than
one disease because different pairs will
learn to various results so we're
measuring is a public the data the
diseases how much as the data present
favor disease given that there is love
that absent there are these
favoring the disease so the maximum or
data present of the minimum of data
absent all the base formula with our
pure probabilities for a particular pair
that is all formulas yeah I would like
to add that each triplet each minimax
table represents one diagnosis and there
is a relative independence between
tables relative so a more than one cable
can reach a hundred percent confirmation
right that allows diagnosis of
concurrent diseases okay yeah
physicians have been around for a while
computer science that's not
there's a problem of motivation for
classes I mean I go for Isabelle the
program was developed by a physician
whose daughter actually died I feel like
if that is the motivation that takes
medical science to start moving for this
it may take you like another hundred
years of it it seems to me that the
preferred method of publishing their
knowledge is medical journals not
natural software
programs like this so you know what is
the incentive like this larger problem
like reading these kind of tools closer
to do the practicing
see how can I answer that yeah you talk
you spoke about motivation you know
motivation is if you have a vision of
the benefit that the program will have
in the future and for several reasons I
I asked myself many times it same
question why in five decades I trying to
create a workable system that really
diagnosis in real patients that why was
I not created so far no many attempts
were done many errors were committed in
our first book with a little more boring
to read it because is more theoretical
we had not prototype at that point it
lists all the reasons I see why previous
programs did not work because they
consider prevalence as this gentleman
said and some other errors you know and
then perhaps to create a program like
this it takes I am a I have a
obsessive-compulsive tree not not the
real disorder you know but I have this
obsession since i graduated from
medicine and i worked a lot on that and
even had to make a living practicing
medicine but in the back of my mind each
time had a complicated case i said how
would the computer solvent and after
more than half a century something
clicked in my head and then I had the
really very talented mind of my son that
helped me then with a logic and with a
mathematical path perhaps a coincidence
of factors all ye right now this there
was a very intense research in journal
medicines published journal and then
this enthusiasm defied the decade
perhaps because they didn't reach a good
result perhaps were distract researchers
by more gratifying programs like
building programs or so and that was
called a winter of medical diagnostic
impatient in
what we are trying to create his a new
spring I don't know if that answered
yeah any other question okay then thank
you very much again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
