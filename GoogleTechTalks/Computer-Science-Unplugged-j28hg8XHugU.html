pleased to have Professor Tim Bell from
the computer science department at the
University of Canterbury in Christchurch
New Zealand
Tim's research interests include data
compression computer science for
children which he'll be talking to us
about today and computers and music Tim
recently completed I think this is your
last leg of your tour a worldwide tour
talking about his project computer
science unplugged this is a project that
seeks to teach principles of computer
science - without using computers so
that is what we'll hear about today
please join me in welcoming Tim Bell
well yep ok thank you very much what I'm
gonna do today is just very quickly run
over some of the ideas that we've been
working on with this unplugged project I
thought I'll start with a demonstration
just to give you an idea also should
just so I guess we've many got engineers
here today any sort of non programming
kind of people here today
ok I'll probably be going fairly quickly
over some of the technical concepts
whereas normally if I'm presenting this
to people who aren't engineers we would
probably spend literally three times as
long on some of the concepts and dig
into them a bit deeper but since you'll
be familiar with a lot of them we'll go
a little bit faster and it's all in the
book ok if you need three more right
okay so Greg's been helping me out here
with these black and white squares which
will be familiar to a lot of us as
representing the binary digit or the bit
the fundamental unit of everything
that's stored on a computer and when
presenting us to young kids or even
general public I quite often start off
with this demonstration where I've had
Greek put up a random mixture of these
binary digits or bits and I'm just going
to add some extra ones to make it harder
and what we're gonna do is a bit of a
hopefully impressive magic trick with it
running out of bits
it's more here
why wouldn't it okay now actually what
I'm in outriggers to simulate something
going wrong on this digital data so it
could be a CD with a scratch landing on
it by flipping over one of the bits okay
so if you just choose any bit and flip
it over for me
yep okay you can try this at home
you don't have coins or cards or
anything that's got two sides so forgot
one flipped over just one okay keep
track of which ones flip is just one
yeah one flip over once that's right and
my job is a computer scientist is to try
and put this thing right so I think the
one that you flipped over might and
think have been met one year it was okay
thank you very much
and so how is it done parity thank you
so Greg had put down most of these cards
here and I put down the extra parity
ones to make sure that the number of
white in each row was an even number
okay so there's three there make it
white to make it up to an even number is
four there so I'll leave that black
because four is an even number and same
with the columns three there so need
another wipe to make it an even number
two three four five six in one two three
four five so we need a white one there
and by the way if you are trying it at
home that bottom corner one will be
correct for both than the chick row and
the chick column so that's a good little
chick that while you're sort of talking
in things you haven't got one of them
wrong or at least unless you've got two
of them wrong
and they can be done with any size
obviously and also you can do it with
coins or caps or whatever is to hand but
the whole point of the Sun plug thing is
we take a concept like parity and we
turn it into something that's kind of
fun maybe it's big like that or you do
it on table with cards and then
typically would be able to start
reasoning about it with kids so what
happens beyond this what would happen if
he had flipped over two of them okay and
kids pretty soon work out that if you
flip over to you can't be sure exactly
which pair had been flipped over so if I
say of
we get flipped over those two there then
the fact that there's an odd number in
each row in those rows and those rows
tells me that there's something wrong
there and something wrong across there
that it could have been those two or it
could have been those two whereas when
you flip over one there's one row and
one column that's got an odd number of
white cards in it and sit there for that
you did identifies exactly which one was
flipped over
incidentally one nice trick of weight
with magic tricks you explain it to the
audience
and then you take it one step further
and so typically I didn't get a kid to
flip over too and I sometimes have an
assistant and the system will say oh
it's really now Tim and or it's really
now okay and whether or not they use my
name there's a one but code to say
whether it's the top right-hand one or
the top left-hand one okay and so then
you can get the right two and it leaves
them was that a puzzling to do I've had
some long arguments with kids afterwards
about how it might have been done for
doing - so it's just a warm-up to the
general idea of what we're on about with
this and where it started it sort of
came from three things all happening at
the same time I will move this out the
way thinks so one was I was involved in
some music education and trying to
communicate some of the boring subjects
to kids my kid started school and they
asked me to come and give a talk about
computers and if you bring along a
computer it's kind of boring for the
kids because they've seen computers and
what's the big deal and also we had a
Science Center sitting up in town and
they were interested in displays and
activities that would sort of show
computer science to kids but you can't
just put in a computer running software
that they probably use at home so what
do you do and I start looking at how
people popularize science topics and a
lot of people who involved in
popularization of science would take a
topic that might not be interesting you
know go into a class and say today we're
gonna do statistics and they might not
be that interesting but if you say today
we're gonna do lotto then suddenly it
becomes a lot more interesting which is
just statistics with long odds right
well today we're going to do viruses
maybe not so interesting but if you say
today we're going to do snot then
suddenly it's interesting and there was
when science first of all I went to
we're
there was a talk that had snot in the
title and all the 10 to 12 year old boys
were going along to it I mean what could
be more interesting it was actually just
about viruses but chemistry how's that
you know publicized generally using
explosions okay
and in fact I'm worried that the next
generation of chemists is probably going
to be a bunch of pirate maniacs because
they've been to all these demonstrations
using explosions with physics pretty
much the same blowing things up
lightning and all that sort of stuff so
we've got this environment with all
these scientific things are being
popularized with explosions and fancy
things but what do we do with computer
science and that's really where the
unplugged thing grew and I met with a
few other people who were thinking like
this and we've pulled ideas and tried
them out over the years and gradually
put them together into a bunch of things
so first of all there is a bunch of
about 20 activities that we've developed
which have all been tried and tested and
worked really well and I'll show you a
few of them so that you know next time
you're asked to go and explain someone's
class or some sort of situation where
the people out there interests in
computers you might be able to use some
of these there's also two books that
we've developed and one of them is a bit
more technical the other one is designed
for elementary school teachers that sort
of age group and that sort of background
and they have all the handouts and
there's activities and them and
follow-up and explanations about how all
these things work there's a show that
we've developed and that generally this
has been run in the middle of winter in
New Zealand and June and it's being sold
out lots of people come along to it I
think actually when they see the
computer science and the title they
think that we're going to show them have
a stop you know their computer from
crashing or something like that
but from the surveys we find out that
they actually get a lot out of it
there's a website and I'll give the URL
for that at the end and a lot of these
things are available directly on the
website there's a bunch of videos and
fit one they just so we're working on a
new set of videos but I'll just give you
an idea what we're on about with a video
of an
activity this is available on video
google.com the computer science and play
comes to computer science unplugged it's
just a two minute video there's actually
three videos there we're hoping to make
a whole series of them illustrating all
of the activities done this particular
one is not the one I was going to show
it she let's count the dots let's just
skip to sorting networks okay so it it
goes through and explains how a lot of
the output you see on computers are
sorted whether it's sorted by name or
age rival of an email date or pay drink
or whatever it is and but this is a
parallel sorting algorithm and what's
happening here is we have this chart on
the ground and two children follow along
the arrows or the lines when they meet
they compare their numbers and this
smaller number goes out the left-hand
line the larger number goes out some
right-hand line so this is a parallel
sorting Network we get three comparisons
happening so it's sort of conveying the
idea of parallelism the idea that we
want to get this as fast as possible get
as much parallelism as possible and they
come out sorted which is kind of fun
activity then we give some bigger
numbers and it makes it harder and and
we can develop bigger sorting networks
you need to be when we did this video I
had a great idea at the end you just
throw them all up in the end and in
three seconds later I realized it wasn't
such a great idea but it made a good
video the so with the sorting Network
you can start talking to the kids about
okay we you know what so we had to sort
eight things you know what sort of
sorting network would you have all we
start off with three and two and easier
ones like there and and then you can
talk about parallelism and how wide can
it be why can't if you've got six values
being sorted why can't it be more than
three comparisons wide and all that sort
of thing
so we've got videos we've actually done
some outdoor events this particular
illustration here is meths and the pack
a bit of knot theory in this particular
case which is not directly computer
science but in the background that
orange on the ground there is actually a
sorting Network as well we had an event
public event people could come onto the
pack and do meth and including bit of
computer science that's the biggest
sorting Network I've done is 50 so if
anyone if it does more than 50 people
sorting you can let me know and we'll
put it up on the webpage and our and we
built a new building at a university not
too long ago and as part of the
landscape and we put in a computer
science garden so in the scat and you
might notice that there are seven
bridges and when I have a bunch of
school kids come out and they're getting
a bit rowdy in the classroom we go
outside and tell them to solve the seven
bridges problem I'd say they have to
cross every bridge exactly once and it
can't be solved so that usually gives me
a good break from the kids while they
run around trying to solve it and then
when they get suspicious and think it
can't be solved then we try and get them
to you know we'll prove it you know and
some of them actually managed to reason
through so the reason is that because
the the degree of the nodes is too many
with an odd degree on it right and they
don't use their language but they manage
to reason that you need to have an even
number of bridges and things like that
at least some of them do this is the
show that handsome dude there is
annulled the wonder parrot actually and
Arnold turns out to be the star of the
show small fluffy animals will always
upstage you he only got in as a gag
because of the parity trick okay but it
turns out in all the surveys that that
they liked all sorts of things but the
one thing that almost everyone liked was
Arnold the Wonder parrot the books that
I've talked about I've had a lot of
people ask to translate them into their
own language and so in fact the Korean
version of it has just come out and you
can order it off the web
want and there is two Chinese versions
traditional and simplified Chinese and
the production and it's even a Swedish
version underway and in fact there's
there's actually about ten languages
that one or another person I just got a
request three days ago for a Turkish to
do a Turkish translation sure enough if
you really want there's actually an
Uzbek translation underway so I got an
email from Uzbekistan where an aid
agency was working with kids and they
wanted to do computing in the schools
but there's no computers and so this was
great because they could do it without
computers that they wanted to translate
into these big so cool so I've talked
about the parity thing let me talk a bit
about what the goals are in case they're
not obvious so the first one is want to
communicate to people what computer
science really is because I think a lot
of the people if you ask a bunch of
especially sort of twelve-year-old to 18
year old kids this is where they're
making decisions about what general
career direction they want to take if
you ask them what a computer scientist
does and so on they generally talk about
programming they'll talk about perhaps
working on your own maybe working long
hours and all that sort of thing and
while some of those things might be
aspects of being a computer scientist
for some people a lot of that of course
involves teamwork logical thinking and a
whole lot of other skills and sometimes
people get counseled against doing
computer science because they are good
at working in teams and relating to
people and so on and we want to try and
communicate a lot of those sort of ideas
want to reach minority groups and
disadvantaged groups and we have talked
about making it available for people who
don't have access to computers but also
a really big minority in computer
science of course as women and generally
the kind of environment that is in
schools for using computers as one
that's probably doesn't always appeal to
women and yet a lot of these puzzles and
interactive team games and that sort of
stuff do and and the problem-solving
kind of side of it does so rather than
saying you have to learn programming and
then we might let you do computer
science it's like even decent computer
science
by the way if you want to do it on a
computer you might need to learn
programming to do that we obviously want
to create interest in computer science
especially the demand for computer
science graduates as is increasing
rapidly the supply is decreasing rapidly
and I think a lot of companies are
getting very worried about the versus
the supply and demand situation we use
it to promote our own courses if we're
invited to go to a school then this
gives us a tool to actually interact
with kids and especially try and
influence decision makers kids making
decisions about their futures but
teachers and parents have a big
influence you know the parents read the
newspaper they hear about job losses and
outsourcing and things like that and
have an influence on their kids
and likewise teachers you know they
might say well you like working on your
own and you don't like communicating
with people and all that sort of stuff
why don't you do computer science and we
really want to try and get the message
across to some of those people that
infect maybe it involves more than just
the hacking thing in we have fun maybe
that one should be first in terms of who
this is being the audience that we're
delivering this to I talked about the
family shows that are really popular
which is probably more entertainment
than education but you can do a lot of
these things and some of the kids will
get something out of it in other words
others will just enjoy it and that's ok
school classes we can actually sit down
and do exercises and do a more thorough
job of looking at some of the concepts
school assemblies where you have large
groups of kids together sometimes they
get together once a week or something
and you might have 500 kids there some
of these are quite good in the large so
a lot of these activities are very big
and theatrical and that makes them easy
to to deliver in that sort of situation
in New Zealand at least we have quite a
strong movement called seniornet which
has senior citizens who have typically
bought a computer so that they can send
email to their grandchildren and then
they discover that they need computer
support and they they get together and
help each other with their computers and
generally they're very capable people
but they're completely new to computers
and
getting people to give them talks and so
on and I found that a lot of these
illustrations are very useful in the
talks that go down very well and it's
even been used in a trial in fact one of
the one of the methods so data
compression is an area that I've worked
on and one case where I was an expert
witness there was a method that involved
LZ coding and at the time when there was
this million dollar multi-million dollar
all suit going on my son was writing out
a story and he got a bit lazy and
instead of writing out of word he would
sort of find where he'd used the word
before and put a little arrow pointing
back at it and I wasn't gonna tell him
off for it I mean I suddenly realized
that an actual effect what he was doing
was LZ compression so what we've got
here is butts the texts are missing and
to fill that one and what I've done as I
followed that arrow there to where it
secured before and so we can fill in all
of that text just by following the
arrows and then here we've got a really
big chunk of text and you follow the
arrow back to where it is and get a big
chunk and now the system has kind of
learned that big chunk and it can
replace it like that so civilly in Palo
LZ compression sometimes as codes used
and zip gzip and ping and gif and whole
lot of situations but it's we can set up
this worksheet for kids to work on and
then we can give them some text and they
can try and see how many things they can
replace with where they've occurred
before and so on of course the real LZ
methods don't use arrows they use two
numbers right one says how far back the
arrow points and how many characters
that's pointing it somehow removed all
the zeros from these slides so let me
just put them in in fact so it's ten
minutes and that's 30 minutes
continuing off the seam there so we have
to show you that is it can either be
sort of a ten minute science centre sort
of show you know where they say you know
three o'clock this afternoon there will
be a show in the auditorium and we'll
explain some concepts from computer
science through to about a one-hour show
which is the one that we run this part
of this midwinter festival usually more
than about an hour I find that no matter
how much fun the kids are having they
tend to lose concentration after about
that long with any all of these things
there's always a balance between
entertainment and education level and
and sometimes I think it's important not
to get too hung up on trying to educate
people about every fine detail but let
them just enjoy it and think through the
concepts on their own but generally I
try and provide some sort of follow-up
there's follow-up material on the
internet too so for example for the
parity one that we did before we were
looking that's basically a modulo two
error correction chicks um okay just
adding things up modulo two and then we
can follow on to other error correction
codes so for example ISBN numbers the
last digit of an ISBN number is a chick
digit do you know what modulus the chick
digit on ISBN is 11 yeah okay so it's
modulo 11 which means it's a number
between 0 and 10 and if it's a team the
digit that's used to represent it as an
X so in principle 1 and every 11 of the
books in your library will have an X as
the chick digit and it just means that's
the number 10 okay and we give the kids
the formula for the chick digit and they
can go through the library and check
that they all add up and you know what
would happen if a digit was typed and
incorrectly what would happen if two of
them were swapped around and they can
experiment with all of those sort of
things now another really important
principle I think working with the kids
is to get the answers from them so for
example with the parity thing there I
mean I explained to us parity because
most of this audience know what parity
is but with the kids you do to get them
to count there how many white squares
there are they'd figure out that it's an
even number that figure out that there's
an odd number for themselves and what I
want to communicate there is that they
probably are capable of figuring out
these concepts from computer science for
themselves and if they can figure out
that concept maybe they'll go on to deal
with some of the problems that we
haven't solved there's another problem
of Education I think is that because it
has to be tested
we tend over a science book that
contains everything they need to know
about science they learn it all and if
they can get all that right then they
pass the tears
that an actual fact there's more in
science that we don't know them what we
do know right and the more we find out
the more we find out we don't know and
it's the same in computer science I mean
there's lots and lots of problems that
we don't know how to solve optimally
there's lots of things that we're still
trying to do and that's what just keeps
us computer scientists and business but
I think a lot of children and the
general public would see that the main
advances of computer sciences can we get
from you know three gigahertz machines
to six gigahertz machines or something
like that but we want to so for example
NP completeness right on the biggest
questions in computer science you can
deal with quite easily because it's
about exponential explosion and and it's
kind of humorous right you can take a
small problem like met coloring or
trebling cells and problem or something
like that and kids soon realize that
these things are really intractable that
is there's just too many things to try
out and they can work out how long it
would take if you could do a million or
billion operations every second and that
the whole infeasibility of these
problems becomes a bit fairly obvious
and because they've solved problems like
the parity one we wanted to try and
think well maybe if they get the myth
right and they work on it they'll be
able to solve some of the other had
problems that we're trying to deal with
as computer scientists
I'll just run through a couple of the
activities that that we've developed
just to give you a bit more of a feel
for things binary numbers turns out to
be a lot of fun and I guess moderately
simple concept but very fundamental to
everything that happens on computer
science everything is just bits and
there's two main ways that I present it
one is getting a bunch of kids up the
front of the class is I in this photo
here and each one has a dot or a number
of dots on their card that's either
visible or not visible in fact I use
black and white cards because it
corresponds to the black and white that
we had on the parity okay so one of my
colleagues does this where each card
sorry each child holds the card and now
they have their hand up or the hand not
up to which means the audience can kind
of read things off a bit more easily but
either way you get these these binary
numbers that's one zero one zero
one there now it's a decode bet binary
number you don't even need to be able to
add you just need to over count up to 21
okay there's 21 dots on the pic on the
picture and then we can reason well if
the kids like well is there another way
that we could have done 21 their card
with 16 dots on it what if if there
wasn't showing we can't possibly get 21
so we have to have the 16 and you kind
of develop the greedy algorithm for
converting it and so on incidentally
it's just giving out the cards as fun
right so you give out the 1 card and
then the 2 card and ask them what comes
next you know they'll figure it out for
yourself thing normally they'll say 3
put out before no explanation but then
typically kids will either say 6 for the
next one you know 1 2 4 6 and then
they'll realize that no 8 is the next
thing in the pattern and usually get up
to about a thousand and twenty four
before they kind of run out of steam it
can also just be done on disk so we give
the kids a set of cards and each each
one can play around off the cards and
try and get the right number of dots
showing just things that may be obvious
to us but is there more than one way to
represent the number 5 ok what's the
smallest number generally they'll say 1
and then after a little moment's thought
they'll say 2 0 what's the largest
number the idea that the largest number
is you double the biggest card and
subtract 1 all those sort of patterns
that come up with the powers of 2 what
would the card be you know if I put a
cab there on the table how many dots and
typically they'll say well maybe it's 0
or maybe it's negative 1 and eventually
someone will reason that it's actually
got half a dot on it I think so I've got
a set of cards that have got 1/2 dot and
1/4 dot and so on and you can work with
fractional binary numbers then moving
from it onto the my so called
s key code we talk about how would you
code these as characters and again kids
will figure out for themselves that you
should use a code something like that
one there and then I introduced the idea
of modems communicating using beeps and
we use a low beep beep for a zero and a
beep for a one okay so I'll send your
message
I should be able to figure this out hmm
so lift two right here's the ones and
zeros so that's beat a zero and P plus
one
bbbbb what leader yep H yeah and here's
the next letter beep beep beep beep beep
I okay and that's my whole email message
to you okay hi
then we can talk about how you know
modems actually go a little bit faster
than that and they make awful sounds and
so on did it at one school and the kids
will win out into the playground
afterwards and we're communicating to
each other like this because it's
actually it's a simple enough code that
you can kind of memorize most of it'll
work it out and your head as you go
along
yeah look good too just while we're
getting carried away with coding here so
base 1 coding we generalize from base 2
to base one okay where each you each
place is worth 1 times as much as the
previous place so here's the numbers 1 2
3 4 5 using just one digit and you know
where else is there used tally marks
counting on your fingers the old
telephones and go tick tick tick tick
tick and most important application of
this coding the annual use the base they
take and in fact one of my friends went
to a birthday party where they had a
hundred candles on the cake and you're
probably aware that as you get more more
candles on the cake it gets more and
more dangerous because you kind of get
this updraft from the flames and this
particular occasion actually the cake
tinned into a molten ball of wax and set
light to the ceiling and that was the
end of the party they had to get the
fire brigade in computer science to the
rescue each candle can either be lit
will not let okay so with five candles
what's the biggest number we can do
steady one okay
in fact that the the song when I'm 64 is
much more significant because that's
when you need one extra candle on your
birthday cake
oh also fingers instead of just counting
up to five on one hand each finger can
be either up or down right so it's one
two three four gotta be careful of four
five seven eighth and so on
oh she windows in New York I found out
that the taxi drivers use a digital
communication system I was driving
around New York and they gave me
guidance on what I should be doing using
digital signals usually the number-four
say you know like don't slow down for
that orange light that we'd like doesn't
mean you should be stopping let's just
keep moving here and sort of messages
like that okay image compression for
this one what we do that this is someone
said this was me of a can of beer but
it's actually a spray spray paint can
actually I didn't bring a spray can with
me today because I just got off the
airplane but I was giving this talk a
wee while ago and so I saw someone the
previous night and that they asked if I
wanted anything I'd say yeah I need a
spray can for this and I'm in a pic of
Mitch's for the birthday cake and they
went into a gas station at 10 o'clock at
night and asked for a can of spray paint
and a pic of the mitches which try that
if you want to hit them what we do is
here's an old again and it's the feature
than the show so we look at how an alter
the image of an old is coded using
pixels we can talk about how pixels are
just paint by numbers and then it
relates back to the bits you know the
more bits you have the more accuracy of
the imagery here and so on
but this particular code here that I'm
using is a run length code and it's the
one that's used in fix machines and it's
got the zeros missing again I'll just
put them in there's a couple of key ones
here and what it represents is the the
first four means that we've got four
what that's so strictly black and white
because it's effects for white pixels
followed by eleven black pixels followed
by two white pixels and in fact is the
image that I've started to to do here so
we've got our four white pixels 11 black
to white and so on and we've just got
the last three lines if to do and at
this point we put out the spray can and
have a giant inkjet printer
and print pixels infect so I have a
little mask yeah it was well used for
spraying pixels through okay if you're
trying this at home practice first
because it's a wee bit fiddly to get
nice even pixels but it's it is possible
now you could do that just using a
PowerPoint presentation but it's it's
there's a lot of drama when you get out
the spray can and you get out the and
there's lots of fumes as well by the way
but it it's in fact one of the things
about all of these in some ways it's
just kinesthetic computer science it's
it's actually just doing it with real
things instead of a keyboard and a bunch
of pixels on a screen and I think for
some learners that's really important ok
some people like to hear it some people
like to read it others like to actually
experience it and it can make it more
memorable that's the final picture by
the way which if we zoom out in fact
it's the original one that it was taken
from so it's a coffee cap which of
course is also very relevant to computer
science
ok information theory or Shannon theory
so like a challenge how we're going to
do this will it this is this is a
retrofitted activity and one of the
things that turns out to be really good
for this is the game of 20 questions or
basically I'm going to give you yes/no
answers so I'm thinking of a number
between one and a hundred you can ask
any question you want but I'll give you
a yes/no answer so what question do want
to ask you can have as many as you want
actually the answer's no okay okay yeah
okay I'll put you out of me it was 27 by
the way I can't just yeah okay and I was
doing this the other day and someone
someone seeders at least them 50 and
ICDs and and then someone else said is
it a hundred okay and well exactly which
actually is a great illustration of
information theory because what is the
probability that I'm going to say no to
that is the answer 100%
you know that it's less than 50 so the
answer to is it a hundred hundred
percent probability of their message
what's the information content how much
more do you know now that I've told the
answer zero hundred percent probability
zero information okay
that's information theory that's what
it's about it's the relationship between
probability and information content so
okay here's another one I'm thinking of
a number
I'm not telling anything about the range
now what question do I ask
it's an integer it's a positive integer
I'll tell you there okay so how many
bits in its binary representation but
then you could guess each of those bits
using use or no questions right yeah
okay and which actually is equivalent to
saying is it lists them to us at less
than four is at least in Aiden and so on
and that is actually quite a legitimate
way of representing arbitrarily large
numbers and there are other ways of
doing that too Cheerilee after doing
this we can come down to looking at a
decision tree so if I tell you I've got
a number between 0 &amp;amp; 7 then possibly the
first question you would ask is a
greater than or equal to 4 and suppose I
was thinking of the number 5 I would end
up saying yes no yes two points to make
here first of all the yes no yes is just
the one zero one that we were doing with
binary before okay so the path down the
tree is the binary number but the other
one is that if you and I were identical
twins like we were computer programs
that always did the same thing because
the same computer program on them will
generally do the same thing then I can
anticipate what your question will be
and so I can just say are the answers to
your question was no yes yes okay and
that's how a lot of data compression
systems work is that they anticipate
what the questions are going to be and
they just send out the answers to those
questions now this is a trivial sort of
coding we're saying that everything is
equally likely but suppose now we'll
guess a sentence so I'm thinking of a
sentence what's the first letter
is it cute is it cute no it's not W is
it it's not e not is T thank you okay
they cost you five bits of information
okay five zeros and ones or five years
is nice okay what's Linux with it H and
then a you know is it okay cost you one
bit each to get that information okay
what's the next letter space no very
good okay two bits higher information
content okay because there was a bit of
surprise there a lower probability
what's the next video key space space
this is just like working with the kids
age it's great though I mean one of the
things about working with kids space
isn't a leader for those who didn't hear
is that they don't mind asking all sorts
of questions and they don't mind saying
but you told us something else before
and in fact once or twice we've actually
discovered things that we hadn't thought
of because you know the kids challenge
you on stuff one of my colleagues was
doing something with cryptography where
they were using envelopes and messages
inside envelopes and someone had well
got it wrong basically and put the wrong
things in the wrong envelopes and it
still worked and afterwards they looked
at it and they realized that in fact the
system that people have been using for
cryptography didn't rely on this
matching up to work exactly to still
have a high strength of encryption and
so they published a paper about it and
that's one nice thing about we can have
kids they don't mind asking questions
I'm appreciate that question too
whatever that th er E space what's the
next character I very good
yes space not a muddy in a serrated zine
yeah very good
I used to people getting there quickly
but we've got this type of idea that
some leaders have high information
content something low and so on in one
of the illustrations in the textbook is
you know if you see today I got a ride
to school on a spaceship low probability
high information content okay and for
those of us who are really interested of
course we've got the negative
logarithmic relationship between them I
wouldn't normally get into that with
elementary school kids okay there's a
lot of math and number stuff in there
but there's a lot more to computer
science than there and human-computer
interaction I think is really an
important area that we miss out on and
quite often illustrate this with the
stripper fig from psychology so I'm
gonna put up a word and you just got to
call out what color the word is written
in okay
not the word but the color that it's
written then here we go they're colors
black okay well in New Zealand we call
this black ok just humor me here okay
mix callate glasses off it takes you a
lot easier yeah and so on yeah we can do
it what's this got to do with computers
and there's there's lots of examples
where this comes up but one that every
kids probably come across as if you've
used Microsoft Windows you're looking at
the screen what's written on the button
that you press to stop the computer Dell
yeah okay and you know who thought it
was kind of strange that you press the
stat button to stop the computer and
most then we'll say everyone knows you
press Start to stop the computer and
point out the first thing under start is
to shut down or log off or something
like that and they'd offers to start the
computer and so on
now this that's not a big deal people
got used to it and there's kind of a
cultural thing around it but with almost
any audience you can generally say has
anyone here ever been frustrated by a
computer has anyone even found an error
message that tells them not to do what
they need to do you know that sort of
thing and in fact I'm quite a safe
furnace does anyone ever felt angry at
their computer they can violent thoughts
towards the computer this is my solution
here by the way the stop button and you
cannot you can discuss a bit you know
this new interface would probably
confuse people and sort of thing so
here's a very familiar if not outdated
error message which says you know it's
either this problem or this problem I'm
not going to tell you which one okay
let's have some fun here today but I
will tell you the solution I replace the
disc and what happens if you replace the
floppy disk you get the same error
message
it's like printer not working check the
printer cable and try again the it
result Brenda not working check the
printer and what you find as most people
have learnt to disbelieve here are
messages or as soon as it comes up they
click the okay or the cancel button or
whatever don't even bother reading it
because they're interested and it gets
people thinking about interfaces and
peps the idea that we need to think a
little bit more about the person using
the interface as one of my favorites
yeah cannot delete the file delete some
files and try again okay and actually I
mean you can talk about what actually
might cause that kind of problem taking
it unplugged away from the computer so
here's an illustration this is a road in
New Zealand if you go across to our West
Coast you come across this roundabout or
rotary and what you notice is someone's
put a railway line right through the
middle and it really is a railway line
going right through the middle of it and
when you as you approach the
intersection you notice that there's
actually something like fourteen signs
which really just says that bad design
means you have to have lots of
documentation all right this is my
favorite one this is a road in a rail
bridge sheared it's the road that have
to give way by the way my favorite ones
the sign for the cyclists it's not it's
not all that backward in New Zealand but
we do have our fun bits of road in terms
of activities for kids we've got a thing
with designing doors and figuring out
you know what the affordances are on the
doors and especially what getting across
to kids the idea that the system is the
Machine and the user that you know
rather than a really good system isn't
just a box that goes really well but
it's this thing here the user plus the
machine and therefore you have to
understand this part of the system and
how it works
and maybe we need people who know a
little bit about psychology and
sociology and teamwork and interaction
and all that kind of thing to be
designing the stuff that people are
going to use which is news to a lot of
kids I think actually that's probably
you know I'll just do sorting so one of
the activities were sorting we have
balance scales and a whole lot of
weights that look identical so the only
way you can compare them is by balancing
them and of course that completely
simulates the situation you've got on
the computer with binary comparisons
it's pretty easy to get kids to figure
out selection sort you know try and find
the heaviest one and then put that aside
find the second heaviest one put it
aside
so on but you can even do quicksort you
know just pick a weight at random and
divide them and the smaller ones and the
bigger ones and then recursively deal
with those and we'll talk about bozo
sort which if you haven't come across
that it's basically mixed them all up
and find out if they're sorted and if
they're not mix them all up and try
again and see if they're sorted which of
course has exponential complexity and
well takes a long time especially you've
got one kid trying to do it that way
while someone else is using quicksort
right enough shown you the sorting
Network I think that's probably
everything enough to give you a flavor
of what the things aren't about there's
a whole bunch of activities there and
the goal of the project is just to make
these available for people to use so a
lot of it's on our website there's a
book that's got a much more complete
list and we're just starting off a new
project we're going to have more videos
and get lots of people contributing
ideas for these but we'll only put them
up if they've been tested and we know
that they actually work well it's very
easy to come up with things that don't
quite work and vice versa actually one
of the activities that goes down
incredibly well is when that's the story
liners there's a bunch of pilot pirates
offering a commuting service between
these islands ok as they do and and they
don't publish a map so you go to an
island and you have to say I want to
take ship a or ship B and we actually
have adults post it around the building
or even around the premises and the kids
have to run up to an adult and who's an
island and you say I'll take B and they
say well you have to go over there and
they race over the air and find out
where they go and after a while they
realize they should be drawing a map of
this and then they realize they should
actually be labeling them of A's and B's
so because they get sent back to where
they started and so on and the gobblers
to get to Treasure Island and a beach
Lee they get there and the first one
there wins and all that sort of thing
and then we can start talking about well
what would happen if instead of Islands
and so on I just represent the map with
circles and arrows and suppose that's
the island that you start at and I'm
going to represent Treasure Island over
here with a double circle and we'll
label the map
like that and we can start reasoning
about what would actually get you to the
Treasure Island okay otherwise known as
the exhibiting state and kids don't need
to be too old they do retakes in a while
but they can figure out what it is and
in that begin relates back to the parity
thing right because the exceed well in
this case the Treasure Island means that
there's an error it identifies rows that
have got an error if the A's and B's
that blacks and whites okay but then in
the book we've got things like sentences
that can be constructed by following
around these finite state machines and
another exercise as interfaces so we can
get someone's digital watch with say
three buttons on it and you know that we
take it apart basically so your watch is
showing the time and if you press button
a then probably it'll be showing a
stopwatch whoops and if you press button
a again then maybe it's going to let you
see at the time and if you press button
B here and what happens in and so on and
we put together this finite state
machine that explains the interface on
the watch and generally it's moderately
complicated and it helps them to
understand that the interface isn't just
a bunch of buttons and like you know is
are we gonna use beige buttons today or
green buttons or whatever well we're
gonna put the okay button to the left or
the right of a cancel button but an
actual fact that there's this machine
hidden under the surface that the user
has to try and understand and I've got
some finite state machines of like
microwave ovens and one of a video
recorder now the video recorder has just
got dozens of states and lines going
everywhere and it sort of makes it
obvious why so many people's video
recorders are flashing twelve o'clock
because you know that the sequence you
have to navigate your way through in the
same way that they had to find their way
to Treasure Island okay it's a hidden
finite state machine they had to try and
find their way through it and most
people don't bother reading the map or
the documentation they try and find
their way through it okay so that's
taste of computer science and like
that's the kind of things we're on about
always keen to hear ideas things that
you might have done as illustrations
that worked really well or activities
and also comments anyone that's done
some of these things will try them out
and
people always come off new materials and
new ideas for how to do them and so on
and we want to try and click there to
give it and make it available for
general use so on that note thank you
very much for your time and if you do
want a copy of the book email me and
I'll give you a free one PDFs and
chemists some people making minerals and
so on there are there are especially for
physics and stuff there are books about
there's a whole field called the public
understanding of science and the
journals of the public understanding of
science and so on but computer
scientists seem to be pretty busy sort
of you know doing stuff to write the
some of these things down yeah but there
right yeah and there's also quite a bit
of math stuff to smith websites and
things like that yeah
at what age how young are the kids when
they can sort of start to interact with
this an awesome how young are they when
they can start to interact some of these
activities I've done with like
four-year-olds mainly just so that I can
say I've done it with four-year-olds but
so I've done quicksort with
four-year-olds okay because when you
think about it what's real got a bit of
patience what's required is not that had
if you've got someone who can cope with
a few instructions and but I also use
them like with my university classes
just as a one-minute illustration you
know like maybe at the start or in the
middle or something like that and
especially something like that I can say
I've done this with four-year-olds so
you guys you know should have no problem
with it
the age group that's really important
for us to aim it is like 11 12 13
because that's when they're about to
Boone some bridges like they might
decide that they hate math and they just
going to do well enough to get through
in it and so we want to get them excited
at that age and think yeah that's what I
want to do I'd better get my math strong
that sort of thing
yeah
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
