Sebastian Thrun from the Stanford AI lab
he's going to talk today about winning
the DARPA Grand Challenge what it took
to build a robotic vehicle it would race
across the desert by itself thanks Chris
for your for your short introduction
that's a very much appreciated it's
great to be here among friends see lots
of familiar faces people I started in
born when I was 15 years younger PhD
students visitors it's great
I gave this talk about 18 months ago and
I had together with Mike Maldonado who
is like the key person behind all this
and had we nothing technical to say so
made a lot of fluff and remember the
veteran loved the projector wasn't
working either which was kind of
commenting on my quality of my talk
today have a little more technical stuff
to talk about because we just did
something so I'm gonna share this with
you but before you get into it this is
really the work of a team of people at
Stanford University and Volkswagen more
davydov and so on I'm just the spokes
organ who's taking all the credit and
some of the money but I didn't do much
work so let's see who here has heard
about the grand challenge before it's
one person who hasn't okay there's a
video I have a couple of them with me if
you want some that Nova mate is really
nice summary so I'm going to tell you
the story of the Grand Challenge and
some of the technology went into it and
some of the reasons why we do this in
the next whatever 45 minutes or so so
the US government has had an interest in
unmanned ground vehicles for several
decades reason being that at current
battlefield lots of people die because
for example roadside bombs and so on and
they found that in the order of about
half a billion dollars of research work
at universities and companies over the
last couple of decades on this topic and
somewhat cynical if you look at what
they get out of it because you know how
defense contractors work they're the
opposite of Google they got
relatively brittle systems that would
require often multiple interventions per
kilometer driven and they would often
offer trained go as fast as ten miles
per hour but not faster so they wouldn't
be the operational so doc I decided to
construct the complete new funding model
which is double the speed no human
intervention whatsoever and no funding
so without funding since the funding
approach didn't quite get us there so
they created the DARPA Grand Challenge
originally in 2004 in March was the
first race went from originally from Los
Angeles to Vegas but then they figured
out there's too many kids in Los Angeles
he can't do racing over here so it
started in Barstow it's the place where
a Kill Bill 2 when uma Thurman get out
of the grave you know that's that's
their and premise like the first casino
behind the border for people who can't
afford a few to go to Vegas so it's
really kind of a interesting countryside
and they picked the route right north of
i-15 which is a powerline sport road and
here's some pictures that they posted
before the race the idea was to build a
robot they can go by itself you'd give a
GPS breadcrumbs about 2007 all of those
that define the route but they define oh
we've only very inaccurately so as you
go you have to basically make lots of
steering decisions and velocity
decisions there's no person involved the
machine is to run by itself so the
moment the way starts you as the
designer go back to a tent have a beer
or whatever and the board has to do
everything by itself so it's somewhat
unprecedented in that in the history of
robotic driving there's never been a
vehicle going 100 in this case 142 miles
by itself so that's what's the challenge
first
this video the table for a second from
history is it kind of a feel for what
Thai people showed up ladies and
gentlemen
sandstorm was anybody here the first
French challenge physically there you
found a mix of research universities
like Carnegie Mellon who's a big player
companies mostly defense companies so
willing to make sure that their work is
being acknowledged and a good number of
people this referred to as maybe a car
nuts people who had no clue about
robotics or building large-scale systems
or figures they have a computer in the
car drive in Silicon Valley this is a
defense contractor that that only finds
in the parking lot when they had a
clippo problem see this car flipped
right over here so they type of shot of
the video Mac's defense contractor
30,000 pounds they they had a bit of a
backup problems they backed up more than
they went forward and then the the small
is anybody here who studied at cow okay
if you're from Kerala you want to leave
at some point do any pockets fine Cal
had the smallest entry Anthony Lebowski
so Anthony I have no respect for him and
I can tell you later how cool this to be
the motorcycle but I asked him after the
race
what's Yoko for next year he said I'm
gonna double my performance which most
shareholders are excited about so the
quencher finished it is not a serious
talk
finished at my 7.3 and many of the
journalists said it was a complete
failure because there was only 5% into
the course but DARPA had put the hardest
stuff up front and and some very serious
mountainous terrain Carnegie Mellon with
the best performing vehicle went all the
way there
basically if blindly followed the GPS
points got about a one and a half meter
error in GPS then drove onto this Ridge
over here got high centered burn up a
rubber tire and that was the end of ice
and it actually was over before most of
us woke up that morning California so in
2004 we had a hundred six teams
competing and in 2005 and we in Stanford
decided to join we had 195 teams just a
little comparison here of which Stanford
is over the assembler it's misspelled
with the D that is something about the
average typing skills certain agencies
so we we had about a year roughly maybe
a little more than a year to put
together a car they could drive itself
and we started thinking well can't be
that hard I mean we drive cars all the
time and then as we started getting into
it we realized it was certain
difficulties that we had to overcome so
I'll tell you about those
so this is our timeline and I start at
the very beginning right over here
somewhere so in the very beginning we
had a dedication to build a team and
Mike Motomura was my postdoc was the
kind of lean internal team leader with a
couple of grad students and did most of
the software stuff but we had no no
vehicle and no money and nothing and no
so we had to find a way to finance
internal team on a crazy idea so the
very first thing to do the college
professors when you don't have money to
hire people you teach a class and you
give the students course credit right so
they paid tuition to take your class and
you teach your class you recoup your
salary and give them an A or a B order
so we created the course topper Grand
Challenge which was a poetry course
without a syllabus without any materials
it's just one thing okay we're gonna be
twenty students and by December 1st we
have a car that's gonna drive itself one
mile to the Mojave Desert yeah
and students sign up for tea came for
the first class and 20 for the second
kind of a exponential decay and they
stayed on B then gotten in touch with
Volkswagen to give us a car so they gave
us a tour ik in fact they gave us a
number of those over the time so he's
one of the students David statements who
was a key player in the car and very
first thing we did is equipping the car
with the type instrumentation that he
usually use for these kind of projects
everybody who does autonomous navigation
in the air on the sea eclipse robots
with inertial guidance systems which are
nothing else but a pairing of a GPS
receiver it tells you roughly where you
are and an inertial measurement unit
that measures accelerations and
rotational velocities so you can make
interpolations between different
measurements of GPS gives you roughly a
feel for where you are and this is
actually sending you we work with
various people on then we started
devising a very simple control mechanism
to get to the state where the previous
grand challenge field had been and the
most basic question is supposed to give
them a route defined by GPS breadcrumbs
by DARPA and you care about controlling
the vehicle so it stays on the route how
you turn your wheels right so it's like
a one-dimensional decision every driver
makes all the time
a very simple controller that actually
we used until the race day was designed
by a fellow named Gabe Hoffman which
goes as follows if you're on the
reference trajectory then make your
front tires parallel to the reference
trajectory then you stay on it but if
you get off it then measure your
crosstrack error and steer in proportion
to that crosstrack error so you can see
the wheels being slightly turned in
because we have a certain amount of
crosstrack error that makes you go back
to the course okay
if you do that you get a bit of a drunk
squirrel because you start oscillating
left and right and for those you have a
control background need to PID control
differ
for dampening an integral term for drift
and so on but essentially that's the
picture okay so you put this together
and we tested this in early November in
Arizona on what book song has a big
proving ground there and this is
basically driving blindly after GPS
points kind of the same that that most
of the competitors in the previous year
had achieved and you can see it's going
25 miles per hour relatively fast the
steering wheel is relatively calm bit of
oscillation still to be able to trace
these points really really well so we
basically reached the level of 2004 in
this class and about five weeks and
Stanford students are amazing as you I'm
sure you all know and then we had to
worry about collision avoidance and then
things became much more interesting so
we put lasers on the roof for those of
you who don't know lasers work here's a
little animation so a laser beam goes
into a rotating mirror that gets
directed into the environment and to a
cleaner area
the laser light goes out it's being
reflected by objects being received by
the sensor we can measure the time of
flight and thereby deduce the distance
if you like that animation was all
stolen from this video over here
okay without permission and then you do
motion planning motion planning could be
as simple as the following which was
Mike Monta Ellis brainchild basically
you try to follow a road you can go
straight but if he goes straight you
might hit an obstacle that your laser
sees and then you couldn't over time
gradually vary the lateral offset to
your reference trajectory for example
you can say I want it over here I want
to be driving medium more to the left
side and then you can look at these
projections roll them out and evaluate
them to the extent of which there
violates safety constraints or maybe
corridor constraints you have a corridor
in which you have to stay and if you do
this at different speeds you can look at
fast verbs or slow nudges and get a
sense as to how to move and essentially
what Stanley did is is that so here's
our first test it's not exactly desert
it's more like a parking garage at
Stanford but that's the best we could
afford so here's a really evil there's
an obstacle will pop up in map as little
dots another one
and still within the class he actually
had a little system that could sense his
things and drive around them and not
even a very elegant fashion but in an
effective fashion so he took that to the
desert here's my class in Barstow
California insane but first and we did
our test and the test was a bit of a
disappointment we managed to get our won
by driving in fact we drove eight point
five miles about one mile further than
Carnegie Mellon a driven which of course
we kept talking about through our
various friends in the field but a mile
later just after Carnegie Mellon failed
we failed as well so we didn't get very
far and the car because of the many many
different obstacles that pushed along
this is what kind of in old Fayette so
we'd love to show this video you know as
look that's exactly where they burned up
their rubber tire wheels are respectful
caring emergency but we felt failed back
there
if you don't show but the many obstacles
in the desert push the car around a lot
and it was really hard to go fast you
could only go in like eight miles power
and kind of get gone much faster than us
to snow for a sweet but we had something
together which was the first end-to-end
system within two months and we could
now go and critique it and improve it so
the idea was from that point on we would
only pick modules it wouldn't quite work
like pretty much everything and then we
placed him by a better module so that
eventually we had a good driving car so
the next thing we did is we actually got
to get a real team and these are the
people who actually did the work Mike
was the software chief the people
Volkswagen and Cedric mordabito is a
local venture capital firm that gave us
money we told them they have no return
of investment they didn't mind
and then we had a computer vision team
and we had a cannon optimization team
and so on he's all
Stanford students mostly and some alumni
and so on a lot of fun strong to get
about 60 people to do this and you got
sponsors right so Android is one
responses they provide all kinds of
stuff like software vehicles karma
caffeine what-have-you and we came up
with an architecture this is the most
boring slide I have but it summarizes
all of Stanley's architecture
goes from sensors to perceptual models
to do state estimation to planning and
control modules that control the vehicle
and then to an interface in this a
pipelined in real-time through the
system and about three and a millisecond
delay from left to right in fact for
those of you who who have an AI
background and were engraved in the
artificial intelligence debate as to
what the right cognitive architecture is
rod Brooks in the 90s came up with this
subsumption thing how to organize robots
and and curse the traditional approach
but we are completing the traditional
corner so you be entirely back in the
80s and availability systems but in
April we had the team together we
started improving our software modules
and we had to face our first big hurdle
which was a site visit the Opera had 195
submissions entries and they wanted to
find the the 40 good ones that they
would then further support all the way
into the race so we had to submit a
video this is our video and again before
the place for Carnegie Mellon failed
just by a coincidence and we weren't the
only one so I'm kind of a man I had a
really strong team they actually ever
really smart they read the rules and
realized the connection submit to
because not just money you could double
your chances so they actually put in a
second car which we didn't raise her but
the civil armies faced on their hammer
was thought to be a Vedic storyline
right by Wow for the coffee active and
submitted their entries and they pass
with flying colors and just to give a
kind of a feel for what type companies
and what type individuals but is where
they have two more videos I want to show
you the first one these were like Karnas
so some some people clearly I'd like one
thing they were really good at like
maybe building a track vehicle and then
saw the challenge come along and they
didn't think of it as a software
challenge and nothing to be notice just
be the fastest in going from 1 to 65
miles power that's enough software
doesn't really matter and they had the
and then the next one is the
most-watched video I've been told some
government he was sought every evening
who's gonna play the beginning it's on
the web so you can tell
they were the only team that brought an
inflatable palm tree to the race with
really cool we weren't quite as humorous
I guess we're just engineers but this
axiom it's coming out of I think
Louisiana or something if you go on Team
X and you can buy calendars with these
girls these girls were in Fear Factor
before they
the twins so this is the first time you
hit the car without a driver inside this
was the site visit DARPA had given us a
very short course 20 meters in place and
evil desert obstacle also known as trash
bin and week I had to drive around it
and it never was really elegant in doing
it it was very short-sighted but it was
very effective I tell you later on why
this is the case in fact if you look for
me from the overhead this is a map of
the vehicle builds because I'll tell you
more about in a few in second wide means
drivable black is unknown red are the
little traffic cones over here and you
can see the car kind of projecting in
steering direction and over here you're
gonna see the evil trash thing coming up
of course the car doesn't and you can
see the Syrian direction good no one's
in the car
okay so that left two forty-three
semi-finalists which stem Park was one
so we achieved our goal and so was
Carnegie Mellon and Carnegie Mellon up
here called red team after their team
leader I read bit ago
and then we went into a phase where we
really try to him out all the bus so the
goal was to build a system that could
run hundreds of miles without
intervention so we at the time we could
do about a mile and then we had to
intervene and we had to go to at least
five hundred miles without intervention
and it will be tricky because desert is
actually complex and is very alive -
there's lots of rabbits and birds and so
on that we killed a long way so we did a
lot of testing the scoring hang out in
Barstow at 125 degrees in the summer
rosemarie respect their husbands on the
trips driving of all kinds of terrain
and to be a little more technical I'm
going to show you the typical stuff that
would happen people drive in a car and
the car would do just fine we also ended
up sharing not paying attention and all
of a sudden even difficult terrain like
this it will go crazy out of no apparent
reason and drive maybe into a ditch or a
berm or down a cliff or something so we
would not be able to catch it and the
cow it can be rescued what happened is
event the dog has interesting data
processing problem where the car in
attempt to model the environment would
model a road just fine as shown over
here and all of a sudden you get these
massive obstacles that are completely
faking the car just drives off the road
and kills us all and even though
Stepford has a steady supply of great
students we can you can sacrifice them
also so let me tell you a bit more
technical what's under the hood and tell
you about three different innovations we
made or three different ings we've
worked on doing this race - laser
interpretation so I told you about the
laser going out and scanning the
environment as you scan the environment
at any point in time you get a scanline
but seventy times a second and you can
assemble them into a 3d model using your
GPS inertial post estimation
knowing very r60 informations XYZ is
also your your you are and rollin pitch
angle of the vehicle as you do this you
get these point clouds there's four of
them here one for each laser eye one
blue one a yellow bonnet green one red
and now you have to interpret the data
and ask where's the road like there's a
big mountain over here there's a big
digit over here and so on the way
Stanley does is this AC uses a scanning
laser to build a 3d model and that's
inference over the 3d models so here's
our laser going forward scanning the
vote if there's a big pole in the way
the pole is being scanned vertically and
if you start comparing the bottom point
to the top point over here then you
realize there's a Z elevation difference
and that constitutes an obstacle no more
or less than that it's very very simple
logic okay so something vertical could
be I mean standing was very environment
friendly like since the tumbleweed would
drive around in time and we'd anything
would just drive around it's an insect
flying up if we're traveling insect
never mind but ever the logic now the
problem was if the vehicle pitches then
the scanline goes in reverse order of
the driving so you might go forward but
the scanline goes backwards because the
vehicle touches down and as a result the
train gets scanned twice and sometimes
the scanning is consistent so when
you're pitch estimation is really
accurate you might get these moments
over here like this one over here where
the CRO is not large but sometimes if
you pitch estimate is very inaccurate
when you're when you're vehicle pictures
a lot for example you get you project
out where the scan point is so even a
quarter degree error in your pitch angle
has a huge effect on where you think
that point is so you have to be really
really certain about the picture which
is way beyond what the vehicle do so
here's an extreme case of extreme
pitching
this is the resulting trace of one of
the lasers on the ground and you can see
this is a flat terrain but if you
compare this point to this point just
because of your pitch angle error you
think there's an obstacle okay so there
was a bit of a bummer because every
couple of miles the car which is
complete without motivation pitch a
little bit and then go off the boat and
then picture a little bit so you'll
really go to making a video that looked
great but we couldn't be dry it at least
not the Grand Challenge so this very
first probabilities came in which of
course you know more about probabilities
in me but the classical way to look at
the data is just taking rock solid and
say they are correct right so you have a
sequence of poses in this kind of little
Markov model and you have their being
fed by your notional system and then you
extrapolate by the points are in the
physical world and then you can compare
two of these points for example and ask
yourself for Tunis by measurement points
do they have an elevation difference of
15 centimeters but in reality these are
erroneous so the truth is there's error
between these post estimates over here
there's error between these for system
is over here and over here so what do
you really got to write down is a
probabilistic formula that says you know
given all this error over here what's
the probability that these two points
are really in vertical alignment of 15
centimeters and then you only accept
your obstacle if that probability
exceeds a certain threshold so you be
really confident this is 95 percent
confident if there's an obstacle now the
problem with there was that now we had
this video complex probabilistic model
that we had to kind of feed and populate
and no manufacturer ever tells you what
the actual error of the units is so you
have to guess it so how do you guess
what errors you have in a unit to get
this test right well you could sit down
and measure it which is almost
impossible so we decided to do something
completely different we said we can do
this in a day by using discriminative
machine learning now how does this work
so the similar machine learning in this
case works the following way and it's
not very sophisticated if your error
model is correct then it's going to
label flat terrain is flat and non
Fletcher and is non flat okay now
how can we train a machine not a model
to do this well let's leave a train how
to belabor train well you can have a
grad student sit there and label every
pixel and say this as an obstacle is not
or you could just drive somewhere
declare what you driven over is flat
because it chose to drive there and then
kind of falsely assume that the side
stripes of a year non flat because
there's lots of bushes isn't quite
correct but good enough and then you can
tune your parameters inside the model so
that they minimize the number of pixels
here that are labeled drivable and
maximize the number of pixels over here
labeled as non drivable and it's just
the discriminative machine learning I
would research in the space of your
Markov chain parameters bla bla bla bla
bla to find the optimal error model so
you basically you learn the Markov chain
use indiscriminate loading and the
results were actually quite amazing so
it might look insignificant for you but
for me was a big day you can see over
here fake obstacles this is a
side-by-side before and after and over
here no fake obstacles but with this
error model in place for the
probabilistic test for occupancy you
know machine learning routine of a
couple of minutes of training we were
able to basically eliminate all false
positives there's one over here that's
missing over there without affecting the
for the the the correct positive rate in
some datasets we went down from like
12.6% false positives all the way to
like one and fifty thousand some a
sudden we could actually send strain and
was surprising I mean I published books
and probably sieve robotics and I've
forgotten all about this when I built
this car and then we realized well
probably is actually your friend so they
kind of come in again
the next thing came up because the
lasers don't look very far they only
looked like twenty meters distance and
we wanted to drive really fast and the
drive really fast like thirty five miles
power was all set go we had to look
further they couldn't stop in time
before the laser called an obstacle we
measured that so this is a distribution
of speed limits in the original Grand
Challenge and you can see it goes all
the way to 60 but if you go to 35 miles
power you have most speed limits cause
these are DARPA dictated speed limits so
we get something else use a camera to
find roads and you think that a camera
of course can see all the way to the
horizon so the question then becomes how
do you extract from a camera image of
where the road is now after 50 years of
AI research there got to be a piece of
software that finds your role in the
camera image right hey I just turned 50
this year we should be able to do it
turns out it's not easy there's no paper
that I know of that can find you all the
board and all camera images okay now we
started something simple said maybe
roads see is a bit of diversity of roads
just give you a feel for this all from
the original Grand Challenge course in
2004 we started saying maybe roads are
brownish okay so take a region of the
color spectrum I call it Road right but
of course you know then you drive of a
paved road that's black and doesn't work
right well you fight over stuff like
this over here and then we said maybe
him maybe the role is to smooth this
thing in the image make the less
smoothness the less you won't drive on
it right so the smooth at is the better
for you to drive yeah the smoothest
thing in the image is the sky
fortunately so
it's kind of a bummer and then Henrique
da camp and a couple of folks from Inter
came up with the decisive idea which is
we don't have to solve all of our
fighting we just have to solve some of
our fighting which is given maybe know
how world looks here
maybe we can detect wrote over there by
that I mean the following you very had a
laser system in place it was perfectly
capable of finding roads but too late
they could find votes right in front of
the car but not further out but you
could extract from this little video
here from the laser system we might be
able to extract samples of how the world
looks right now this is a laser system
it doesn't look very far you could
extract the region that's drivable and
use all these pixels over here as
training examples for a mixture of
gaussian and then apply that mixture
goes to the entire image in the hopes of
finding the ball all the way to the
horizon and that's the typically result
here of a mixture of gaussian we are red
means drivable and you guess blue means
unknown and all of a sudden we could
bootstrap our perceptual range from the
short laser range using this little
machine learning trick all the way to
the horizon and there was a big day too
because all of a sudden you could drive
faster you could see stuff in longer
distance it's not perfect like if the
road changes its color then for a moment
you'd think wow there's something else
but then you just slow down so the laser
can catch the obstacle and it's fine so
here's a typical example it's from the
early versions and this just shows as
you take the straight road over here and
do the trick the laser goes about 20
meters out this cars driving down the
dark red stuff is laser but the vision
goes all the way to 60 meters out so all
of a sudden we could see much much
further it could detect obstacles much
earlier so that gave us the speed I'm
going to show you a video of the
adaptation in action this is taken from
the it's called the qualification event
where the vehicle had to go from
pavement to grass and you can see as it
goes into the grass the first time it
doesn't quite know about this so it says
not drivable but as soon as it gets onto
the grass the laser catches the vision
of the grass the vehicle adapts to it
and is able to then find grass very
reliable so here's another transition
going on these of course obstacles their
flag correctly here's another one this
is a difficult section with hay bales
you can see the adaptation going on and
so on and it was able to drive quite
reliably so some of the results that we
got with the adaptive vision was really
amazing
if you may I teach computer vision at
Stanford and I tell the students vision
doesn't work it's really hard to make
work but this video adapter all the time
for lighting conditions and Road colors
so the Sun was down on the rise and it
will just have a different model and so
on and it worked if she quite amazed me
well the last thing we did is after we
were able to do 35 miles power this very
short the problem we went to is the
league was too fast it was way too fast
so if we go into 280 and drive 30 miles
per hour
that feels slow but if you go into a
very treacherous mountain pass with a
big cliff on one side and a mountain on
the other side going that speed makes
you feel you're you're crazy so we had
to find a way to make the video go
slower specifically what happened is
record a rough terrain like big ruts or
so like washouts from the rain and it
would just go exactly the same speed
just like a robot as it done in nice and
benign terrain so we had to find a way
to make it slow down and to cut a long
story short we we worked on adaptive
mechanisms for speed control before I
show you those let me one last time
highlight what our competitors did at
this wonderful place in Pittsburgh they
used to work for years they actually
recognized this problem and had a team
of four all editors because one
management station of like 24 people in
a trailer that would go through every
inch of terrain and label it and tell it
exactly what speed should go based on
aerial image they collected and they had
a vehicle in the desert for months on
end to get lots of ground data and and
they succeeded in labeling it but but he
didn't have the manpower to do this and
we didn't feel that we wanted to to
really hand label all of this so what we
did is we used again machine learning
being excited now about machine learning
where the bshorts telling how fast to
drive by just driving a stretch in the
mountains okay and that was me driving
so the car got like a distinct German
style of driving in the end
and then build a controller this is the
same figure it's hard to see the yellow
stuff is human driving the pink stuff is
robot driving the controller kind of
copy that and the parameters of
controllers was it was monitoring the
amount of shock that the Vega got the
steepness of terrain and the the
narrowness and it would then slow itself
down to meet certain guideline
parameters and after they received a
shock if we then slowly forget and get
fast and fast again until I got a
neutral oh and it got faster again
neutral fast again a new shock and so on
wasn't quite human driving I mean
typically human story before right this
would kind of slow no after the right
but still like rats coming groups and so
on whatever so with that we had an
assistant together in September where we
did that was in hundreds of miles of
testing in fact there was a constant
balance between spending more time in
Arizona testing and making sure we going
to don't get a divorce at home you know
if I have still recognizes when we came
back home or we would fly them in and
they would hang up with us in Arizona
and the car was actually quite competent
it was not elegant so the steering was
usually a bit later than people would do
it but we could drive hundreds of miles
without any problem whatsoever
we did a tune of my run on Monday and we
could average speeds about 22 miles per
hour roughly which in the desert trust
me is a lot so if you put if you if you
put yourself in the car 22 miles is a
lot fact as Michael was observed it's
illegal to drive drunk but it's
completely illegal to to program your
car when you're drunk
and then we driven by it so this is kind
of fun videos Carnegie Mellon was a very
serious competitor and by all means they
have won just the way same way we wanted
Stanford and a comment was later on but
they did fantastic with it if it desert
but they have a lot of industrial
wasteland in Pittsburgh so they practice
their berkeley my friends from berkeley
practice their motorcycle did a new one
and they didn't quite get the
no I mean I surely this videos I got a
comment that I have an enormous respect
for the people in Berkeley and Anthony
Levin dusky in particular in that if you
control a car and you want to you know
steer it all you do is you drag around
get stir great that's turning right so
if you do this on a motorcycle it's
Chris knows if you just drag around your
steering wheel you fall right because it
was balanced so what you do is you steal
the opposite direction you start falling
and then you catch your fall that's the
way you turn a motorcycle so workman's
out on the control set but if you find
the achievement but they had these are
all videos in the rep you can now know
that they had a lot of lot of fun doing
this and they were the when the only
ones practicing this maneuver kind of
give back to the same maneuver just
before the race and and we had also our
problems so we had a day when we came
into the Mojave Desert after a major
rainfall and the road was basically
turned to a lake and just by driving
over that water I would splash up and he
couldn't see anything and the only thing
he could see something where the lasers
on the roof that were making all the
decisions so we're sitting inside there
realizing if there's a mistake in the
software right now he won't even be able
to see it before we die this may be the
only moment where you could really say
that you know that the the the robot was
better than human drive-ins just for
this very short moment and clearly the
humans were insane to accept that well
come race time just to finish up here
the race itself took place in Fontana
Speedway and then in in prim and Nevada
Fontana was an event to basically select
the final 20 20 last finalists so we
came in our blue t-shirts via blue
because Carnegie Mellon take red as a
color so we couldn't take that anymore
she looked like Berkeley guys we had two
cars we had a full support of Volkswagen
America and so on the Opera had made up
a course that was about 2.2 miles long
on the speedway there are all kinds of
challenges our show you in a sec here
they kind of resemble the challenges
you'd find in the desert it wasn't
really desert racing but you could claim
if a car wouldn't be able to make that
course then it wouldn't be able to
succeed in the Grand Challenge so they
had a narrow gate that resembled one of
the gates on the course very narrower
which
already half the teams couldn't
negotiate that first gate turned out and
then they had an abandoned car over here
there could be another robot sitting
there while you're passing it maybe a
disabled robot and so on they had a big
open high-speed section where you could
go as fast as he wanted up to 50 miles
per hour sustained Lee is going about 38
here that's the place for accounting he
was consistently faster than us he were
somewhat more conservative on the speed
side and then the most difficult
obstacle was actually a tunnel that they
put up that emulated in underpass under
i-15 turns out the crossed i-15 but he
couldn't go over a real highway and they
couldn't shut down the highway so they
made us go through these really narrow
under passes the problem with the
underpass is you lose GPS cover so you
lose track of where you are you have to
locally navigate so that can kill you
because you lose nonsense where you are
but can also kill you it's the moment
you emerge from the tunnel where you
regain DPS and then you realize you're
somewhere else and if you don't very
carefully integrate your data your map
will look very very funny afterwards so
this was the underpass this is an
emulation of a power pole they wanted to
test that he can go around a powerful
because on the race course was the power
support for half of Los Angeles and Tara
had this fear that we might just knock
off one of those and and Los Angeles
will be dark and that would be famous
for that so we had to test that and of
course I've been fine just to give you a
feel for how difficult it was this is
just some random video from the web that
nova recorded this is the local team dad
which did actually very fine on the race
but in the beginning they had some
difficulties with the hay bales and the
dug their own nest was pretty much it
then a fantastic laser scan on the roof
they be using now these are motorcycle
again and eco PFF amazing they got the
control worked out but not the
perception result
this is our the most amazing woman's I
did raise from the dead
illustrator bravely for fun
now some people had an interesting
solution to the GPS from like these guys
when they ran out of GPS when to full
throttle so in the channel they
accelerate to 60 miles per hour and they
almost I mean we had to get an ambulance
for the cutting now in person sitting
there this is one of the very few videos
that I have that Carnegie Mellon does
something foolish going over hey bb-8 so
we had an argument on this not not us
but can email it the sensors are miss
calibrating the fixes afterwards the
robber went just fine but in the
beginning had this problem and and and
the judges said you know that you're
gonna lose points for this and red said
no aha I can take hey girls don't see
the problem and then there were lots and
lots of different teams that just didn't
make the first gate you know well they
made the first gate but didn't make the
second run into a car guys and you might
laugh but it just shows how hard it is
60 bit systems to do this this is a
moment where two unmanned vehicles on
the course and so on stuck in the
rearranging the hay bales what this is
interesting team so they had a about 20
laser scanners up there a university
that couldn't quite decide how to
organise the software so every student
get one laser and one laptop in the
trunk and in the end they all plug the
laptops together and they took a
majority vote on trial
the race itself which getting hidden
with series here unfolded knocked away
and it was a big day for so here's Mike
our chief software guy a mechanic from
Germany and one of the chief Volkswagen
people we got the race course on a CD
yeah we had some cow problems - we got
the race course at for a for the morning
and we had exactly two hours to process
it so Carnegie man would go into the
trailer and do their hand labeling in
added thousands of waypoints which has
basically smooth the course using a
least-squares smoother and then look at
the data months define well it looks
fine plug it into the robot and then
talk to journalists get some coffee and
so on and then at 6:30 when the Sun
started rising the race began we were
seated second after Carnegie Mellon
Cunningham ended beaten us on speed and
there in the pre runs and cutting min
was a third they had two cars in the
race and this is the video of the race
of parts of it from this Nova movie here
and it's video a video that still to the
present day provoked some emotions for
me because after after working a whole
year on this car and spending so much
time inside the car this was the first
time the carbon by itself you know you
see it sitting there empty in the
morning you trained it everything you
know about driving at least you think
and now it has to stand his own man also
on its own car makes little mistake in
the beginning and the nudge that was
wrong
but then confidently goes off by itself
and within like 30 seconds you lose
sight of your car and it just disappears
it's kind of a bizarre feeling I mean I
can't I mean you know that's all young
people when I give this talk to older
folks I often compared to raising your
college kid like raising a child make it
really perfect and someday it's gonna go
into college different city and you have
to trust it too doesn't make the right
decision and come back without dents and
scratches or whatever or not pregnant
whatever whatever can happen we call it
it's kind of the same thing you try to
optimize this car and we anticipate
every contingency and now it's on its
own right so and it made a couple of
stupid mistakes in the race but it
survived so this is all footage that we
didn't get but the helicopter collected
from Nova which made a documentary
so you can see Stanley driving by itself
without a person inside lots of
advertisement of course we were actually
quite lucky there were about three teams
that right quickly took off Carnegie
Mellon on us at about the same speed if
every were slightly slower than Carnegie
Mellon's fast vehicle we just saw this
one over here because the website and
somewhere over here
Carnegie developed an engine problem
with a fast vehicle and it slipped
slipped down backwards a hill and never
became really fast again it allowed us
to pass it later on this is Karthik
Karthik failed at a very sensational
moment little GPS glitch team dad had
gotten stuck behind a rock the year
before and not enough floral so this
anybody terma to give as much as well as
I possibly could I mean they were stuck
so they did team Ensco is another one
they actually had a laptop come loose
and lost all of perception in my attempt
but went all the way to my ninety this
is the case when cutting me Allen got
stuck and Stanley just right behind it
closing the gap of originally five
minutes difference in the starting time
so Stanley is kind of informally taking
the lead here and it was a complete act
of randomness that Stanley actually won
it was really a failure of Carnegie
Mellon's engine that made us win and no
more no less than that so we were for a
while chasing Carnegie Mellon and at
Mile hundred three a really important
moment for us
the organizers paused Carnegie Mellon
and let us pass it the way it worked is
when you're being paused it wouldn't
count again time wouldn't count against
you you just you save the time but that
way a passing vehicle just past the
static obstacle not a dynamic obstacle
so this video from our car looking at
that which we got later and we were just
in the tent sitting there and all of a
sudden the voice came ladies and
gentlemen
Stanley has just passed Highlander and
you can imagine like what effect this
had on us and on other people the last
obstacle was in stretchers mountain
paths over here which only five vehicles
reached Stanley was the first to go down
and you can see it's very dangerous
there's a big cliff over here it's
fortuna' feet low it's harder than the
first year's mountain pass even though
the entire course was was easier than
the first year and Stanley has to make
life-or-death decisions I guess
and it to basically control its speed to
not get too fast and avoid the berm and
do this for a couple of miles this is
the DARPA chase figure that just
observes it and can stop it and then
when that happened we all knew there was
a chance for Cindy she come back which
was amazing so you all lined up over
there in the finishing line and at some
point you saw a distance a helicopter
and then it's our little dust cloud and
then you saw a little blue dot and all
of a sudden you realize wow your car is
coming back after 130 miles was
completely unbelievable and mind-blowing
and our car was first to come back which
was even better so here's sandy going to
the finishing line this summer over
there celebrating this really historical
moment I think for all of us in robotics
this I'm going to comment on a little
bit later on what it really means for me
to have been involved and but this is
just a little video that that shows our
adaptive vision in action and this is
the only man-made obstacle we encounter
it happens to be cutting around scar
which is pause so we could we can check
whether the video she works and we
actually catch it you can see it's being
classified as non drivable which the
hammer is and I think AMG discontinued
the h1 production sins you can see the
shadow over here in the map and so on
just for amusement but the interesting
thing is and I mean it's very seriously
if you look at this chart five teams
finished for within about half an hour
of each other and the the all of these
are equal winners it means good to have
the check the money and the fame but
technically these differences of eleven
minutes are competing in significant and
it was completely random luck with the
drug or driving right at the speed limit
some had an entry problems some didn't
and that made the final decision so it's
really an amazing achievement for the
robotics field for which people said
seriously this is absolutely impossible
and you get five cars finishing now the
Opera is began to realize there's a new
technology in the make that saying she
has some hope for society and created
what's called the urban challenge
they're not going to say anything about
it you can read up on the web it's
basically a challenge that deals with
the city then you have to drive from
point A to B to C and you encounter
other cars along the way and you have to
interact with other traffic and the
limit states one of the shortcomings
we're in the Grand Challenge which is
there was no traffic so this is via test
in traffic so DARPA has announced what
city this it might be Mountain View
might be Palo Alto hopefully it's gonna
be some old military base maybe but on
November 3rd 2007
together with Google you're going to be
competing and hopefully finishing yes
my interpretation is there's gonna be
two types of traffic one is other robots
and the second one is military vehicles
but if it's military vehicles gonna be
tanks so that if you little toerag
runs into a tank the tank won't even
notice right so you have to worry about
traffic detection and so on let me spend
the last two slides on the big picture
why we actually do this I mean it's fun
to get engaged in the competition but
there's a much broader picture behind
all of this I told you the military
perspective and there's a good amount of
utility to this given the number of
people we lose for example to roadside
bombs in Iraq these days but what what
drives me more than that even so is the
societal perspective and what we can do
to humankind with self-driving cars and
people sometimes don't quite realizes
cars are deadly instruments we can about
42,000 people every year and States
because of traffic accidents 90% of
those are caused by human error
okay so just in proportion it's about 15
times as many people as September 11 and
it's about as many people every year
it's all of Vietnam War for United
States okay so every year we lose in
Vietnam or again again and again and
again and if you don't look into this
there's many other dimensions in which
this can technology can help people
commuting is another one right so we in
the Bay Area know about this the Beltway
Chicago Los Angeles people spent on
average I think 1.25 hours per day
commuting in the car and that takes away
whatever 10% of the work time so if we
could free that time or people could
still sleep they could work they could
do email I guess we do even learning
about driving but they could do more
productive things they could actually
make people's lives any more productive
which i think would be a great effect on
society and there's many more dimensions
in which you can turn this and spin this
I talked about saving lives and saving
money making people more productive
here's the last one I want to really
talk about I guess that's obvious aging
population people who can't drive right
now drunk people out people people with
disabilities blind people children and
someone could possibly Drive this is an
interesting one highway throughput if
you look at the nation's highway systems
its many places beyond cap
like specifically in the bay area in Los
Angeles and so on there's almost no new
construction of highway infrastructure
because people live there you can take
their property away so almost all the
money goes into mass transit that is
being invested yet less than 1% of us
use mass transit as a way to get to work
so if you take a picture of a busy
highway at peak capacity when it
performs the best which is the vehicle
about 45 to 55 miles power and in the
picture you count the number of pixels
that are taken by car whereas those are
still free only about 8 to 10 percent is
actually taken by cars and 90 percent is
still free why because we allow the
drivers who maybe can't be control of
vehicle very well there's space in front
of us and on the sides right so what if
you could increase is to say 16 percent
by a self-guided car you've doubled the
capacity of the US highway system you
did something it otherwise would would
require trillions of dollars investments
to reach and for which we have no
current plan
there's no almost no new constructions
country and there's a steady increase of
3% per year of high values which means
20 years from now it's gonna be even
more disastrous than it is today so it's
certainly a vision that I think this
technology embraces that that we should
all care about these are the type things
that we really pursue as motivating
factors at Steff of you now completely
deeply engraved in getting the next
Grand Challenge it's gonna be hard to do
it it's harder than the previous ones
could be driving in traffic if you see a
funny turret coming to Mountain View
that acts like a drunk scroll stay away
that's us and visit us on the number
Thirds when we hopefully do a good job
in the expansions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
