director and research organization at
Google and I'm delighted to welcome
Indra rawa Omar and Anna for students
from the Oakland International high
school and their technology teachers
shall cherish and the school principal
karmann ghia reyes i heard about this
school about a year and a half ago or so
while watching a program on television
and decided to go visit them because it
seems so unique and have been really
impressed with the work that they do so
on the basis of that we asked them to
come here and actually talk about their
school and their experiences I'll do a
little bit of a high-level overview of
the school and then invite carmelita to
actually talk about it in more detail
and introduce and students so Oakland
International high school is a first
public school of its kind in California
unique in that one hundred percent of
its students are immigrants and over
ninety percent qualify for a free or
reduced-price lunch of the 320 students
served by OHS nearly one-third hold
refugee status and many more have had
interruptions in the formal education
having escaped ethnic conflicts and
severe poverty in places like Liberia
and Nepal and Burma only six percent of
English language learners in Oakland in
2008 by eligible for admission into the
University of California system at the
time of graduation and this year as IHS
prepares to graduate its first class of
students at least sixty percent of the
seniors are eligible for admission to
the UC system and due to the great work
done by the OHS staff the students are
able to overcome the tremendous
obstacles in their lives and graduate
high school to pursue college education
and the teachers hold top tier degrees
and I've really been impressed with the
dedication that they show to the welfare
of the students and to see them succeed
I'd like also to add that we have
different programs that we're trying to
do with the school and if any of you who
are engineers are interested in
volunteering your time to actually teach
programming classes that were attempting
to work with them on as well then I'd be
very grateful so with that I'd like to
invite carbon
you know to come up here and to start
with the introductions and talk a little
bit about the school and then open it up
for a conversation good morning i am
here representing a lot of teachers who
did a lot of hard work to open a new
school for immigrants in Oakland four
years ago this is a group of children
that historically in the United States
in California and in Oakland have been
underserved and have not reached their
potential newly arrived immigrants who
come into this country at age 14 15 16
in general never graduated they had too
many obstacles to graduation English
being just one of them and in Oakland
like I said the majority didn't graduate
and so about six years ago it started a
conversation about what are we going to
do differently to create opportunities
for students who through no fault of
their own only due to the immigration
process at a particular point in their
lives really were set back and by and
not just one individual student but a
whole the next generation so what we did
is in Oakland was reached out to an
organization called internationals
network that had a lot of success in New
York City working with immigrants and
refugees and we opened to school in 2007
and we start out with 58 students and
six teachers and now we have over 300
our students come from 31 countries and
speak 29 languages other than English
and they all bring tremendous strengths
however what they don't have is English
and a large percentage of them don't
have technology skills and those are the
two things that we focus on and on in
their instruction so that they can be
productive in the United States and have
access to college so I want to tell you
a little bit about our students
of them are beautifully educated in
their home countries they just don't
happen to speak English and others come
with huge gaps in their formal education
maybe they went to second or third grade
in Guatemala and have not been in school
since we have students who are rocky
refugees a student who was hit with the
roadside bomb and he has lost an arm and
an eye has shrapnel still lodged in his
brain has a brain damage so we have
students who have tremendous needs but
also have tremendous strength that they
can bring to the United States and so
what I'm here to do today is to talk a
little bit about who these students are
engage you in a short conversation about
what are the needs of these students and
then I'm going to introduce some and a
teacher who will talk about technology
and how we're using it to build
tremendous workers and thinkers and
learners so what I'm going to share are
some immigration stories that our
students wrote in their first year they
emigrated and if you could hey rama give
one give one to each person and
everybody should get a different story
and I'd like you to spend one minute
just reading the story of a particular
student
and what I'd like you to think about is
what are the supports that that child
may need aside from the obvious of
meetings learn English and if you could
turn to your neighbor and do a very
brief share out of who that student is
and what you think they might need in a
school and in a support structure so
that they could be successful in America
in the interest of time I'm going to cut
off the conversation but would anybody
like to volunteer or something they
think that a student might need the
teacher and making come out i can start
pointing at people and calling on them
I'm picking you yeah I think our
conversation definitely revolved around
emotional supports and explanations
about the differences in culture and the
differences in in sort of their lives
and also maybe the similarities and so
some sort of emotional support whether
it's counseling or whether it's friends
or family so that's what our
conversation was and over here this
group what were y'all discussing
challenges faced by undocumented
immigrants that they have to worry about
whether they'll be able to get a job
whether they could be deported whether
they're eligible for financial aid these
are just a few of the problems that our
kids have actually these documents have
been tremendously helpful in eliciting
some of these challenges for kids
because they don't come with you know an
index card saying this is my problem
please help me with it and so we have to
discover it and often language is a
barrier there's one student here who
wrote his story about his father being a
police official in
morocco and that the family was
threatened by terrorists and so their
family was sent to America to keep them
safe and their father was still back in
Morocco when he first came all he could
say in English is my father policeman
and so I thought his father was a
policeman and that was as much as I knew
about his story until he wrote it down
and and illustrated it and then I had a
much larger comprehension of like oh
this is this is quite another level of
stress that the family is under so we
have students who come to us like I said
beautifully educated but don't know
English and then others who may or may
not know their times tables and we are
entrusted with moving that work forward
so that they have the opportunities to
reach the American dream now I want to
talk a little bit about the economic
challenges of doing this I am on a
budget committee in Oakland and so I am
also charged with going out and making
California citizens aware of the budget
situation my counterparts in New York
the New York Public Schools they have
three times as much funding as I do and
three times as many adults in the
schools to do the kind of work that our
kids need and give the kind of supports
and so in comparable schools with the
same students the same numbers they have
counselors and vice principals and
social workers and that's just not
available in California with the current
funding crisis and I wanted to give you
a little piece of how does that play out
in a school so next year assuming that
the text that there are tax extensions
here in the state of California we are
slated at the school site level to get
forty five hundred and fifty seven
dollars per pupil to educate them and
what are we required to pay for my
salary my teacher salaries the custodian
salary the lights the
water all the supplies the copy machine
the toner all the books and the pencils
all the field trips all the bus passes
for students and when you break that
down for what does that look like on a
day or hourly rate the per hour
allocation is three dollars and
thirty-two cents to educate a child in
Oakland and I pay my babysitter fifteen
dollars just to make sure my kid doesn't
drink drano and you know and to keep him
safe and in California we are asking
teachers to do a tremendous amount of
work and asking principles and
custodians and school site officers to
keep kids safe and clean and well
prepared and it is just not sufficient
funding so go out and vote pressure your
political officials to fund schools
there is plenty of money in the state of
California to do so it is a matter of
making it a priority so that's my little
plug for funding California schools I'm
going to let salliche a talk really
about technology and how we've been
using it in the schools and I do want to
say thank you to google translate with
29 languages in our school I would be
sunk without it I constantly write notes
in English and have them translated and
notes like your son is smoking behind
the gym or your daughter is coming to
school late every day and it's very
helpful I would never be able to do my
job so thank you
hi my name is silage a Suresh I am the
founding math teacher and the technology
coordinator at Oakland International I'm
here to talk to you a little bit about
how we use technology at the school and
to also talk about some ways in which
you can engage with the school beyond
today's talk when we started the school
about four years ago all of the
technology resources we had at the
school consisted of machines of varying
ages and varying degrees of
functionality that we had essentially
scavenged from other schools that were
closing down and it was not pretty to
top it all off that first class of
students that we took in a number of
them were refugees who had never used a
computer before in their lives I mean I
distinctly remember teaching students
how to use a mouse and the difference
between left click and right click which
I still do to this day and so the
objective of our technology program is
really to give students those basic
basic skills including keyboarding but
to also take them to a place where by
the time they graduate they can create
and produce college-level work that will
help them be successful beyond the doors
of our school so the technology
electives that we provide our students
at our school range from art where
students learn how to use photoshop and
indesign and flash to computers where
they learn microsoft office google docs
OpenOffice movie maker and then
electives where students do things like
make websites make blogs learn how to
animate in flash learn how to produce
music using reason and digital keyboards
so we have a wide variety of technology
electives that we make available to our
students and none of this would be would
be possible without the help of one of
our local partners that provides us with
refurbished technology Otx West is the
name of a nonprofit that takes donated
computers from companies like Google and
other large institutions they refurbish
them and they provide them to schools at
low cost so that we have actually been
able to assemble for full computer labs
for students to use on a drop-in basis
and students use those labs in all of
their academic
says to produce work but given the
budget constraints that Carmelita was
talking a little bit about even these
refurbished machines are probably out of
our reach next year that you're after I
mean it's it makes it so that our
students will not have access to
technology if we didn't have partners
like Otx and if we didn't have money to
allocate towards these resources so you
know the other thing I wanted to to talk
about is the fact that we use google
apps for education for just about
everything it has transformed how we
work not just as teachers with each
other but also in classes with students
I can't imagine teaching my class
without it I mean we use Google Docs and
Google Sites and blogger and gmail every
single day in all of our classes and all
of my students can testify to the fact
that they go to a Google Form at the
beginning of every class to start every
class and they check their email at the
beginning of every class and to be able
to administer that from within our own
domain at the school is hugely
empowering for me it has made all the
difference in my ability to plan lessons
and check students work and make sure
that students are on task and so any of
you work on Google Apps thank you I'm
extremely grateful to you I'm also
extremely interested in the other things
that you were doing and other products
that we might not know about that you
believe could help us reach our students
and help them gain the skills that they
need to succeed after high school so if
you are interested in working with the
school in any way beyond today's talk
there are a couple of different ways you
can get involved perhaps the simplest
way is adopt a classroom this is a
website where teachers are able to
create accounts and donors are able to
provide any amount of money to that
teacher to be used throughout the school
year for projects that they need the
reason this is helpful is because
teachers are able to design projects
throughout the school year without the
constraints of the budget cycle and the
ordering cycles in the district and they
can access those funds and purchase
materials any point during the school
year for the projects they need
based on their students needs so they
don't have to decide in September what
project they want to teach in May based
on where their students will be in April
they can decide in April my students
really need these skills and this is the
project I want to teach and so these are
the materials I want to buy that's not
something that teachers normally have
the power to do but this website
empowers them to be able to have that
flexibility to plan in that way another
way that people can get involved if you
are interested in volunteering and
actually working with students for the
next three weeks I will be teaching a
video game design class at Oakland
International it's the first time we've
ever taught this class and I'm very
excited it's based on a curriculum
called bootstrap which some of you may
know about and it teaches programming in
scheme so students actually produce a
little video game in over the course of
the three weeks in pairs I'm happy to
have anyone volunteer one or two days
there's many days that you're available
over the course of those three weeks to
help students learn how to code learn
how to debug learn how to present their
products to other people and you know if
that seems like too much for you you
know we're always looking for guest
speakers to come in and talk to our
students in the internship class or
people who would be willing to host a
student for a day one or two times a
year to be a job shadow as many of you
probably realize most of our students
don't have a lot of access to adults who
work in the technology industry or
adults who are professionals in general
and being available even if it's only
being available by email to be
interviewed by a student could have a
huge impact on the trajectory of that
students academic career I mean they
don't have other adults in their lives
they can ask questions too like how do
you get a job at Google or what does an
engineer do they don't know engineers
they need adults in their lives who are
not their teachers who are not their
parents but who are professionals who
are interested in opening the window to
the world of possibilities that are out
there for them if they continue their
education they continue to learn English
and try to find something to do that
they love so we're happy to talk to you
about other ways you can get involved at
the school feel free to ask questions at
the end or share your thoughts or ideas
but I want to turn the microphone over
to our students because they are for
pretty amazing students who were here
and I really want you to hear their
stories so our first student speaker is
Bravo missoula she's a 12th grader from
Eritrea please give her a warm welcome
hello everyone good afternoon okay and
thank you so much for having me here and
my name is raha I'm solo I am sorry i am
from Eritrea that's in east of Africa
this year I am great 12 senior student
in Oakland International high school in
our school there is 61 senior students
56 of them will will attend in community
college in two-year or four-year college
for next year I in Oakland International
School it's very very nice school for us
as immigrant students because the sum of
my reason to say this is the teachers
they help us in our vocabulary
everything in English as English Learner
students and besides the lecture that we
should learn in class and also for next
year I am planning to go to community
college first than to university I want
to be to study in pharmacies to be
pharmd for future and i came to united
state last year because i came to live
in Eritrea Eritrea the government didn't
allow freedom of religion so and I want
to have that that's why i came to united
state I have a big problems that I have
to struggle with them in since i came to
united state and the first one is I came
to nice to the state alone I am I don't
have parents here so I have to do a lot
of things by myself to go to and such as
finding school and also living in native
the state everything so as a teenager
that's difficult for me to do it so and
also public school is it's free to learn
everything but for Community College
since I didn't finish my immigrations as
I'm asali at this time so after I didn't
finish it I have to pay for that so I
have to think about that I don't know
how to do it and my second struggle is
learning English because even I am
learning guinea eritrea us some English
but I have to improve a lot here Oakland
International high school is helping me
a lot to improve it but still and I have
to improve it in the first time when it
came here just to instruments that was I
was really shy at that time because if I
do miss ache in my English everything
people will laugh at me or something so
that's why I didn't speak at that time
but I struggle with myself that's
because if I didn't speak in English if
I didn't practice it then I will never
can speak English in my life so that was
my struggle to do that and also the
third thing is life style of this
country and in this country people they
can speak like freely for what they want
to say for people for their teacher
everything but in Eritrea we cannot
speak for all older than us people free
whatever you want because and that is a
sign of respect if you didn't speak for
people so I should I have to change it
here too I have to say whatever what I
want to to get what was my need so this
is one of three just three this was my
three struggles in my life and thank you
so much for Google for giving us this
opportunity because this is very
important for me because this is one
skill that's speak in this big company
workers so thanks so much now i will
transfer the state to anna junior
student in my in our school thank you
for listening in silently
hi everyone my name is Anna I'm from
Honduras and i came to the united states
because my mom wants a better future for
me so in my future I would like to study
for a nurse first I would like to go to
a community college and then transfer it
to the University but one of them is my
biggest struggles that I have is that
sometimes is hard to get color ships
because i am anna document students and
because one of the bests scholarships
ask you for your ID number and there's
scholarships that you can help you put
an ad for everything but it doesn't
matter because i will figure it out one
way to pay my education so i can be an
example for those and document and
students and one of my hopes is to the
president obama help to the trim at come
true the proximate the the DREAM Act
will provide me to financial financial a
and it can apply for sinner ships now i
will now will transfer to omar and thank
you
good afternoon everyone my name is
Selmar well I am from Mexico and i came
to the united states to get a better
education because in my home country you
have to pay a lot of money to be able to
go to school and it's really hard to
find schools that will accept someone
with low income like me and most of the
school they don't have good technology
like computers and you want to have if
you want to go to those kind of the
schools you have to pay more money
something I wanted to talk about is the
way I learn English and that was by
playing video games I started playing
video games like Mario and then moved on
to more challenging games like Goldeneye
double-oh-seven and the legend of zelda
the reason why these games were more
challenging to me was because they were
in english and the games is based on
doing what the Carters ask you so I
didn't at the beginning I didn't know
what they were telling me but then as I
went through the game I started to
understand what the Carters wanted to me
to do and I also started to understand
English and that was helped me a lot
this call in Mexico it's really
expensive and when I was 12 when I when
I was in 12 grade I stopped going to
school because I didn't have enough
money to keep going to school and also
because I had to take care of my little
brothers when I turned 16 I went to a
doll school which was a little different
on the normal schools in there I I went
for three months to the adult school and
after that I took an exam that was worth
for three years of school and I passed
my exams the first try and this was a
very good accomplishment for me because
after not going to school for about four
years and then passing those exams made
me feel really good and give me a lot of
hope for my future I am I am kind of
confused because there are a lot of
things that people can do I want to be a
scientist and a firefighter and
policemen and i'm not sure what what
should I start with and now I would like
to introduce Indra thanks really
good afternoon everyone this my great
honor to be here today and thanks for
having me my name is Indra car key and I
go to oakland international high school
i have been in the US for two and half
years my parents they were from bhutan
but they were forced to live as a
refugee in Nepal for 17 years I grew up
in refugee camp with lot of different
perspectives and big lot of different
perspectives and tasks my dad he was a
used to work in school my mom who never
went to school had to stay home and have
all the refugees for survival distribute
food and rasim that he went provided us
every 15 days my parents they were
forced to live from Bhutan because of
political circumstances and laws they
are forced to they are used as forced
labor as like a slavery their language
and their culture was banned in boonton
in southern in southern bhutan for
naples sticking people they were chased
from bhutan in the year nineteen
ninety-two i was born in refugee camp in
93 and almost living almost whole life
in a refugee camp i had to i can dream
about a lot of things but i can neighbor
hope it will come true and there was a
in the year two thousand eight there was
a fire in a gravity camp which made us
live in a forest for two months under
the tent fighting with storm and who
indian hearts on and human and he was
government decided the refugees to
resettle in different countries like
Australia US Canada and Europe European
countries and first luckily I got a
chance to come to California live in
Oakland and experience my new life and
hope for my dreams when I first came
here I didn't how to turn on the
computer I shall I asked a lot of holes
and buttons in the computer which is
really confusing when I saw a lot of
people when I
people using the button I did the same I
quickly I quickly gained the knowledge
of fusing computers and internet and as
I started going to Oakland International
high school I changed it changed my the
way I live then I was I finally found
what I love to do is come to study
computer science in college this next
fall i will attend UC San Diego and i
hope to measure in computer science i'm
also looking forward to work with google
after i graduate from college and thanks
for having us
hi so I don't know if there's any
questions but I did want to say that it
is amazing that technology can transform
the lives of kids when we opened it was
it was 2007 and that was a first wave of
refugees who were coming out of Burma at
that time they were mainly Corinne
speakers and the next year I went to go
visit the refugee camps that they came
out of and they had no electricity no
running water and had never seen a
computer they had never seen ice I mean
like they'd never seen a toilet they'd
never seen ovens and so America was a
very mysterious place and so within a
week of arriving they come to Oakland
International high school and see their
first computer and touch their first
computer and salad teaches them to
double-click and friends and family
members that they thought were lost
forever were found on the internet
because what happens in refugee camps
when there's resettlement is usually
camps are dispersed across the planet
100 refugees go to New Zealand 100 go to
Mexico 100 go to oakland california
hundred go to England and families and
communities are broken up and the
students found their cousins and their
former neighbors and they couldn't
believe it and so within a week they
became very proficient at things like
email and chatting and it was really
amazing for them so I am sort of in all
of Technology and thank you guys for
helping make it possible if you have any
questions for us or for the students we
can take them I just can't imagine how
you can prepare people for college when
they come here not knowing the language
and possibly not having an eighth grade
education what can you say about that
sure so
it like I said we have students who come
at all all kinds of levels of education
the strongest predictor of how quickly
you will learn English is how much
formal education you have in your native
language and so if you have a strong
educational background most people can
learn English and pass the state exit
exam within about four to five years
that's a fairly normal trajectory when
you have gaps in your formal education
that challenge becomes much larger
however well in traditional settings
where you might only have one or two
hours of language instruction in a day
it becomes impossible but because our
school is structured to give students
language acquisition skills in every
class so the art teacher the science
teacher the PE teacher the math teacher
are building in language opportunities
to read write and speak English so
you're not just teaching math you're
teaching literacy and math it's seven
hours a day of straight English and by
really focusing in every class on
English language acquisition we can ramp
up the opportunities for some kids that
would otherwise be left behind but we
also have a lot of kids who go into the
community college system because when
you immigrate at 16 or 17 even if you
pass in California it's called the KC
examination most of them still need to
work on their English and a community
college is a great place to do that and
then to transfer but then we have kids
like Indra who are off to the University
so we sort of support multiple levels of
student achievement I'd love to hear
from the students who are in the
technology class what sort of a day in
the life or maybe some of your favorite
Dave's at the end the technology class
where
but you learn much like we haven't taken
the class yet the video game class oh
the computer class I really like this
class because it taught us a lot of
things like making videos and making
presentations and this is a very good
class because it will help you a lot in
the future after you graduate from high
school and after you get out a
university will help you in your work
and it will show that you know more
things that the people expect you to do
and you can prove them that immigrants
like us can still learn a lot of things
like them
wiki um
well we have like choose a presentation
and I present about the wiki page it was
wonderful because i used to use computer
but not like now and I know more and I
know that I can do more stuff like in
pork like import things like really I
this year we learn about technology and
that I never thought it up and learn and
text thanks to miss Taliah because I
learned a lot to use the wet sighs how
can I create things yeah one of the
things i will say about stylishness
class is I always thought that computers
were very an isolating experience where
you have your screen and it's just one
on one and with Google Docs and other
technology where there's collaboration
between kids on projects and the way we
actually teach English is about
collaboration and so kids in all of
their classes are working in groups and
I was like I don't know how that's going
to work in a computer lab where
everybody's sitting in front of a
computer and so I'll just like no no
there have all these things like Google
Documents and like three kids can be
working on the same project at the same
time and they're talking to each other
on the computer and like building things
together and I was like really and that
that was the first year that she was
teaching technology and then she's like
you know we can use this as a staff I'm
like well how does it work and so now as
a staff we use Google Docs where the
whole staff can see things like
disciplinary referrals to the office and
say oh who wouldn't the office today and
what they do whose mother got called and
both for and also we can see everybody's
grades and how they're doing and it has
been a real learning tool for us as
adults
and so kids are learning this new
technology and the adults are learning
the technology at the same time and it's
pretty cool I think we're done yeah
we'll hang out afterwards if you want to
talk to the any of the kids individually
and otherwise thank you so much for
