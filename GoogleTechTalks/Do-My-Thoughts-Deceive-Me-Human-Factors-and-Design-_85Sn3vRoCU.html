a pretty good turnout it's my pleasure
to introduce my friend dr. Jason Wong
Jason is a human factor scientist with
the naval undersea warfare center he
received his PhD from George Mason
University in human factors and applied
cognitive psychology in 2009 and today
he'll be giving us a talk about whether
our thoughts deceive us human factors
and design please welcome Jason thank
you very much thanks for having me and
thanks for such a great turnout today as
Ricardo mentioned my name is Jason Wong
I work with the naval undersea warfare
Center pretty much doing what we call
human systems integration but
essentially human factors on submarines
which is certainly a unique environment
not one that people typically think
about but I'll be talking about some of
the work that I do throughout the talk
but in the meantime the primary focus is
the question of whether or not our
thoughts deceive us and when he asked
that question a lot of people are like
well what are you talking about
now these are my thoughts I'm thinking
them why would I work on deceiving
myself but it turns out that the way we
think and the way our cognition operates
is not always necessarily ideal so I
wanted to start off with an example this
is taken from actually a television show
called Darren Brown's mind control which
was on Sci Fi he doesn't actually
control minds but it's sci-fi so you
know they got a they got a play with the
play with the title but nonetheless I'm
gonna show a short video the video is
not going to have sound but you can kind
of get the point
essentially by the way Darren brown took
this from researcher by the name of
Daniel Simon's at the University of
Illinois who originally conducted this
experiment but this is a nice video
showing what's happening so the guy here
is Darren brown and he's playing the
part of a lost tourist in a city he has
a map and he's going to try and find
someone off the street
to give him directions and then you're
going to find something interesting
happens so here he goes looking around
we find someone and the guy starts
giving directions then this thing
happens you know painting comes
interrupts them and then right off the
bat this guy without missing a beat guy
off the street keeps giving it keeps
giving directions so you see a couple
smiles read a couple chuckles but a lot
of people didn't seem to notice anything
interesting so if I this might be a
little bit easier so if you notice what
Darren brown is wearing here black shirt
black sports jacket and after the
painting yeah different guy wearing a
white shirt black jacket dark hair and
of course the guy off the street has no
idea what just happened keeps giving the
directions so just as another example
because someone might say well you know
the guy looks similar similar hairstyles
as another example same setup here
Darren brown tops finds a woman off the
street she starts giving directions here
comes the painting and it changes from a
white guy to an Asian woman and the
woman off the street does not miss a
beat so returning back to that question
of Dura thoughts deceive us well to some
extent especially in this example they
most definitely do human cognition has
its limits and the field of human
factors is the goal of this field is
that it seeks to understand these
limitations of our cognition but despite
these still design usable systems so
whenever I talk about human factors and
these principles I always get this well
a lot of this seems like common sense
and a perfect example of that and
something you're still learning any
human factors class is that you don't
use the color red unless I mean
something bad or something dangerous is
about to happen that's the kind of
Association that we have and it seems
like common sense and it seems like
something that's innate and everyone
that we wouldn't violate this principle
yet it does happen so this is a
screenshot from actually the US
government dental and vision benefits
so there's a separate dental plan and a
separate Vision Plan and this is
actually off of mine
I'd not enrolled in the dental plan
right now and you can see up here it
says that you are not enrolled not
enrolled being in red being a bad thing
I mean that's perfectly fine but I have
terrible eyesight so I definitely need
the Vision Plan and it says you are
enrolled in big red text this
common-sense principle of use green if
it's good red if it's bad is violated
here it might just be that the designer
was terribly lazy and didn't really care
but it's also entirely possible that the
designer made this conscious decision to
make that text read as well violating
the supposedly common sense principle so
throughout this talk I want to talk
about how we're making some of these
basic mistakes talk about some of the
limits of low level and high level
cognition and I'll talk a little bit
more about what that means later on I
want to talk about how this affects
design and also how we can go about
fixing things so the first topic I
wanted to talk about is that of visual
attention this is what I studied in
graduate school so it's near and dear to
my heart but this is what I consider a
little more low-level cognition a little
more basic cognition that we don't have
as much control over of course we have
some control over where we pay attention
or yeah the things that we pay attention
to but a lot of times when we don't have
that conscious control so I call it a
little more low-level but nonetheless
the concept of visual attention focuses
on the fact that there's only so much
stuff we can focus on at once for
example that ridiculous noise outside is
really easy for us to focus on and it
makes a little bit harder to focus on me
or to read the text on the slides visual
attention means that only we can only be
focusing on this particular stuff and
also especially with visual attention we
have a broad area that's known as our
visual field that we can pay attention
to but only a very small portion of that
3 angular degrees right in front of us
that we actually have very good fine
detail so if we want to actually extract
fine detail from from the environment we
only have a small window in which to do
so so the big principle from this is
that cluttered design is bad then you
don't want them
so a good example of having uncluttered
design since I'm speaking at Google I
have to just a little bit about but the
Google homepage here is nice and clean
especially with this redesign where a
lot of the stuff up top with all the
different functionality has been taken
away unless you actually move the mouse
but it's nice and clean if you imagine
you're trying to extract information if
you've never been to the Google homepage
there's only so much to look at it's a
nice uncluttered design that's very easy
to pay attention to again it's almost
seems like a common-sense principle but
you have people that completely violate
this so this slide right here is
actually a slide that we use at the
government with the US Navy if you want
money for an internal project this is
the slide that you create you fill in
this template you have the project title
up top we fill in a project description
justification approach all in Times New
Roman 10-point font which is barely
acceptable for print let alone a slide
that goes up in front of a bunch of
people trying to figure out what your
project is about it's a completely
cluttered design that really doesn't
make any sense but bosses say you have
to use it so we have to use it okay so
that's kind of a broad overview of
visual attention but I wanted to talk
about specific kind of sub phenomena of
visual attention the first being seen
gist which is exactly what it sounds
just understanding the gist of a scene
kind of the basic most fundamental
aspect of the scene so scene gist was
actually originally discovered and
talked about by Mary Potter at MIT back
in Canada
late 60s early 70s so as a brief example
of this I'm going to show you three
pictures very quickly all I want you to
do is kind of just give me the gist or
just remember the gist of what the
picture is and after the three I'll ask
you for what they are okay here we go
okay so what were the pictures what was
the first one classroom second one
library third one cottage garden yet
that one's a little bit harder I kind of
threw that in there too to throw you a
little bit it's ideally a Japanese
teahouse but that's that's a lot to get
out of this but there's a cottage
there's a garden there's a library and
there's the classroom so what Mary
Potter and her colleagues have found in
been replicated all over and as a brief
demo I gave you people within tens of
milliseconds I'm a little second being
one thousandth of a second can figure
out the gist of a scene which is pretty
impressive a very quick flash and you
get the gist of what's going on so this
is a very useful thing a very it's not a
quirk of cognition but it's a very good
thing that we should try and take
advantage of so how can we do that with
design well one example of that would be
through advertisements we know and you
guys being Google doing a lot of
advertisements people don't really stare
at advertisements they kind of look at
it and then they glance away so this is
a great place that we can use the
principle of scene just to make sure
that people get the gist of an
advertisement before looking away so
here's actually a bad example of this I
found this on a website maybe September
October 2008 when the election was still
going on a nice image so what do you
have here is it uses it's primarily blue
which is the color of most closely
associated with Democrats it uses the
Obama logo in big white bold text it
says senator Obama this red button that
says speak out which is neither here nor
there and then you actually read the
text tell senator Obama it's not 2004
then you read the super tiny text that
says paid for by mccain-palin 2008 and
you go what in God's name were these
people thinking the principal have seen
just the fact that most people really
don't care that much about politics they
might look at the ad and look away but
within that 2030
you know milliseconds for half a second
typically what are they going to get
from this they're not going to get that
it was paid for by mccain-palin 2008
they're gonna get that this was an ad
for Obama so this is an example of a
complete violation of scene gist and it
takes a lot of effort to actually
realize that this is not an Obama ad
okay so moving on another concept I
wanted to talk about was inattentional
blindness this is a concept that was
originally found by again Daniel Simon's
and other researchers as well from the
University of Illinois but here's one of
the most interesting demos of this
so what I'm going to show you is a video
some of you might have seen this this is
fairly popular within pop culture's so
if you've seen this no cheating kind of
state kind of stay quiet how many of you
have seen this by the way oh god okay
well it might be worth it for the people
who haven't seen it there are six people
and I'll just explain it briefly there
are six people there's three people
wearing black shirts that's the Black
team and there are three people wearing
white shirts that's the white team
they're gonna be bouncing a ball or
throwing a ball back and forth your task
is to focus on the white team here
completely ignore the black team and
count how many times the ball passes
between members of the white team
okay this video goes for excuse me this
video goes for about thirty seconds or
so so count focus on the white team and
the number of passes that occur between
members of the white team
okay how many did you guys count sixteen
that's the right answer how many of you
that have not seen this video before
notice something interesting notice
something kind of strange happening what
you guys notice gorilla guy in a gorilla
suit who didn't notice the guy in the
gorilla suit a few people okay this demo
totally is worth it for the people who
didn't notice it so let me come back
here so instead of counting now just
kind of pay attention to just watch the
video but yeah so up comes a guy in a
gorilla suit pounds his chest and then
walks out so the guys so for the guys of
you who totally missed that and for the
guys it's you know it's like how in the
world did you miss that and for people
that have seen this already at least now
you know it still works on other people
yeah yes so in this condition when
you're focused on the white team you
tend to filter out the people wearing
black and of course the gorilla is in
black I'm in this condition I think only
about 42% of people actually notice the
gorilla if you ask people to focus on
the black team so they're ignoring
everything that's white that number
jumps up to about eighty percent so I
made it so you guys would would miss the
gorillas I'm an interesting part of this
as well by the way the test that you had
was what Dan Simon's called the easy
condition just counting the number of
passes between the team if you make the
task much harder which is count the
number of just throws and count the
number of bounces so you're keeping two
different counters in your head the
number of people who notice the gorilla
drops not significantly so even if
you're paying attention to the black
team but trying to count the number of
bounces and throws separately the people
that miss the gorillas are the people
that see the gorilla is only about 55
percent yourself so that kind of
illustrates this principle of
inattentional blindness where if you're
paying attention to attached that's
relatively difficult then your attention
is focused on that and you tend to miss
other things in the environment
specifically guys in gorilla suits so
how can this come in handy
one example that I'd like to talk about
is that of proofreading we've all made
stupid mistakes and this is an example
from Jorge Chams PhD comics some of you
might be familiar with the guy on the
Left Mike just a minute is PhD
dissertation and the woman on the right
is his wife who's volunteered to go
ahead and sit down and read the PhD
dissertation so yeah uh it's not until
his wife access that and reads it did
she realized that he misspelled his name
but typically when we're reading
important things like our PhD
dissertations you're reading for content
maybe a little bit of grammar but you're
not really focused on spelling Microsoft
Word no matter what is gonna underline
that word read so your attention is busy
doing something else you're going to
totally miss that proofreading error and
you know this is in comic form but of
course proofreading errors happen all
the time
this is pulled off the nbc.com website
which presumably gets a lot of pageviews
and you see the Air Force telling him to
never let you know never let him out of
your sight I kind of wish there was a
little thing underneath that asked you
to visit their website for more
information
but and amazingly enough they're talking
about air force vigilance which is being
very vigilant really paying attention to
the task at hand
obviously the designer was not in the
least bit vigilant when he was typing
out other text for this banner ad okay
so moving on quickly through the tour
visual attention is a concept of
attention capture which is not quite the
flipside to inattentional blindness but
it's kind of close what this is saying
is that if you're doing a task that's
not especially attentionally in
demanding you are likely to be
distracted by other things and this
field is all about devoted to studying
what exactly is going to distract you so
in the most basic task what you have
here on the left or the main task is a
visual search task
so once the display on the right appears
you're looking for the square amongst
the circles pretty basic stuff but the
first screen that you see is on the left
six placeholder objects telling you
where the objects will eventually appear
and then you
see the actual search display what you
need here is yes this new object here
where there wasn't one before so this
new object is known as I'm a new object
that abruptly onsets to the display
because there wasn't a little
placeholder for it before and what you
find when these kinds of conditions
twenty-five to thirty percent of the
time the people's eyes or the observers
eyes move from the center of the screen
to the new object then to the target the
new object is never the target it's
always a circle it's never that's square
they never need to look at it but
twenty-five to thirty percent of the
time they look at it if you ask them
later did you notice anything funny
they might say yes if you ask them you
know they might actually volunteer the
information that yeah I noticed new a
new circle appeared the were you
distracted by it no of course not
you know I knew it was there why would I
pay attention to it but there's an
involuntary eye movement made to that
object that's totally that's distracting
of course they can get back on task
fairly quickly but it's the distracting
eye movement that people aren't even
aware of so the guest gets so I'm sorry
one more thing just to briefly talk
about is that it's not just abrupt on
sets of new objects that suddenly can
capture your attention an example here
and this is from my PhD dissertation
where I had the visual search tasks the
two boxes in the middle but the Box on
the outer sides is the addition of a
memory task you saw a color disc in this
case a certain shade of yellow you had
to remember it then you saw the object
so you switch to the visual search tasks
and here you can notice that not only is
there the abrupt onset of a new object
but it's also the color that you were
currently memorizing first for the
separate memory task and what you found
here is that on average about 40%
some people were as high as like 50 or
60 percent Soraya's would totally get
distracted look at this object before
moving to the target and then here they
were just tested on which shade of
yellow they had to remember doesn't know
which comes out okay on the projector
but nonetheless there are a lot of
different things and a lot of different
factors that can distract us from the
main task and capture our attention in
design this is really important for
things like system alerts we're always
trying to alert our users to things that
are very important or the things that
aren't very important you need to figure
out how exactly do we design those those
of you who are users of OS 10 might have
the system application installed called
growl or people familiar with this see
some nods okay essentially if you get
like a new instant message a new email
if your Xcode compile is done or
whatever whatever in application team's
worthy of alerting you about a new box
will appear in the upper right so you
get essentially the onset of a new
object that will give you alerts so you
can move your eyes you can look at it
after maybe five seconds or so the Box
fades away you can go back to doing your
work this is of course an example we're
all we've all use Windows at some point
we've all had these stupid boxes come up
in the lower-right alerting you of
whatever you know your trial version of
Windows is about to expire who knows
what but nonetheless you have to move
your eyes down there even more insidious
though with these boxes is you often
have to move the mouse and click on this
tiny little X right here in order to
close the box otherwise the box itself
sometimes doesn't disappear even worse
if you miss the box and click on the
message itself it brings up the
application window so you have to go and
close that in order to get the whole
thing to go away and it's very annoying
but nonetheless it brings into mind the
fact that we need to design our alerts
very carefully if it's something really
important like you have a virus or your
computer is going to explode we probably
want to interrupt their task and flash
something right in front of their face
but otherwise if it's not that important
maybe we can think about different
alerting strategies and there's a whole
lot of literature in the lot of human
factors literature about alerts okay so
yep okay so I want to talk a little bit
more about how we can understand and
train visual attention talked about the
different phenomena that I want to talk
about that are particular interest but
how can we seek to understand visual
attention but one way to do that is we
can do this through eye tracking which
is one of my personal favorites I know
that there's a lot of eye tracking work
being done here at Google but here's how
we can apply that
and here's how we're applying this at
the Navy this is a project done by Helen
right at the Navy that I got to work
with last summer with some of the data
analysis but dealing with people who are
fire control technicians on a submarine
these are not the firemen they don't run
around with fire extinguishers these are
the people that so if the subs sitting
on right under water these are the
people that localize where the different
ships are at the surface or other subs
for that matter so here's a shipping
here's a shipping vessel here's a
fishing vessel here's a Russian boat
that we might want to keep track of so
these are the guys in terms of fire
control technician it's like firing
torpedoes so I'm a very important job
that we want to make sure that they can
do properly so here's an experiment
looking at you know they have a lot of
tools available to them we want to know
what kind of tools they use that creates
the best performance so the experimental
setup goes like this in the upper left
is the sonar display sonar being the
sound display we send out sound pings
and those that sound comes back in a
certain profile and it shows up here
typically that data is dealt with with a
sonar technician fire control people
don't have access to this but we're
gonna give it to them here anyways
all that data comes in gets computed
through a bunch of computers and gets
put up to a display in the upper right
that displays the data in a slightly
more friendly format that goes into
another computer that does stuff to the
data and it spits out into these two
identical displays and these are the
main displays that the fire control
technicians work on and they have
geographical display here they work with
the actual pings here and they do a
bunch of other things so essentially
what we're able to do is get a bunch of
junior fire control technicians to come
sit down with strapped and are attracted
to their head and we're able to present
them with scenarios where they actually
have to localize targets in the
environment and we're able to track
their eyes so we got information that
looked like this in the upper left is a
display of fixations a fixation is when
you're when you stopped moving your eyes
and you're focused on a location and
you're gathering information from
place so if I focus on a particular face
and I stop there
it can fixate on that face and gather
information so each individual blue dot
is a different is this different
separate fixation that the fire control
technician made so you can see here
there are a lot of blue dots around
around right there's very specific tools
within their main display down here is
saccade data a saccade is essentially a
very quick eye movement that occurs
between fixations so if I wanted to scan
the room and look at each individual
person I'd fixate on a person make a
saccade to move to the next person and
so on so this way I can see how the eyes
are moving through what's called a scan
path and how it's gathering information
in the sequence so you can see here the
faint red lines that show up kind of on
the screen between the individual blue
dots from this we can find typical scan
paths and what we're able to do with
this is we're able to break down some of
the scanned paths in a generalized
manner and were able to correlate this
with performance so we could see that
we're able to come up with a specific
workflow so they would go from this
location to over here press a button
down here then use this to inform what's
going on here and we're able to kind of
make these assumptions and also
interview fire control technicians about
what they did to say hey this is kind of
a best practice sort of thing of how to
use this system to most accurately
localize your targets to best do your
job so this is how by tracking where
visual attention and the eyes were going
we're able to understand kind of the
thought process behind these fire
control technicians so that's kind of my
favorite way of doing this but of course
there are other ways as well I'll talk a
little bit about those in terms of
training visual attention one of the
most fun ways of doing it is through
first-person shooter video games a bunch
of researchers most notably early on
green and Babli a brought in people who
are novice and expert video game players
specifically those that were best at
first-person shooter video games so doom
quake all those kinds of games and what
they found here at
you think about it too if you've ever
played these games is that you're
focused on the central point on the
screen because that's where your gun is
aimed but you have guys enemies coming
at you that could be you know way up top
away from the side even could be coming
in pretty close but you have to be able
to detect all these guys to shoot and
kill them
so what green and Babli did with their
expert video game players and an expert
video game players was run them through
a series of basic attention tasks so
something up top right there where
they'd first be focused on the center
and then kind of a little blip would
appear on the screen and could either be
these circles here we're not there but
there's a little bright dot that would
appear either close in to the center of
the screen or progressively farther out
then the screen was wiped and they had
to say hey where was the object and what
they found was that a stash line is
video game players and the solid line is
non video game players they found that
the video game players were consistently
able to detect objects better they had
you know greater capacity of visual
attention to pay attention to more of
the screen and were able to detect the
small blip that occurred very quickly
and the experts were better than the
video game novices so just by playing
video games also these guys have done
some training studies where they bring
in novices and have them play hours upon
hours of video games which is not a bad
way to get your undergrad psychology
credits and then and then test them on
and they seem visual attention tasks and
you do see an improvement after hours of
video game playing so some of the work
that I've done at George Mason
University with Matt Peterson and his
group is that we did this with eye
tracking we brought in video experts and
novices have them play video games and
track their eyes this is some very early
pilot data that we had we're working on
expanding this entire study but
nonetheless what this says is throughout
it was only a 10-minute there was a
10-minute pilot study so they only
played games for about 10 minutes but
you see that experts up top that's a
graph of fixation frequency how many
fixations they made how many times they
stopped to gather information in the
world you see experts actually made
fewer fixations
then the novice is dead which is the
blue bar so it's interesting that the
experts actually made fewer eye
movements you think that if they're
better at the game they might make more
but that's actually explained down here
with the average fixation duration so
this is how long they actually stop to
gather information and you can see here
that the experts stopped when they did
stop they stopped for longer and
gathered and yeah they stopped for
longer that analysis did so combining
these two results together what we can
say is that an expert will make fewer
fixations but when they stop to make a
fixation they stay there longer
presumably because they can gather more
information which was shown by green and
Babylonia that experts have a wider
field of view they can gather more
information from a single fixation so
we're definitely working more with
training video game players as well and
seeing how their eye movement patterns
change over time at George Mason but
this is definitely an interesting way to
Train visual attention okay so I wanted
to shoot yes absolutely so it would
probably be consistent with the
hypothesis that the experts have better
peripheral vision yes was that me was
peripheral vision major directly in any
way or does this was yeah let me repeat
the question
yeah is there any sort of like
measurement of like how good your
peripheral vision is sure if so what
were the experts better to some extent
this test right here up top can be
thought of as getting at peripheral
vision because your eyes are forced to
stay at the center of the screen and you
present objects that are close in or
farther and farther away so you're
tapping into that measure of how well
can they pay attention in the periphery
I mean expert experts are definitely
able to simply expand their field of
view to expand how much they can process
in the precision the whole screen about
what it's like percentage of the Cabal
what was the angle relative to the
person like about what angle of their
vision is I sure they typically the
screen don't have that
off the top of my head but they're
sitting about 20 inches or so away for
like a 19 inch screen or so so it's it's
pretty filling in actually the green and
Babli studies they have I think they had
a really large screen and people were
sitting very close so for so for these
studies it took in a lot of their visual
attention for the studies we had it was
just a standard distance you'd sit away
from the monitor
thanks yep no problem okay
so switching gears a little bit to
higher level cognition something in
higher level because we have more
control over it generally is problem
solving and decision making problem
solving is interesting because one of
the most interesting psychological
concepts when we try and sell when we're
studying how people solve problems is
the term called perseveration which is
when we have a solution to a previously
solved problem and we keep trying to
apply that solution to everything it's
like we've developed a hammer and
everything else looks like a nail so an
interesting book that I found I'm the
Tyrell event to software development is
this book called anti-patterns which is
of course a play on software patterns in
development where people have written a
certain piece of code to solve a problem
and any new problem they come at they
keep trying to jury-rig this piece of
code to fit into others off and to fit
into these other problems and this is
the problem to some extent its
programmers being lazy but of course to
some extent it's just that we've put in
all this effort and we don't want to see
this effort go to waste
we want to maximize the efficiency of
the effort we put into something and of
course a lot of the time perseveration
can be a good or reusing solutions can
be a good thing but perseveration which
is when you refuse to switch away from a
solution you've already found can be a
very bad thing but we all have these
kinds of problems this is xkcd cartoon
it's the holidays we're all going to
have to go home and fix their parents
computers or else they're gonna ask us
for a specific tech support and this is
the diagram that we all generally use we
have a problem we're going to try and
find a menu item a button that looks
like what they want to do and we're
going to click it and we're gonna see if
it works or not and they have this kind
of loop that goes through that we
generally go through of trying a bunch
of different buttons and googling and
see what's going to work
and that to some extent if you go with
this for too long you're going to be
perseverating because you can be trying
this one particular solution that's
worked before on all these different
problems
thankfully the xkcd comic has kind of an
exit clause where if you've been trying
this for more than half an hour you give
up you ask someone for help you call
tech support god forbid or else you just
plain give up and say yeah well we'll
try something else next time but
nonetheless you know we want this
behavior that we have is generally good
but we have to be aware of when we're
perseverating of when we're just trying
too darn hard to make the solution fit
into something else and we have to
recognize that and say okay kind of wipe
the slate clean and start over
so this related concept of decision
making is an interesting one so what
some experimenters did was give people
two different glasses of wine and they
were told that one wine was
significantly more expensive than the
other wine even though of course the two
wines were very very similar I don't
think they were identical but they had
similar properties and they told them
you know drink the wine and tell me how
much you liked it on a scale of one to
five naturally as you would expect
people that people tended to like the
wine that they were told was more
expensive even though it was very
similar the chemical composition was
what's very similar what's more
interesting is when they had people do
this in an fMRI scanner an fMRI scanner
is able to look at the brain and see
which particular area bundles neurons
are active so what you can find here and
what the researchers did is that they
imaged specifically what's called the
orbital frontal cortex an area in
frontal cortex that's known for emotion
and pleasure and kind of happiness so
what you find here is that on the x-axis
you have the rating of how much they
liked it so here when they really liked
it you can imagine here's where the
expensive wines go and here's where the
less expensive wines go quote unquote
more and less expensive on the y-axis is
how much activation you saw in those in
the orbital frontal cortex so what you
see is that as you're told it's a more
expensive wine
you tend to like it more in that area of
your brain is more active so what this
is saying is that not only you might
think you know people you are kind of or
you might think if you're told that it's
a more expensive wine you're gonna like
it but you're kind of lying to yourself
that you can actually know that you know
they're really the same but because I
paid more I'm not gonna get ripped off I
like this one better but it turns out at
the mineral level your neurons are
helping helping perpetuate this lie by
saying hey you really do like this
better on a neural level so this is kind
of the ultimate example of do my
thoughts deceive me where your brain is
actually supporting these lies that
you're being told that yes you like this
more expensive wine better okay so real
quickly cuz I'm starting to run out of
time I'm talking about understanding
cognition from a broader perspective not
just understanding visual attention but
how we can break down also this
high-level problem-solving and
decision-making strategies that I'm
talking about so we can do this one way
we can do this is through something
called task analysis which we're
applying at the Navy right now but we
have a system for pilots and navigators
on surface ships trying to navigate a
giant ship imagine trying to parallel
park a giant I'm really expensive really
heavy ship against a dock without
bumping into it it's a big task and we
don't want to just set them out to sea
and say hey have fun so we've built a
virtual simulation of this here's a
screenshot of that simulation it's
pretty high fidelity they have all the
physics built in but the issue is right
now that every time a student gets into
the simulator you need to have an
instructor there as well
giving feedback hey you're going too
fast hey you made this turn too early or
good job which is only occasional that
they get the positive feedback ah but
nonetheless it's very expensive to have
these instructors there they're often
hard to find because they'd rather be on
boats and also they get really cranky
nobody wants to see a students grow up
and turn 50 times over they'd rather be
somewhere else so the goal here is to
develop an intelligent tutor a software
based tutor that can monitor what the
students doing and give feedback so when
in struggles so you can have one
instructor for eight students instead of
one instructor for one student so
Stanford University's developing the
intelligent tutor so that's actually why
the main purpose I'm here for the week
is working with the people at Stanford
but the Navy is developing essentially
what I have to call the answer key so
the students doing something and the
tutors monitoring what the students
doing but the tutor doesn't know what
the right answer is or what an expert
would be doing it's not able to give
feedback properly so at the Navy what
I'm working on is working is
understanding what an expert would do so
we actually went across the street to
the surface were four officers school
for anonymity purposes that's why that
guy's face is blurred out but we got
them into the system and we said hey can
you dock the ship can you undock a ship
and you can and then we could ask them
pepper them with questions why did you
do this why did you make the turn why
were you going this fast how did you
know when to stop and we interview we
videotaped and got all this information
we read a bunch of books and we work on
distilling this into something that
works essentially like a flow chart in
this case here it's kind of a text-based
it's a text flow chart of well they have
the goal to do this which means they
develop this sub goal if this you know
if they haven't hit the threshold
they're looking excuse me if they
haven't hit the threshold they're
looking for keep monitoring if they have
then move on to the next goal things
like that but essentially breaking the
task down into which primary cognitive
pieces and then laying those out so that
it's easy to understand and then from
there we can take that and actually
implement it in what's called the
cognitive architecture which is a piece
of software so you can actually click on
go and the software will go through
similar steps and make decisions and
solve problems in a similar way and from
this COMPETES of software the
intelligent tutor can pull out
information about what an expert would
be doing okay so finally last thing and
that I'm done is the idea of training
higher-level cognition problem-solving
and decision-making skills and really
one of the best ways to do that I think
is to make sure that the people you're
trying to train have a full as a best of
an understanding of the problem at hand
that they can possibly have without
going all the way down to you know atoms
and chemistry and things like that but
in the upper left you see a sonar
display I've actually showed an example
of that earlier
okay it's all that so nerds found data
coming in and the interesting thing
about this is that if you have a certain
sound ping coming in you don't
necessarily know what that means for
where the target is in the environment
the target could be at 3,000 yards away
at this angle or it could be twenty-five
hundred yards away at this angle it's
not exactly a perfect science of
figuring out because of the sound and
getting back this target is here so you
have to end up trying a bunch of
different solutions well what about this
one and this one and this one and this
one and each of those solutions have a
better goodness-of-fit or have more
error or less error and that's displayed
on a display that looks like one of
these four known as a pep display
parameter evaluation plot i'm the x-axis
here is actually time so you can see
with not a lot of data you get a display
that's all red in this case red is
actually good which is probably
backwards based on from the very
beginning but red means very little
error this solution fits very well so
it's very likely that the target is over
here so without much data what this is
saying is oh the target could be
anywhere which is not very helpful if
you want to actually fire a torpedo
however with more time you get more
information and by twenty minutes you've
gotten lots of data and you can see the
little red piece is a very small
function of that so this is the kind of
display that these fire control
technicians are working with but they
only pretty much read it in a book they
might have a classroom lecture
explaining it but it's not very good we
want to make sure they really understand
it so we've actually done this is built
believe it or not in Second Life that
virtual world technology that nobody
uses anymore well surprise the
government still using it but they've
actually it's essentially they're not
using it to chat with other people but
they're using it kind of as a modeling
and simulation platform that's been
built by someone else in this case
Linden Labs so we're just leveraging
that technology but they built a 3d tap
because what actually happens is that
the color as I said represents more or
less error but in this case you can
actually represent it spatially by the
height and the z-axis of how much error
there is and there's all kinds of
functionality in here when people can
click a play button and it can actually
go up top it'll try
each of the different solutions show you
how good the fit is and actually build
individually each of those little boxes
so if you have enough time if the fire
control technician is really curious
they can sit there and play around and
see how this graph is actually built
square by square to figure out where the
best solutions are so from here they get
a really comprehensive picture of what
this PAP display is actually doing and
hopefully this gives them they are able
to perform their job much better
so in summary as a whole or cognition
doesn't always work the way that we want
it to but there are many different ways
to understand it cognition and there are
many ways to make our cognition better
in terms of training or cognition so
human factors sometimes feels like
common sense but it's not always common
sense but creating usable designs is
critical whether people are searching
for something on the web or whether
people are trying to localize targets on
the submarine thanks a lot
Sharan anyone has questions I'm happy to
take them if not that's okay thanks for
the talk I was curious about a couple
points sure let's do a mash-up of couple
points thank you you mentioned so the
$10 $30 sort of orbital frontal cortex
thing the biases that are created yes in
interpreting something so when how do
you actually deal with that when you're
designing an interface around maybe the
the correctness of the data versus any
biases like from a color like is a it's
color a bias and will that create
someone to have to miss read a result or
lay an impression of the result as an
interpretation that's more favorable
when it may not be sure absolutely and
it's and it's definitely something that
you have to be aware of in this case I
would consider more of a need for
designers to really understand the
presence of that bias versus trying to
train out those biases from people for
example if something's happening at the
neural level it's going to be very
difficult so almost like an optical
illusion what's happening at the neural
level so training them this is really
what's happening might be very difficult
versus if we're able to understand these
biases through things like research and
human factors not necessarily reading
the literature but talking to someone
who has read the literature
understanding this is how people
actually work where and we're gonna have
to work on designing around that
something like color is certainly one of
those issues that comes up a lot of
people are color blind people have
different associations with color but
there's a lot of there's a lot of
research out there that we're gonna have
to see to understand this question right
here so the attention
anteye focus the distraction from what
you ought to be paying attention to but
it's not quite interesting enough yes
how do you are there good ways of
of trying to keep someone's attention on
that even though it's a boring thing I
mean this is like the you know the
airplane pilot problem of yes 250 people
and if you screw up they die and your
job is boring yes absolutely and that's
actually a feel or I'm a field within
cognitive psychology knowns vigilance
where people have to pay ultra attention
to something or baggage screeners at the
airport have to you know sit there and
look at these bags they get you know
five ten seconds to look at them and how
often is there going to be a knife or a
gun or anything like that and there's
actually been a lot of research on this
as well there and the strategies for
example you know TSA baggage screener to
get a lot of training it doesn't really
seem to help
every so often you get a news article
saying you know someone you know was
testing and passed through five guns
through security and they totally missed
them but there are some strategies
things like giving people lots of breaks
TSA employees get a break fairly often
want to say maybe every half hour that
don't quote me on that but breaks for
example and then upping what's called
the hit rate so essentially because in a
task where you're trying to detect
something like baggage claim your
baggage screening there's very rarely
going to be a gun or a knife in the bag
for you to detect so it's not a very
satisfying job however if you start
inserting image you know inserting guns
which they do they'll put in like an
image of a gun so someone says you know
there's a gun but it turns out it just
it's kind of it's a false thing but
least they got some satisfaction that
hey they did their job correctly so if
they so especially if it's their job and
it's a really boring task those are ways
to give them incentive to pay attention
if it's something that's not necessarily
their job then it might be harder to
keep their attention versus I'm just
totally turning away
okay I'll put you on this plot what do
you think of the search results page
yeah not the homepage the search or the
search results page I personally like
the search results page
everything's on it's on the left-hand
side that's definitely me on the spot
Thanks okay I'll talk to you about it
after it's in general I tend to like I
think it's relatively uncluttered things
like the ads that are right on top are
kind of highlighted as these are ads
you're able to kind of skip past that
and the actual content is is nicely
segregated so it's really easy it's
really easy to find the question I did
want to ask you is around the study that
you mentioned where they were using
video games for guest attention
peripheral vision is it was they're also
measuring attention in the sense that
experienced players because there's two
different types of attention logically
so is it sort of the active or passive
attention as well as are they actually
are they actually focusing because I
thought maybe novices would focus too
hard and not actually see things in
their peripheral vision so it's a matter
of being too specific and having to move
whereas if you don't focus you actually
increase your peripheral vision so our
experienced players just relaxing more
and not moving because they're more
relaxed but then they're actually seeing
less detail sure absolutely and it's
actually kind of the best way to answer
your question is that there's one
specific task called the useful field of
view where there's a central task where
they have to discriminate between one
item or another and you can make that
very difficult for example lion
orientation from horizontal to like 510
degrees off but then at the same time
that the central task is presented
something in the peripheral is something
from the periphery is presented that
they also have to detect so it's a
matter of the center detection task in
the peripheral and what you find a lot
of times is that the standard effect not
ignoring expert versus novices is that
the harder the central task is it's
almost like attention get sucked in
so they're worse at detecting things in
the periphery what do you find with
experts is that their attend is that
attention doesn't get quite as sucked in
there's still good at the central task
but they're still also able to pay
attention in the periphery so it's
almost like if you buy into this theory
of attentional resources we have kind of
this pool of how much you can pay
attention to expertise can pay attention
to more both centrally and peripherally
as well does anyone who'd be so you have
a question following up on his question
this is drifting a little bit there's
you know a thing that people can get in
the zone the flow yes and I'm wondering
if you ever tried to see how attention
changes when someone is in flow sure and
that's an excellent question and I'm not
familiar of any research off the top of
my head that's actually looked at that
mmm Ricardo are you familiar with that
yeah I know it's it's certain it's
definitely interesting but not not
familiar with anything like that but
because I know that one thing that
happens is totally screen out yes yep
your attention is fully is fully focused
on something but when you've got sort of
a central can you get in yep yep
absolutely
yeah we typically think of flow as
you're focusing on one task very
intensely so in terms of things like
alerts that pop up you might totally
ignore them or the phone rings and
totally ignore it
but yeah but I'm not familiar with too
many studies with that one place I might
look for example is the attention
deficit disorder literature where people
are obviously that's a case of a
specific case of how attention works but
people with 18 you tend to get very
focused on one particular task and it's
hard to distract them so studying
studying that
that phenomenon could inform inform
normal attention okay all right um
what's your perspective on level of
detail because I was at a talk recently
and it surprised me because it was a
tough D talking he's very adamant about
detail and short our throughput in our
eyes like twenty megabytes of data a
second and and he's all for like adding
as much detail as possible so that if
you're trying to show data if it's a
graph line it should be a sparkline
where like if you looked at it really
sharply that your eyes could actually
pick up all the varying my sure
difference does it so when you're trying
to present data of an idea like someone
has to be someone needs a larger version
of it to sort of grab their attention
but that once they have their attention
they sort of need the detail and usually
we we only have one state versus a
graduated state so Jevon opinions on
that sure absolutely and I think with
proper design it can definitely be done
there are some examples of like fisheye
displays that there might be tied to
something like eye tracking so as you
move your eyes where your eyes are
focused that part becomes almost like
zoomed in so if you have a display so
almost from a zoomed out perspective you
can see where the data is that you want
but as you look at it that data actually
kind of comes into focus as long as it
needs to be designed correctly in such a
way that from the zoomed out perspective
which is you know when you're standing
back and looking at everything you know
where the data is that you want
otherwise if it's if you really need to
focus on it you don't know where it is
it's gonna be impossible to find so that
so you have this problem of designing
from a zoomed out perspective but also
designing once they've actually walked
up to this poster or whatever it is and
look for computer screen and look much
more closely that they're able to still
retain the sense of space of where they
are in the entire the entire thing but
still receive that information kind of
right at the center so it's certainly
going to it makes sense it's going to be
a really tough design challenge someone
like Tufte of course you probably pull
that off but I'm not sure about as a
standard usage
