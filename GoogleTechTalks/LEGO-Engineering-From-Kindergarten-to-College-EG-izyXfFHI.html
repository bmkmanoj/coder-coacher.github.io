before Christmas break what I wanted to
show is some of the work that we've been
doing to try and teach creativity and
innovation through engineering so we've
been working with a number of different
partners and the stuff we developed
works everywhere from in the
kindergarten age group all the way
through college so you can see we have
some middle school girls building robots
right here or you can do a Segway which
is a little bit more complicated you
have to know a little bit of control
theory to make it work so the first
thing though I'd like to talk about
really is what do I mean by engineering
so it's clear that what we're trying to
do and how we're different from say
science education or math education so
really there's three parts I see to the
engineering process the first one is
really trying to set a goal what is it
that you want to solve what is your
problem
identifying the need of what you want to
solve and once you've got the problem
the next step is to really to plot a
path from where you are now to that goal
so how can you actually solve that
particular problem and realizing that
you can use math and science to try and
predict whether or not this path will
work and then construct this path using
knowing all your constraints as well as
all your costs to eventually actually be
able to build whatever it is you're
going to build realizing along the way
that as you start to go down this path
it might not have been the right path
and you have to continually reassessed
your path so that you finally get to the
goal that you originally set out for so
this requires things like iteration like
failure stuff that usually doesn't get
into schools as much as it should we
learn more actually from failure usually
than success so how can we get kids and
actually adults to fail often so that
you can succeed once so in this case we
have Lego people building Lego people
it's kind of the terminator thing you
know so this is my problem trying to I
don't know if I can stand still for for
45 minutes is gonna be tough that's
right the problem is right now that that
kids are not learning engineering in
schools they're not understanding really
why they have to learn math and
in schools and we firmly believe at the
center that if our kids don't if it's
the next generation doesn't graduate
with highs from high school with some
engineering math and science knowledge
how can we expect them to really be able
to help develop new policies vote on
existing policies and really do it from
a scientifically sound point of view so
in other words I think that if we don't
improve our STEM education we will be
having an energy crisis every twenty
years so how do we get that in the
classrooms one quote that is kind of
nice is this was out of the heart run
man Commission on national security in
2001 this was actually six months before
September 11th they came out with this
they actually predicted some sort of
terrorist strike as well the
inadequacies of our system of research
and education posed a greater threat to
the u.s. national security over the next
quarter century than any other potential
conventional war that we might imagine
so people definitely realize that this
is a problem and so how can we go about
solving it so 15 years ago we started
the center for engineering education and
outreach at Tufts to try and work with
partners to actually solve these
problems our mission really is to excite
all students at every level about
learning math science and engineering
through research informed tools and
activities so it's not to get more
engineers it's to make sure that
everybody is Engineering literate the
center has four parts to it we have a
graduate program in engineering
education one of the graduate students
in that program is here if you guys want
to talk to educational theory we have a
tool development program where we
develop tools probably the most famous
of which is Robo lab which is underneath
the Lego Mindstorms product we have an
outreach program where we work with
thousands of teachers on every single
continent except for Antarctica and and
then we have a professional development
program for teachers so you can see that
there's no reason to keep your Legos dry
like oh those are made of plastic they
can go underwater just as well as they
can go above water so we have a whole
fifth grade middle school science set of
activities for teaching water quality
actually with submarines which is a lot
more fun so just in case you still don't
believe me though let me give you some
quotes that I've heard growing up
the first one you hear all the time it's
okay that Johnny doesn't know how to to
do math why I can't even balance my own
checkbook yet you never hear anybody say
it's okay that Johnny doesn't know how
to read because I don't know how to read
so why is it that adults feel it's okay
to to role model lack of science and
engineering knowledge I'm not a science
person I'm not a math person but not
reading and writing I've often heard
people tell me that they're scared to
fly so dangerous what they just heard
about a crash so why is the average
American statistics knowledge seriously
lacking and how can we change that and
then my favorite one of them all was my
wife was sitting in a Southwest plane
there on the runway there starting to
take off and you know I don't know if
you guys remember but Southwest used to
have those seats that face each other
and I guess when seats face each other
you kind of have to talk to the person
across from you so this woman leans over
to my wife and and she says you know if
we went this fast when we were in the
air we get there so much faster this is
when they're on the runway no no you go
much faster when you're in the air by
this time the planes taking off and
they're up in the air and she goes one
no look I mean the cars are going faster
than we are
my wife trying to explain though that
was a mountain you just flew by so these
these are some of the issues that we're
trying to tackle that to teach people
really what the basics of science and
engineering is how to solve problems on
your own and actually how to make it
interesting and exciting by making a
creative and individual so we believe
strongly that that there needs to be
some engineering education in the
schools from kindergarten up and in fact
we helped put in the first engineering
state standard in Massachusetts which
covers all the different age groups
why because engineering gives you not
only the hard skills in math and science
and logic and in programming but it also
gives you the soft skills that I
mentioned earlier about how to
problem-solve how to work in teams how
to communicate this was one of the
things I do with my students at college
we build robotic animals they were a
particularly competitive group and so we
had to see if Darwin was actually
correct and Darwin went out over
intelligent design
telogen design didn't work with Lego
especially not with us building so
alright so if we need to have
engineering education why does it have
to happen in the elementary school why
can't we have it in the high schools and
really what we've found is that if you
want everybody to understand engineering
math and science you have to do it
before adolescence for those of you who
have kids I'm sure you've noticed that
as kids go through adolescence they go
from being physically curious to
socially curious and engineering is all
about the physical world so the first
three or four years of their education
are extremely important for them to
discover what's going on around them and
we spend most of that time actually
teaching them how to read for some
reason it's very important to us that
our child can read Harry Potter before
they turn eight but not nearly as
important that our kids understand how
the car works in fact one of my good
friends who's done this far more far
longer than I have always says why is it
that in third grade we spent so much
time teaching our kids about volcanoes
you know we spend no time teaching them
about cars and I can guarantee you when
they turn 20 every single one of them
will be driving a car will be in a car
and not one of them will be inside a
volcano so the second part of this
though is we really need to have the
research that shows that this the
effectiveness of these types of
education so we have a research program
at Tufts and tried to answer this and
there's a number of other research
programs across the country now that are
starting up in engineering education and
you find some really interesting things
probably the one I think is most
interesting is looking at the gender
differences in learning so for instance
if I took this group here and I asked
all of you to start building a car I
would pretty much guarantee that every
single one of the males in this room
would start grabbing Lego bricks and
building before they had any idea of
what it was they were going to build
whereas most of women and girls would
stop and think what are they going to
build before they grab Lego bricks this
is a problem because if I have boy girl
groups by the time she's come up with
idea of what she wants to build he's
already started to build and he's not
going to rip apart what he's built just
for her because even if her idea is
better so how you structure the
classroom can make a big difference
another thing we look a lot about is
at is how people learn so everybody
learns slightly differently so this idea
that there's one right way to teach
anything is just simply wrong so really
what a teacher needs to do is present
stuff and in many different guises in
many different ways many different
representations so that each child can
learn according to whatever works best
for him or for her and this is true for
adults as well and so actually what we
developed for kids is substantially
different from what we would develop if
we were trying to teach adults and it
turns out we actually spend a lot of our
time teaching adults because the
teachers have not learned you know this
material before either and so we've
spent a fair amount of our time trying
to restructure what we do so that works
for both age groups I guess the final
story I'd like to give on on the gender
difference the gender difference
particularly interests me because that's
Kim my daughter this is back before she
pierced her ears started to wear makeup
and went through adolescence but what
was interesting about Kim is that she
grew up in an in a family where we did a
lot of construction her brother's her
two older brothers do a lot of
construction and she literally has no
interest in building anything and so why
is that it wasn't in the environment in
this case where we don't think so
because we did so much in the
environment to promote building and so
we soon realized it's a lot of it is
just simply how you pose the problem and
what you pose is a problem so women and
girls tend to be very much interested in
the bigger picture of what you're trying
to do and how it's affecting society men
in general don't tend to be nearly as
interested in that is whether or not
they can just make it super charged
super cool and super powerful one of my
favorite stories with regard to that was
this is now about 12 years ago or 13
years ago we decided we wanted to teach
fluid mechanics to fourth graders mainly
because if you understand fluid
mechanics you can understand everything
in this world the world's based on fluid
mechanics and navier-stokes equations in
case you didn't know that so the best
way to do this is to bring a toilet into
the classroom so we did we brought a
toilet we stuck it up in the front of
classroom we asked the class how do you
think the toilet works what's in the
tank of the toilet and all the kids took
a piece of paper and they filled in they
drew a box for the tank of the toilet
they filled it in my favorite was this
one boy who had a gas turbine engine
inside the tank of his
but the difference was that the guys had
the box in the field in the box
the girls filled in the box with equally
bizarre solutions but then they also had
the toilet itself and the sink next to
the toilet and one girl had the mountain
that she could see through the window
that was above the sink next to the
toilet no guy thought anything but the
tank of the toilet so really what
questions you posed and how you posed
and makes a huge difference in
engineering typically people pose very
specific problems we need to design a
gear train so if you can change the how
you pose the problems and what problems
you pose you can engage the girls far
more what I wanted to show most today
there were some of the tools that we've
been developing because I think that's
what's the most fun to show off
basically and so I wanted to start with
the stop action movie we're work we're
doing and the idea here is to give kids
different ways to tell you their story
so as a teacher one of the things you're
always trying to do is figure out what's
in the mind of the kid right and then
how can you change that to agree with
what science currently believes is true
so usually how do we find that out we
ask them to write about it so can you
write me a lab report can you write me
how you solve the math problem can you
write me a book report well if you don't
like writing that's not a very effective
way to get across what's going on in the
kids head so what if we come up with
different ways so what if we come up
with a way to actually make a stop
action movie so let's make a quick stop
action movie you can see this is our
software here and I can snap an image
and then I can move it forward just a
little bit snap an image again move it
forward a little bit snap an image again
weave it forward a little bit and this
is really exciting isn't it and pretty
soon we have wallace and gromit which we
sell for millions of dollars and we can
play that and you can see I have my
movie I can change my time base and all
that pretty simple so I can use this to
do three things I can use it to tell a
story I can use it to predict a story or
I can actually use it backwards and I
can try and deconstruct and see whether
the people have the physics correct in
the story that they've written so let me
show you some examples at least the
first two telling the story I can tell
the story as a book report so this is
the story
Artemis Fowl I don't know how many of
you guys have written read Artemis Fowl
here this was excellent this was a
preview done by a third grader the new
book that was coming out at that point
that's Butler and on the right there and
Artemis Fowl with the jewel in the
middle so you can actually just do it
this is a different way to do book
reports and we've had classes break the
book up into multiple chapters and then
as a class produce all of Harry Potter
book two or all of the number of other
books so and this goes on and on the
amazing thing is how much time and
effort the kids put into this just
because you're changing the medium with
what they're giving with what they tell
you their ideas so we can also do this
for asking them how they understand
various science concepts and these are
actually out of build churches high
school physics class so you can talk to
him afterwards if you have questions but
here's he just asked him to explain to
to him what temperature was and so they
were able to do this with beans the
picture on the right was something I did
in my daughter's fourth grade asked him
to explain the phases of the Moon and
you'd be amazed at the discussions that
the kids go through as they're working
in a team to make this movie because
they think they know and somebody else
thinks they know and they have different
models and so they have to discuss it
between each other to come up with one
model for the movie and that's really
where most of the learning is going on
but I can also turn this around this is
what bill came up with in his high
school class which i think is brilliant
the idea of trying to predict and make
your movie physically accurate so in
this case I know the time base of my
movie where should the basketball be
every tenth of a second and I put the
basketball there and then I turn this
into a movie so you can see here he's
looking at the X versus Y so the kids
understand how the two of them act
individually and then together how you
get the trajectory the basketball on the
right is the final movie that they
actually made with blue screening in the
background of them shooting the
basketball the neat thing about this
story is these guys finish this movie on
the last day of class they stayed late
the last day of their senior year so I
mean how many seniors do you know this
day after school the last day of their
senior year to do physics and all we've
done is just changed
with which they're reporting back their
knowledge to us the next one we do a lot
with and as I said is the LEGO classroom
where we've done everything from
pre-school all the way through college
so let me show you some examples of
those we use this to teach all sorts of
different subjects so but for instance
let's start with math so if in those of
you who haven't played with Lego
robotics you have a Lego robot it's got
a couple motors you can let's pull some
of this stuff off so I have two motors
here and I can put a shaft in the back
to be a bumper and I can turn it on and
I can download a program into my little
Lego car so what we do in the first
grade is actually get them to just drive
forward for a certain amount of time so
let's go forward being kindergarteners
we'll go max speed for two seconds I can
download that program into my robot but
first I probably have to plug my robot
into my computer let's try that again
okay and then I can hit run you can
disconnect it and if I hit run you can
see that goes for what do we say two
seconds I can stick it on the ground
pretty exciting isn't it we can improve
matters because you know nobody really
drives these days without playing music
along the way so let's go for a little
bit longer and let's add a little bit of
music I'm going to take off the motors
though because it's hard to hear the
music over the motors so being a
classical musician we decided there
should be a lot of classical music in
here how about a little bit of Grieg is
always good so we can download our
program and if we hit run this time can
you hear
amazing mano fidelity for bid and if you
don't like our music which most people
don't you can go ahead and write your
own music which is where students will
spend hours and hours because you know
you need a good operatic death song at
the end of every robotic competition so
what we do is so actually what we'll do
in the in the beginning is just to get
kids to drive a certain distance so
they'll drive for two seconds and
they'll see that it goes almost as far
as they wanted to go but you know it
didn't quite go as far so then they'll
go for three seconds and that goes too
far
and that is well okay we need some
number between one two and three and
that's how we introduce fractions and
decimal numbers to them and they quickly
realize that they want to go maybe 2.5
seconds and what's interesting is to
help type in 2.5 and they'll get really
frustrated because they want to point 5
and what the software's telling them
they have is 2.50 they don't want to
point 50 they want to point 5 so that
starts the discussion of well what is
the role of the zero being in the back
and this is something now they're
interested in learning about it we can
take the same problem and make it a
little bit more complicated for the
second and third grades by asking them
to build this Lego build a Lego car and
measure it drive for one second measure
how far it goes then drive for two
seconds measure how far it goes and you
build up this graph of time versus
distance and then what we do is once
you've got this graph built up we take
your car and we say we're going to put a
little Lego minifigure at exactly 12
centimeters in front of your car so they
look at their graph they figure out how
long their car should go to go just 12
centimeters so they're learning how to
interpolate their graph then they line
all the cars up everybody hits run at
the same time and we see who comes
closest to just kissing their lego
person a couple of people run over the
Lego person so you can pause and teach
little about ethics unless it's Darth
Vader was there a lego person a couple
of the greater stories are there was one
group in New Zealand that was it was an
all-male group they decided well if the
competition is really who comes closest
then if my robot takes out everybody
else's robot I'm gonna win they didn't
they lost there are people whose cars
who go backwards it's really quite
entertaining but what's amazing is we've
done this now for ten years in
classrooms with all age groups and
they're always interested in doing it
again
and trying to improve their times in
better understanding the math and the
modeling that's going on underneath it
and again it doesn't have to be lego and
it doesn't have to be our activities
it's the idea that you're actually
trying to solve problems yet you're
doing engineering and that's really what
the driver is so there's no reason we
can't do exactly the same problem in
college so how many people in here have
had controls okay good so we can teach
proportional controllers with this so
the idea is here's a program I'm gonna
have to leave the mic for this one
here's a program where what we're gonna
do is we have a loop subtract it from
where we want to be multiplied by
constant proportionality wait for a
little bit the whole time I'm actually
going to record what the encoder is
reading so we can download this and in
this case I think the desired location
is exactly 100 degrees or a third of a
rotation so if we hit run
you can watch the tires and you see it
actually overshot a little bit and came
back let's do it again
okay we can upload that data because
remember was taking data the whole time
and you can see yes we got a little bit
of overshoot and then it was flat at a
hundred degrees so the next question I
want to do in my class is to teach
people how to actually model this
controller so what I'll do is I'll have
them go through the open-loop solution
where I just turn the motor on at a
given speed and record position versus
time and I can upload that and then I
can model my motor and if you model it
you'll realize that there's a linear
portion where friction is just balancing
out the power and then there's the
acceleration portion here so it turns
out to be a linear plus exponential so I
can fit a line to it and get many or
plus exponential equation once I have an
equation that models my motors I can
actually go through and do a full model
on the controller so that I can actually
program it to go for some desired
location I can run it and then I can
compare the data the my model to the
existing data and so you can see here it
didn't work all that it worked okay the
black is the model and the red is the
data I can then vary my model and see
maybe get a little bit more ringing we
can try running that one and see if we
get the same ringing and watch the
motors you see how it gendered us a
couple times and we can again upload the
data and so what you find is that kids
all of a sudden start to really why
they're spending hours and hours in
front of MATLAB in the simulation
environment because they have a physical
analogue to it and there you can see the
model was actually pretty well in
predicting the jitter we haven't tried
this in first grade yet but oh we will
so but my favorite part about this
robotics in the classroom is doing
science experiments with it so what we
can do is I can take an accelerometer
and connect it up and I can say I want
to take measurements on my accelerometer
I need to take measurements every 1/100
of a second so I download this it's
going to take a hundred points at 1/100
of a second ok now what I'm gonna do
so we can actually see what our
acceleration was we can come back
connect it back up and read our
acceleration we get the data back and we
can upload it and so through this we
actually can measure our drag
coefficient and we can start to actually
we do all sorts of different things like
jumping around with it see if we get to
0g the other thing you can do though is
acceleration is actually quite a
difficult subject to teach kids so one
of the one of the problems we often run
into when we're teaching say high school
physics is that kids if you ask kids
well if I throw this like this the whole
time it's flying through the air and
actually a fair number of adults as well
as kids will tell you that it
decelerates and then accelerates towards
the ground
when in fact the instrument leaves my
hand it only has one acceleration the
whole time it's 1g downward so what if I
take the acceleration and I convert it
into a frequency and I'm going to
actually make this louder so that you
guys can hear it I had this on the plane
and gets a little bit embarrassing if it
gets too out on the plane but okay so
now if you can hear really mess around
with your data
you're going to also have a lot of fun
with an accelerometer because you can
use this as a Wii to control another
robot so here's a case where some
students in a university and Switzerland
decided there's no reason they couldn't
drive their their robot with a steering
wheel so the to NXT is the two Lego
bricks are connected through bluetooth
the one of them in the steering wheel
has an acceleration accelerometer it
measures the vector of G and then it
sends that out to the motors of the
little Lego car and so you drive it
around you can travel the speed with a
little angle indicator on the side again
very useful stuff and one of the neat
things though is since the motors you
can actually use the motors as a haptic
device so that you can actually give
feedback to the to the controller and
they can see when they're coming near
walls and it will start to push back on
them which is very entertaining so I
wanted to show you a couple examples of
what kids have done all around the world
with the Mindstorms stuff and so these
are all the different areas countries
that we work with currently with
teachers so you can see Antarctica is is
sadly white and the school population is
fairly small this is a group in China
they were showing me these pictures they
are making assistive devices for
handicapped people with my favorite
being this one and because obviously we
all are slightly handicapped in that we
can't fly
and so he's developed the solution to
our problems in New Zealand Australia
these were a group of a couple different
schools that were showing me robotic
animals they had built for those of you
who've been down in New Zealand the last
one I'm sure you'll recognize is Weka
which are all over the South Island this
was middle schoolers as part of the
RoboCup junior competition there's a
dance competition so they built this in
Germany they built this rock and roll
singer and you can see the amount of
science and physics especially that you
have to understand from centers of mass
to friction to make this thing work it's
huge so how can we get this more into
the classroom
this was at the university level
students were given an NXT a couple
motors and a simple program just turned
the motors on and 25 pieces and the idea
was to see how many different ways they
could put the pieces together to get
different behaviors out of their robots
you can see very rapidly you start to
give them all sorts of different
characteristics and personalities but in
each of these cases the program and the
pieces are all exactly the same just
used in different ways
this next one's my favorite tries hard
but never really gets anywhere there's
this option this was out of a high
school in Luxembourg
this is guess tall if you shake hands
with Gaston he will either decide he
likes you or not like you depending on
the temperature of your hand what was
impressive about Gaston lence he
actually had two microphones in each one
in each year and students actually wrote
a program that would did a cross
correlation between the two mics and
could determine where the sound was
coming from and would follow you around
as you talked what was also impressive
about Gaston is the whole effort was led
by a tenth grader who had actually was
having all sorts of social issues
because his parents undergone an ugly
divorce and he had completely withdrawn
within himself and actually by leading
this group is what pulled him back out
of his of his doldrums so it serves
actually more purposes in just teaching
math science and engineering this was
one that was done by my students as a
final project it's actually gives you
the ability to cook hamburgers
so because no one really wants to go kam
burgers for themselves so the first
thing you want to do is take your frozen
burger and stick it into your George
Foreman grill they found out the hard
way that veggie burgers stick didn't
work very well you need really greasy
hamburgers and then what you've already
chosen what condiments you want on your
hamburger so you add the cheese all
condiments go in the upper left-hand
corner they were Mac users
and and ironically one of the students
ate so many hamburgers he actually got
sick on him but anyway but we put this
on the web and actually a bunch of
eighth graders in Switzerland saw it and
they decided they had to be able to do
the same thing and what's ironic is that
they came to a teacher who had never
done this before who had no computers
who had no leghul and said they wanted
to do it she found Lego she found
computers and she was amazed at how
these kids were coming in at recess
staying late to build a hamburger maker
it's now become part of the school they
do hot chocolate makers and all sorts of
other things and they and they really
enjoy it and as you can see they're
amazing film editors - you watch those
too many times and you feel a little
nauseous but you'd eat that burger
wouldn't you
so so I guess then the next thing is
really if this is so exciting and so
interesting why is it not in more
classrooms and what we've seen is there
are basically five reasons that it
doesn't get into classrooms number one
is the teaching style is completely
different it's actually in hearing more
and more about Google it's very similar
to what's happening in Google it's about
mentorship and about enabling as opposed
to about telling and most people teach
the way they were taught so to break
that cycle takes a little bit of work
and innovation on the part of the
teacher the next is that there's no
right answer you'd be amazed at how many
teachers get really frustrated with us
because they want to know what the right
answer is because if the kid asked some
questions they want to be able to tell
them the kid whether or not the kids on
the right track
well of course there's a million
different ways you could cook hamburgers
with Lego bricks so there is no right
answer and that teachers find difficult
in the days of standardized testing you
have to get to chapter 12 well if you're
gonna take time to build a lego
hamburger maker you might only make it
to chapter six so how do you actually
balance out what you need to cover for
the standardized tests and how you
actually cover it and this is something
we spent a lot of time working with
teachers on the content knowledge
engineering is not usually taught to
priests pre college teachers and so how
do we change that and then lastly if you
take this into a classroom you will find
that the kids are up and running around
and excited and asking questions
sometimes they're in tears there's a lot
of emotions there's a lot of noise it's
it's chaos and most teachers are used to
quiet classrooms where they can manage
it so teaching through chaos is a lot
harder to do and believe me when you
come home from a day of it you're a lot
more tired so that takes a while to get
used to as well so how can we actually
start to make this happen in classrooms
well the first is to actually try and
build virtual communities so we have
Lego engineering comm where our teachers
around the world share ideas we have a
bunch of activities and talk about a
bunch of the research that's happening
to show how the one of the best ways or
most effective ways to bring this into
classrooms we have conferences where we
work with teachers
mainly in Europe North America and Asia
but we're trying to expand that out into
Africa as well - not to Antarctica
though to give people a chance to meet
other teachers and hear what other
teachers are doing and then to actually
play with the tools as well another
program that we've started at Tufts is
called stomp student-teacher outreach
mentorship program and here the idea is
if we're asking mrs. Smith Myers to
teach something she doesn't understand
in a way that she has not used to
teaching with technology that has a
habit of causing problems computers
crash batteries die and teaching with
chaos going on that it's really only
fair to do that and give her a little
bit of help so we started a program at
Tufts where we actually pay our
undergraduates to go into the classroom
and help mrs. Smith Myers out and what
we rapidly found is not only does mr.
Smith Myers benefit but our students are
benefitting a lot as they are starting
to learn how to communicate we're
learning how to lead and actually learn
how to try and help the educational
programs in their local area so you can
see here we're couple more examples of
like a robotic animals always a favorite
this is one of the ways we train our
stomp students this one is probably my
favorite I don't know how many Lego
sloths you've seen before but this one
actually does move rather slowly so the
last part of what we're developing is
new and other ways for to allow people
to tell their stories so what if you
could tell your story and your story
included a stop action movie your story
included data it included a program
haven't included text it included a
movie and so that's what we're calling
Robo books and in fact this whole
presentation I'm showing you is actually
built into a robo book so you'll notice
how I am running a lot of stuff from
within the presentation it's PowerPoint
but with robotics built in essentially
so how can I tell my story when my story
might have a program that I would
download into my
and XT and run it so I can get my data
back so as it's running it's taking some
data we can move things around to get
some data out I might want to then get
get that data and share it in my book so
it pulls the data off I might want to
type some and I'm an amazingly fast
typer information or I might want to
actually just simply grab a picture of
what I'm doing mm-hmm and then once I've
got this whole story together I submit
it to my teacher so my teacher gets
really more of a blog than a single
written assignment and what we're
finding is that kids actually take much
more ownership of it because they're
able to interact with it in so many
different ways than just simply writing
a report there's a second part though
what if I can figure out a way to not
only let kids share their stories but to
let teachers share their stories so
imagine a day when you're a 3rd grade
teacher and you download off the web an
activity that you think is pretty cool
and you run it in your classroom you
know you run it the first year it works
okay but you'd like to change it a
little bit so in year 2 you change the
text a little bit then year 3 you make
it match your local standards so it
matches California State Standards by
year 5 you've completely changed it so
it it teaches math and science that has
on the state standards and you put it
back up onto this iTunes world and then
the Norwegian teacher downloads it
translates it into Norwegian and puts it
back up there and the Massachusetts
teacher Tran takes it down translating
to Massachusetts Standards and puts it
back up there so what we're hoping is
that in five or ten years we can get a
complete set of curriculum across all
age groups covering all subjects in all
languages and meeting all standards
something that would be prohibitively
expensive for any company to do so
that's sort of what we're doing now it's
the time for me to turn it around and
actually make the pitch so really how
can we get you guys involved so what can
you do to actually make some of these
change happen changes happen in your
kids schools or your local schools so
the first obvious one is too simple
I did I have a it took me two and a half
million dollars and no I didn't put the
TM there so it's obviously some other
Google I have two different colors you
know the third no so the first one is
simply just to play with your kids doing
mathematics robotics or whatever finding
different ways to actually work with
your kids to build stuff and hopefully
most you guys are doing a lot of that
already and if you don't have kids play
with your neighbors kids it's a whole
lot of fun the next one is to actually
get involved with your local school the
reason teachers teach is because they
truly love teaching it's not for the
outrageous salaries that they make or
all the perks that they get or the fact
that they have to pay for their own
pencils for the classroom so they are
always very excited and interested to do
stuff that gets the kids more excited
it's just a number of times it's really
difficult to do it on your own so an
extra set of hands makes a big
difference so one of the things that I
think that would be really neat that I
would love to see is a Google stop
program we have stomp programs now with
a number of different companies National
Instruments Raytheon Foster Miller
Symantec we're starting one with iRobot
so there's there's a number of different
models out there and what we found is
that first of all the teachers really
like it it helps them out they have that
extra set of hands it's very important
though that if you do go into classrooms
you go in as an assistant that you don't
take over the classroom but you do as
the teacher tells you to do because that
will guarantee that mr. Smith Myers will
continue to do it even if you're not
there so Google stomp program we train
volunteers how to go in and be effective
in the classroom get materials there's
the help desk work with school systems
and school system with a T as well I'm
not really sure what that T is all about
and the benefits are number one is
you're helping change STEM education
number two actually the one reason I
love doing it is I got to meet all my
kids friends the number three we found
in the companies that we work with it
actually you get increased employer or
attention because they feel that they're
being allowed to do stuff that actually
affects their family and for their
become
active citizens the other thing that I'd
like to advertise or pitch would be to
try and collaborate more you guys have
an incredible reach as you well know and
one of the places I could see a great
collaboration happening is is there a
way that we can right now within YouTube
you can actually as you I'm sure you all
know make your own movies why don't we
have the ability to make your own stop
action movies as well and can we
actually use that as the place where
people can do stop action physics and
stop action chemistry and biology and
mathematics your strengths in a virtual
community or something that I could see
that you could help us out a lot in in
making a difference and then finally it
seems to me that there's no reason that
the Robo book that I showed you couldn't
also be a Google Doc Google Docs would
have to be able to control robots but we
could certainly help there so those were
a couple ways that I was thinking that
we could have an effective collaboration
to actually start making a lot of these
changes happen in local schools around
here so I thought I would end with
probably the most complicated Lego robot
system I've ever seen and this was a
doctoral thesis it ate a ha in
Switzerland what we have is actually a
fruit fly that drives a robot around for
you so what we have is we've taken a
fruit fly or the student here took a
fruit fly and mounted it inside this
this set of LEDs so it's a little known
fact that fruit flies fly based on
optical feedback so if they see things
going by slowly they try and speed up if
they see things going by fast they try
and slow down if they see things going
by at different speeds they think
they're turning and they try and turn to
to get away from that problem so we can
actually control how the fruit fly flies
by changing its its visual system so you
can see here there's the fruit fly and
there's Chauncy the one who did this
work and so he's got a Lego robot with
two ultrasound sensors on it and when
Eve sticks his hand over one the fruit
flies visual information changes in the
food fly tries to move its wings
accordingly and so what he's programmed
is to make the fruit fly actually turn
into any object it sees by how he
changes the optical feedback he then
picks up the wings
and those wing positions control the
motors of the vehicle so you'll see when
he sticks it on the floor most of the
time it'll actually turn in towards him
now fruit flies are actually fairly
cheap labor so they don't have the
quality control you would hope for and
so sometimes they turn in the wrong
direction so he was actually doing
doctoral work looking at trying to model
the fruit fly thought process as a
control system but this was something
that we decided had to be tried because
it was too much fun to have a food
flight controlled robot we did have to
deal with the fruit fly rights activists
that took a while but so here's a little
kid that walked by the booth and found
that some of the times the fruit fly
would actually drive at her and found
that a little bit confusing so anyway so
that's all I have thank you very much
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
thanks
so who's got questions yeah so the
question was how much does it cost to
equip a third grade classroom to do LEGO
engineering it costs something on the
order of two thousand dollars for a
classroom which we found them getting
the money is usually not a problem you
can usually find local industry to
donate getting the support that the
teacher needs is the bigger issue so
yeah yeah so the question was what other
programs are there in in robotics based
education or Lego based education there
are a number of programs out there we
are not the biggest we just work with
Lego and developing the tools primarily
so there are books there are a number of
good books from college house books for
middle school science for elementary
school engineering for high school
science and engineering there are a
number of different companies that will
actually work with you to do the stuff
the best person to talk to on that is
the Lego at your local Lego distributor
they'll know about them a lot of
universities are doing this in the
university and have outreach programs
into local schools yeah
that's that's a good question so there's
a couple questions in there the question
was really is there a way to measure
success and the first question there is
really what do you mean by success is it
motivation and excitement does it better
scores on the whatever your version of
the EM cask standardized testing are so
there are studies that are going on
right now centered around all of those
the second part of the question is is
more of a classroom management system is
how do you ensure that one person
doesn't take over the group and there
are we have some programs where we try
and work with teachers to teach them
some of the ideas that other teachers
have found that are effective in the
classroom to stop that from happening
the younger kids usually the younger
male kids are the biggest issues in the
kindergarten first grade getting males
and particularly working teams is not
that easy ironically the girls actually
that's the reason they like the
engineering time is because they like
the chance to work with their friend
their friends in a social environment oh
yeah yeah yes so this is all right this
is all about improving their math
learning or their science learning and
so they take the standard science tests
or the standard math tests at the end as
well as of course the standardized tests
the we are working on trying to find
ways to do testing
that's not pencil and paper so asking
you to build something and analyze how
well you built it but that's still in
development yeah
there there actually there are a number
of different after-school programs
there's FIRST LEGO League there's
RoboCup jr. there's the world robotics
in Olympiad those are the big ones these
are all excellent things to get your
children involved with they teach a
whole lot about engineering and teamwork
and so on the idea is really to have
something like a sport but the
engineering and math and science based
however those do not directly affect the
classroom and so a lot of the stuff we
do is really about that classroom so
that's every child in every grade but
they do indirectly affect it I think
half or three-quarters of the FIRST LEGO
League coaches are actually teachers
yeah
that's a good question so the question
was how long does it actually take to do
one of these activities inside the
classroom and that first of all is
highly age dependent but usually what I
would recommend is something on the
order of an hour or two hour to an hour
and a half a day twice a week for
roughly three to four weeks to really
have a continuous program you'll be
amazed at how quickly the kids will pick
it up they're really super fast at doing
this stuff yeah
I'm hopeful that there will be a
turnaround if see if Obama turns it
around in in his 4/8 year term I'll be
amazed it's a huge amount of time and
investment and momentum that's gone into
it but yes but I am hoping to at least
lighten up and realize that that there's
more to life than just making sure that
everybody has exactly the same skills
and doing exactly the same thing on
Tuesday at one o'clock in their
classroom whether they're in Texas or in
California yeah that would be great I
hate I haven't really gone down that
road much at all thirty know him I'll
give him a call all right
any other questions yeah
there there are 50 different sensors
that we support now on the NXT so we can
sense pretty much anything however one
of the sensors is actually a breadboard
so you can build your own sensors so
there are books out that are how to
build your own sensor and do different
stuff like that which which is fun too
we use I use at the college level that's
usually not in elementary school yeah
okay so the question was how do you
compare all the different robotics kits
out there available for middle schools
it to my mind it really doesn't matter
what you use as long as you're doing it
so if there's a teacher that's really
psyched about the Arduino or something
like that great support them in that the
Lego has a couple of advantages one it
works out of the box too the motors are
already big and easy and fast to connect
three there's a number of different
software's out there available for it so
if you like graphical programming or see
your job or whatever else you want to do
it's available and and for its there are
a lot of different sensors that you can
use with it so that's what makes it nice
but but of course I'm biased because I
spend so much time working with it and
yeah and five when you say Lego every
child knows what you're talking about
yeah
yeah so the question was there might be
a lot of parents at Google or maybe
other people aren't yet parents or maybe
we'll never be parents
people Googlers who might be interested
in a Google stomp program or something
like this and how do we get started I
think that's a conversation we got to
have I think it would be great if we
could if there is enough interest be
great to get a project like that going
if you're interested you can contact me
directly and you know I'll work with
Jeff Walt's and other people and see if
we can figure out how to how to get
something organized I'm bill while w/e
IHL all right anything else well thanks
a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
