joining us it's my pleasure today to
introduce our speaker Gloriana Davenport
Gloriana is a research is a principal
research associate and founding member
of the MIT Media Lab where she leaves
the media fabrics group trained as a
documentary filmmaker Gloriana has
achieved international recognition in
her work in digital media forms her
recent work explores the emergence of a
new paradigm we call the media fabric a
semi intelligent organism consisting of
a vast and evolving collection of media
artifacts structures and programs that
support our engagement in a meaningful
way situated in and around modern
communication networks the media fabric
beckons us into a diverse landscape of
creative story potential that is
synergistic with our imagination and
integral to our everyday life Gloriana
has published many technology journals
she has presented and exhibited her work
at many international symposia
conferences and film festivals and she
has taught many media workshops and has
served in an advisory capacity to
several nonprofit and commercial
organizations I would also like to
mention that our presentation today will
be archived to the public for Google
video so if you have any questions in
the Q&amp;amp;A session that our Google internal
please wait till after the presentation
and without further ado please join me
in welcoming Gloriana Davenport thank
you Mary and Eric Coleman who is my like
a stepson for taking me out to breakfast
this morning and introducing me to the
google site i guess i was last here on
this particular campus many years ago
when SGI was a very small organization
growing so i've been around for a little
while i guess and i'm still sort of
focused on the same set of problems that
i've been focused on for a long time
which is how can we really have an
audio-visual world where week
and use that on those audio visual
elements to communicate and sort of in
our everyday life as opposed to only on
television networks or even only on the
Internet in a sort of a non face-to-face
world so I thought I'd begin with a
couple of interim introductory remarks
about the media laboratory many of you
know the media laboratory it was founded
in 1985 and we have gone through a
couple of directors we have a new
director who just started in January his
name is Frank moss he was formerly at
Tivoli and he's sort of bringing us into
the next generation of work the Media
Lab started trying to bring together
print film and computing in the early
days Nicholas Negroponte II is well
known for his sort of pioneering work
trying to get industry to recognize that
there was going to be a lot of digital
media out there the next decade of our
work was really on digital in everyday
life the lab is very broadly situated we
have 32 principal research faculty
researchers or faculty and they all have
different specialties not one of them
has the same background so we today
we're everything from augmented
exoskeleton work with Hugh hairs leg lab
Hugh believes you know eventually we'll
have be able to attach to ourselves
mechanisms that allow us to move through
space much faster jump higher not used
cars as much to people who work in
material sciences and then a core group
of faculty who began when the Media Lab
started who are still really working in
the digital media
area and the Google is a member of the
digital life consortium so this means
that you have access to all of our IP
you have access to any of the individual
researchers at the media lab if you care
to have if you find on the website
something that interests you when you
want to have a one-on-one conversation
or you want to get to something in our
archive you can do that as well probably
talking to Mary in the digital life
consortium which is run by Andy Lippmann
we have I just want to mention these
these five directions because they have
some implications from my work as well
and hopefully for your work viral
communications we're working a lot in
the peer-to-peer area really looking at
how people can borrow power from other
people how people can cash on other
people's machines on with the idea that
will make something that works better
than any individual mechanism that is
out there we have a lot of work in
intelligent machines cynthia brazil is
working with robots sort of everyday
robots who might help you look after
your mother for instance and trying to
make those robots intelligent and have
effect when they engage with you deb roy
is in cognitive architectures he's just
had a young baby and the baby is being
videoed by something like twenty two
cameras in his house plus audio in every
room because he's interested actually
and how children learn language but if
you want to see a lot of data he's
working with it and he has particular
ways that he's looking at trying to draw
out content and meaning from that vast
amount of material and stay tuned
because that's a five-year project and
he's going through many terabytes and
sort of using sneakernet to get the
terabytes from his house
to the lab we have a lot of people
working in learning and expression and
we have for many years Seymour Papert
those of you who know the lab Seymour
Papert was at the lab she wrote logo and
has spent the last 20 years probably
looking at how children learn and most
recently he and Nicholas Negroponte II
have partnered in the hundred-dollar
laptop which is the idea that we can
bring the cost of the laptop down to a
hundred dollars that laptop it while
some of the research on the design of it
is being done in the media lab most of
it has spun out to something called one
computer per child the idea is to
manufacture millions of computers very
fast and deploy them in parts of the
world where there isn't much density of
computer use today or there in places
there's a lot of density but the country
itself wants more density the ideas that
the countries will pay for the computers
and then deploy them into kids growing
up in the educational field and what I
like about this laptop is it's running
Linux it's open system it's a
peer-to-peer system working on a mesh
network and so kids can collaborate with
each other and only occasionally hit the
internet so it may be one of those few
instances you'll see in where there's a
huge deployment where the internet is
not the primary means of swapping
material sort of in the short term the
reasons for that are to bring down the
cost of the laptop we have to have a
very very lean laptop and it's going to
have to get together with other laptops
in order to do certain kinds of things
but it's also because a lot of the
places we imagine it will be deployed
may not have such easy access to the
internet and certainly don't have the
wealth to pay for connectivity that
costs money so these laptops were
initially with a crank so that you could
hand crank them for about 10 minutes if
you crank them up you'd have about 10
minutes of run time that's gone
to some different designs for the energy
generation because the crank makes you
not be able to do anything with the
laptop while you're cranking obviously
and my media fabrics group I think a lot
about the media is all out there and how
can we bring pieces of media together
into a story form that is interesting
and meaningful I meant to mention in the
learning and expression piece another
big piece and the piece all mostly
talked about is the common sense
initiative in the lab which is to grow a
huge database of common sense to use
that common sense then to parse through
content and be able to synthesize
content from what the computer
understands so again Frank Maas really
sees the next 10 years as being human
scalable human machine partnerships and
I think that that's a pretty good term
to talk about almost all the work in the
media lab today so what do I want to do
it's always hard to explain because
media is you know it sort of is very
fluid different people think media does
it different things they're big
companies they're small companies and
there's your home camcorder but just
ensure a short I sent my grandson a
while ago a little card that I made it
took me hours to make the card I had to
cut and paste images go into Photoshop
do this or that what about if you could
just tell the computer a story and have
the computer then send you a bunch of
images that you could put together into
a sort of animation that was funny and
it was a kids story would you invent
kids stories would you enjoy would your
kids enjoy making stories that way
there's a lot of overhead even once you
have the idea of telling a particular
story of finding the images putting the
masking on changing the color and we
could do it better similar thing is
um I would like to recall and share my
experiences in China using images from
my own collection I shoot about I put
about 2,000 still images on my laptop of
year personally and I shoot 200 hours of
video and there since I'm trained as a
filmmaker I'm pretty focused on the type
of collection on making current
commercial venues don't really support
the type of story that I think about as
a which are sort of coherent stories
about particular topics where you might
have a hundred sequences on one
particular general theme and I'd like to
be able to navigate through those in a
storied way come back to them over and
over again get different perspectives
and then what if I could learn from
other people's perspectives
institutional archives today I don't
know what Google's looks like but they
suck they're there in general you're
locked into a one hour format you don't
know what's in that format you can't
jump around you can't extract a nice
little five-minute section of my talk
that might go very nicely with five
minutes section of somebody else's talk
so that when you want to put together a
background piece on what's happening in
video today you actually can do that
using video as opposed to looking at the
video and making some text notes I put
together a few images from my own
collection and present them like this so
if I would tell a story in time like
that as a very small example but I could
say I have nieces and nephews who grew
up on the beach that had a dog they
loved who very often slept in a chair
near them sometimes that kids wanted to
look like grown-ups at other times a
grown-up kid would be watching younger
kids on the beach all of these images
have a lot of memory for me they really
tell the story of my family but they
don't tell the story if I
to look at them singly a single picture
does not tell that kind of story and for
me to go through the number of pictures
i have is again a lot of overhead so can
we create story navigation for media
collections I know Google is is working
very hard on the video aspect and yes we
can but what does it take and there are
many different methods out there so I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
theoretical framework that I use which
is able to be told in a few sentences
and then I we can talk a little bit
about how story storynest might change
what we do with media and what it
technologies that at least I'm up line
to the problem and a few few things that
are in the immediate future of my work
and I'm happy to have discussion during
the time i'm talking or after would but
if there's a time you think i'm racing
over something you want a little more
detail just give me a buzz so there are
some assumptions i make one is that
media archives will continue to grow I'm
not going to defend that in any way and
that the consumption of media will
continue to be driven by the consumers
convenience by the meaningful engagement
with the media which includes
construction as well as searching and
having a story told for you and
reasonable cost again I don't plan to
discuss any of those I just assume them
and i'm also assuming demand for mobile
access will grow which means that i
think it makes a very good argument for
the type of collection based
storytelling that i talked about and
that's beginning to happen in the
industry but without any real
information layer helping you make it
more storied so there are two problems
that i think relate to store ignis that
are useful when you think about building
a UI or building an architecture one is
the problem of intention we all collect
media based on our individual intentions
but sometimes there are many intentions
and their conflicting intentions so if
we take 20 photographs on a trip we may
take them for different reasons and that
needs to be reflected some people call
it metadata I don't like the term
metadata because I think it it sort of
come to mean some things that it
shouldn't that that are very limiting
but you want to sort of understand what
the intention was and taking the image
and then you need to understand what the
intention is of the people receiving the
media and that intention needs to be
adjusted as you sequence media because
as your sequence media you add new
meaning so how can we capture knowledge
about intention and use it and the
second theoretical piece is the problem
of the extraordinary and the ordinary
all stories that we know of for
millennia have been about ordinary life
and what they do is they take little
bits of ordinary life and they elevate
them for the purpose of the story to an
extraordinary status the extreme example
of that is hero stories you know where
you get somebody who's really a normal
person but they happen to be in a
situation that is told in a way where it
makes that situation extraordinary but
even if you have a two year two and a
half year old child who tells you
something as before a child really uses
because in their sentences they
understand things that change the normal
course of their everyday life something
that happened they fell and hurt
themselves they came home they know if
the handful and hurting them hurt
themselves they might have been going
along and doing something else so we use
this notion of the extraordinary event
in our everyday language and it's part
of how we understand the world so
we now everybody records video all the
time I don't like to say anything bad
about the media lab at all but this is
what our web our video website looks
like and you can go down it for a very
long time it's a list it tells you who
spoke everything is about an hour maybe
an hour and a half and very few people
have time to go into it and actually
Eric and I were just talking about this
how many of you go into the archive and
look at something after the fact because
maybe you don't have time maybe you
should be doing that instead of
listening to me but you're here so
that's good for me so you because you
are Google you know what Google does
online i'm sure you also know what
flickr does online but just um i thought
i would put a little flicker up just to
as an example so so i can look at beach
and i can get a lot of beach pictures
people have tagged very nice i can look
at what tags people have made and how
popular they are and i can go to these
tags and i can get some more pictures of
beach but the pictures don't unless i'm
part of that social engagement who wants
to tag and see my pictures come up they
don't really help me there's nothing
here that's going to make me want to go
into those pictures or is going to show
me what might be coherent with some
other picture I have so for instance if
I have a picture of a beach and I have
my my grandkids building a castle and I
remember there was some dye flying a
kite down the beach but I didn't capture
the guy flying the kite so I have to
make a very specific query of
person kite whatever in order to come to
a picture that doesn't even know whether
it matches the pictures that I have and
would look good next to it so that's
that's sort of where we are today except
YouTube and Google it's great that that
people can post their videos I think
that that's great there's a lot of
repurposed content on this that's not
really the content on the most
interested in actually so here's
something I did while ago Seymour Papert
had a workshop in 19 in 2003 and instead
of we've done a lot of media blogs at
that point we just put media into the
blog and you post the blog and people
would comment out it on it and by the
way I think it's very curious that it
took almost 10 years to have a calendar
state come up as a sort of a storage
archiving interface for media but that's
part of the web but in this piece we
documented in detail see more and
Jacques d'Amboise I'll show you a little
video although that's was a really bad
idea by accident the first date you
didn't see it but someone went behind
the screen so that's all silhouette
Jacques d'Amboise 1xe several we're
going to do that but that's that's on
Saturday welcome says they will play
with those things ah but this they're
basically is that if we can get the
music the light and these things with
the dancers activated that's gonna take
so much time ok I'm going to just pause
that I apologize for that I didn't
realize that how to click on it but
there there are about 250 300 of these
sequences that document the 12 day
workshop
in great detail the idea was that the
kids would wear sensors on their body
and as they dance they be able to
control lighting and music that they had
made and graphics and by the end of this
they got to make their own dance and
there's a lot of discussion about
whether it was too much of a top-down
teacher or whatever but the interesting
thing is how could you go into that
collection and just get five clips that
tell you what a day in that workshop was
like or the progress that were made or
what were the key issues so I'm going to
talk about three approaches that we have
right now to that that I'm working on in
media one is common sense reasoning
which applies to this particular problem
then I'll talk a little bit about some
audio time-lapse work and finally I'll
talk about a rich media construction kit
and so in two thousand about two
thousand and one push Singh who was for
a very short time faculty at our lab
developed something called open mind an
open mind the idea was that everybody in
the world could use the web to put in
common sense because otherwise how are
we going to get all of this thing all
these things that everybody knows but
the computer doesn't know so at the same
time my student barbara barry was
thinking about well what if you're a
documentary filmmaker in the world could
we use this common-sense back the other
way and give you a suggestion about what
to shoot and what's nice about the work
that she did if you think about it
because i'm going to talk about it from
the camera aspect a little bit but it
flips back the other way so once you've
used the camera and annotated from the
camera stuff anything that the camera
learns about what you were shooting is
already you can call it metadata or
anything you want but it's attached to
the video and it can then be used by a
system so the camera look like this it
was a sony camera with a computer and
when you take in a shot you annotated
the shot as
briefly as you wanted to and the system
used to resources one was open mind
concept net which is a set of concept so
you can look at this and you wake up and
where do you wake up you wake up in bed
what was the last sub sub event to get
out of bed what happens after would you
drink some coffee stuff like that it's
just everyday life that has been
collected from these millions of people
on the web and then put into them parsed
then cleaned parsed manipulated and put
into a semantic net and in addition
there was a resource called life net
which was this is an activity you did on
life now which was you could add to a
list of things that you associated with
something was sort of like a game you
could put true or false by different
assertions on you could put suggestions
and the idea was to come up with short
scripts like I awake I feel hungry so
ways that we could think about how
people act in the world she went out and
filmed some marathons and used the
camera and so the camera was then
suggesting to her given what she said
was happening what were other things
that might happen that would move her
story along like if she saw runners who
were exhausted the system might tell you
that runners get hypothermia they need
to be warmed at the end of their run
runners celebrate at the end of the run
and so on it turned out we had a lot of
information in the network on marathons
so it was a very clunky first step and
one of the things we discovered was that
the concept net was really too low level
to use well so she's gone on to build
something called story net which is just
going into its second
phase two have people actually build
little stories on the web that our
little sequences and as we get many
sequences we can use them to think about
what is this story that you're
describing over here like we also made a
comic kid this was kind of fun people
what we hoped was people would make
these comics and the common sense system
would propose to them different things
in the world that they might manipulate
given the story that they were telling
so in this case you have a happy person
who has found a seed and then the system
goes and says well what are you likely
to do with the seed and one thing you
might be likely to do is pick it up
before you plant it and it's a type of
system that suggests things within the
common sense and as you grow out the
story that you're telling common sense
learns from you so it's a two-way story
when Barbara looked at the robe la
situation she also just theoretically
parsed how it might work if we had a
strong story net to bring out multiple
clips and today i'm working with a
student Edward Chen and his idea is that
you put a story in and you get a story
out now I'm not sure that this is a good
way to go because you don't know what's
in the collection if you know a little
bit what's in the collection or have
some expectation it might be a
reasonable way to go in the UI in this
case we type in Jacques makes a dance
and we get back now each of these clips
that we put into the blog that I didn't
say before we described with a very
short amount of text so the system is
using that short amount of text that we
put in and it's very little consumers do
not like to annotate stuff unless it's
sort of in a game form but it's your own
media content you're digitizing it
you're probably willing to just put in a
little bit of material we have some
other work that we're doing in the
comments
area that assumes that we can pull from
your emails and your calendar and other
ways of getting that but I think you
might not mind putting a little piece of
texted so in this case once you've
started in the first case jock makes the
dance the system goes in and sees what
made it find about making a dance and in
fact it doesn't know anything about the
main character so it gives you lots of
examples of different people who are
making dance you can go on and select
one of those and then make a new line
and so you're sort of building a story
with the system this is promising it's
not yet ready for prime time there are a
lot of issues like I said how do you
know what story to make but it's a start
okay we'll switch gears a little bit
another project I'm working on has to do
with the idea that there's a lot of work
that assumes if we take data like of
this room so there's a lot of things
that happen in this room and somehow you
could make a story out of it how do we
do that if you really have everything
that happens in this room for 24 hours
this is sort of like the deb roy problem
although deb roy is trying to look at
how a child learns language my student
is looking at how do you design objects
that have this capability just because
you can so a lot of people get down and
they say well why do you want to object
that's recording audio and making a
history of itself well she derives from
things like the way we value art and say
if their transactions that happen they
might not just be ownership transactions
they might be that this bench has
witnessed a lot of fun times so i would
like to sit on this bench or i would
like to have this bench right now she is
working on a bench is about the fourth
project she's done she assumes lots of
things happen on the bench she
instruments the bench with microphones
capacitive sensors and speakers and then
the problem is how do we when you sit
down and you're quiet for a while if the
bench wants to talk to you what should
it say so basically we are looking for
at a system that allows a event
detection matches the event with an
event signature and a classification and
can then create what we call you no
audio time-lapse which is quite
different from a visual time-lapse so
I'll just play these in sequence so you
can get a little flavor of this it's
sort of a weird project here in media
lavish so this is the original audio
stream
but have you going back to the three so
that's sort of real-time quite an ER
ever seen the Disney or two
so this is the machetes taking catalyst
or wait for Milly sorry I went by
there's a lot of you i'm here to lie
this is just compressing the whole thing
that is sort of a standard rate and this
is using her current system
bbiab a
I don't know if you can hear a home I
wonder if it's maybe something on the
top four you notice
ok
in my particular case I went the bios
you get as a undergrad you get a free XP
oh so you don't really get any climax in
this approach but what you get is things
that the system thinks our extraordinary
events and they're mixed in with sort of
ordinary ambience and I think it's an
approach that for long time collections
of lots of data is interesting approach
and she's defending her thesis probably
in three months time so hopefully it
will get a lot better by then but it's
sort of a typical odd media lab project
to think of designing objects that have
this kind of history the audio
time-lapse piece has a has implications
for any kind of video reporting where
you want to go into the audio track and
actually cut from the audio track the
last piece I wanted to show you was sort
of what we're doing in media
construction kits so this is called
confectionary it's a drag-and-drop
interface on the web that allows you to
upload movies images audio and create
graphics and text and put those together
and the system collect creates a flash
file for you and the publication
environment allows each piece of media
you put up to be tagged with what what
is called the Creative Commons we're
using the Creative Commons license so
you can say who can use it you can say
where came from who can use it and
behind each piece of media you'll be
able to look for that so that starts to
get at this problem that everybody wants
to protect their media it doesn't quite
get at the problem because NBC or warner
brothers are still not going to love you
if you clip some of their sound file of
some voice and put it over some other
type of content the other thing this
web environment does is it allows people
to mentor other people in telling a
story and so you can have a very private
place to build your story before you let
it out into the general world and so so
some people will have access to the
staged version of the story that goes
along and hopefully this will play a
little bit better just get rid of some
of this
sorry okay
so I'm going to show you budget eight
has an internship program for high
school and college students who result
history and photography and I think the
death qualified who have median writings
our detail-oriented and who also loved
learning by looking at all photos and we
did train something archival methods
that can be applied to other areas of
study as well okay i'm going to show you
one of my favorites is somebody telling
the story of her mother and father city
so in that piece we're trying to break
up a frame in my brother me my father of
my mother this was taking armenia 1993
this is a good picture I loved boy who
had been in the US for four days and
wound up at a workshop at MIT where he
didn't really I mean he speaks ok
English but he really couldn't
understand everything so he just watched
his his older brother learned to edit
and he learned to edit and he made
something and all of these kids were
really missing their homeland this was
an eleven-year-old girl who had just
come also from Armenia so this
this environment is shortly going to be
live I think within about a month for
anyone to use and then in particular
we're going to use it within the
Armenian community to look at whether we
could build a people's history whether
there'd be enough interest of people to
put in their life stories and for other
people to build pathways on top of that
so rather than have a historian which is
the typical way histories are written as
you have a single person they look at
events they tell you how it was to have
everybody contributing to how they see
something and then use an ability of
other people to make pathways through
that content and say this is how I see
this collection which if it works and
you know you never know will be I think
pretty exciting so so I want to just
mention a couple of things in what's
next I just mentioned the confectionery
is going to go live fairly shortly we
have story net to coming is being
designed the architecture for it is
being a design now and we're going to be
focusing on how to collect knowledge
about intention and goals and also
sequence examples and then finally a
100-dollar laptop has a particular issue
and the hundred-dollar laptop I put them
up like this I see I made a little
mistake in the photo shop this morning
but I'm rather than thinking of them as
one machine it's much more interesting
if you can kind of conceive them as a
connected as sort of connected hubs of
machines where people in a particular
neighborhood or region are thinking and
sharing things together trying to solve
problems one of the issues that it's
raised as if we deploy many many of
these how do we help people not get
stuck or actually help them break out of
some idea that they get
how do we get them to a new idea for
something and to give you an example of
that David Cavallo when he was working
in guess it was when he was working in
Thailand he was doing a workshop with
some kids and there was a girl who had
to go home every night she had to go to
her parents home she had to turn the
lights on for a particular agricultural
situation in order to increase the
amount of daylight hours and then she
would have three hours where she could
do anything else and then she'd have to
go back and turn off the light in order
to save electricity she figured out that
using a small cricket she could do that
remotely I mean it seems probably to us
fairly obvious but it's not necessarily
obvious and kids a lot of time solved
this kind of problem for themselves and
their family if they're given the right
tools but how do you think about that
and how do you think about mentoring
that kind of innovative use of the
laptop so we're collecting a large
collection of materials that we've
developed over workshops different times
and then that architecture is going to
allow anybody in any of the hubs to put
in their own information because one of
the things we've learned is the kids if
they can document as they go along can
tell a pretty good story but they need
something that allows them to do that
documentation and the hope is that some
of the really good stories will bubble
up and then become the things that other
people look at so I mean that's a pretty
familiar scenario today but this is just
a particular problem area that we're
looking at that content so that's sort
of what I have to tell you today and any
questions I'm happy to discuss stuff
yeah
how do you feel the media lab doing
today it seems to be like back in the
early nineteen
it was just very exciting it sort of on
the cutting edge and then it sort of
went through a louse or at the end of
the 90s in there and now you have a new
director I mean what's your put your
outlook feeling good about it yeah I I
am I'm oh okay repeat the question the
question is about the Media Lab the
suggestion was that it was a very
exciting place to be in the late 80s
Early 90s and then I went into a sort of
a low period a difficult period for it
and the question is how is it doing
today I think I tried to characterize
this idea of the human-machine
partnership which is the idea that isn't
exclusive to the media lab I mean
there's no we're not exclusive in the
space anymore and I think that that is
well recognized but I think that we have
incredible synergy and overlap between
people who are doing who have very
different long-term visions for how
these technologies are going to affect
us and I think that those larger scale
works are growing fast in the lab which
is a little bit different it's still a
lot of little examples but there's also
these larger sort of initiatives and so
I feel very good about it um you know
it's sort of I'm sort of at a point
where I won't be there full time for
that much longer but i think it's it's
they're starting to be a very good
synergy and discussion and we're
starting to get a lot more undergrads
again which was one of the things that
happened in the low there stop being as
many undergrads engaged in the lab and I
think Frank's doing a great job in
getting us to talk to each other so
sorry I think it's a stay tuned
situation and certainly being at this
Institute where this company right now
is a fabulous place to be I mean it's a
very very exciting time in a company
that's really changing on how people are
using
media and what it means to put these
this next generation of media together I
was telling Eric actually that I work I
do a little bit of work in New Orleans
I've been connected with New Orleans for
a long time and what I'm doing now is
trying to have kids design the urban
environment or be part of that design
process because otherwise they're even
totally out of the political process
it's pretty much of a disaster down
there right now just simple story and
you know we are working with
architecture firm that uses Sketchup so
I knew that Google had purchased
Sketchup and all of a sudden I see
sketchup with Google Earth wow that's
really a fun new different way to think
about building media environments with
pretty easy to use tools so that those
aren't going to be the type of projects
you're going to see come out of the lab
today I think the common sense effort in
the lab if we can really pull that
together and it's something that I'd
like to talk more to Google about
because i think it's it's really a very
promising way to look at a meaningful
story building what's your name Bob lo
ok is from google news and he's saying
there are lots of people building news
stories and then there are people
responsible for trying to get those
stories into a common framework and
wouldn't it be really great if there was
a common framework and how might you go
forward and I think that that's a type
of problem that the lab that the getting
a dialogue going with the lab becomes
really interesting because you know if
you I think that it I personally think
if you can really harness the common
sense work even up to the point that we
have it you have a lot of bandwidth in
how you how you look at evolving news ok
that's one thing the second issue of
formatting
as complicated one because the question
is how much do you want a top-down
approach I was talking to somebody at
NBC yesterday and I was at CNN when the
head office of CNN was five people and
CNN leveraged a totally new organization
for making news because there were only
five people and no union contracts
everybody was a stringer and four of my
students at that time were stringers for
CNN which meant you went out you made a
story you thought was interesting you
sent it in and it ran or it didn't run
and they got pretty good at being able
to have some dialogue with the stringers
to find out what was being made so they
could sort of predict when a story was
coming in if it was a story that they
really wanted and of course eventually
everything was formatted and their
archive that was a mess in the beginning
just absolute wreck became very
structured because they found that the
archive had value and and so it goes you
know but but that's it that may be a
equilibrium that doesn't happen the
first day out of the box because there
are different formats out there but but
I think that that's maybe even solvable
but I would hate to see it look like you
know what CNN became finally was a very
formatted regimented news like every
other news and you almost never and any
of these new shows really see what
happens I come out of a documentary
tradition that says you know situate the
camera or situate the storyteller some
place where they can evolve and make a
story about what is really happening and
that's hard to do when you get to top
them so I'd love to talk more about that
it's a it's a fascinating problem
any other ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
