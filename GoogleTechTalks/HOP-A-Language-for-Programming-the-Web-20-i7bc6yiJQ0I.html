from inria in nice and he's here to
speak about the hop programming language
and what he's built using that okay so
thanks Arthur so do we have to speak
close to the microphone okay so my name
is Manuel Serrano as Arthur said I'm
coming from France thousand friends in
security police i work at ania where I'm
the leader of a new research team called
and which isn't happening for diffuse
and secure computing and we aimed at
developing theories languages and tools
for building differs application and
this is one of these tools what I'm that
I'm going to demonstrate today so it is
absolutely abuse to say that from the
beginning of computer science computers
have been evolving all the time
obviously as everybody knows they are
becoming faster and faster smaller and
smaller and cheaper and cheaper and the
important point for us here is that with
each new generation of computers you can
imagine new kind of application you can
envision new application that you want
to write clearly with an iphone you
don't want to write the same kind of
application as with a prayer computer
and yet we are just as a beginning of a
new area a new revolution in computer
science because up to now application
were meant to be executed on one
computer which was a dedicated user and
from now on it's different in the past
we used to be implementing applications
that were just dedicated for computer
that was running on that computer and
that was sometimes and really T to any
real world and from now on things are
different because as I said previously
computers are now for instance mobile
phone as well as mp3 players which means
just object that you have in the common
eyes and even more than that new
computers are digital camera you can
talk to your camera with a Wi-Fi
connection maybe's are also in your TV
set if your TV set is recent enough
maybe your wristwatch is also provided
with a computer he is by itself a
computer if you have a Rueter Adam it's
also a computer
so this means that we are just
surrounded with computer and yet this is
just a big beginning of something
already you can control the light of
your apartment with a computer you can
probably control also the oven and the
shutter of your windows up fully one day
you will need maybe you will be able to
control your vacuum cleaner with a
computer and this means that actually so
house we live in and the car we drive
are just full of computers and now we
are surrounded with computers and the
idea is to write new application for
this environment we are no longer
interested in programming individually
each of this device but we want to write
applications that are bred them all at a
time and so from a computer scientist
point of view this raise an interesting
question of programming languages
because more or less application filled
demands dedicated dedicated programming
languages for instance if you want to
write a floating quite intensive
application probably you will use a
language like Fortran if you want to
implement a GUI for a desktop computer
such as this one and if you are
adventurous enough maybe you will use a
language like c++ if you want to control
an airplane most likely you will avoid
C++ and probably prefer a language like
Esther rail and now the question is if
you want to write a difference
application for this environment and one
more time the problem is no longer to
address individually each of these
device but it's true right application
that embrace them all at a time which
long well we will you choose and so as a
small step in this direction of
providing new language we have designed
hub that is exactly meant for
programming this application so hoping
some key word is just a system that lets
you write distributed diffuse
applications and run on versatile
architecture loose architecture poly
specified this application may be
designed for single user or for military
users it's just up to you the kind of
field we are interested in our mostly
multimedia house automation and sharing
and we see that this three application
sale will probably merge because in the
future are probably there won't be many
difference in between the house
automation application
and the communication and sharing
because you want to mix all this
together and so from a technical point
of view what up he is nowadays it's a
programming language and an execution
platform so the idea of the
implementation er up is if you want to
write diffusion epica to this
application you have to be provided with
an infrastructure for that and exactly
for that we have the web which is
already there and which is also already
which is already sorry the big fetus so
the idea of up is clearly to reuse the
web not to provide something for the web
but we use a web so if you want
something like a metaphor app actually
uses the web as a virtual machine which
means that we will compile up to the web
technologies so compelling hop to web
technologies means for us that hub will
be a hundred person compatible with the
web and so instantly we will be able to
reuse everything that is designed and
developed for the web so we will be able
to take benefit of the entire web but
that's not only it up being a
full-fledged programming language we are
also able to implement new protocols web
protocols such as HTTP that kinetically
with hot but also new protocols for
instance if you want to write a
multimedia application maybe you might
be interested in implementing protocol
for controlling an eye-fi system such as
MPD if you want to write a house
automation implementation maybe you want
to write extent protocol or sing like
that and since one more time hut is a
full-fledged programming language you
can implement this protocol in hub so
since hot views the web in a slightly
unusual way I would like to spend a
couple of minutes explaining what are
the difference between the traditional
web and hop web so on that picture you
see the traditional web you have a just
a bunch of clients you have a server and
on the back end you have a database
with her we introduce a fourth player
which is a broker that goes in the
middle in between the client and the
server here when I say clients actually
I'm in a web browser so now your client
no longer address a remote server but it
address broker that in turn will connect
to a server when needed clearly the
brokers a good place for implementing
mash up because since everybody knows
your web browser is not a load to up a
new connection to remote server you have
to be provided with someone else that
opens a connection for you and the
broker could be hit but it is also it is
possible to write measured with up and
maybe it's convenient to write measured
without it is not what up is meant for
up is meant for controlling your
electronic environment so this means
that heart is able to communicate with
your eye file system with your TV set
with your mobile phone etc etc it is
able to communicate with these devices
either because you are running also
another broker on the device and the two
bloggers are able to communicate or
because as I've said before up as
implemented of protocols that let it
talk with one with individually each of
this device for instance MPD for talking
with your eyes I system and when you
want to write an application with up
maybe you are still interested in
fetching data from remote server for
instance if you want to write a
multimedia application maybe at some
point you will be interested in getting
the pictures of the cover of the cover
album you are currently listening so for
that you still need to be able to
address remote server so how control
your environment but still it is able to
communicate with remote server at the
end till the broker is also a full
fledge web server it is able to
communicate not only with one client but
with a community of client which means
an intranet and typically if you want to
write an application for instance for
controlling the music that you are
playing in an apartment maybe you will
want that all the members of the family
and the people that are in the apartment
be able to control the music so you want
actually to design dynamic intranet and
that the kind of thing hub can do for
you so before presenting the language
just to application to illustrate the
kind of thing where
twisted in so the first application is
about house automation and since this
application requires a lot of devices
that I cannot go with me I just show you
a small video clips that give you an
idea of what this application is here so
we have implemented the extent protocol
in hub exam is a protocol that uses a
power line to address device you have in
your apartment typically the lights
eating systems or shutter a thing like
that up can be used to control the
equipment but it can also be used to
react to events so we have implemented x
10mm also sorry extend rely on small
devices such as the one you see here
which are very cheap equipment each
device in new roc would cost something
like 50 more or less so it's really
affordable it's not extremely reliable
but still you can do interesting thing
with it and so we have implemented dicks
10 in hub and instantly we are now able
to control our electric equipment with
web interface and that's what we are
playing here we are with a web interface
switching on and half the lights that is
just on the right part of the screen and
we are doing the same thing with our
mobile phone we are just controlling the
equipment and you will see since we are
also able to react to event we are for
instance able to implement intruder
detection and things like that only
using web technologies and web browser
so that what you see here the movement
have been detected and brother react
about it so something on the mobile
phone so this is one application first
application so related to our automation
so I will try to stop it ok so now the
second application i would like to
illustrate it is this time a multimedia
application so the idea is here that in
a personal apartment mine actually i
have somewhere in the apartment a
network attached storage which is this
evil evil available on the network which
contained just my musics and then i can
come up and grab any device
any electronic device I have at home and
control the music for instance I'm able
to go to my bedroom grab my mobile phone
and say please this album and raise the
volume then i go to my kitchen I grab a
PDA and I say no longer playing the
bedroom but now play the music in the
kitchen then I go in the living room and
I say raise the volume and change of
music and you see on this application
the specificity is that the architecture
is really dynamic that it you can come
up with your device switch it on switch
it off at any moment they can appear
disappear and and that's it and the
architecture and the application work
like that so to give you an intuition of
what it looks like the application if
you are using a device that as a screen
large enough you will be presented with
an interface like that where you can
just select the music you want to play
so let's play classical music let's
select back for instance and the concert
oh so maybe you can hear it I we all
just change that I don't know if you can
hear it but my computer is now playing
music and we can see it over there right
I'm just playing music nothing very
fancy and nothing very unusual about
that now I will simulate the fact that a
new device arrives and in that case a
mobile phone so a mobile phone as a
small stream so it cannot afford a
graphical interface with so many details
so maybe my mobile phone we use an
interface like that and now you see the
point is that from my mobile phone I can
select a different sound and my hint of
faith behind is have dated automatically
and I can stop now the music and once
again my interface behind is
automatically updated so i have a strong
synchronization in between all this
interface and so in my application my
multimedia application every body sees
the same thing everybody is aware of the
same information at the same time so how
is that implemented mainly all device
that exports some musical contents are
equipped with a web broker that is a hub
broker that is if you want to provide a
musical
tense you have to embed a broker on your
device if you want only to control the
music you just need to be provided with
us let's say a web interface so on this
picture here you see this guy as just is
just used for controlling the music
while this one is providing music and
this means that in these settings you
can come in my apartment with your
mobile phone and if you have some music
in your phone and if you are providing
if you are running a hot broker on your
phone then I will be able to listen to
your music on my I file system same
thing I will be able to watch your
photograph that are on your mobile phone
on my TV set for instance that the kind
of thing we are able to do if you just
want to control one more time you don't
need to be provided with a broker but
only a web interface so that's it for
the application and now some slide about
the real thing which is the programming
language behind the scene so programming
with hub means mostly programming the
relationship in between the client and
the broker so what does it looks like a
hot program third you have to understand
the general idea of the execution of our
program every up program executing
parallel on at least two different
engines one engines is here for
computing and one engine is here for
interfacing which means that we have
really an parallel execution we have to
heap to stack but only one shared
namespace so this means also that we
have in between the client and the
broker we have your program and you just
in your unique source code you annotate
the part that are dedicated to the
client and you annotate the part that
are dedicated to the broker in this
picture the red part are for the client
and the blue part our Father a broker
and of course what up provides is
convenient mean for the red part refer
to the blue part and also the other way
around so because we are able to refer
to the other side we are able to write
compile compact source code actually so
now the real saying them since you still
know HTML you already still know or you
already know how because switching from
HTM
to help is just a matter of syntactic
transtech translation at first glance
you goes from HTML to hub by simply
inserting an open parenthesis in front
of your HTML opening markup and you get
rid of your closing HTML markup and you
replace it with a closing parenthesis
and that's it you're done you have your
first or program of course that's not
the entire staff and I'm cheating a
little bit when I say that because if
you want to do some interface with HTML
you have to implement client-side
actions and these are implemented in
JavaScript so if you are using
traditional web technologies each
program contest at least two different
languages HTML and JavaScript with up we
get rid of that because we have up and
hop up on the both side the only thing
you have to do is before the expressions
that are to be executed on the client
you introduce marker which is still
design that means to this that means
that the following expression will be
executed on the client and not on the
broker so here I am so now what about
generating documents if you want
generate document with traditional web
technologies you will need to use
something different another language
typically something like PHP so what you
will do is inside you HTML document you
will embed PHP markup that we will
produce a mad put some output that will
be string containing HTML well form
hopefully HTML that will contain well
form a bully JavaScript expression with
up to get rid of that because since up
is a full-fledged language you can just
compute on the broker and you can just
create your abstract syntax tree which
represent interface you want to build
and you will ship that to the client and
now the idea is that you build you
elaborate your interface on the broker
but the valuable use and your broker can
be using the client too and here in this
example for writing the so to source
code are exactly equivalent that uses
dynamically produce table of three
elements of three rules sorry for the
app version what we do is we create here
a list of three element and then we
iterate with this iterate or map over
the element of the list and so this
variable i is successively bound to the
value 1 2 3 and you see that this i is
used here on the broker to construct the
interface that is it is a content of the
table data which is here and it is also
used on the client to display an alert
message when we will click on this table
data so I is used on the broker and on
the client and so you see that the till
design delay an expression to the client
and the dollar sign goes the other way
around it's lets you refer to broker
expression from the client side so now
one once again since up is a
full-fledged programming language you
want to use it for realistic program you
need to be able to do some abstractions
so you want maybe to define your own
widgets and so you can define in hub new
widget and new markup just by defining
new function so you can see here that we
define a new markup row which is just a
combination of table data in table row
that we use here at any regular market
so it means that actually HTML it's just
a pre-loaded library in hub and every
markup is just a function so now some
live live demonstration to to give you a
stronger intuition of what the language
looks like so I run the demo and I
explained the source code afterwards the
first one is the first demo is really
simple quite stupid actually it's just
open a new window and went to mouth
flies over the words they disappear
except the light which the last one
which is great so this is stupid but
this is a live demonstration and what I
can do for instance is I can edit the
source code of my demonstration I can
replace the world lady by man I can use
this new version and I can rerun the
demo and now this is a man that
disappears so you see the entire system
is dynamic and everything is evolving
dynamically so r is a simple idea
we actually have only three words The
Lady Vanishes that are placed in boxes
and we implement user action which just
makes it to first where disappears and
the last one just to be go back and
that's it for the first demonstration
quite simple the second one is slightly
more complex I will run the demo first
and explain the source code after world
so the demo is just a list of three
elements and I click on this button and
I just rotate the element of the list so
this demo is absolutely useless but you
can imagine a more realistic one which
is a table with rows that you can sort
according to the colon so some
demonstration this one is useful the
last one is useless so all is that
implemented on the broker side we create
a list of three element fubar G which is
bound to a variable al here this al
variable is used is placed in a in a box
then we add a button with a message
rotate and each time we click on the
rotate button we grab this list that
were built on the broker and we flip the
elements so you see on this example that
we have a data structure here that is
used once on the broker and three-time
on the client and that another
specificity of up to let you reuse the
data structure on the both hands so the
previous example was not involving any
communication in between the client and
the broker once the program has been
installed on the client of course for
some realistic application you need to
be provided with a mean for
communicating with a broker and for that
we have special functions special broker
function that we can invoke from the
client so when you define a function
with this keyword service you can invoke
it from the client with this keyword
sorry with this keyword wheels up here
and so you invoke a service and when the
service complete you invoke this
callback where RV is bound to the result
of the service invocation so how does it
work I run the demo once again this
demonstration is what is just a web
interface for scanning my disk so when I
click on this button it tells me that
my / TMP currently I have this fight and
their size is as follows so r is that
implemented we have created one of the
service here which except one parameter
dear so we first on the gooey side we
create an empty box a larger one where
we put everything we add a button with a
do dash sk message each time will click
on this message on this button sorry we
invoke the service defined here with the
value the actual value / the mps
parietal for dia this service actually
scan the disk elaborate a list made us
five names here and file size send it
back to the client the client grabs this
list and create the table with stable
rule table header and table data and
that's it so you see we have exchanged
here data structure in the in both
direction we have sense left hand p to
the broker and the brokers and back list
containing strings and integers and we
could have decided to move this table
construction into the broker side and
actually it's up to the programmer to
decide where you want to put your
program do you prefer to put it on the
broker side or do you prefer to put it
on the client side it's just up to you
the only thing that you cannot move from
the broker to the client are these two
function here and the reason the reason
why you can't move them to the client
side it's because this to function
actually scans the disk so the note that
not even exist on the client so now I
would like to explain how we enforce the
interface synchronization in the
multimedia application and so for that I
will just use two three slides so once
again I run the demo and explain the
source code after a while this
demonstration is absolutely abuse I
create a new window which contain a
canvas and then when i click on the
canvas i draw lines on my interface
pretty obvious r is it working I have a
canvas which is just defined here and
then I add an event listener to mouse
down even
each time the mouse is clicked a line is
drawn from the last position of the
mouse to the current position pretty
obvious pretty regular and a single
fancy here now I will slightly extend
this example and i will add a new
listener to my canvas so i add this new
listener I preserve the previous one and
I add this new one and what I do here is
each time the mouse is clicked in
addition to drawing 19 I call a service
function which broadcast an event to all
the clients that are interested and then
on below I create to user interface that
we'll just wait for this draw even here
so I run the demo and I explict explain
the client code just after one so this
time my demonstration just spawned three
windows and when I click on this one all
the web interfaces are updated so you
see I have a strong synchronization in
between all my web interfaces so how is
it implemented I close that so we have
one extension to the traditional dumb
event model which is this new kind of
event here called server event in the
previous slide that I've used mousedown
event and now i'm using this server
event and so this means that all the
clients registered to the server event
named row and when they receive this
event that just draw a line which is
provided as the event is provided with a
value which describes a mouth position
and so that's it that's the way i
implement synchronization in between all
my interface so now some word about the
implementation of up you start with a
source code that looks like that and we
have three different execution engine
involved for executing this program
first on the broker side we use by code
interpretation for all this blue part
then we have a client-side compiler that
take all the client-side expression
that compares it to JavaScript and then
we have native code compiler that is
able to compile your library so all the
built-in function are compiled to native
code so your program executing your
program involves running this compiler
and using all these different execution
mode so what about the bytecode
interpreter nothing very much to be said
here it is not very fast bike on
interpretation but that's not a big
problem because your bytecode
interpreter is fully compatible with
native code competition so you can call
native code from bytecode and visa versa
so if you need to be filled with us you
can pre compile your code and that's it
and the way we the reason why we use a
bike on interpretation it's just because
of the short development time the short
development cycle you know you don't
need to compile anything to run your
program you just load it on the server
and that's it you're ready you can run
so no computation is a deployment that's
the reason why we are still using the
bytecode interpreter also it is slow so
for the next version what we do is for
the architectures that let us embed the
compiler we will on the fly compile the
program's the first time you load it so
this way we will have native code speed
even for pause this part of the broken
broke execution so now the client-side
compiler so this compiler compiles up to
JavaScript and it's fully compatible
with JavaScript which means that you can
call javascript from hub and you can
also call up from JavaScript we have
decent performance for the client-side
computation which means that more or
less you pay no overhead because you are
using the hub compiler that is a rub
compiler deliver source code that has
the same performance as unwritten
JavaScript code on some micro benchmark
here you can even see that hot is faster
than JavaScript and this is it for the
bag program here and the reason why I
hope is that faster than JavaScript it's
simply because bag is
program written in the hop style with
smooth function and it's absolutely
mandatory that your compiler is able to
inline the small function and clearly
JavaScript there from knowing lining so
it is strongly penalized by the fact of
not in lining this model function but so
this benchmark is no text is not is
organized not usual and in general so to
source code runs at the same speed as
you can see for the other programs so
now native code compilation more or less
the same story that we are slightly so
slower than see when we compared to
native code except for some benchmark
still bag for the very same reason there
is still the small functions that you
have to win line and GCC clearly is not
able to win lines multi function so that
way and sip on this program up is faster
but in general the performance of a
power between the same performance as C
and twice the ones I see more or less
that kind of performance we have now
some some word about the web server so
here we try to evaluate the performance
of the hub web server and the first test
we did was to measure its performance
for delivering small static files and
here we are just increasing the numbers
of requests we address per second to the
hot server or to all the web server
sorry and we measure their throughput
and what you can see here is that for
delivering small static file appears
mostly as good as all the major web
server such as apache light your tomcat
now for delivering larger static files
up is still pretty decent because it's
as you can see here faster than apache
and as the same performance as tomcat
significantly slower satellit but still
pretty decent another interesting part
for us is the dynamic aspect that is
when you want to deliver dynamic
document and what we did here we start
true we wrote sorry
all very simple program in different
languages up PHP Perl and we ran it on
several servers and we just measure the
throughput of the server and as you can
see up is significantly faster than any
server for delivering dynamic content
and the reason why I hope is faster
that's because you are embedding your
generator in the server you have no
barrier to front to cross when you want
to generate a dynamic document sorry so
no performance penalty and if you
compare the true source code here you
will see that more or less help at the
same performance for generating dynamic
document and generate ecstatic document
and this is not the case for the other
server so the problem here with tomcat
which is pretty slow is a memory problem
it's just that tomcat is running out of
memory so it is wiped out of memory and
so it is no longer able to deliver
anything so I think I'm almost done so
in conclusion hot peers an ongoing
project it is not complete yet it is not
polished enough yet we have some dark
corner and some black sides but still we
are able to implement a whole bunch of
application so we are using on a daily
basis some applications that are
implemented in hub and I won't
demonstrate them but for instance one of
the sadness application is up slide the
applications that I'm running right now
for projecting the slide so you can see
everything that I have been demonstrated
from the beginning is just web pages run
on my regular Firefox so you see this is
just my slides that I have been
presenting to you right now but with the
title of the window presented so we have
a whole bunch of application everything
is available on the web you can just
download it why one could be interested
in programming with up mainly because
there are not so many systems that let
you write this application we have
implemented hop and we have run up on
various devices such as pc mobile phone
PDA so it is quite portable and and
still reliable you can just download it
try it and try your own application it
is variable over there it is released
under the GPL license you can grab the
source code and do whatever you want to
do with it and that's it I'm done with
this presentation of of up yeah it's me
cute yeah yeah okay so the question is
what about security and what about
protecting your private data right so
right now we are they will wreak on
security and that's a true problem we
have the mechanism provided by the web
which means not that much we have
authentication provided by the web we
are able to implement HTTPS something
like that but that's clearly not enough
and for us this is just very strong and
important research topics and that one
of the goal of our research team to
study security in languages like up but
nowadays we have nothing but we this is
something we plan to work on so you're
right that's an issue
okay so just to repeat the question the
architect is the architecture of op such
as no clients can communicate directly
but they need to to interact as a broker
yes that's correct you you have to go to
a broker absolutely but we have
something like an architecture which is
not exactly client-server we are a mix
in between client server and
peer-to-peer because it's not that clear
who is the server and who is the client
for instance your mobile phone maybe the
server your PDA may be a client and the
other way around it will depend on your
application okay so first of all to
client could be connected to the same
broker you don't have to use one broker
per client it just up to you but if you
happen to have one client / Broker so
how does a broker communicate you mean
just by using HTTP for instance or
because you have implemented something
based on upnp for instance that lets to
broker discover itself and the
communicate like that or because you
have implemented your own protocol for
instance we have implemented the jabber
protocols we're able to communicate
using this protocol in between broker
it's really up to you but natively may
be another way to answer your question
you see this wizard form that is
dedicated to calling a broker you can
use it from a client of former broker so
as a broker i can with hub another
broker yeah
am i dealing with network failure right
right now prolly which mean by hands
with exception and time out which is
just a pain and which is just unreliable
so I have no good answer for that and
I'm aware also that this is a problem
and that we need a new construction in
the language for dealing with video I
agree with you and I was just speaking
about dark side of the language and
places where the language is not believe
that it is not polished enough and this
is one of this side of course yeah so
the question is is there a way to make
broker more declarative and imperative
up the nature of the language is a
functional programming language with
object-oriented extensions so you use it
in paratively or you can build
abstraction on top of hub let's just
help to you for instance we have we are
students that I've been working on
reactive extension on top of up so it's
not a limitation of hop up is just a
language you use it to where you want to
use it you build your own abstractions I
don't know if it is a very good answer
to your question
ok no more question yeah so have we
looked at legacy code and compatibility
between HTML Javascript and hops that is
the other way around the first answer is
if you are provided with JavaScript code
don't convert it to hop into up use it
as it is right now because it is fully
compatible with up so why bother ring
with translating it too hot for HTML
well we have not had the idea that it
could be useful to translate HTML to
help and so we have not looked at that
in particular but we are xml parser we
have HTML parser so we can just pass
your own source code and generate up
from it I think it won't be too
difficult because we have everything in
the language for that so probably we
will be even able even able to load in
the broker HTML source code and convert
it on the fly into abstract syntax tree
without anything else no more questions
yeah
yeah okay so I won't repeat I won't
repeat the question because it is a
little bit torrent for being repeated I
will just try to grab one example which
was just this one I guess okay so the
question is what about preserving the
semantics of scheme which ears that
variables are just locations and lexical
scoping so you're right hope is rooted
deeply and scheme so happiest an
extension scheme and we have a
call-by-value call-by-value semantics
when you stay on the broker or the
client but as soon as you cross this
boundary we have a copy semantics so
here we have this data structure which
is built here and when it is sent to the
client it is copied to the client so you
can have two clients running in parallel
and they won't be synchronized because
they use our own copy of the function
and when you call a function from the
broker to the client all there was a
rare round we use copy okay
no more questions okay so yeah one last
yeah yeah yeah so this language is
called links until done by Phil well
done any student so CID is not exactly
the same because first of all links is
based on on a mix of XML of ml and
xquery so its a mix of two languages
more or less the same kind of idea you
want to be able to call function from
the server and from the client and the
other way around and they use a
different approach because for instance
you are able to use every function on
both ends which means that you can call
a function that scans the disk from the
client and automatically you will
execute this code on the broker so say
they don't have this notion of functions
that are tagged to be executed on the
broker and tagged to be executed on the
client to compile our manage this for
you I don't have in mind exactly which
protocols they use when they call the
function that traverse the network
mundari and I don't remember exactly if
the implement sharing or if the
implement copy I I should have just
reread the paper before coming here but
I don't remember so I can't answer you
but what I remember is that you don't
write your annotation on your program is
a compiler that manages that for you and
so you don't have the equivalent of this
with up construction you just call a
function whatever it is and it's on the
declaration of the function that you say
it is a functional okay
this happened to broker but at the cool
side you have no annotation so it also
means that the grant granularity is
different because in length you'd say
that this function is a poorer cursor is
a broker function and that's it or you
says this function is a client function
but we cannot as we do here declare just
expression that are belonging to one
side it's the boundary is just a
function declaration not the expression
and well set the main differences as far
as I remember okay so this is something
why I have cheated when I said that you
can say that a structure that's true you
can set that Astro to be at this moment
you cannot send functions so there is no
way to do that and I should have
mentioned it so that was a good question
okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
