talks and today we're going to talk
about basically a fancy way of saying
dependency injection but I don't want to
use the word dependency injection
because people kind of have preconceived
ideas of what it is so instead let's get
to the basics and talk about what
exactly why exactly certain things make
code really really hard to test in order
to test the method the first thing you
have to do is instantiate it and that
seems like something very very obvious
but it turns out that people tend to put
all kinds of crazy things in the
constructor which makes the
instantiation process really really
difficult not only do they put things in
the constructor people put code into
static initialization classes which
makes the code again even harder to
instantiate because the static
initialization class probably goes out
and reaches to some kind of singleton
expects it to be initialized and so on
and so forth so the first thing we have
to do in order to test any kind of
instance methods is to instantiate the
class all right let's get to some fun
code and let's talk about this thing
suppose you have a piece of code like
this and you want to instantiate a
document presumably document is used
somewhere else like let's say a printer
printer wants a document order printed
so the document says well I need a URL
and it goes on and instantiate an HTML
client and says hey HTML client would
you be so kind and go fetch this URL and
give me the content and now I'm gonna
save the content in my local field how
would you test this any suggestions and
from the audience
well you would have to write a test
server right you would actually have to
instantiate a web server that comes up
and you would have to set up the test
server with some document that you want
and then you have to instantiate the
document and then pass the URL that's
gonna have localhost to some port and so
on you anybody see a problem with this
how cumbersome the whole process is so
we need to do something about this to
make this thing easier to instantiate so
any suggestions
well what we can do is we can ask for
HTML client in the constructor and we
can say hey I need the HTML client and
in the test I can ask for a mock HTML
client and say hey I'm going to override
the get method and when you ask for a
URL I'm going to return you a document
that you we already need now the reason
why the previous slide we could have
could not have tested and that this
slide we have is that in the previous
slide we have simply instantiated
something that we wanted whereas in the
next slide we said we don't care about
how this thing gets instantiated always
say is we need one of these in order to
get our work done
ah and so this particular thing is a lot
more testable than the previous one
because I can always pass in a mock HTML
client but even though we can we get rid
of a server we still kind of have a
problem here and that is every time we
need to instantiate a document we have
to instantiate in a mock HTTP client we
have to prime it with it with an
expectation to get a call to a get and a
URL and so on and so forth and have a
prime to return the value which we want
so to make this thing better how about
we just get rid of the whole client that
get URL and instead we simply say the
document wants HTML that makes the
instantiation really really easy because
I can simply say new document ask for
the the HTML code that I want and shove
it into my field variable that I need
now the reason I know what I need is
because I think the stuff that I need is
what I save in my fields anything else I
ask in the constructor and I don't save
in the field it really means that I'm
only needing something from there in
order to traverse something where else
and fetch the stuff that I really want
so what you want to end up with is a
document like one over here which simply
says I need to match the m/l which you
can then store in a string now the
reason why this is important is because
you had a lot of other objects depend on
a document suppose you have a printer
and if you want to instantiate a printer
and test out a print list that you
presumably have to pass in a document
and would be really nice if I could
simply say new document passing the HTML
into the documents constructor which I
want to print and then test to see if
the printer works properly I don't want
to go and mock out all the pieces over
and over again but let's get back to
this doc this document over here for a
second what we're doing here is we're
mixing the object graph construction
with object lookup instead of asking
what we need we are constructing it
ourselves and I want to demonstrate this
through this particular class imagine
that just like a document you had a
class called the car and just like HTML
client you had a class called engine
factory and the car wanted to get a hold
of the engine in the previous class what
we did is we instantiated the engine the
diet of the HTTP client which in this
case is the engine factory now isn't
this a little bizarre that a car knows
how to build a factory and then asks the
factory to build an engine which then it
saves inside of itself I find this
rather bizarre but somehow when we are
dealing with abstract concepts such as a
document HTTP client and so on we easily
make this mistake and we don't kind of
notice this is a problem only when we
deal with concrete objects do we realize
just how silly it is for a constructor
to be asking for the factory or
something that produces something's that
are asking for the item directly
so again if you just ask for the things
that you want the construction becomes
really easy because at that point you
can simply call a new operator you
instantiate the object you pass in all
the references that you need and then
once you have the document you can
easily pass it into the printer or
anybody else that needs it now the
reason why this is important is because
there are many objects the tests are all
about instantiating small portions of
your application right it's the same
drill every single time you instantiate
a small portion of the application you
poke out the objects a little bit and
then you assert some output you
instantiate some other piece of portion
of the application poke at it and assert
some output and if the instantiation
portion is difficult you're going to
find it really hard to test different
pieces and even if it's not that if if
the document is difficult it's going to
be difficult to read document test it's
going to be anything it's going to be
hard to test anything which needs the
document directly or indirectly so it's
a kind of a transitive problem right so
one bad apple can really ruin it for
everybody else this is basically talking
about the test driver the the printer
and the document again in more detail
which simplifies right you simply
instantiate the test driver you
instantiate your printer you instantiate
your document and you pass the document
through the printer in the old setup you
would have to instantiate the document
the HTTP client which is your friendly
which would return the stuff that you
need into the document and then pass it
into the printer that just makes the
whole process a lot more convoluted and
difficult to deal with
so the first problem in testing is
really that the test has to successfully
navigate the constructor each time
instance is needed and therefore we
really really want to make sure that in
our tests the new the constructors are
really simple preferably ideally we
would like to have nothing but
assignments inside of the constructor
you simply ask for what you need and you
save it into your local variable in your
local field and you're done with it so
now let's look at something called a
service locator first of all how many
people know what service locator is okay
so service locator says basically well
there's all these objects which are
really hard to instantiate or hard to
get ahold of so maybe instead of
instantiating them directly or having
them as a singleton and we already
talked about how Singleton's are hard to
test we could maybe go and
store the responsibility of getting
these objects with a service locator and
then we simply pass a service locator
around that gives us the scene because
we can always override an operation or
service locator and then return the
object of interest the problem is that
the service locator encourages api's
which why ah you know because you simply
have a class that says I need the
service locator and then you look at the
api's without looking at the source code
and you say gee I wonder what I need to
override in order to make that class
testable and you have no idea you simply
they have to look at the source code or
you have to run the code to see where it
crashes in your test in order to figure
out what needs to be overwritten
it also becomes difficult to wire
different objects together in the test
because while in the constructor you can
simply say I need a B and C and then
simply instantiate those things with the
service locator you now have to
instantiate those things but you're not
quite sure in which order you have to
instantiate them in and then you have to
train the service locator to return them
in fundament and finally the service
locator violates the law of Demeter
instead of asking for the things you
want
you're always asking for the service
locator and then reaching through the
service locator to get the object of
interest so let's have a look what that
looks like by the way sometimes the
service locator is known as a context
and I just want to point out it is much
better paradigm than having a global
state where you store your Singleton's
in so it's much better than global
lookup at least your code is testable
but it's kind of hard to test and it
hides the true dependencies which are as
I pointed out it makes the api's lie
about what they actually do so let's
have a look suppose you have a house in
a house and the constructor says I need
locator what do we have to override and
a locator in order to construct the
house no idea you really need to know
what is inside of the constructor to
figure this out so if you know that you
have door window and roof in your fields
then you you can kind of figure out yeah
I see I need to override the get door
get window and get roof so from a
testing point of view well before we get
the test this is how the API lines right
this is what we mean by that it says all
I need is a service locator and
everything is happy from a testing point
of view you have to still instantiate
the door root roof and window but then
you have to instantiate the locator and
in some way you that have to set the
parameters on a locator or you have to
override the methods or depending on
whether it's an interface or not and
then it pass the house into it now
suppose a house all of a sudden had a
new dependency on let's say plumbing
well if you had any defense any on
plumbing then you would simply declare
the new constructor and you would
immediately know which tests do not
compile because now there's a new
parameter in the constructor and you
could go into those tests and then fix
them whereas if now house needs a
plumbing and reaches into the service
locator to fetch the plumbing everything
still compiles but random tests all over
the place are starting to fail and you
are not quite sure why it's not exactly
obvious that all of a sudden there is a
new dependency that was added and you
have to deal with them in the step
the other way of looking at the service
locator is basically that all the
objects basically suppose you wanted to
reuse the house and give it to somebody
else
that means you have to give the person
not just the house but also all the
compile-time dependencies so now house
depends on a service locator so now you
know you just you can't just give
somebody a house to reuse we also have
to give them the service locator but the
service locator knows about all the
other services and objects and cetera
whether the house needs them or not
the service locator knows about them so
now you have a problem that in order to
give somebody a house you have to give a
service locator in order to give a
service locator you have to basically
your home application not very reusable
so now let's look at it the same exact
thing but this time in the constructor
we specify things that we actually mean
we say we needed Oh door window and a
room I don't need to look into the
source code or run the code to kind of
figure out what I have to miss things ah
this is very obvious as a matter of fact
I can simply just look at the Javadoc
and say oh yeah that's kind of what I
mean kind of makes sense that the house
needs a door window in a roof yeah I can
see that and I'm simply going to go on
call the Constructors on these so our
test becomes much much nicer right all
that stuff
regarding service locator the overriding
or setting or whatever they just
disappeared and now we're just dealing
with what we want I personally prefer
this kind of API it makes it really easy
for me to instantiate objects and work
with them because when I instantiate a
house and a test I immediately know what
else needs to be instantiated not only
that I have a choice in my test whether
to pass a null for any particular object
or the real value suppose I'm testing
the painting method of the house
presumably I don't need a roof for that
so I simply can pass in a null for roof
and that basically tells the reader of
the test that if something goes wrong
you don't look into the roof that's not
where the problem is because I didn't
even give you one so the thing with
service locator is that we are mixing
the responsibility of object look up and
object creation and from a testing point
of view we automatically need either a
interface or we need to override it to
mock it or we need to have a service
locator which basically has a whole
bunch of setter methods where we can
externally set the dependencies and of
course as I pointed out anything which
depends on a service locator now depends
on everything else whether you like it
or not by the way people have lots of
different names for this thing so
sometimes they call the registry the
locator the context the manager the
handler the environment the principal
and so on and so forth right all
different names same exact idea not
asking for what you want but really
asking for these intermediate
object which then knows about the whole
world so now let's talk about law of
Demeter for a second so imagine you in
the store and the item you're purchasing
is 25 bucks
do you give the clerk a 25 bucks or do
you give the clerk your wallet and let
him retrieve the $25 yes Paul
give them your wallet you let them
retrieved 25 dollars why is that in the
form of a credit card in a form of a
credit card
yes oh I think most of us will agree
that if you really want to give the
cloak $25 right that makes it much
easier from a testing point of view as
well so let's have a look suppose you
have a purchase method and there's a
customer and the purchase method says
okay give me a customer and I'm gonna
reach into the wall and get the money
and I'm gonna record some sale or
something of that sort right now from a
testing point of view we need to now
create a customer so we need to create a
customer when you create a wallet and we
do shove money into the wallet and then
we can kind of test this I imagine this
thing it's kind of like imagining of a
haystack and like you properly position
it a needle somewhere in the haystack
and then it's it's an understanding
between you and the code that you know
how to traverse the haystack to get the
needle that you want right all this
stuff around it is really irrelevant I
mean nobody cares about the customer or
the wallet they just want the 25 bucks
but nevertheless we instantiate this
this monstrosity that goes around it in
order to get to there are $25 not very
interesting test not to mention there's
so many objects going on it's kinda hard
to figure out if anything goes wrong
what what is it went bad now what
happens if we change the purchase to
simply say hey I need the money
presumably $25 right from a testing
point of view this greatly simplifies
things right I no longer have to
instantiate the customer the wallet or
anything else
now this is kind of a toy example that
I'm placing up here but imagine in the
real world where the sensation
customer constructor doesn't just take a
wallet but takes ten other things right
so and suppose the customer insist on
having doing no checking to make sure
you can't pass a noise for all the other
parameters and suppose the constructor
does real work where it tries to
authenticate something from a database
right all of a sudden having the
previous test makes it really really
difficult because you have to pass in a
customer and you can't even construct
the customer because of all the things
we've talked about in previous half an
hour so really you really want to make
sure that you really just ask for the
objects that you directly need to get
your work done you certainly don't want
to ask for the intermediate object and
then reach through that object to get
the item that you want and fundamentally
that's what's wrong with the service
locator is that you're always asking for
something that you don't want or you
don't need directly only to retrieve the
things that you want out of it so the
law of the matter basically says you
should always ask for the objects you
directly need the ones you're going to
operate on the ones you're going to
dispatch methods on right the dead
giveaway is if you have a dot get dot
whatever right I mean typically we have
a service locator dot get customer
repository dot get customer buy ID pass
in 37
good luck testing that and so the
pendency injection is basically what
saves you from all this because it
allows you to have all the methods
simply ask for the object that you want
so here's a little myth that everybody
has and that is dependency injection
makes refactoring hard and the myth goes
that if a child object now needs a new
parameter then I have to pass it through
all of its parents that's what the myth
says or at least that's what people
first think about when you ask when you
say that all of the dependencies should
be declared explicitly in the
constructor however what what what this
myth is is missing is that if you are
passing something along just because
there's some child object that needs it
you're breaking the law of Demeter right
because you are not supposed to know
about anything that you don't directly
need and so the myth says that you have
now this that the dependency injection
makes it harder because it makes you
pass things around that you don't need
but the law of Demeter says you
shouldn't do this so let's see how we
can reconcile this so first again let's
have our example of house door and a
doorknob and suppose that all of a
sudden the doorknob so by the way first
of all to instantiate this this tree you
would have some kind of a factory and
you would simply instantiate the
doorknob you pass it into the door and
you pass it in the house and now the
house is constructed with all the
parameters that it needs now suppose the
doorknob all of a sudden means a color
and the door needs a window or something
like that right the myth says this is
going to put pressure on a house because
now house has to ask for all these
parameters to pass it through but that's
wrong right because the house isn't the
one responsible for constructing these
things and that's the key difference how
simply says I need a door as a matter of
fact houses emit is not even aware that
door has doorknob so from a factory
point of view and now I have to
instantiate the color and a small window
to fit inside of of the of the door but
notice how it doesn't actually affect
the house so contrary to what you would
think by explicitly the asking for your
dependencies in the constructor it
actually makes it easier to add
parameters not harder and the reason for
this is because all of your business
logic
I doesn't deal with object lookup of the
construction right the business logic
simply says I need all these things and
then somewhere else is a factory that's
responsible for wiring the pieces
together now at this point many people
say aha but now I have one Factory per
class that I have twice as many classes
that's not true either notice again how
one factory serves a whole bunch of
objects typically you actually have in
theory you actually only need is one
factory for all of the objects of the
same lifetime in practice we would
really have ridiculously large factories
and so we break it down further but
nevertheless the point is you really
only need one factory plus couple of
break down to the classes are not
ridiculously large per object lifetime
and in typical application you have your
long-lived objects you have your session
if you have a web application your
session scoped objects and you have your
request scope objects plus you have some
objects that are really short-lived
typically those are rare you typically
just stick to your request scope so in
theory you can get away with four
factories in such an application
couple of rules about object
construction so you only really want to
inject objects whose lifetime is equal
or greater than yours so a new
constructor if you're asking for if your
house and you're asking for a door it is
assumed that the lifetime of the door is
at least as long as that of a house if
not greater you can get into some really
troublesome spots if you break that rule
so if you have an object that needs to
have a shorter lifetime you typically
pass that through a stack or you simply
break your object graph in some kind of
a different structure so that you group
your equally little objects together so
that you you simply instantiate although
equally equal lifetime objects together
and then you say now do the work that
you need to do get done so you have to
basically phases let's talk about other
common practice that people do and that
is paranoid programming so people love
to put null checks everywhere for
example in this case we have a house and
there's a precondition check that says
make sure that somebody whoever
constructed you gave you a real door
that seems like a good idea but it turns
out actually that from a testing point
of view it makes my test much harder to
deal with
suppose I have I have a house and I want
to paint the house the color red and I
want to assert that the the house color
is red after I painted it presumably
that has nothing to do with door so I
should be able to simply say create a
house and pass in an old door because
the door is not involved for this
particular method it's involved with
other methods but not with this one it
prevents me from actually doing this
because I need to sex the the the
precondition will throw an exception so
these kinds of preconditions actually
make it hard for you to instantiate your
objects to put it differently I prefer
an application
that I know that it works because I have
a whole bunch of tests to prove it that
it works rather than have an application
that I think it works because there is
precondition checks everywhere
executable checks in formula tests are
always more valuable than having a
precondition check now people will say
well what if it's an external based API
rules might be different you know your
mileage may vary if you are really
creating an API for an external world
where people are going to be calling you
it makes a lot of sense to put
precondition checks inside of your
methods but if this is your internal API
that your application uses internally
what you're really saying is that you
don't trust yourself
and so those checks tend to just hinder
your testing then and make it rather
than make it easier also as I pointed
out earlier is if you come across a test
like this and you see new house new door
you're not quite sure if the door is
involved in this particular test or not
like is the door involved in painting
you're not sure right and so by passing
in a null you're making it clear to the
user that door has nothing to do with
the particular test I'm doing and that's
I believe a valuable information to be
passed on so I like to think of it this
particular way that in production code
right the code that I expect to ship I
really don't want to get in the business
of passing notes I always want to pass
you know don't pass in at all rather
give me a empty collection don't give me
a null for lager rather give me a lager
that doesn't do anything still in
production code you always should assume
that you're getting a real object that
you can call methods on and if you for
your particular configuration feel like
that that particular object doesn't need
to do anything then have a known value
object that simply creates no offs for
all the methods you call on it which
should also that mean that you should
not ever have to do no checks now that's
maybe a stretch and maybe a nice gold
get to but for the most part we try to
avoid having null checks now in a test
it's the exact opposite in a test when I
instantiate objects I really want to be
able to pass a null so the constructor
to basically tell the reader that these
parameters are irrelevant for this test
you know there might be a different test
where those parameters are not null and
some other parameters are no but for
this test it's irrelevant so in your
tests your nulls are your friends but in
production code it tends to be your
enemy same thing for the new operator
right if you instantiate an object in
your production code directly then
you're basically preventing anybody from
giving you a mock a friendly or
controlling the construction that's why
we don't want to do a new operator in a
constructor like we saw with the with
the document and new HTTP client it's
much better to ask for the HTTP client
better yet
forget the HTTP client ask the thing
that you want which is the document so
your production code really should not
be should have all this be devoid of new
operators instead the new operators need
to all be inside of either your
factories or inside of your tests
because test is all about instantiating
some sub portion of your application so
that you can go and poke on it
so in summary you want to abandon the
new operator pretty much in 99% of your
cases now there are certain places where
new operator is perfectly okay
instantiating a hashmap it's no problem
with that there's no need to ask for it
in the constructor just go ahead and
instantiate same thing for collection
instantiating what I would call a value
object such as a user totally not a
problem just simply make a user the key
with these objects that they're all
reliefs of your application graph like
there is nothing behind the hashmap
really it's the end of the road
that's why instantiate it is perfectly
okay but for the most part your services
your objects that are responsible for
talking to each other and collaborating
those need to simply ask for the
dependencies finally because you're not
responsible for constructing these
things and you're really broken your
application down into the phase of
construction in the phase where the
business logic lives you should never be
in the business of asking for anything
that you don't really need all right
this is the law of Demeter you should
always be only asking for things that
you need directly any kind of
indirection that you place inside of
your production code will make it so
much harder for you to test your code
from a from a test because now you have
to instantiate all this intermediary
object and maybe mock them out and so on
and so forth and that cost becomes
double the cost if that work is done in
the constructor so what's painful in the
method I can survive once what's painful
in the constructor is going to be shared
by lots and lots of tests all over your
application so really you want to think
of your objects as having come in to two
categories there is your your pile of
business logic this is the stuff that
does work in your application this is
also where probably most of your bugs
are in your application you know this is
where the if statements are and the the
loops and you know collaborations and so
forth you want to make sure that these
objects are really easy to instantiate
from a testing point of view
and then you have your pile of factories
or the new operators or the builders or
so on and so forth
now by separating the two pieces out you
get an interesting from a testing point
of view makes it really easy to test
because you can always instantiate the
business logic and passing its
dependencies and test it that way and
you can also instantiate a factory and
ask the factory to produce a object
graph and assert that the object craft
is correct without actually running any
kind of cool down there if you mix the
two if you simply call the new operators
wherever you feel like then it's really
hard to say why don't you I want to test
to make sure that the instantiation of
the database works correctly but I don't
want you to actually go off and call any
kind of sequel methods on it
so by having the separation you can
actually test both the factories and the
the business logic in isolation if you
mix them together not so easy it's very
easy to basically call a method that
starts doing the real work instantiate
more objects as it goes along and they
do more work and so on and so forth
so it turns out that our factories if
you file the dependency injection the
way it is recommend that it turns out
that it's really really easy to
instantiate things you simply look at
the constructor and you say ah in order
to instantiate a house I need to
instantiate these other things and
interesting she ate those are
interesting so those other things
and on and on as a matter of fact the
whole process is so automatic that you
can build a framework that simply uses
reflection to look at the constructor
and says and say aha in order to
instantiate this I need these other
things I mean this a normal instantiate
those I need those other things and so
on until you get a full closure
one such framework is juice and with
juice you basically don't have to write
your factories you simply write your
business logic that says I need the
following services to get my work done
and you assume that the juice can
basically look at the stuff using
reflection and say ah I know how to put
the pieces together
because simply the pieces just ask for
each other
so when you have these this builders in
these business logic write small tests
are become very easy to write and
understand and we kind of pointed it out
you can test everything in isolation and
you can test the factories in isolation
and you don't have to worry about the
factory also doing the work or the the
work also in tank shading other objects
it also makes it so that because there
is the set of factories that are
responsible purely for wiring it makes
it very likely that if your business
logic works then chances are very good
that the whole application works because
the wiring especially with the strong
strongly typed compiler you can't really
plug things in the wrong way I mean you
can and some circumstances but for the
most part all the hard things are kind
of compiled checked for you so in many
cases it's sufficient to simply have
test for your code and kind of assume
that the whole thing works now you
probably don't want to just purely
assume and you probably won't have a
couple tests to make sure the wiring
works together but for the most part if
I have tests that prove that everything
works in isolation and I have a simple
one simple test that kind of proves one
happy path to the application
I'm actually pretty confident that both
the pieces work and the wiring is
correct and it's probably working the
way I intended to and I believe that's
it so I am gonna ask four questions now
no questions you guys are all dependency
injection experts well I know you guys
are alright well thanks for coming yes
question can you grab a mic saw the null
check thing you mentioned that my test
you didn't need to create anything in
tension anything that the code actually
doesn't need mhm
um so there's one kind of a testing fake
called a dummy
are you suggesting we will never need a
dummy anymore
no I'm not suggesting you don't need a
dummy so dummy would be like your now
value object correct is that what you
mean by dummy dummy is something that
only has the correct type it doesn't
instantiate doesn't implement any real
method right but it usually has no ops
for all the methods right right right
so it's essentially a null value object
so if you have a class that expects to
have a logger and you don't want to
actually log anything I would pass in a
dummy lager into or no value lager into
it I'm actually talking about something
slightly different when I find the
example again with with the house and
the painting here we go ah a house might
have a whole bunch of methods for
example house might have a lock method
and house also might have a paint method
when I call a lock method presumably
house has to collaborate with the doors
and the windows in order to get the
whole house locked down so if I was to
write a test for the lock method I would
pass in a real door and real windows
because I wanted to assert that the
whole locking process works
but if I'm painting the house that
method has nothing to do with doors or
windows so I shouldn't be forced to
instantiate doors and windows inside of
my tests for getting the whole problem
of dummies even if I have a dummy door
hanging around I still don't really want
to instantiate and pass it in because
they kind of suggested the reader of the
test that somehow the door is involved
in a whole painting process for this
code example I understand but like what
are the scenario you think will be a
good case for dummy
object you okay kind of thing you would
like you would use a dummy object if you
know that in your execution path you are
actually going to be dispatching and the
parameter which means a Knoll would
cause a nullpointerexception
but you really don't care about this
particular object because it's something
like a logger or locks or something of
that sort in which case you just want a
no operation to happen over there that's
what a dummy is for the dummy is needed
when I dispatch it but not now use it
right and Knoll is a much stronger form
of a dummy because it says not only is
it not needed nobody's ever dispatching
off of this thing alright guys thank you
