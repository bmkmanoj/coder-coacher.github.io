at a lot of our data in relation to our
gambling customers right around the time
of the World Cup basically to see what
we could see
I run product management at kolba to be
us I'll let you introduce yourself right
so we expect ha ha I'm the VP of
emerging technologies like forward which
really means that I get to work with
lots of different companies these days
that are free products or see how they
fit into our infrastructure to make
their I've been with provost for 10
years I've had multiple roles there so I
kind of went through all technical
positions pretty much that we have there
from research to operations and recently
moved into this role so a little bit
about cool about coulvet provides
information about IP addresses and we
provide geographic and network
information and what our customers do
with that information is basically
provide richer more engaging more
relevant experiences for their users so
whether it's geo targeting and other
kind of targeting for search and other
kind of advertising or financial
services and e-commerce companies
helping to mitigate the risk of fraud
you have video on-demand and sports
companies who stream live video content
and other rich content one of the
reasons they're able to do that with
copyrighted content is because solutions
like ours allow them to comply with the
regulations and the other contracts they
have that restrict them from streaming
content in in other places Major League
Baseball as an example in the US where
legislation actually prevents them from
streaming live games in markets where
they've sold the rights to broadcasters
so the reason they can stream live games
is because they can tell where you are
if you're in a home market and restrict
that content and that's how a gaming
customer chooses as well
gambling obviously has online gambling
has different restrictions in different
places around the world the reason you
can gamble online where it is legal is
because online gambling companies can
tell whether you're not what
you're in somewhere where it's legal or
not yeah so as I said we took we have a
number of gambling customers mostly in
the UK but all over the world and we
took some of their data and looked at it
in relation to right around the time of
the World Cup as I said so a little bit
about to be us we'll talk a little bit
about the methodology and our data okay
so the way we get the data is we have
what we call a closed defect system that
we basically as customers use our data
we get individual transaction data back
from them which we use for counting
purposes but also to focus our research
efforts so if you have de the IP the
internet the ipv4 space basically is 4.2
billion addresses not all of those are
assigned so there's about 2.8 billion
addresses that are assigned right now
but again not all of those are used by
actually users a lot of that is
infrastructure space and the majority of
that traffic comes from from a subset of
that so we use that feedback data as a
significant sample to target the areas
that are important for our customers to
focus our research on the other thing
that we do is as we get that data back
we release data we release our IP data
every week as we get that data back we
join individual IP addresses back home
to all the dimensions that we have
available on that specific IP address or
the network at large and we store that
so we can basically perform dimensional
analysis across all of the effect data
that we receive and that's about 30
billion queries per month that again is
a subset of the queries that are
actually performed against our data the
actual number is probably you know Wayne
or 100 billion a month because some
customers have higher performance
requirements and choose to implement it
differently that doesn't allow them to
give feedback data back to us
so some of the some of the information
that we that we assigned to an IP
address includes geographic information
from continent bound to postal code and
then the network characteristics we
assign are things like the carrier for
isp the organization that is responsible
for the content of the network the
domain the the speed of the connection
how the connection is routed through the
internet whether the whether the that IP
address is associated with anonymizing
activity and things like that and we
have this data going back pretty much
since we started about 10 years worth of
data you can imagine there's a lot of
data there because we have so much data
well one of the reasons we haven't
looked at it yet in the way that we've
started to look at is because dealing
with all this data is kind of onerous
there's a lot of data to deal with and
so we'll talk a little bit about the
technologies that we use to actually a
great some of the data so it's easier to
report against and also just just mine
it a little bit about gambling though so
online gambling has a kind of storied
history I mentioned the reason you can
gamble online is because these companies
can now tell whether you're somewhere
where it's legal back in 2006
you saw stories especially about
European companies and executives or
European companies being indicted in the
US because they were breaking the US
laws by allowing their customers to
gamble but by allowing US citizens from
the US to gamble so being able to tell
where users are coming from is critical
to industries like gambling and gambling
in general online gambling is a growth
market so it's it represents 8 percent
of the total market or did last year
which is which is significant in terms
of the market and it's also growing so
it's it's growing 13 percent per year is
projected to about thirty six billion
dollars by 2012 which is which is a
large market this is all according to h2
which is a sort of industry gambling
industry analyst and and because of the
legality it's mainly in Europe and Asia
that you see online gambling that's not
to say there isn't any gambling
North America though in the u.s. in the
u.s. gambling is traditionally
legislated by states different states
have different laws you can actually
gamble online you can do things like you
can bet on horse races in certain states
and you can play poker online for money
in some cases but what's happening in
the u.s. there's legislation now being
passed to allow certain kinds of
gambling across the u.s. it will still
be regulated by States and one of the
reasons that's happening is because
there's other laws being passed to allow
that gambling to be taxed and of course
once you you know it is a significant
market once you start taxing it of
course it represents a significant
revenue stream for the government so if
that's one reason why you're going to
see that and what what you're seeing now
is some of those companies those same
companies that were in trouble in 2006
are coming to the US and they're either
setting up shop or buying some of the
existing gambling organizations in the
US so and gambling is interesting
because it has because it's it's
worldwide it has a lot of the aspects
that make IP address geolocation
interesting you need to localize the
language to the your customer you need
to know where your customers are coming
from so you can market to them and you
need to you need to restrict access and
there's also a lot of fraud involved
especially during these big events what
you see is online gambling houses
especially smaller ones will be
blackmailed by fraudsters who'll say you
know I've I've set up a system that can
take down your gambling site and I'm
gonna do that you know during the World
Cup unless you you know unless you pay
me X amount of money and so it's really
important to them you know you some of
these sites have been destroyed because
they've ignored these threats some of
them just pay out but it's really
important to them to be able to
understand what threats are real and
also help prevent them so it has a nice
broad application for IP geo so a little
bit about how we went about this we
worked with the design company called
stamen design and they do a lot with
really interesting visualizations and
they do a lot with G
they did the maps for the last Olympics
I think 31 the 2012 Olympics in London
as well you can see it some of the
projects they've done here crime
spotting in Oakland and San Francisco is
a project where you can go and see
real-time crime statistics for those
cities they're they they're responsible
for big labs where you can see different
visualizations of big stories log on or
log me in and wireless visualization but
they're a fantastic design company they
do great work and we knew that working
with them we would see we would see the
data in ways that we hadn't imagined we
could see the data and see things that
that we wouldn't see otherwise one of
the things one of the ways that they
were able to work with a large data set
is through the use of solar which you
can talk a little bit about so Solar is
a Apache project and it's built on top
of the scenes and leucine engine it was
developed by Cena in 2004
what makes solar interesting for a
project like this is that it allows you
to rapidly dive into the data it's very
fast to ingest data build indexes over
it and it provides facet search and so
faceting basically is at the core method
to group by operation so we've used that
to to explore the data web statement and
we'll present some interesting
visualizations that Solar and we used
some innovative newer graphing concepts
for those visualizations so there are
two kinds of graphs that Stayman used
with the data the first is a horizon
graph which I'll talk about in a little
more detail in a second is a stream
graph which made you might be a little
bit more familiar with I'll talk about
horizon graphs first horizon graphs were
introduced in 2008 in a paper by these
folks
Stephen phew is a design vlogger and
consultant he is his site is the
perceptual legend he wrote a paper
talking specifically about panopticon
views which is a commercial business
intelligence company of horizon graphs a
lot of the images you see are from
Stephens paper but it's a really
interesting way to see data that you
would normally look at temporal data you
might normally look at in a line graph
in a compressed form where you can start
comparing things and seeing things
differently so you have a traditional
line graph and this is a very good way
to look at data over time and you can
see variations than data peaks and
valleys it's pretty intuitive what this
means but it it's hard to compare one
line graph to another you can start
overlaying line graphs you can start
putting them beside each other but it
gets very busy very quickly and you can
see that this is a this is 50 stocks
over about a year in 2006 all with
different line graphs and it's
impossible to really see what's going on
with these line graphs are really
compare what's going on with them so
horizon graphs allow you to see the same
data but in a much compressed form the
way you do that is you draw a zero line
in the graphic ideally somewhere in the
middle of the graph depending on your
graph and you color the space between a
zero line and the line you color the
space above the line in one color the
space below the line in another and what
you have is anywhere if you look at the
red space is anywhere above the line you
have empty white space and so you can
leverage that white space by essentially
flipping the graph up so now you you cut
the graph in half you can still see the
peaks and valleys through the color and
you can compress it further so so this
graph is it has six bands of color and
you can see the darker color on top if
you look at those those hearts of darker
color those polygons fit in the polygon
below in every case and what you can do
is basically compress them down so what
you wound up with is a graph that takes
up less than a fifth of space but it
still gives you a very good sense of the
data so you can see by the intensity of
the color and the
color itself whether the data is
positive or negative and and how where
the peaks and valleys are so obviously
with the colors more intense the the
peaks and valleys are higher and lower
so people get that same graph of 50
stocks with horizon graphs you get a
much richer picture of the data you can
see individually how individual stocks
have performed which one have which ones
have done well which ones haven't and
you can start to see trends temporally
so you can see these stocks are all
performing negatively in this time frame
and these are performing positively and
that maybe gives you some indication of
where you might want to look deeper into
the data the other good thing about this
is this in all these line graphs are it
doesn't really matter it's all relative
so you're seeing relative peaks and
valleys instead of absolute numbers so
that you can see you know you might have
one stock at that that trades at very
low price in another stock that trades
at very high price but you'll see the
same trends because the data is all
relative so that's the rising graphs so
if you look so you know we're dealing
with countries all around the world
these are the line graphs the countries
you can start to see well first of all
you can't see many countries on one page
you can start to see maybe some trends
in terms of where the peaks and valleys
are but it's hard to kind of see them so
this is this is actually a single color
horizon graph but you this is Internet
traffic to gambling sites from different
countries around the world and
immediately you start to see and this is
just in about a week before the World
Cup immediately you start to see like if
you look at the right edge of each of
these of these columns you see a lot of
activity there which correlates with you
know the day before and the day of the
World Cup and you still see individually
where you have a lot of activity like in
Germany there's always a lot of activity
versus guinea where there's not a lot of
activity until the World Cup so and you
have many more countries here on this
graph than you did before so it's a
really powerful way to see data temporal
data when you're looking at
two elements so this was really neat and
it does show some trends it really gets
interesting when we start looking to
stream graphs though so I like to be as
talk about the stream graphs
all right so stream graphs are a type of
stacked graph complex layer and it was
developed by lee byron personal interest
to visualize his his listening habits on
last.fm provides you lots of different
data about which music do you listen to
how often you do that so he tried to do
that with line graphs and different
standard visualization techniques and
none of these really product clear
picture to the table so he developed the
stream graph concept which excels really
when you're trying to present lots of
data to a mass audience it's not it's
probably not I mean it's not a accurate
it's not a highly statistical
representation of the data but it gives
you ideas of trends and how how the
different layers behave independently in
2008 the New York Times published a
stream graph that showed flock the movie
ticket sales performance of 7500 movies
over the past 21 years and that was kind
of the first publication of that and it
evoke different kinds of emotions
probably more technical people didn't
feel like good about it because it
doesn't really give you a good
quantitative image of what's going on
and less technical people really like
that representation because it it is
very aesthetic and it lets you visually
explore the data much much better than a
more accurate rips a representation of
the absolute numbers so here's an
example
well yeah basically and and this is
actually what we'll walk through what
the stream gap graphs do is they let you
start seeing trends and then depending
on your system you can start drilling
down into the data either with more
stream graphs which is what we'll do or
for other data so this graph is
worldwide Internet traffic to some of
our gambling customers from the 5th
through the 13th and of course the World
Cup started on the June of this year
start on the 12th so what you see is a
pretty regular pattern of Internet
traffic it's heavily dominated by
European countries and the UK mostly
because a lot of our gambling customers
are in the UK but also they have a
pretty good gambling culture they're on
my game of culture anyway and you see
there's a lot of activity during the day
it drops off at night comes back during
the day you see activity on Saturday and
then and then more activity than the
other days of the week but it's pretty
regular until the day before the World
Cup where you see it spike and then
continue to stay high so this is
interesting it is dominated by the UK
and Europe so what we're going to do is
drill down into different continents in
different countries and then eventually
different network characteristics of the
data to see other trends and and you can
see little examples of little anomalies
in here but once you start drilling down
they become a little bit more apparent
so if we look at just Europe it pretty
much looks the same you start to see
little weird things like up here you see
this little choke point but it pretty
much looks the same so let's take a look
at everything but the UK since it was so
heavily weighted from it with the UK so
now it starts to look a little bit
different you start to see less of the
rhythm is still there but it's less
extreme so you see a more activity
throughout the day you also in the first
graph you can see this little blip but
this becomes a lot more apparent here
Friday morning there's something going
on and you see that's this red band in
the middle which is associated with the
with the US so there's something going
on there
we also see different countries behaving
differently so the blue up here right
above is the Netherlands and they have a
very regular rhythm of activity during
the day and not much at night versus
some place like Denmark which is down
here which has pretty regular activity
throughout the day and then you also
have like this green up here is
Singapore where there's not a lot of
activity at all in the week before the
World Cup and then it really just blows
up so if we look at Asia yeah ah that's
a good question I'm glad you asked
because it's very important to
understand it this so the size it's like
a stacked graph so the size of the color
is more traffic more queries and what
this data represents is IP address
queries from these companies it doesn't
necessarily mean that people are
gambling so someone could be coming from
the US and hit the site and be denied so
typically when you when you use stat
graphs you you have a couple issues so
first of all if you use lots of time
series series that don't contribute that
much data kind of disappear in the graph
visually so the other issue is if you
have two two series of equal vertical
height but with different sloping one of
the two tends to disappear visually so
this methodology really is to visually
pull those out and not make them
disappear and Stan stand apart so it's
not so much like I need to know exactly
the slope but I want to know what the
movement of the individual layers is
right it's actually an algorithm that
that you so yeah so it's for its
detailed
there's detailed documentation in the
paper that was linked on the previous
slide so and you'll see you'll see kind
of how it differs from a stacked area
graph when we look at the UK
specifically and it's a nice example of
how a stream graph kind of changes how
it's different from a stack area graph
in some ways does that help at all I
mean basically what you're seeing here
what you're looking for are trends and
in some cases it gives you some answers
but in more cases it just raises
additional questions that you may or not
may or may not be able to answer with a
string grep so we're looking at Asia so
Asia
looks a little bit similar to Europe
except that you don't have that big
spike on Saturday because it's because
for for the customers that we're seeing
this traffic Asia isn't as much of a
gambling culture traditionally but you
do see them coming to these these
gambling sites during the World Cup
before and during the World Cup so and
again you get a much better view here of
the impact of of Singapore and their big
traffic which is represented in the
middle here where it just kind of
explodes so this gives you an idea of
gambling patterns in in Asia if we look
at the US where you saw that kind of
weird spike well this is North America
but but this is instead of by country we
did it by organization because it
actually gets very interesting so if you
look at the so the immediate thing that
you might notice here is that regular
rhythm is gone it's a pretty straight
graph for the most part you have these
blips which I'll talk about in a second
but even even in the bands there isn't a
regular pulse of activity so when you
look at the actual organization so it's
hard for you to read that but red is
Google so either your counterparts in
Mountain View are staying up all night
gambling everyday or there's something
else going on you start looking at the
other organizations like Microsoft and
Yahoo and you realize what these are are
bots that are indexing the site so that
all of a sudden makes sense where before
you might have seen a lot of traffic
from North America
sites have not been able to explain it
because really you go to a site once you
get denied in that you go try again this
is much more understandable these these
kind of anomalies are weird this one on
this side is was Comcast cable in in San
Rafael California and so there was just
a bunch of activity on Saturday I don't
know why I don't know I mean we can look
it further we can say ok which sites
were they going to what IP addresses
were they this is it many IP addresses
or single IP addresses but it's
something to look into it could be
completely legitimate or it could be
illegitimate it could be it could be
someone probing the site before an
attack
it could be someone probing the site for
legitimate reasons it could be the site
itself doing some running some tests
you see the same thing here this one is
in Phoenix from a publishing company
again very odd to see that level of
traffic the day before the World Cup but
it could be again legitimate or
illegitimate and certainly it's strange
you also see that choke point that I
mentioned earlier much more pronounced
here and you see that on all the graphs
and that could be an attack maybe the
server's went down because of an attack
or maybe they went down because they
crashed or maybe they maybe some of
these sites took their servers down for
maintenance it happens to be during I
mean it's a bad maintenance window and
then it's in the middle of the World Cup
but if something bad was happening and
they had to take a site down then it
makes sense probably to do it when
traffic was low anyway so that's
probably what it is but it's interesting
looking at these graphs and kind of
coming up with theories for this and
then as a customer of the data you would
be look at this industry it's
interesting to think about what happened
yeah
if you you can it's not just relative
you can you can get information about
how many total queries this is and then
you can start figuring out what the
traffic numbers actually are what I
would do if I actually want to know what
those numbers are query the data
directly for that time frame and find
out what the reason I don't for this
particular graph but we could come up
with them yeah so that's that's the way
that the graph works it tries to and
maybe you can explain it better to do
but it tries to kind of equalize the
data you'll see this in some other
graphs where there's less data that the
graph shifts more where there's more
data it's better at equalizing yeah
right right and I don't know exactly
what the graphing software is doing
there but it's basically a artifact of
the graph yeah so this is everything but
Europe Asia and North America so again
you see this kind of shift because
there's less data overall so the
weighting is less but you start to see
interesting things again like which
countries outside of those three main
markets are our good markets for
gambling and gaming so here you have
South America in green and gray gray is
Australia and you see again South
America has a good rhythm Australia they
stay up later or they're gambling at
different times but it's more of a an
equal band until you get to Wednesday
interestingly Australia started betting
really early if you look at other
countries I was looking at other
countries like Malawi and when I was
looking Malawi I was just looking
between Friday and Friday and it was
just basically flat except for a spike
somewhere on Monday or Tuesday and I
thought well I guess they don't have the
team in the World Cup so they were
interested in it until I looked at
because every other country started
betting on Friday and then I looked at
Saturday and then there was
huge spike so it's just interesting to
see the different mentality of different
countries and I don't think Nigeria
played until the 13th so it could be
that they were betting on African teams
I don't know but it's interesting to
come up with hypotheses about this so
now we'll look at three different
countries in Europe starting with the UK
because it represented so much data this
is just a very interesting stream graph
because if you basically have a stream
graph and if you take away to London you
have a stack area graph on top of it
because London basically creates a zero
line but this essentially matches the
European data in terms of its pulse and
again everything I talked about with
betting on the weekend and the choke
point and things like that so if we take
away London to be interesting to see if
if the UK is sort of heterogeneous in
the way Gamble's and the graph
essentially looks the same you start to
see a little bit more detail in terms of
what other cities in the UK are gambling
online but it basically looks the same
so let's look at something that looks
different
so here's Germany you kind of have this
rhythm but it it's also a little bit all
over the place you have you know Monday
morning people come in to work and they
stop betting but then they sort of get
over their guilt and they go online
continue betting is this Germany's first
game was on the 12th and so you see a
big spike here but it's pretty
consistent there online all the time
betting unlike the UK and you also have
this huge area that kind of looks like
London did in the UK except this is
Carl's row club which is not any place
I've heard of so it's a little bit
harder to explain until you start
looking a little bit deeper into the
data and this is actually one in one
internet age either internet provider
they have a big hosting facility in
karlsruhe
and so you know we're locating their
traffic where they're where their data
center is because that's the last point
we see and so in our data this would be
represented with a routing type of
regional regional proxy so you know we
know what country it's in but we can't
necessarily tell you what city it's in
but at least we can tell you it's
Germany is so now now that makes a
little bit more sense but that's Germany
we'll look at Denmark next which also
looks really crazy there's really no
pattern here you have this huge red and
these huge blue definitely you see a lot
of activity during the World Cups and so
that big red most likely represents
consumer traffic it's strange that this
blue is really active here and really
active in the middle of the week before
the World Cup and then kind of dies out
completely when you look at the
organization behind these that blue is
basically a website that reports odds
for games and it refers traffic to
gambling houses so for whatever reason
there's a lot of people online checking
the odds of different matches whether
it's World Cup or not and going to
embedding sites into place and bets the
red is similar to what you saw in
Germany in Karlsruhe it's it's seems to
be a hosting provider although it also
has provide some VPN services I don't
know why there's a big spike there maybe
there were some other major sporting
event that people were betting on but
certainly if you know if I want to learn
more about the Denmark market and how it
works this is something that would you
know I would start looking into why
there might be a big spike and then a
complete drop in activity and and what's
going on so I mentioned that we have
this Geographic data we also look at the
data in terms of the network
characteristic so the next few graphs to
be as we'll cover and they show how
people are connecting and routing to get
to the family sites
so what we see here is a string graph
representing the connection types
meaning what we do is we categorize
network blogs by how they down here in
red and yellow which
there's a pretty healthy amount of
wireless fighting going on here
that's represented as purple on this
graph and we have this green band that
shows uniform traffic coming through
here six connections so that again is
probably most likely the u.s. traffic
that we saw earlier that originated from
the large search providers can we see
that as fixed connections here all right
so as I said it was a pretty healthy
amount of mobile betting going on and so
now we're we're segmenting the data via
mobile providers and since most of the
traffic came from the UK we see t-mobile
UK and Hutchison 3G this is interesting
if you you know to slice data like that
it's it's it's interesting to understand
which providers users are with you can
use that for marketing or target ads but
so just the fact that it's that you
actually are able to its mobile carrier
helps you because you know the users
mobile so whatever IP geolocation tells
you is probably something that you
should not rely 100% on but you can use
confidence factors and other data points
that we give our customers to understand
these circumstances so there was also a
segment of Talib users and that was
actually kind of surprising because it
was a decent percentage of of the
overall traffic and again the UK's down
there there's some US traffic there yeah
Japan India and then there's you know
lots of developing countries on there
these modems anonymizer so when you're
operating a gambling site you want to
make sure that your customers are not
circumventing your IP geolocation and
typically I'll try to do that by I can
through the proxy server that provided
provides if you're trying to gamble for
you pay provider
what better proxy to use than one in the
UK and maybe I could say a word about
yeah I know how much data so the way
that clova identifies anonymizer to
identify anonymizer z' by specific IP
address and activity we see we also
because we provide our data as network
blocks we also identify network blocks
that have anonymizing activity in them
so a lot of this activity is probably
not anonymizer activity but is in a
network block where we've seen in autumn
Iser activity certainly so I wouldn't
expect that every transaction that you
see here is associated with someone
using a proxy but you can see you know
the graph certainly gets wider as it
moves to the right which is what you'd
expect during a big event that you'd see
more anonymizer activity at these sites
and as to be a said more in the UK
because they're trying to reach sites
there in the UK right so physically what
we fly is bad neighborhoods so like the
crime spotting data you look at it this
is a network block that had some
suspicious activity going on in the past
or recently so you should be cautious in
dealing with that type of traffic and so
now we we segment that the anonymizer
population by area and it's not very
surprising that most of these anonymizer
are actually with hosting providers so
they're probably not systems that are
actively being used
actually users and these can be
compromised machines or hosts that
people have set up specifically for this
yeah so someone might get up squid or
the other possibility is just that foxes
get routed and the significance of this
information is is that when you're
trying to prevent fraud when you're
looking at traffic coming in to your
site the more things you can correlate
with the better your predict prediction
capabilities are so if you can correlate
if you know that certain carriers or
certain organizations or certain
countries for certain connection types
correlate better with known fraud then
knowing all that data when it traffic is
coming in lets you treat those
connections differently than you would
otherwise and that's what the financial
institutions do that's what ecommerce
sites do that's what gambling houses do
and that's why it's important to have
this information so you know it was a
pretty brief look at a very small part
of our data we're just starting looking
at this data we're just starting looking
at different ways to visualize the data
what we'd like to do is make a lot of
this information public because the more
people looking at it the more
interesting things we'll find in the
data as people start looking at the data
I expect that you know we'll see more
trends in the data and that we can start
to use a lot of this usage data to do
things like predict events predict and
prevent fraud look at marketing trends
and there are certainly going to be a
lot of assumptions that people have
about traffic to different markets from
different places that can be either
confirmed or disproved with this data so
we're excited about this we're going to
continue looking at it like I said
hopefully we'll make this data public
pretty soon and that's it
any questions
yeah well I mean that with the law is
typically state that you're using you
know industry best practices and and
yeah and it's not and there are certain
certainly ways to get location data that
are not industry best practices so if
you're trying to if if you're you know
selling restricted Goods to different
countries around the world where those
Goods aren't supposed to be sold
then using things like user reported
data wouldn't be sufficient you'd have
to use some other kind of data or you
know even GPS now you see spoofing there
so yeah yes in our experience
yeah yeah so let me repeat the question
cuz I don't know if the questions are
coming through in the reporting but the
question is when we put this data on the
public do we know what kind of
visualizations and graphs will allow
with it'll be static or dynamic and
things like that sure all right so
certainly our goal goal is to enable
lots of people to explore the data so
static graphs are not going to be very
suitable for that obviously we'll have
to provide some level of pre aggregation
to protect the innocent customers but
you know we can provide dimensionally
aggregated data and let people slice and
dice those datasets are everyday ones so
that's that's the plan and I would
expect that we're gonna probably provide
some interesting visualizations like
this and maybe some more traditional
ones that let people get a little bit
more statistical specific with the data
that's our plan I would expect we're not
going to well at least in the first
instance the the first exploration will
be through different graph types rather
than just access the data directly
although we might depending on how we
can aggregate and anonymize the data
make the data directly available my
second question was with the stream
graphs have you done any kind of cross
dimensional analysis backed by your
brush using explain correlation
it's interesting like we've done that
with multiple stream graphs like I was
talking about looking at a specific city
that shows weird activity and then
looking at different dimensions of that
but that's by running different well
yeah running different stream graphs and
it's actually been very interesting for
us to see certain things about our data
that that weren't completely evident to
us before but I don't know what the
stream graphs capability are to look at
multiple dimensions in the same yeah I
mean what we've wound up doing a lot I
mean to be as a nice pen we basically
spent a long time just creating
interesting graphs and you wind up
creating graphs on specific metrics and
excluding specific things to get to the
answer you're looking for you know so
you look at interesting things like
routing types against cities against
carriers and organizations until
something starts to make sense like that
choke point that we saw early Saturday
morning I think it was if it exists
across every routing type and across
every customer that we're looking at and
in every country then it indicates
something maybe industry-wide if it only
exists for one of the customers then
it's something specific to that customer
and so that's that's the kind of
exploration you want to do sure so
there's actually a JavaScript library
that you can use to to create this it's
called proto biz I you know I know
everyone's wondering about the stream
graph on my shirt so I'll answer that
question yeah yeah I didn't plan on
wearing this shirt I brought it and to
be a mention he pointed out that if
there's a essentially screw up on it so
I realized I had to wear this shirt so
it was not entirely intentional yeah
it's um yeah I'll let you decide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
