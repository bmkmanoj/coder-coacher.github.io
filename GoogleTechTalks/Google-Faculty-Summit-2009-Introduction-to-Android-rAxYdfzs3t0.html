name is David Conway I'm product manager
for four various parts of Android I
specifically focus on the Android Market
my day job but I'm going to talk to you
broadly about the Android story today
and I'm also very pleased to have Dan
Morrill here who's our lead developer
advocate so he'll be he'll be jumping in
as well here's what we're going to cover
the open platform in the market Dan's
gonna go deep on writing Android apps
and a bunch of interesting technical
aspects of that and then I'll go to some
demos and we can do questions at the end
as well so Android is an open platform
and when we when we started out thinking
about how to do this we realized we
really had to take into account all the
sort of major stakeholders and aspects
of the mobile industry one is and and
you could argue these or two actually
but the industry itself the carriers who
run the networks and have these massive
fixed cost investments and networks and
the OEMs who make who make the handsets
that run on them developers is obviously
a key one and especially for us as
Google I think our our goal overall was
to try to with Android was to try to
really open up the mobile experience
that people were having you know we had
feature phones with j2me and whatnot but
a lot of the content wasn't compelling
it was highly controlled a lot of
fragmentation and incompatibility
so we at Google we're a technology
company we really think about developers
a lot and the last piece of course last
but not least is users we really put
users at the center of everything that
we do
but again in approaching mobile you
really have to think about all these so
we think of it as three legs of a stool
and everything we do around Android is
to kind of bring this all together to
make a successful ecosystem for
everybody so for carriers and OEMs there
are a couple major ways we approach this
one is just giving them a way to ship
devices and user experiences without
paying for the privilege excuse me
so Android is free it's open sourced and
you know I think if nothing
in terms of just the bill of materials
for phones you have a question
yep yeah so so the Android we we do not
charge for the software for the Android
software that runs on drones we develop
it here we open-source it we work with
partners we've created this Open Handset
Alliance there is not a $15 per device
sort of fee to you know to run the
software on a device and to date we
haven't actually sold the devices
ourselves that's really just working
with partners and we're creating the
Google experience on most of them so so
yeah it's you know I think in terms of
it lowers the Bill of Materials cost for
the phone itself so often you get sort
of a feature phone at our sorry a
smartphone at future phone prices
because you're not paying for that
operating system cost and our belief is
that you know we make money when when
people use the internet to searches etc
and so you know the more we can get
people using the internet doing searches
the the better we do as Google so this
is strategic for us I think it's sort of
similar the creation of Android is sort
of similar to what you may have seen
with us in the 700 megahertz auctions if
you remember a year ago or so where it
was just critical to us to open things
up and we knew this sort of the right
things would happen if we did that the
the second major piece as far as
satisfying cares and OEMs was just
giving them away to to innovate and
differentiate and so it's licensed under
the Apache 2 license there are there are
parts of it that are under different
licenses such as the Linux kernels
obviously GPL but and we've used various
other components to our blue stack is
from blue Z we use supplicant for Wi-Fi
and there's there's various open-source
projects that sort of are part of the
entire experience but but these sort of
the runtime layer and above and the apps
that are open sourced are all under the
Apache 2 license which is very flexible
and you can pretty much take the code
and do with it what you want and don't
even need to contribute it back so
that's our approach there for users you
know while the OEMs and the carriers may
not necessarily agree with this this is
more Google's approach to everything is
we want the users to be in control of
their device so
they can install the apps that they like
when an app installs they get to see
what permissions this thing is gonna
have so if they don't trust this
developer and don't want it to have
access to their address book they don't
have to install that up and they can see
that that's gonna happen so we have a
permissions model for that and we want
them to be in control there the
experience themselves so you can
literally replace entire parts of the
device such as the dialer or the address
book so if you want to substitute in a
different component to do different
things and handle those calls from other
apps you can do that and even if you get
a bundle of them you can control sort of
which ones which ones they use and which
ones you don't
finally developers and this is this is
where dan and I spent a lot of time Dan
working actively with them on the
development side and me running the the
Android Market which is really this
entire ecosystem to sort of make open
distribution work they can write
whatever apps they want even if they
compete with somebody and they can do
what they want with them they can
replace the core components I talked
about they can they're basically in
control so that that transitions really
well actually going to jump ahead to the
app publishing model for them for the
developers they're really in control of
their content they're the ones who
signed their own apps and so they've
therefore are the only ones who have
power to replace the wraps and phones in
the future there's no approval process
you you post something on the Android
Market and and it is it is up there in
just a few minutes and really they're
the ones who have the relationship where
they're users and customers so we're
sort of running I'll talk about the
broad space we are running the Android
Market which is it excuse me
it's non-exclusive because you can still
install apps for the browser you can
still use a USB cable to sideload it to
your phone but with the market itself
we're trying to create a global
applications market that that simplifies
a content distribution make sure the
right people get a piece of the action
so that there's incentives for all to
make this a success and strategically it
provides a really really key
part two maintain compatibility and
prevent fragmentation you think about
what happened with UNIX where things
just exploded you know with an Apache 2
license you can imagine that happening
but but the hope and the mission is to
is to you know is to maintain that
compatibility give people an incentive
and we have a compatibility test suite
for at four four four devices in order
for them to be allowed to have the
market so that if something's on the
market you know it'll run you're on your
device if you have the device yeah and
and and in general the developers have
the relationships with their users and
can upload what they want but we do have
a YouTube like model where people can
flag apps which they think are
objectionable you know we don't allow
things like adult content and whatnot
and then we have we have customer
service people here that when things get
flagged enough times we review them and
and sometimes take them down but it's a
it's an after-the-fact sort of ex post
facto model as opposed to a explicit
upfront approval process and then just
finally finishing this slide they
there's a one-time $25 registration fee
for people to publish things on the
market that's really just for us to make
sure that they're a real entity and to
limit spammy type apps and just by
running a sort of financial check on on
someone they have to have a credit card
and an address associated with that what
not we know they're real entity and it
avoids sort of a spam problem and and
they get 70% of the sales we run this in
aggregate as a nonprofit but we have we
have partners that that have vested
stakes in making this a success and and
there are sort of transaction and
distribution fees associated with that
and end transaction costs so with that
I'm gonna hand off to Dan Morrill he's
our lead developer advocate for for
Android he works with our developers and
and talks to them all the time about
developing apps so take it away Dan
thanks David so so yeah who here like
has anybody actually written an Android
app yet pulled around it at all okay a
few people cool so
to do today is just give you guys kind
of an introduction to how an app is
written what sort of the app development
philosophy is and you know call out some
of the more interesting technical
challenges that we solved in building
this platform but before I do that I
just want to kind of back up for a
moment and and ask kind of a you know
how do we think about Android
what is Android so Android has really
three things and the first thing is it's
a chunk of code for making cell phone
calls
I step on one of these back in the day
Motorola StarTAC could could very well
be the best actual straight-up phone
ever made before they started adding you
know other things to them that were not
phones but really all this thing did was
they had a little processor in it you'd
start it up and all it did was just talk
to the radio and make this tiny little
LCD display that showed you what phone
number you were calling that was pretty
much all it did and so that was the
original kind of you know purpose of a
cell phone and obviously you know
Android includes that functionality but
Android also includes you know like most
modern cell phone operating systems
these days includes a fully you know
company and qualified tcp/ip stack a
worldwide web browser and so on and so
you know Android is a full on you know
Internet client this is actually kind of
interesting I remember years and years
ago I think it's probably five years ago
I guess I saw this commercial and I
forget for which you asked carrier it
was but they had this was a woman and
she had this new cell phone and she was
telling her friend about it and she's
like yeah this is a great new cell phone
and then the friend asked a question and
the woman didn't know the and she's like
oh well I don't know and so the the the
friend gets out like his new cell phone
he says oh I'll just look it up you know
on the internet and starts doing a
Google search and the woman the original
one in the course so she's like you can
get the internet on your phone she said
in this like totally sad tragic kind of
voice and I just started laughing I
don't know if that was the effect they
were going for but I just started
laughing because it was such a non
sequitur to me because I was like why
would you not want the internet on your
phone you know and so that was five
years ago and only today are we really
getting to the point where you've got a
really excellent you know web browser an
internet client on your phone and so
finally we're starting to get you know
where that kind of function
it's mainstream but of course the third
thing and probably perhaps the most
interesting thing for this group is that
Android is a platform for running code
now I'm being very high-level and vague
and kind of generic about this and the
reason for that is you know we really
have three kinds of code I'm you guys if
you have heard anything about Android at
all you've probably heard that we have
this thing called dalvik which is this
virtual machine that runs managed code
and this is what you know kind of the
lion's share of android development
experiences like and you write you know
your applications using the java
programming language and they during a
compilation step are transformed into
dalvik bytecode to run in this virtual
machine now you know people have made
kind of the assumption that oh well you
know to write android apps you write
apps in java that's really not the case
you know because we do in fact support
ajax applications who I believe to be
the guy on the left the other guy is
Achilles and you can write web apps you
know whether it's a straight up web app
you know that has no need of piece at
all it just runs on the you know inside
the browser entirely or you know we also
as I'll talk about a little bit later
have a mechanism for integrating web
technologies and functionalities into an
actual dollar gap and then of course you
know there's the you know native code
for heavy lifting that currently we
support the you know for example the ARM
processor which is what's in most cell
phones today and you know you can write
parts of your Android applications and
native code as well so I didn't mention
dalvik let me give you you know a really
kind of high level overview of what
Dalek is dalvik is a virtual machine you
know running bytecode it's similar to
you know the Java Virtual Machine or
the.net CLR but it is not a Java Virtual
Machine it actually has its own bytecode
format it's a you know typical won't
shock anybody who is familiar with
virtual machines it's memory protected
garbage-collected there's actually an
application development model that has
managed lifecycle objects and then
dalvik however the you know the the
primary reason why we you know kind of
rolled our own virtual machine instead
of you know repurposing or implementing
a java virtual machine or something like
it's really because our engineers looked
at the you know the existing virtual
machines and kind of realized they don't
actually work that well on mobile
devices for reasons which I'll get to in
just a moment and so you know dalvik was
optimized for embedded devices mobile
phones and similar things and as such it
was designed to not really need a
just-in-time compiler and as I mentioned
it does actually have a custom bytecode
format and is not Java so the experience
of writing an app for Android that runs
on Dalek is really that you know you
write your application and you're you
use a number of API is provided by the
system that together with the
application runtime environment
implement basically just a managed
lifecycle object if you're familiar with
the concept of like something like OSGi
you know or similar kinds of component
object spaces it's similar in notion
they're defined life cycles for various
objects but it's much more streamlined
and lightweight and so the other thing
that it's interesting in or that's
interesting about this model is that the
dalvik virtual machine in the way it
runs is actually designed to be fairly
closely integrated with the actual
process model and in fact dalvik intends
that most of the heavy lifting done by
the system is handled by native code so
for example we don't do a lot of
graphics operations actually in you know
Dalek we punched through to native code
for things like you know 2d and 3d
operations you know talking to other
processes and so on and of course you
know all your favorite tools are
supported which is the main reason why
we spent a pretty considerable amount of
effort in building a set of tools that
lets you take Java bytecode and
translate this to dalvik bytecode and in
this way this lets us allow developers
such as you guys to reuse your favorite
tools and your existing skills in Java
you know best-in-class tools like
Eclipse although you don't have to use
Eclipse but we spend a lot of time to
try and make sure that you know we
picked a great community with robust
tools and you know made the paved the
road to make it as easy as possible for
them to write Android apps so I
mentioned this a couple times you know
and I want to take just a few minutes
and talk about some of the
things that we did for dalvik we say
this and people you know believe us but
they don't really believe us if you know
what I mean and what we'll say is look
you know mobile out you know mobile
devices don't have a lot of memory and
people will go like oh yeah sure okay
yeah that's true that mobile devices
don't have as much memory as a desktop
PC and they're not as fast but people
usually wave their hands and say Moore's
law and unfortunately no that does not
work in mobile and the reason is that
what Moore's law actually says I'm sure
you guys in this room well know better
than that most people the industry is
that transistor density doubles every 18
months it doesn't say anything about
speed speed is what the desktop you know
world you know the Intel's and AMD's of
the world have chosen to use their
increased density for but in mobile what
almost all of the major players are
doing is they're using Moore's law to
increase transistor density reduce die
size and reduce power consumption so
they're increasing battery life and
things like you know faster processors
and more memory is a very secondary
concern and so it isn't really
acceptable when you're writing mobile
applications to just kind of wave your
hands over it and say oh well you know
sure it might be a little sluggish today
but in you know in 18 months it'll be
twice as fast and then it'll be usable
that just really you know that that path
doesn't work on mobile and so
recognizing that we went and did a lot
of you know work on this so you know for
example
yeah dalvik bytecode why do we have a
different PI code format than say Java
bytecode the reason for this is the
dalvik bytecode if you look at the Java
bytecode structure it's organized on
classes and it tends to be kind of
chunked up I mean you jump around a lot
in memory when you're interpreting a
Java class in the case of Dalva we
actually did was we designed the
bytecode format to be very very flat and
shallow so that we can take this load it
into memory once and memory map it
across multiple processes and this is
particularly valuable for the system
classes like the core runtime frameworks
and so on because what this lets us do
is essentially load that memory once and
we only have one copy of the system
running as opposed to loading up you
know the the same memory and the same
objects for each process that or each
application that's
on the device the second thing that we
did and this is an example of another
optimizations did aggressive inlining
and or excuse me not inline aggressive
in turning so you guys are I'm sure I'll
familiar with string interning which is
where if you've got a string literal in
your application and that appears
multiple times the memory for that is
actually only allocated once by the
compiler and stored you know essentially
is as a global somewhere in this global
intern pool in addition to interning
strings though dalvik also does things
like interning function and methods
signatures the reason for this is if you
think about a you know a method that you
know has two integer inputs and returns
an integer that might be addition for
one class or it might be subtraction for
a different class and all of a sudden
you've got this and even though these
things aren't huge you've got the same
signature
you know existing in multiple classes in
the system and if you can in turn those
as well you can also reduce the memory
now of course the thing here is that
we're obviously a lot of these
optimizations are aimed at saving memory
and there is obviously a computational
you know trade-off that you make when
you do try and minimize memory
consumption and that's actually by
design and quite intentional because
what we're doing is recognizing the
memory pressure is what we call a memory
pressure is really the biggest
technological issue to building a decent
framework like this and really what this
boils down to is this if you're familiar
with a hard real-time programming system
you know that the difference between
like hard real-time and soft real-time
isn't that hard real-time systems need
to run really fast it's that they need
to run really predictably you know there
are many applications like say video
where 30 frames per second is acceptable
and most of the time you can hit 30
frames per second but if you really need
to maintain that frame rate you build in
a hard real-time system so you have a
guarantee that you can hit your frame
rate goal and in assume it's similar in
concept to what we to the way we think
about memory our metric is kind of how
many processes can the user keep in
memory at any given time and you know if
you've got five applications installed
and there's only enough memory for you
know one of those applications so what
happens is every time the user switches
between apps something gets shut down
and they get started up the user spends
a lot of time waiting for apps to switch
and so to avoid that you know we have
as one of the key design goals of the
overall system both dalvik and the
framework is to minimize memory and what
that does is that allows us to have this
sort of minimum number or increase the
average number of applications that we
can have loaded in memory at any given
time and by doing that what that lets us
achieve is responsiveness and improved
user experience and so on so these are
some of the things and then of course
the final thing is just you know a
register base instead of stack based VM
what this means is if you look at you
know in a simple addition take two
integers and return their sum you know
in a Java Virtual Machine which is a
stack machine you typically you don't
just have a load a load B and an add you
have a load a from stack so push a or
push a on to the stack push B on to the
stack you know and then that will
eventually end up trans you know get
transferred in native code at the
actually hardware assembly level into
like one read one store for each
argument that you load off of the stack
and so on a desktop it's really not that
big a deal because you gotta just in
time compiler which can come along and
optimize all that away but on a mobile
device if you actually use a just in
time compiler all of a sudden you've now
got basically two copies of your code in
memory and everything that I just said
about memory pressure means that that's
really something that you want to avoid
so all this is why dalvik has this kind
of I'm not gonna call it unique but very
memory focused and interpretation
focused execution environment we wanted
to make sure that a sufficient is an
interpreter so that doesn't need a
just-in-time compiler
although that's said we are working on
few and improved features such as an
improved garbage collector I forget
exactly what dalvik Scott right now I
want to say it's a mark-and-sweep but
I'm not sure but basically we want to go
to one of the more advanced garbage
collection algorithms has been out there
just-in-time compilation you know we're
are the teams working on one now and one
of the most recent benchmarks I saw has
something about 85% of native speed
which is pretty good for you know what
it would essentially constitute a second
generation vm and then you know
additional optimizations in the core
libraries yeah questions back
we can't compile the Native when
somebody downloads the app primarily
because we don't necessarily know what
the instruction architecture is that
they're running
we could do that but you know there
again you end up with two copies of it
and you'd end up with two copies in the
ocol storage so like you know again you
know if you take the original bytecode
and then have like a native compiled
version of it and you download that you
know you've then got a store that
downloaded bits somewhere and that
enough additional storage space that's
also limited I'm sorry I couldn't quite
catch that that's a possibility and it's
something that we've talked about I'm
actually not familiar with with it's
come up and I'm not sure if it was just
a you know we don't have time to do that
yet or if it's if there was a different
objection to it so I don't know what the
the answer to that would be so yeah so
the point that I kind of want to make is
actually I had one slide out of order
here so I'll do this one next so what I
wanted to do is then just take you know
another quick moment and talk about so
everything I just described also is an
interesting insight or sort of a glimpse
into our security infrastructure that I
wanted to talk about as well and so when
you install an Android application it
gets assigned its own unique user ID in
the Linux sense so what this means is
that we are not using you know a phone
is not intended to be a multi-user
system and so we instead use this notion
that Linux has of and this is a standard
UNIX multi-user thing and we actually
use that as application protection so
what this means is we're relying on the
Linux kernel which is very you know very
very well tested to be very good at
protecting users data from other users
on the system and so you know in that
way we we use applications sandboxing
and this goes all the way up we do a you
know the only process in the system that
runs this route is basically this thing
we call the zygote which is a copy of
the dalvik virtual machine running as
root pre-warmed up and so what it does
is it basically on system boot this one
process starts up and then goes to sleep
and when it gets a message from the
system and you're saying hey install
this or run this app it does a fork and
exec in a CH user to become the user of
the Apple
in that way we you know it's essentially
a you know drop privileges scenario
um and instead you know we have this
thing that we call binder which is a
kernel level IPC thing that's actually
rather sophisticated it's been I forget
exactly where we inherited it from but a
couple of our engineers wrote it having
based it on similar work that they've
done before and it's sort of a
fourth-generation IPC system that is
really good at you know passing things
like pointers and even file handles and
so on between processes and we rely on
that as a sort of enforcement strategy
to make sure that any IPC that we do
between processes is safe what's that
I'm sorry I can
so the question was so what we know
essentially how our privileges and
permissions and so on handled for
applications and the way this works is
an application needs to request a
certain number of or needs to
essentially state what it's capable of
doing does it access the Internet does
it read the contact book what does it
require from the system and then based
on that it actually will display
permissions to the user when the
application is installed and the user
has the ability to essentially reject
the app so the user can't do like a
line-item veto and say give it Internet
but don't give it context book because
we can't we can't assure that the app
would function you know with that
situation
so instead the it's it's an
all-or-nothing sort of thing but the
user is presented with all of the
capabilities that the application
requests and the system will enforce the
fact that the application can't access
something that it didn't declare that it
needs so the final thing I wanted to
talk about real quickly was you know you
can also do Ajax applications on Android
and so this is just kind of a quick
laundry list of you know what the
browser on the device is capable of but
I also wanted to point this out we have
this notion as I mentioned of dalvik and
you've got your your java namespace and
your your your managed objects and so on
living in there and you can also embed
this component called a webview which is
a wrapper for WebKit an actual little
browser component and you can stick that
in your application and it can display
websites and so on but we also have this
thing called add JavaScript interface
which is a tiny little method that is
actually very powerful because what it
lets you do is inject a Java object into
the JavaScript namespace and so it lets
you create what I like to call augmented
Ajax where you can provide additional
objects and functionality to your
webpage running JavaScript that it would
not normally have so that's it for the
whoops that's it for my technical talk I
wanted to go back to Dave who is going
to show you guys some demos of
interesting apps all right
so let's go to the projector if we can
good okay so running our cupcake release
which is what all the most users in the
world have right now with the Android
devices and I just I I just wanted to
highlight some of the cool things that
that the system can do and sort of
illustrate some of the things dan and I
have been talking about Google's a
company focused on speed you know you do
a search and you see how many
milliseconds it took to get the search
results we try to apply that in in the
UI design as well so you know we have
this status notification bar I know if
you've seen this our users love this
where basically any app can put a
notification in there that's touchable
and actually takes you to the app or
some independent activity within the
application and this is not too
successful to us this is this is any
application similarly in terms of speed
we don't have sort of a hub-and-spoke
model where you you know literally have
to come back to home to go everywhere
and you'll see this in the demo you can
jump from app to app based on interfaces
that they define they can define and
that can be used by all we also have a
widget model you know here we have a
search box by default on the screen but
you can also you know I could add a
different widget if I wanted to I have a
bunch of choices so we really try to
make it easy for the user to jump around
and and get it there an information very
quickly I'm gonna talk about
multitasking next I think it's a big
advantage of Android you can really run
multiple processes at the same time and
this is also an opportunity to
demonstrate some really what I think are
cool third-party app to doing a lot of
this stuff we're talking about so
there's one app called toon wiki that is
a music player replaces the native music
player but it does some really cool
stuff like if you're gonna be able to
hear this but it actually
actually displays the lyrics of the song
as it's playing can you hear that
yeah there you go so it's actually
gathering lyrics from the internet
creating a service for that and their
app draws on that and based on the song
that's playing it can do that now what's
really cool is there's another
third-party app called Shazam so the
company has been around a few years they
do music recognition literally based on
audio so if you're in a bar and the car
and you hear a song you like you hold it
up and it tells you what the song is so
I could do this on a separate phone just
as well and played over the PA but I'm
gonna just tag that song
yeah it is so I could use two phones
exactly and they're not using native
code at this time I think I know there's
a plane I'm moving to that so it just
will get faster in the future so there's
the there's the app it found it and then
various apps have defined interfaces
that anyone with a song can jump off and
use so well already well here let's go
to youtube and you know here's a bunch
of songs looks like maroon 5 played on
David Letterman now we may get audio
playing over audio at this point so I'll
probably just back out of this but this
is all about the way happening over the
3G connection yeah so there's David
Letterman about to introduce them you
know can also go I'm gonna go buy the
song in Amazon - how do we do para
management with everything potentially
running that's really up to the apps and
you know we do offer functionality like
like wake lock and whatnot but obviously
that's a pretty expensive thing in terms
of power consumption so developers need
to use that judiciously and obviously
when you're playing music or when you
have the screen and the backlight on
that's one of the most power hungry
things you can do
for the for the user not in this release
of the software I don't think we the
question was is there a way for the user
to see kind of what the power
consumption profile is and I can't make
pretty announcements here but they were
working on something like that so okay
so that's you know so so from that song
I jumped off to Amazon and I could
literally go buy the song here and
download it to the phone as well so so
we make it really easy for folks to to
to jump around between apps when they're
sort of common information that they can
all share and again just showing you the
notifications here it's telling me I'm
playing a song so I'm gonna jump back to
that and I'm gonna pause that note that
there's no actually notion of quitting
the apps I'm really just sort of jumping
from app to app and you know the system
is really smart about memory kind of
managing the memory in the background so
if I go launch something big like the
browser right now that'll get kicked out
of memory because the you know the
browser's pretty big in terms of memory
footprint so you can you can always go
in the app manager in settings and you
can you you can do it but we want to
make it so that the user can never never
needs to do that it's it's more sort of
a browsing model with the home and the
back button you and what we do is when
when you run out of memory the apps that
are in the background gets sort of
freeze-dried and the state gets saved
but they come out of memory in that way
so that's no ID and you know the answer
to that if we can take that in the QA I
don't know exactly what happens but no
you don't run out of memory
no but but you know the worst the worst
case scenario is the only thing inactive
memory is the app running in the
foreground that's sort of the worst case
scenario that feels weird right yeah I
mean you can always hold down the home
key and actually see what's actively
running if you want and jump to them but
and there are third-party apps on the
market where you if you want that
feeling of satisfaction you can go do
that and you can go you can go into
settings and manage your apps in that
way but the goal is for users not to
have to think about that yeah yeah so
the question was do we want this to be
your your only device and and our other
competitors approaches I guess I would
say that there's different devices for
everybody and they all have different
strengths you know I think we've got
great music player video player we've
got YouTube we've got all sorts of
things if you're really hardcore into
one certain type of app or one type of
media content you use you know you you
know you're gonna choose a device that
works for you but we yeah ours right so
there there are you know there are
trade-offs in and by virtue of having a
radio that's on all the time you know
there are trade-offs with all this stuff
okay so I'm gonna jump now I'm gonna
want to talk about I think I showed you
widgets before one of the widgets that's
really cool is our voice search which is
an app as well but you can launch it
from this so I'm gonna push this
Ethiopian restaurant San Francisco
okay so what this has done is it's it's
driven a web search base you can see it
recognize what I said given us our
mobile search results by the way the
browser is using Google gears so it
knows this blue dot actually knows based
on sort of my cell ID that I'm running
on right now the cell tower are on
roughly the area I'm in and you see a
bunch of you know a bunch of listings
here notice the number isn't a link nor
is the address but you can see it gets
outlined in green at least the address
did when you when you and so the
system's smart enough to just pick up
what what our phone numbers so I could
call this now or I can literally click
the address and go view it in maps here
I'm in here I'm in the fat mode the
satellite mode you know and I could go
and get you know directions to the
address from my current location because
it knows where I am with different
levels of location on the default is to
just do the low power option which is
know where you are based on the cell ID
or the Wi-Fi ID if you're on that but
the device also has GPS we have a robust
location framework that handles all that
so I can go ahead and get the route it
said it couldn't determine my location
interesting well I just reflash this
device so that's probably why but anyway
so you can do that yeah and you know I
could I could drill in and you know look
around and see if it looks like there's
you know parking nearby or I could even
go into Street View we have Street View
and you can you can look around and
identify what the storefront looks like
so a lot of cool stuff you can do there
and again we're really we're detecting
those phone numbers and those addresses
even if they're not marked as links the
last thing I wanted to talk about was
last thing I wanted to talk about was
kind of future direction for bridging
the the physical and in the electronic
world you see if I have a recognize this
bar code but you've got a barcode
scanner that's that's on the market and
you can use it to basically actually
don't know if it's going to recognize
this barcode but let's see what happens
it is not recognizing that Barco does
anyone have a soda bottle or anything
with a bar code here that's gonna take
this here we go so say I'm at the store
and this looks really cool there we go
so I can so I can open product search
here's your use package they're linking
off to the browser ad - to Product
Search and oh yeah look it found it
sensible foods apple harvest yeah
and it really gets more interesting from
here I think barcodes are just the
beginning
I'm really interested to see what
happens more in sort of the augmented
reality world so we have this thing
called a cool sky map where see yeah
here I'm actually looking down through
the earth because the projector is the
projector is you know only pointed down
but basically basically using the
location sensor the accelerometer and
the compass - to tell me where I am and
I can I can basically overlay
information another great example this
one will be harder to do on the screen
is this thing called wicket ood where we
take all it's not we wear this
third-party developer takes all the
Wikipedia entries that have GPS
coordinates associated with them and
overlay them on overlay them either on a
map or in this case on the camera so
getting back to sort of the augmented
reality thing now this will be hard to
do but let's see what happens
what was the question sorry is the is
the book yeah I made your point voice
search is pretty good I mean it depends
on and not get that now it depends on
let me do one thing at a time actually
so I have to kind of do an angle here
because it wants me to do in a landscape
mode but you see I have sort of a little
radar thing at the bottom showing me
where there's things and then it
should overlay yeah this is too tricky
basically in camera mode it will overlay
it's actually overlaying points and with
with markers on them I'm happy to show
this to anybody afterwards that they're
interested and you know there's the
Pleasanton mall and there's you know San
Jose State University and whatnot so you
know you could be on a mountaintop and
do this and sort of look around and
actually points things out for you and
overlays it on top of the camera so I
think there's a lot of interesting stuff
that can be done there and that in the
research area and and whatnot okay I
think we're just about out of time so
Jeff was gonna come up and talk he Riyaz
talked about a mobile project so I'm a
late addition here I asked well thank
you if I could join them because I guess
about six months ago I asked to offer it
if we could donate some androids to some
university faculty and to see what what
they could do with them and he said yes
let's do an experiment so I guess we
donated about 200 to maybe a dozen or a
couple dozen universities and I didn't
expect much results but I just pinged
them early this week and they sent me
some of their each of them sent me a
slide so I wanted to just show you some
of the things that are going on in the
universities using this platform for
both education and research and also get
your feedback is this something that
would be of interest if we did more of
it you know to me this this platform I
was at Intel during the 90s and it's
hard to believe now but when we started
there was really no PCs and in the
academic computing centers that really
started about mid 1990s and really
before then there was just about a dozen
different kind of workstations and it
was hard for folks to communicate but we
donated I don't know tens of thousands
of computers and PCs and I think now we
rush uhrin in a new era of maybe not
personal computing but maybe everybody
computing and then I think this kind of
fits in with our theme
for inform and empower global
connections and that's why that's one of
the reasons why we wanted to have the
Android talk because in addition to
creating content through the books
project and communications through
language translation we do think this
Android platform will be the platform or
platforms like it the way most of the
people are introduced into computing
throughout the world anyway some of
these projects actually are looking into
those issues and I just want to quickly
run through them and then get your
feedback and see if we should do more
like this this one's out of North
Carolina State professor Franck Muller
and this is fairly traditional kind of a
thing ad hoc networking it's a student
class project we have a lot of class
projects and this one's kind of doing
some interesting interesting things
there's a lot of senior project classes
we've seen this one's out of MIT and I
believe this might be the School of
Architecture but Eric heads up one of
their educational programs and they're
creating a game for students to learn
about weather and that this was a pretty
interesting one I want to see this one
actually working Columbia Professor
Steve finer is working on augmented
reality now he's been doing this for a
dozen years or so on PCs first and now
switching over to the Android and as you
can see it's using GPS and data provided
by New York City and kind of reminds me
a little bit it's sort of scary a little
bit of Minority Report you know where
you're presenting these things in onto
the screen but fascinating research
nonetheless this is another project sort
of reminds me of our Android App
Inventor it's you know this is for for
middle school children and they've
deployed it in 300 locations underserved
communities and all the students
programs run on the Android so it's it's
kind of an another exciting development
on the educational front out of brown
this is one project that I must admit I
don't fully understand I or the
motivation for it but whenever I see
something like that at the universe
it interests me and it bothers me so
much that I want to keep learning about
it but this is an HD ice professor who
is creating this project called spin and
somehow the Android the the phone
monitors videos does audio of nature's
and captures that whole experience and
then when the artifact is created the
actual digital artifact is given with it
and it captures the various moments the
conversations that went on I should
probably anyway anyway okay please do
okay here's another one social
networking is big and then I like this
one wreck watch whenever we're on our
way up 101 and there's an accident it'd
be nice to know that to switch over to
280 so this would be a good useful
project another more augmented reality
this might be my favorite one some of
you may know I was from I lived in
Pittsburgh for a few years and this is
they're calling it yen's cam and yen's
is some kind of Portuguese term for you
all or all of us or something like that
and what it allows you to do is to sit
in the stadium and get various views of
the action even if you're way way up in
the rafters you can see replays and you
know basically see the goals scored and
so forth so this was a really
enterprising I think actually they're
going to try to make a company out of
this but I could show you the video but
we really don't have time but I
encourage you to look into that
everyone knows Richard Ladner at
University of Washington and he's using
the Android 2 for mobile access for
folks with disabilities and so forth and
it's another exciting project and
Richard also has a Google research grant
srini session who's here today is
working on privacy and any androids and
mobile environments which is I know a
real concern of a lot of folks so that's
also exciting and then we have Deborah
Estrin who's here
Deborah is the only one that has two
slides because she is the two projects
that and actually we're funding Deborah
through a research grant as well as and
giving her some androids but this
participatory sensing project is one of
her projects I kind of liked this one
about the idling trucks living in San
Francisco waiting for the Google bus and
that's a good thing so I I think the
citizen science is another interesting
area and then the other project I just
called wellness but it's basically
monitoring chronic diseases and you know
basically putting your health back into
your own you know having yourself
monitor via your Android or your mobile
phone so that's a really good one as
well anyway those are just some examples
probably about half the projects we've
funded earlier this year so I'm anxious
to hear your feedback is getting this
kind of platform useful for you and your
education and research should we do more
of it
this is a little bit different from our
research grants it's a equipment grant
so we definitely like to get feedback on
that feel free to send me email or
anyone here on our staff if we should
encourage that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
