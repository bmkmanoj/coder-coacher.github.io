I have known for a number of years now when
he was at the University of Michigan.
All right.
I was going to say Michigan [INDISTINCT]as
a joke but I don't want to say that so--or
Ohio State--so I would like everyone's help
in welcoming Brett Lyons from Boeing Company.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: Good morning everyone.
So I'd like to say thank you again to [INDISTINCT]
and the host of the [INDISTINCT] and whatnot
and all of the attendees for taking your time
to participate today.
I brought to the conversation to--in the aerospace
perspective on that and at the manufacturing,
we have a lot of very specific requirements
and opportunities that have allowed this industry
to be a very good incubator for this technology
and as you'll see, where we are now and where
we've been and where we're going is a proof
of that.
So little bit about myself.
I work at Boeing research.
I'm in the composite processes group--Boeing
brought me in to work laser sintering.
S we're--I'm a--one of the second generation
of employee that have brought in--had been--had
been brought in to focus specifically on this
technology.
I work on work on mostly laser sintering material
development.
We had the great introduction on laser sintering
a few slides ago, thankfully.
So I don't have to do that as well.
What I want to go over today again is the
requirements and the opportunities we have
in aerospace or a good educator and a good
method for developing new manufacturing processes
and materials.
In general, additive manufacturing tends to
be the one that we're really focusing on right
now.
We look at the composites industry, a lot
of that came from, you know, a lot of the
real hard work in the weeds development came
from the aerospace industry, you know, vertical
stabilizers and the 727 back in the 70's and
whatnot, all of a--the composite [INDISTINCT]
work and from the Navy and whatnot back in
the day.
All that work is a--is a--is a model force
seeing how aerospace can work on these new
materials and processes.
So we'll go over just a few of the requirements,
obviously each one of these, you could really
spend a lot of time speaking to, then we'll00I'll
show a little bit of where aerospace is today
both on the military and the commercial sides
within Boeing obviously are the examples that
I can best pull from.
I'll show a little bit about what research
we've done to drive--additive manufacturing
so we were kind of--we pushed things through
the last five years or so.
And then, we can speak at the end about some
of the challenges that we're looking at right
now particularly in new materials in laser
sintering, although there are numerous.
So that, we can start with the requirement
and opportunity within aerospace and why they're
important additive manufacturing.
So these airplanes fly over everyone's houses.
It is--safety is just paramount and critical
and all of this--within the company that I
interact with and certainly everyone--I'm
sure the idea--takes a really, really personally--serious--at
a personal level of seriousness.
We have a lot of customers, a lot of regulatory
bodies that dictate how we behave as engineers
when we work in aerospace.
You can list requirements from different governments,
from airlines, from, you know, telecommunications
companies for the satellites, whatnot, until
you're blue the face but I think the subsection
25 605 there from FAA, it is part of the Federal
Aviation Administration's aviation requirements--I'm
sorry, regulations--really kind of--from a
material and process perspective for-- additive
manufacturing really, really, kind of gives
you the spirit of the regulatory environment
that we're up against then the requirements
to put new materials on aircraft.
We have to understand in any given period
of time that a given material is going to
be installed in a aircraft, how it's going
to perform, right?
And that's a, you know, it's easy to say as
one quick sentence.
But that means you have to know how the material
behaves mechanically in all ranges of temperatures,
humidities with chemical exposure, different
vibrations, being exposed to different radiations,
being exposed to pesticides, that's one of
my favorite tests, any case of fire, how do
the things behave?
It's just a tremendous amount of information
you have to develop and you have to do that
with a very high confidence level.
So it's a tremendous amount of data that has
to be generated before any one material could
go on an aircraft, even a washer for a side
panel that gets sealed with a--with a pump
or something miniscule that really doesn't
effect the safe--the safety of the aircraft
has to be understood completely.
That's the requirement that we work under
within aerospace.
Now and then to flip that is--to opportunity,
you can kind of take a customer's perspective.
So a number of airlines, particularly in the
commercial side--I don't know--are really
sensitive to the aircraft weight.
So you can look online a little bit, we--Boeing
obviously have a lot of information about
aircraft weight and how it affects performance.
I'm obviously--now, I haven't published any
of that.
But what I can point to is some of our customers'
works.
So American Airlines is one of them, [INDISTINCT]
Airlines, Southwest all have programs that
are basically kind of Employee Initiative
programs that allow their employees to make
suggestions about weight reduction, about
fuel burn reduction, etcetera, etcetera.
That really affect their--the bottom line.
What those programs give us and what the public
can see then is how sensitive these aircraft
are to weight.
So I don't need read the slides here but if
we pull one pound of weight off one aircraft,
within years time, that's--that saved a 114
pounds of fuel burn, it's one pound, so that
power break you have, if you want to use an
excuse, you know, to go out and buy a nicer
computer just--if you travel a lot, you can
keep that in mind in your rationalization,
if you take that one pound off an airplane,
it's a--it's going to save a lot of--a lot
of pollution.
Over the period, you know, aircraft's lifespan
again just that pound off is quite a bit of
fuel reduction.
And then that often translates no way to pollution
and you know, and just cost and everything
like that but also in bottom line of the--of
the airlines.
The read news numbers you'll see associated
with airlines are huge.
They bring in--they circulate lots and lots
of money.
These materials, these airplanes and everything
are really, really expensive.
But their profit margins are really slim in
the airlines.
It's very hard to make a lot of money on that
and these kind of numbers are things that
they care at about.
So, when we talk about, you know, the--we
have opportunity to reduce weight that actually
has a real significant impact in societies.
It's an environmental impact, it's costs impact,
it's commercial impact for us as a company
selling airplanes and whatnot.
And we're always looking for ways we can do
that, Boeing is pretty, you know, again that
bottom line drives us pretty hard.
So we're always interested in technologies
that might get us there and Additive Manufacturing
is one of them, I'll speak to it--reasons
why in a little more detail in a second.
So, going back to the requirements, this is
just a little bit more of a [INDISTINCT] list
of the type of things we have look at for
a polymer, we have to understand completely
again with a very high level of confidence
before we can put it on to any aircraft.
So, you can see, it is, you know, [INDISTINCT]
mechanical testing temperature, smoke release
toxicity in the very unfortunate and thankfully
very, very, rare event that there ever is
any kind of fire on a aircraft.
Rest assured, the polymers that are around
you really, really hard to burn, the new ones
and the base--you know driven by the FAA's
requirements whatnot are very, very resistant
to fire.
You can see some really extreme examples here
of flammability test on bottom right.
And these are polymers, these are--these are,
you know, material that start out basically
as fuel and they get to behave like that under
really extreme thermal--thermal conditions,
that pretty amazing chemistry and then the
processing goes along with is also equally
important.
So again, some of the detail type--types of--if
you're not familiar with working in that type
of--that type of requirement, these are the--these
are the tests that we have to look at, just
some other tests we have to look at for any
given material.
So, why we think additive manufacturing, and
why we feel additive manufacturing can really
impact the weight and over all performance
of an aircraft.
General section like part [INDISTINCT] reduction
is a huge thing obviously, flow time is cost
and one--full time for manufacturing is a
lot of cost and that something to consider.
But there are also other benefits in the--in
the aerospace world that we also tend to think
of, one of them I kind of [INDISTINCT] this
is kind of the Digital-Physical Loop.
So, with additive manufacturing and then kind
of the inverse technology, reverse engineering
technology, laser scanners, something like
that.
We're able to flip and flop between physical
space and digital space very, very easily.
With a low enough cost and low enough time
such that it's a--[INDISTINCT] accuracy, such
that--that it really is a variable tool for
engineers.
So we can make a part--we can make this chair,
we can laser scan it, we can take it into
the digital space, now we can do FEA on it,
we can do flow analysis and then we can--you
know, whatever you want, whatever types of
[INDISTINCT] processing you want to do, put
on that.
And now, with additive manufacturing, we can
take newly generated data and easily spit
it back out.
And when you start getting in to the real
strict performance requirements for an aircraft
part, those optimized designs are really,
really important.
So that's--that's one of the real enabling
technologies, why we're interested in additive
the manufacturing.
Second is that, manufacturing flexibility,
again we've had a good introduction of this
just a little bit before.
But basically with additive manufacturing--we're
doing in a batch process, so we can make first
batch of parts faster than any toolmaker can
even setup the jigs for his--on the CNC machine
to cut his mold and whatnot.
But at some point, our batch process are going
to be that much more expensive such that you're
going to reach a cut off point in terms of
quantity or a molded process or a tooled process
and maybe even more assembly process will
eventually be cheaper in most part--every
part is it's own--is it's own example that
you have--you have to consider details on.
But at that point, then you can transition
over to your kind of more standard robust
manufacturing--if you ever get to those quantities.
Now, in aerospace, you know, when we're making
even--the highest rate plane that were, you
know, both Boeing and Airbus making right
now is in the range about 40 units a month.
So, if you have one unit part on that, that's
one part--I'm sorry, 40 parts a month is also
your--is one year, your highest quantity requirements
that you'll see.
There are lot of commodity parts that have
much higher--especially like faster that have
much higher quantities in that.
But when you're talking about 40 a month to
an injection molder, that's not even, you
know, it's barely getting to two one.
That's really--like you can kick out, you
know, 40 parts an hour, easy.
So, that's an important--an important thing
to keep in mind is our quantities are appropriate
for additive manufacturing.
And the last thing is we've got robust processes
now, so what I'm going to focus on for this
topic is selective laser sintering.
It's kind of like--kind of like of additive
manufacturing process.
The powder based process while unsupported
geometry can do, they really--the kind of
complex shape that we need.
It has working with solar crypts on thermoplastics,
things like nylon, we'll speak to the polyurals
[INDISTINCT] and sulfites stuff like that.
These are robust materials that we already
used in the aircraft and this is the process
by which we can--we can form them in to the
shapes we need.
So, we have viable process that manufacturing
flexibility and then also the downstream type
things.
These are some of the examples of why Boeing
has invested in additive manufacturing, why
we incorporate it into aircraft.
Speaking of incorporating aircraft, we will
talk about two--I believe it has been disclosed
for a number of years.
So it's a--this all public release and whatnot.
Since 2002, Boeing has been putting a fair
number of parts on our tactical fighter aircraft
in production.
So, it's not just a prototype, it's not just
the one of demonstrator, you know--this is
the main line in production, you walk into
the factory, guys on the floor are putting
parts in, as you can see right down there
on the bottom, they are installing these parts
on the aircraft.
And we have been doing so since 2002 in serial
production.
We're going to talk about specific programs,
we're going to talk about specific numbers
whatnot but needles to say, it's fair amount
of parts that we've been flying for a long
time, almost a decade now.
The interesting thing about so, it was--we
used additive manufacturing that point and
investigated it because of geometry constraints,
we had a new aircraft, very tight constraints,
we didn't have the ability to manufacture
the dock work [INDISTINCT] is what--with traditional
means it--that would allow us to actually
fit everything we need to one into the aircraft
[INDISTINCT] so we had to use some kind of
process that can do this really crazy squiggly
parts.
So, that was, you know, the big driver.
Obviously all the other benefits, we're taking
advantage of no tooling costs, etcetera, etcetera.
The other interesting thing about these programs
is in this particular aircraft type, we've
keep--we keep very good relation because obviously
there are government [INDISTINCT] in this
case.
And we also visit depots quite a bit--maintenance
depots whatnot.
So, since 2002 on this program for the--let's
say over a 100 parts on a given aircraft,
we've never see or heard of one reported failure
of these parts.
So, they're a little of bit of--what that--what
tell--that tells me as an engineer, &quot;So they're
probably a little too heavy then.&quot;
So, especially these condition that they--that
they're put in.
But that's impressive.
Right.
So, we had a question about mechanical properties,
we have to understand that.
We do understand these mechanical properties
in sufficient depths to be able to engineer
all these type of components.
So, we look at these, &quot;Oh, these are just
air ducts.
This is what I get from my structures people
in Boeing.&quot;
I thought, &quot;Oh, you guys are just make air
ducts and widgets and whatnot.&quot;
Well, that's true but anything you put on
a fighter aircraft is--even if it's just sitting
there bolted to the wall with a, you know,
&quot;Do not step&quot; sign or something like that
is experiencing the [INDISTINCT] of temperatures,
of vibration, everything that that aircraft
sees.
That's the equivalent of grabbing a piece
and pounding against the wall time and time
and time and time again, everyday for decades.
Well, almost a decade in this case.
And we can talk about, you know, strength
of the materials, we can talk about all the
testing we've had to do to understand that
one.
But keep in mind the image that you see here
on the left side--keep in mind what these
requirements were like.
And instead of talking and, you know, putting
a grasp about, you know, meantime the failure
and fatigue strength and stuff like that,
I figured I just show you what the--what the
environment is like with this parts we're
living in.
That's what they do everyday for ten years.
The span of the general video you'll see some
of the applicable aircraft and programs.
But needless to say, these are really work--these
real working environments, very challenging
in all over the world literally they're saying,
you know, extreme sun radiation, freezing
cold temperatures, everything, lots of load--the
people that operating with them--yes, in a
general view.
People that are operating these parts don't
have any particular love for this technology.
They're not babying these parts at all.
They don't know them from any other part that's
on the aircraft, you know, functioning at
this level.
And that to me, when I came in to Boeing is
a fantastic surprise to see what this is--this
level of engineering we've accomplished with
additive manufacturing.
So, and then the--just landing loads alone,
you know, you're working like five, six feet
slamming down carrier dock and whatnot.
I mean, let's try to do that with your hand
like this way.
You have to really, really hate that part
to give it that much of--that much of a load
though.
So that's where Boeing's been.
That's where Boeing was when I came in to
the company.
And what I've worked towards and what my colleagues
also--what we clad around is transitioning
that in to a commercial here.
So, that's a lot of technology starting in
military applications and whatnot for numerous
societal reasons given [INDISTINCT] there
are thankfully enough transition into the
commercial aircraft which are a much more
viable economically, right?
I mean--fighter aircrafts are produced in
really small numbers, like that is a niche
product, it's very special product, very expensive.
Commercial aircraft are approaching with correction
rights that we're forecasting.
They're really approaching almost a commodity
either.
You get 40 a month for a given, you know,
component is a--is getting--for giving aircraft
is getting there.
So, we've been working to transition this
from--again, the commercial aircraft--military
aircraft down to the commercial side.
One of the big thing that's been amazing for
me to see is that once we published specifications
within Boeing for the materials and the processes
we're using to make these parts.
The engineering community is just--allowed
that to grow or a facilitate that's--those
process there's growth organically within
like--within the company.
We started with 787.
Let's just say almost all the commercial aircraft
independently of any, you know, pushing on
the technologist's perspective like mine have
all adopted these technologies where they're
applicable.
Each one of them does their trade studies,
economically, mechanically, you know, in terms
of engineering whatnot.
So, that's the best validation I think that
from an aerospace company we can--we can give
to additive manufacturing.
All these independent design engineers are
making these decisions, running these traits
on their own to put these parts on the plane.
So, a few notes on research.
So, that's basically where Boeing's been and
where aerospace has been and now looking forward.
Here's some examples of kind mature technologies
that we've developed and we look at that are
specific to additive manufacturing, kind of
related to that digital physical loop.
So, one thing is the thermal control of additive
manufacturing machines is critical.
I could--I'll be glad to anyone to tears about
that tonight over dinner if you want to.
But needless to say, it's a really difficult
problem to control temperature spatially in
machines that as dynamic as additive manufacturing
machines are.
We got lasers tracing on.
You have the different--I'm sorry, material
[INDISTINCT] sources and whatnot.
To do that is taking a lot of effort because
you would go in to tomography, in-process
tomography.
This--the challenges involved with additive
manufacturing, it really pushed us to look
at process control.
I think more so than most other established
processes.
And just because of the needs for consistency
and whatnot.
Inspection, so we've--really this is one of
my personal favorites--really got into micro-computed
tomography.
So, we're making all of this really crazy--excuse
me, all of these really crazy shapes and whatnot.
But how did we actually inspect them?
How do we actually know we have in full 3D?
We do planar cross sections with microscopes,
that's nice but you're starting to destroy
your sample, you know, at the level that we're
really interested in investigating.
Whereas micro CT really offers a unique perspectives
to start visualizing on very, very fine scales
and even larger scales, the geometries we're
able to create.
So a few notes on current problems, so we
even mentioned before of need for new materials
so for a host of reasons mostly of temperature
performance and flammability performance,
we need new thermoplastics to operate robust
land laser sintering.
That's--this is what I live at Boeing.
And so in general the industry particularly
laser sintering is familiar with Nylons polyamide
it's particularly Nylons 11 and 12.
Now we look at these new material families
[INDISTINCT] things like that and polyphenylene
sulfides, polyphthalamides, things like that
and they behave totally differently in this
one process and all the information, all the
literature we have which is not very deep,
it's 10 years deep or so is based on these
material families and then when you take this
other material which behaves just completely
differently and you put them in the same context
you kind of almost start in from scratch in
a lot of ways.
A few comparisons would take a long time to
deliver some of the points and that is why
we spend a lot space in paper.
You look at the difference between the materials
and we look at the melt temperature and then
the specific heats of the material.
Now maybe we have to go higher, takes lot
more energy they get in there and then how
much energy does it take to transition them
into a melt and do a melt regime and whatnot,
when you start really looking at these different
materials properties again which is a--each
one of this is a whole thesis, just comparing
that set of numbers right there.
In the context of laser sintering, it's a--it
illustrates the effort we have to put forward
to bring these new materials in to use.
Thankfully you can see parts in the bottom
and that's the--that's where the proof is,
right down there in the putting--o we are
able to make track on these and we are bringing
new materials with a much higher strength,
much higher capability into additive manufacturing.
Again just to further that contrast you can
see it later, being scanned right there in
the machine of these little air flow sections
whatnot.
It's a higher dynamic environment, I can't
say it enough and then again, looking at where
the polymer is usually dealing with, I'm thinking
about--thinking about process like, injection
molding and Autoclave processing kind of,
you know, net--whole part material energy
input at one time type processes whereas additive
manufacturing is infinitely dispersed--discretize
and quite variable.
So in this injection only you get to heat
up, you know, with some control, apply pressure
when you're molding your part and whatnot
and then let it cool down, basically as fast
or as slow as you want to because using a
control space with some--takes some engineering
effort to do that.
You compare that to additive manufacturing,
it brings material really close to the melt
and at some point for every given little discretize
part on the, on the component, you're then
running it through different thermal cycle,
right?
So how do you--how do you control that?
That's really, really challenging.
W e hold this material up to their melt point
right, laser passes over right away brings
it into the melt regime and then starts cooling
down and then you hold it basically where
all the other part around is--all the other
part around there is staying as well, it's
a--it's a really , really horrible thing to
do to the polymer and you have to--you have
the very specific team of polymer that actually
work viably in this processes.
So again, this is a lot of stuff I hope for
the next few days we will be able to get in
the weeds after this, if anyone's interested.
But that's an illustration of where we are
right now.
What we're looking at and when I go back to
work on Thursday.
Anyway, so moving forward kind of summary,
we have new materials coming in line.
I focus on polymers, so that's what I'm able
to speak to, metals are moving forward as
well.
Metal parts, if we put titanium on a plane,
it's s it's carrying load.
It's the only time we ever put a heavy material
like that on aircraft.
So the risk [INDISTINCT] is that much higher
so we'd had to have certain level of understanding
and confidence with polymer just to make air
ducts, widgets, washers, things like that.
When you start putting titanium parts on an
airplane you better understand how that material
is going to behave and that--thankfully if
FAA and those type of bodies enforce those
of regulations.
So it's a much, much deeper development curve
to follow.
So those new materials are going to obviously
extended in your application.
There's going to be organic growth in terms
of number parts, size of machines and, you
know, which is just kind of [INDISTINCT] the
number of application is going to drive the
machine technology etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
but there's a natural progression that already--just
within Boeing and our supply chain.
One thing we have noticed is there's--let's
about patents one--from the technologist perspective
within additive manufacturing, I have to say
it's been a good education for me to see your
patent system work in that context.
I'd say and I think most people familiar with
the technology would agree that the way in
which additive manufacturing companies just
by their nature and the type of technologies
that they're using, had used the patent system,
it's almost really abusive.
We're really--frankly, it's embarrassing we
should be five years ahead of where we are
now to be honest.
But again, the level of complexity that we're
dealing and subtlety, you have to understand
when you really consider what's new and what's
inventive in additive manufacturing is typically
beyond that which patent examiners have the
time or the expertise to consider.
And that's why I do a lot of problems--so
that's--it's--maybe not very popular perspective
to have on patents and intellectual property
but definitely it seems to be the case in
this industry.
So we've had a great demonstration of how
this technology is important within the countries
likes United States that pay--or labor enough
to actually have a living wage and whatnot.
These technologies are going to be quite competitive
with it.
And why?
It's because they're faster than boats I think
it's a lot of what comes down to in the near
term.
So in a lot--in number of industries you have--if
you're going to--if you're going to do with
low cost manufacturing [INDISTINCT] your shipping
time in that as well.
We make parts in a day or two.
And with boats do not get in through customs
in a day, so there's--it's kind of another
interesting thing from Boeing's perspective.
Particularly when you deal--you get in to
situations what we call AOG, Aircrafts On
Ground.
We have, you know, $300 million airplanes
if they, you know, ran in to a landing strip
lights or something like that, they need that
airplane fixed because that aircraft is a
very valuable resource.
They pay a lot of money to get that going.
It's the same with like oil and gas industry.
Individual parts can have just grossly exaggerated
value by their place in system, right?
If the system is broken, you have to get a
widget on that aircraft or equipment out from
the manufacture.
Who's going to allow you to do that?
You know, you're not going to be able to get
a part made and put on an airplane before
you can make one at a closer facility.
So, that's something at going keeps an eye
as well.
Machines are becoming more robust, so there's
lots of in line process control and it's really
getting complicated.
But it's fascinating as well, most thankful
there's a progress going that way.
In line basically with thermographic controls
are one of the next one that's going to start
coming out you can see that in [INDISTINCT]
swift infrared cameras controlling the hidden,
but on the machine real time whole laser scanning
over it's just like if you're--if you're in
Aerodis it's exciting.
And lastly the analytical methods really need
to mature as well.
So, when I bring a design like that, I have
this experience myself to stress analysis
and I'm showed him a picture of that.
He just laughed, he said really but--like,
I'm not even going to look at that, that structure
in terms of analyzing it for how it actually
the perform, you know, in a given a situation.
And in the bottom--in the physical part and
that was--it was helpful and that obviously
having like kind of prototype was valuable
for him to be able to start thinking about
it and you know, feeling a part and whatnot.
But remedy is the analytical tools we have
is a little bit of robust enough that aren't,
it don't require, you know, grad students
whole semester to complete the analysis.
But are not really able to usually handle
these kind of junctures normally we understand
really what we're making here.
And that's for that kind of micro CT stuffs
coming up plan and then we know we haven't
really--we've thankfully out-script the designer's
ability.
They really know what they're drawing.
So, are there other more excuses for them
from the manufacturing perspective, but we
have to move those tools along as well.
So, I hope that was a reasonable kind of summary
overview for--of how air spacing about and
manufacturing.
And went over the requirements that we operate
in, the opportunities for weight reduction
and how valuable that is--or out of and doing
complicated parts.
So, a few examples were going--I think you
will use it this, obviously a competitors
are starting to use it as well in their products
it's going just beyond our company thankfully
to help both with industry.
A few examples of the kind of research we've
had to do, to really advance the process a
little bit in order to meet these requirements
and keep the airplanes safely above your head
and not on it.
And then some of the areas were working with
new [INDISTINCT] relations and all that stuff.
So, I hope that was a reasonable overview
and I guess, with that, we have time for questions.
Any questions?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, Matthew Anger of IBM.
Can you comment on the use alloys and whatever
metrological constraints that might come with
it and additive manufacture?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: For metals--yeah, metal isn't my
area of expertise but I am related to it,
you know, close to it and do see it.
So, you have specific issues with metals.
With aerospace we mostly are interested in
things like titanium and then the light metals
like aluminums and whatnot.
Aluminums and the light metal tend to be really,
really conductive.
So, control of the part and the part of geometry
is experientially more challenging.
So you've got to really high melt time.
You can't preheat like we do in laser sintering
to give a more isothermal condition, right?
So, your time should rate in, in terms of
time and spaces massive.
I know your conductivity is really high too.
It's very challenging now and--for those materials.
For the titanium and whatnot, you get an option
to these issues.
So I--so now we can make this wonderful part
has this thing shaped and whatnot.
Now has this rough surface which knocks our
properties down just tremendously.
So, how do you deal with this surface on this?
So, you can--you can do quite a bit a work,
you know, with your [INDISTINCT] size distributions
or latest [INDISTINCT] energy and progressing
stuff like that to get the feature size and
a little size smaller, smaller, smaller.
But that's still kind of a challenge or problem.
With titanium sticking in it now you start
getting finer, finer, finer particles when
you know it, oops and your lab explodes, you
know, it's kind of initially that way as well.
So, that's kind of what metals are now.
The--a engine companies has mentioned previously
who really focused a lot more on that because
when Boeing, we have a large apart--a metal
part, most of them are big forgings.
That's, you know, you look at '77 and the
only--most of the metal there is large forging
and their machines.
And I know that worth's, it's banging--it's
placed under the aircraft crimped carbon fiber.
So, out of the many function is still, you
know, at these parts you can make or in metals
are like, yeah big or so.
Heat trade is another huge thing with that
to actually keeping the juncture stable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi.
I'm Kathy from [INDISTINCT] I was curious
you actually hit on this in your answer to
the previous question, but you said you were
making air ducts.
I was wondering if surface finish was an issue
and if there's anything that you do to mitigate
that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: Right.
I do work on that now and it really comes
down to finding automated processes to do
it and we developed processes to look at the
surface finish of air ducts and thankfully
there's a lot of, you know, background technology
like the [INDISTINCT] Industry and whatnot
but we're all working with in that.
But the best example I can give to that is
the surface finish, particularly on laser
sintering parts as we process in this consisting
enough to be able to work protectively.
The best--the example that I was given when
I came in was on was on one of these tactical
fighters that I--that I showed.
Simulations on the test--not simulations,
test on that's on stand before we load these
new ducting systems in the aircrafts and basically
they have a predictable models in terms of
how much flow they're going to get at these
given points and whatnot and then they measure
the actual result.
And we within basically the test margin of
error for the first laser sinter and some
place of ducts that we put on aircraft where
is typically when they're doing multipart
assembling in a ways cuffs that are joined,
the hand bottom one of their lucky to get
within 15%, 20%.
So, the margin, you know, they're over size
if they're making it any heavier because of
that, so.
It's consistent enough to be able to work
with them, but we do work on it to--it's actually
more important for parents to make commercial
aircrafts that's why they really care about
surface finishes and make sure we can get
parts of the cost with a different regulations
about if the customer can see it during landing
and take off, they can have a certain appearance.
But as well as all the another parents wanted
us, it's really driving in us, this is fashion
and so.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ZANG: Hi, Brett.
I have a great question.
I'm Jun Zang from UT Austin.
I have a really basic question.
I probably miss this, so in terms of an airplane,
right?
So, what's the percentage of the parts maybe
using these AM courses.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: So, percentage?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ZANG: And then what--and what's the percentage
in terms of the cost?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: The overall percentage is really
small especially sir considering I mean, there
are millions and millions of parts in an aircraft
and we're putting a few hundred or so and
so like that you're kind of ball park.
And then each program is different, each one
is going to have different numbers of parts
and quantities and whatnot.
The cost for the aircraft to get also thankfully
for instances this is very small compared
to what we pay for, you know, the rest of
the structures of the--of the plane.
The comparative cost I think maybe is one
of the point--the comparative cost between
an added manufacture part and the--and the
molded part is also quite different so we'll
pay easily hundreds--maybe thousands of dollars
for a simple part with all the quality control
we put on through it and whatnot.
That's typical and doesn't bother, it's all
because the mold to cut that--to cut the mold
to make that part we are remolding or, you
know, [INDISTINCT] labor whatnot is a $50,000
mold.
So, you know, you look at, you face--you can
do those trades and your tooling cost and
then all the tools storage cost and so as
maintenance cost.
All the added assembly you have for this different
components, all the ceiling you have to do
all the finishing on these small parts easily
gives added to manufacturing to bring the
cost benefit.
Quite a big of cost benefit [INDISTINCT] speaking.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is [INDISTINCT] from Eastman Chemicals.
You hinted about thermography, what's the
state of part on control thing that special
temperature profiles?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: It's--so thankfully this isn't--the
most leading work isn't at Boeing's so I can
speak about more freely thankfully.
So if you look at patent literature right
now, there's US [INDISTINCT] that's a German
company and they have patents and Boeing's
also has patents on thermal control of machines.
Well, basically we can--we can mount cameras
within the chamber and there is already existing
software that actually came from the aerospace
industry censored reasons and whatnot, to
be able to basically defines zones and then
you can take that output as a--as and you
can translate that into a given voltage or
a heater that is known to control that area
of the part and whatnot.
So that's kind of--that's a state over there.
There are--there are prototype machines that
have that in development but nothing sellable
yet.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, Brett.
Kevin [INDISTINCT]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: All right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, you have some part that you showed
that were deployed.
Have you used material models and processed
models to optimize the design to most parts?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: Well, yeah, quite a bit.
So, the first generations of parts were designed
an old much more standard--yeah, that's very
standard approaching, we're just kind of swapping
in geometry the thing that they can do.
It started in this commercially graft that
were moving forward and went through in a
quiet a bit of particular in adopting flow
simulation and we do a lot of internal geometry
to really control that flow in the way that
we want to.
So, as far as the process tools that they
used to design that I don't think they're
really any different and they would for--would
be for any other parts that did make the other
process, but the geometry that were allowing
[INDISTINCT] its what's differentiating.
Several standard, you know, BCFD and stuff
like that for those design pretty sure.
Did that answer the question?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Raju [INDISTINCT] MIT.
You have this interesting graph where if you
plot time and cost versus quantity of parts
for small quantities, additive manufacturing
is good and as the quantity gets big traditional
manufacturing does better.
So, for the three important categories of
plastics, metals and ceramics, where is that
crossover now and where do you see that crossover
moving in five years to higher quantities?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: We have--it's hard to do that in
anything by a part by part basis because you
can take a, you know, an air duct extension
which is this big and you're going to have
breakeven quantity like five or something
like that right or no transition qualified.
When the tools are really simple the parts
are very small and what not.
If you take that make it four feet longer
that's typically going to move and end up
dozens.
So that's typically where we are out for the
polymer and whatnot.
For metals, that's, you know, you might want
to ask the ancient people little more on that
because they have done more work in it but
for us from our perspective now, the primary
creedal is going to be all the testing required
to get those and all the process of elements
that's going to have to be done prior to that
in addition to testing to get those materials
to a place of confidence.
So, the answer for that from our perspective
is there is no cut off point right now for
metals because it's really something we haven't
invested and have we--again the engine manufacturers
is going to get a little more further along
in the place but for polymer parts and the
dozens typically for, you know, dozens, two
dozens, you know, in that parts of aircraft
it depends on the rate of the program too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think--I think that's going to be--have
the last one to stay on schedule.
So, apologies for that...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: Yup.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You'll get this chance in the panel discussion.
So, thank you very much Brett.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LYONS: Thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
