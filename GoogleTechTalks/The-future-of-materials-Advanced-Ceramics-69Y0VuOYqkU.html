going to be talking to us today about
advanced ceramics and I guess I'll let
you go ahead okay first off I want to
say thanks for everybody for coming to
listen to me talk about something that's
may or may not be related to Google so
much but it's to me I find it very
interesting as the world of advanced
ceramics so ever since I was a young boy
I was always interested in the world
around us I remember when I was about
four years old
we had a uh racetrack we had a car
racetrack with a remote control and the
cars would zip around it and they'd stay
hooked onto the racetrack I never knew
how until a couple after I use it a
couple of times I picked up the car and
looked underneath and I saw this gray
rectangular material I was wondering
what is that so I end up taking apart
all of my toys and I took apart all of
the cars just to play with the magnets
that kind of sparked my innate sense for
the interest of the world around us
eventually I watched mr. wizard and he
taught me how to make a little fire by
harnessing the sun's rays with a
magnifying glass and ever since then
I've I've always been interested in
science and technology eventually I can
went to college and I studied material
science and engineering at the
University of Florida
I earned my bachelor's and master's
there and focused in ceramic engineering
because my professor for the
introduction to ceramics course was the
most interesting of all the courses that
I taught I figured he if he could do it
so could i and so this picture here
shows ceramic that we make it's Aerodyne
that I took home to use in my home
glassblowing studio to see how hot you
could get it I'm going to talk a lot
more about this material a little bit
later I just want to show you this
picture and show this material being
heated up and then the travertine tile
underneath cracking because one material
won't crack from the other one will
you'll see why a little bit so the way
this talk is going to work I'm going to
go to the beginning of mankind really
and kind of take everyone through a
little trip where of the material
evolution and it's a
act on technology and then I'm going to
get into the advanced Technical Ceramics
world and talk about different materials
that most people don't even know exists
and some of the applications that they
work in and then they'll get a touch on
the future a little bit now this picture
I have shows the game of
rock-paper-scissors so in that game rock
beats scissors and paper beats rock and
scissors beats paper which is the way
that game works but in the evolution of
materials and its effect on mankind
quite the opposite is true so in the
beginning a a couple million years ago
man
start to evolve a little bit and the
first da primates are cavemen what what
have you you had wood tools they've
added a little sticks and things of that
nature after about a million years they
evolved into modern caveman modern
caveman used rocks and stones to make
tools and make God they used Flint to
learn how to make fire and that really
sparked the first step towards man's
effect on the world around him and kind
of changing the way the course of the
course of time so the key thing here is
that man use stone axes at made knives
that all these materials are somewhat
considered a ceramic type material the
word ceramic is a very ancient word it
actually comes from the Greek word
quran' MOS which means pottery or potter
and that actually dates back to the time
of sanskrit which means burnt earth so
it took about a million years for man
kind to lighting the fires actually
realize that there was something
underneath that after the fire burnt in
that one area for so long there were
some very hard materials and i was where
the first early ceramics came from and
they date back they're really ceramics
that anybody has really discovered it
comes back about twenty four thousand
years to uh they found some figurines in
czechoslovakia
so these this picture is actually of
some ceramics pottery that is maybe from
the maybe 5th century BCE so it took
basically a million years of
experimentation just to figure out how
to make ceramics to begin with and from
there on at about 8,000 BCE so it took
about sixteen sixteen thousand years to
develop glass which was really kind of
found by accident in the northern
Egyptian area when somebody heated up
the kiln or that was making the ceramics
in the which had the right amount of
sand and calcium oxide and sodium
carbonate in the area and they found a
nice pretty glassy glaze on that ceramic
then it took about another six thousand
years to figure out how to remove the
glass from the ceramic and make each
material separately and that was the
woods considered still the Stone Age
time I've been about 3500 BC people
discovered how to make metal and we
entered the Bronze Age and kind of
exited out of the Stone Age
this material is manufactured and made
probably when somebody heated up their
little uh pottery kiln a little too hot
and had the right elements inside of it
they noticed that the met metallic the
bronze and which is made out of copper
and tin float to the bottom and kind of
came out so this is where the scissors
beats the rock because the people that
it ended up developing the Bronze Age
and the bronze weapons and jewelry end
up overtaking the people that had the
stones so the newer technology took over
the older technology actually I was in
Israel a little bit ago over in the
Timna Valley which is in the southern
part of Israel are the northern part of
ancient Egypt and I got to witness some
of these old smelting furnaces firsthand
and I found this very interesting
especially I want to include it in the
talk because this is actually real
artifacts and this is what the old
metalworking
kilns look like and they were they would
have existed without the ceramic
refractory type materials on the outside
was heated up to about a thousand
degrees C with the or inside and once it
got to the right temperature all the
copper would come out of the bottom so
this happened at the same time that the
iron age started to come about so people
ended up developing and realizing that
you can make steel by melting certain
other materials at higher temperatures
that this material was even stronger
than the bronze so the people who had
the steel technology ended up kind of
conquering the people around them which
is another step on the kind of evolution
of mankind and materials so it's took a
long time to go from cavemen lighting
fires to survive to making steps every
few thousand of years to develop
different materials so now in the past
couple hundred years more advanced or
more typical ceramics have come about
and most people when you think of
ceramics you think of toilet bowls or
coffee mugs or roof tiles and those are
very important materials because they
shape the world around us but the ones
I'm going to talk about it a little bit
more advanced but before I get to that
part what I kind of just asked everybody
what is a ceramic and does everybody
kind of know what a ceramic is kinda yes
no is a question all my professors
always asked me in college so if you're
going to just share with you the
official definition is that it's a
typically inorganic material that has
ionic or covalent bonds has typically
made out of metal and a gas combined and
it's a very inert type material there's
a wide variety of different types and
they're usually crystal in it in nature
but they also can be amorphous and this
picture is of a typical ceramic in this
picture here is of a is it of an
advanced ceramic called silicon carbide
don't talk to you I'll explain that a
little bit so the reason why advanced
ceramics haven't been made into
very recently is because it takes a lot
of Technology just to process the
materials you start with a powder that's
very dense and heart you can't do much
with it until you compact it then you
have to heat it up to the right
temperatures to where each individual
particle wants to become one big
particle and due to the thermodynamics
of each particular material will
determine that amount of heat and energy
that you need to put into creating that
ceramic now ceramics are key enabling
technologies for pretty much everything
around us today and I think of them as
the unsung hero of the materials world
because not too many people know what
they are take them for granted or don't
realize just what they do but one of the
biggest ceramics out there are just
refractories that enable furnaces to run
at higher temperatures without them you
couldn't make fiber optics without that
there'd be no internet and I think we
all find that hold that very near and
dear to our hearts computers in general
even not before modern computers came
about there were the vacuum tubes and
you had to make the glass and the same
type of furnace and even glasses are
considered type of ceramic material cars
the same thing that you have a spark
plug inside the engine it has made out
of a very insulating material called
alumina and then the same goes for
airplanes in electronics TV radio and
everything else you can imagine and if
anybody has any questions afterwards
feel free to ask now the difference of
regular ceramics versus advanced what we
call advanced technical ceramics are
that advanced ceramics can go up to very
high temperatures their their properties
are much stronger than steel and they're
much harder the hardness is up to three
or four times that of Steel it's a very
lightweight material and they're
extremely resistant to certain chemicals
or pretty much almost all the chemicals
out there whether they're basis or acids
and that becomes the key in lots of
different processes such as even the
semiconductor fabrication and electrical
properties
these are depend on the exact material I
brought a wide variety of things to show
everybody at the end and we can talk
about the differences of all of them and
a little bit this is a few pictures of
what advanced Technical Ceramics look
like and what we consider to be that
what we consider those materials to be
are really typically non oxide materials
because your typical ceramics are oxides
like alumina oxide or zirconia oxide
then the more advanced materials are
materials that aren't found in nature
this picture right here is of boron
carbide this is a powder of boron
nitride this is a piece of silicon
carbide this is a composite material of
it a couple different borides and this
is also a silicon carbide so in general
in the ceramics world the non oxide
ceramics are all the nitrides and the
borides and the carbides so Sarah dine I
didn't really mention is the company
that I work for I've been working there
since I graduated college as a sales
engineer so I really work on a lot of
interesting type projects and I'm going
to discuss a lot of those with you guys
place the ones that we can talk about
it's a company it's about 40 years old
the founder found it in his garage about
40 40 years ago he's still the CEO and
it's all we make are advanced ceramics
and not too many people know about it so
that's why I'd like to share and I'm
glad that all of you are here and
listening and Esk ceramics is a European
company located in southern Germany and
they're part of Sarah die now and they
are they've been around since the early
1920s so they've got an incredible
amount of Technology and materials and
those will be some of the materials that
I talk about in a minute so advanced
ceramics are used in places such as the
aerospace industry nuclear waste
containment which is what this huge what
you call a casket is armor which is what
this is this called the bull it's a
minor resistant vehicle and actually I
brought a sample of our body armor too
which has made
of a few different hard ceramics and
it's used in the semiconductor industry
there's used as heat exchangers for the
chemical process industry and a quite a
variety of other places and we'll get
into all the details right about now so
the aerospace industry uses a material
well they use a lot of different
high-tech materials but one midtech one
material in particular I'm personally
very fond of is called silicon nitride
it's formula is SI 3 &amp;amp; 4 so there's 3
silicon's and 4 nitrogen's and it is a
very hard very tough ceramic and it's a
very strong insulator and it's used one
of the one of the neatest things that
it's used on are the nose cones for
missiles that need radar guidance
because it's a very thin tough material
but it can transmit RF frequency so it
can communicate with whatever it needs
to communicate with it's also used as
the spark plugs for airplanes or anytime
you take a trip down in a dc-10 or a 737
chances are that the spark plug is made
out of this material because it can
withstand the harsh environments of a
jet engine and that's actually why this
material was developed back in the 70s
one of my old bosses his name is John
mangles worked at Ford and led a team of
about 30 scientists and engineers for
about 20 years just to develop this
material so that way it could be used to
create efficient power in jet turbines
this picture shows the microstructure of
silicon nitride the grains are these
dark grey areas it they're elongated
somewhat needle shaped in comparison to
typical ceramics which are more Boulder
shaped which have more Boulder shaped
grains and that's what accounts for its
toughness because you have millions and
millions of these microscopic needles
all interlocking and it creates a very
very good properties of toughness and
compressive strength and low friction
another interesting material is boron
carbide which is this picture right here
and I brought a sample rock also so you
guys can come up and take a look
afterwards
boron turns out to be a nuke neutron
absorber so it's used in areas where
there's high radiation and the material
boron carbide has four Boron's and one
carbon so it's got a very dense amount
of boron in it and when you mix it with
aluminum you create a composite material
that absorbs radiation which is very
important because there's a lot of
nuclear power in the world and after you
use the the fuel rods you have to store
them somewhere and there's a lot of
spent nuclear fuel in the world that
needs safe containment so this container
made out of a composite of boron carbide
and aluminum can store spent fuel for a
very very long time
another area that boron carbide is used
in is a military armored and vehicle
armored and body armor and that's
actually I brought a sample up here the
material is so hard that it went to a
k47 bullet hits it the bullet physically
shatters and then the ceramic also
shatters in a local area in a way the
whole thing ends up stopping the bullet
is because it's backed with a Kevlar
type material and it's the really
interesting thing is that I've met quite
a few people who have been in in Iraq
wearing these vests and it saved their
lives one guy was had a machine gun
you've got hit right in the gun and five
bullets right up the center of his chest
and he's still living to talk about it
another guy I met just two weeks ago at
an art show I was talking to this guy
looking at a painting and on his leg he
had a big scar and I said what's that
from and he said well I just got back
from Iraq a little while ago and the
vehicle I was in drove over a mine and
it exploded and it tore up his legs and
his arms and he had these the really
wicked scars but luckily the plate
stopped all the shrapnel that was going
into his chest and it saved his life and
I just find that really incredible the
material is so hard
it's almost as hard as diamond and the
way that you manufacture this material
is extremely energy intensive the
closest thing on the world to the area
that you can make boron carbide is a
volcano and we actually had to get some
of the world's top volcanologists out to
help us design this furnace we used to
make it and takes about a month to make
a 40 ton brick of this boron carbide
then you have to break it down for with
jackhammers and different attrition type
males to very to make very fine powder
and it has to be processed with lots of
chemicals to make it have the right
composition and then it has to be heated
back up to over 2,000 degrees C and
compressed with thousands of with
hundreds of tons of pressure and after
it goes through all that you get a nice
plate of this material that'll stop a
bullet and I just find that incredible
that there's so much energy that goes
into manufacturing it and that kind of
the conservation of energy state of mind
that's why it stops bullets there's so
much energy in it
it can withstand so much energy one area
that silicon nitride is used in is our
car engines or diesel truck engines in
particular there is a time in the
development of trucks that most engines
were failing after about 50,000 miles
because one of the key components the
cam roller which was made out of steel
would gall and spall and end up failing
and cause Mack truck to shut down by
replacing that material with silicon
nitride the trucks are allowed are able
to run for millions of miles there's an
extremely low coefficient of friction
between it between silicon nitride and
steel and it's very lightweight so what
the area that it's in in the engine
oscillates extremely fast and it saves a
lot of energy
another area are racecars we make parts
that go and race car engines and I met a
guy who has horses it races the Porsches
and he's had one of these silicon
nitride that lifters in that car and
raced it every week for years and it is
work done incredibly another interesting
product that ceramics
diamond is actually used are these
friction shims which are these pictures
down here in that material there's a
very fine mono dispersed layer of
diamonds that's a that's embedded and
also another ultra hard material and
they're used to stick components
together when there's any sort of
rotational speeds such as in the car
engines between the camshaft and the
flywheel but in lots of other
applications too when something is
spinning really fast and transfer the
torque to another part the diamond
sticking to both sides and really hold
everything together and increase torque
by about 300% some of the pictures
didn't come through also medical
products are made out of ceramics
because because ceramics are
biocompatible we make now we make but
yeah well we do make braces out of
ceramics that are translucent it's
actually a lip line called clarity
offered by 3m and as allows people to
not have the big metal mouse that I had
when I was about 12 or 13 so if I if I
knew these existed this would be pretty
cool but uh one area another area that
ceramics play a part in that I that's
near dear to my heart and probably
everybody else's are the evaporation
boats this allows to send this thin
silver lining to be placed inside potato
chip bags the way it works
the material is so is very its wetted by
aluminum it's not corroded by aluminum
it's used in a furnace where a rod of
alumina is placed onto it at a high
temperature and the aluminum melts or
whatever metal you put in there melts
and spreads across the top and it
evaporates off of it and it coats
polymers to make this very nice silver
lining and allows your Cheetos to be
crunchy so I always think that's pretty
cool
now another area is the industrial area
this this industrial where products
group or group of companies rely on
advanced ceramics to take their
processes farther and be more efficient
silicon night there are three materials
that are used in these kind of
applications its silicon nitride silicon
carbide and boron carbide all are used
for their very hard nature and they're
very kepler chemical inertness one area
that's very interesting also are
windmills and windmill bearings with the
need for more efficient and greener
electricity everyone is looking for
different ways of obtaining that and the
windmill bearings by having a silicon
nitride ball in between the two metal
races allows for bearings to last a very
long time some issues that not exist
with windmills if you have ever driven
lacrosse down the highway and seen a
bunch that are stuck is the fact that
they create huge amounts of static
electricity on the blades that static
electricity jumps across the outer race
through the metal ball to the inner race
when you have metal bearings in there
and when that happens it creates a
little pit and the whole bearing fails
and then how do you replace a ball
bearing up on a windmill it's a lot
tougher than replacing something in your
bedroom or your fan and your ceiling so
silicon nitride again is a excellent
material because of its low wear and a
low friction and also every piece of
paper are mainly every piece of
commercial paper that you touch has
touched a piece of ceramic in its
lifetime the paper mills start with wood
and they go process the wood with
chemicals and liquids and eventually a
huge sheet of pulp is press moves at
about 60 miles an hour over various
various areas that remove
more and a little bit more of the water
eventually when when the mill when the
paper has about 95 99 percent paper pulp
it has to go through its final stages of
manufacturing to suck the final bit of
water out of it and at that point it
rides over these huge 30-foot long beams
of silicon nitride and silicon carbide
no other material can survive that
environment steel and metals would rust
and they wear a weight weight quite fast
the ceramic lasts for many years and in
every major paper mill in the world
that's it exists and it and it helps
make the paper another interesting area
that silicon carbide is used are in
fluid handling circumstances such as
pumps for chemical chemical pumps and
also water pumps in every car engine
this material is very hard and also has
a very good good chemical resistance
into canvas to withstand pretty much any
chemical out there it's used in pumps
and in many chemical manufacturing
plants where nothing else survives and
again it has to do with the amount of
energy that's put into manufacturing
this these materials allow them to
survive and much harsher environments
and this what you're looking at right
here are what is called heat exchangers
and micro reactors that are made out of
silicon carbide this is a brand new
technology that has never really been
developed anywhere in the world
and what it allows is to have stirred
and liquids passing through some
channels and other liquids passing
through the others to transfer heat and
remove process heat out of severe
chemicals and they'll survive up to over
1,500 degrees C which is which is really
hot and nothing else in the world can
really do that I just I just find all
this stuff very fascinating I hope you
guys are buying it uh somewhat
interesting another really cool area
that every computer relies upon is the
manufacturing of
I reckon dr. chips surd all certain
ceramics are used in the wafer fabric
fabric
create particles when they're going
through these high temperatures and all
the etching processes by it utilizing
advanced ceramics such as aluminum
nitride or silicon nitride it allows for
larger and larger wafers to be
manufactured more efficiently and
they're very hard material so it allows
the plane arity of the the wafer to stay
very planar this is what some of the
parts look like so you can just imagine
a large silicon wafer there with all the
dimes on it and it's just really
incredible that these materials exist
and enable technology to move faster and
every day another area that ceramics are
used indoors the manufacturing of
aluminum the aluminum industry really
uses up about one and a half percent of
the electricity on the entire North
American electrical grid and by
utilizing different ceramics that are
conductive and resistant to certain
materials it's enabling them to save a
lot of electricity and allow to be
allowed them to have a much more greener
process the materials that are used see
arrows titanium dye boride is silicon
nitride and boron nitride boron nitride
as a white powdery type material they
call it the white graphite is very
smooth and I can be used on coatings for
whatever you need to cast anything or
lots of other really interesting areas
another picture didn't make it such as
cosmetics so not only is are the some of
these materials used in these very
intense furnaces for manufacturing steel
and aluminum they're actually also used
in in makeup for uh for anybody who
wears makeup I have a sample up here if
anybody wants to look I think somebody
in the audience might um
also silicon nitride is used for oil
exploration and recovery this material
is non-magnetic and it allows for very
interesting electrical equipment to work
at thousands of feet below the surface
it actually goes in some circumstances
to five to ten miles down the earth down
beneath the surface of the earth to help
different companies find oil and it's is
just remarkable that it anything can
withstand the kind of pressures and
temperatures that exist at that level
and it's also used in different valve
systems and valve balls and bearing
balls and I also have one of those up
here that is I can show that you can
come up and take a look at afterwards
every car has brakes they're machined
with silicon nitride it's the best
material to make brake rotors it just
happens to work very well so every time
I stop my guards yeah think silicon
nitride at least a little bit I also
thank my response time very recently on
another topic the National Academy of
Engineering had its Congress just a
couple just last month and it's a team
of some of the world's best and
brightest minds Larry Page is actually
on the committee of the National Academy
of Engineering and they had and they
determined the world's top challenges
for the 21st century
these are they were engineering
challenges that they are engineering
challenges that have no solution yet and
some of them are to making solar energy
economical providing energy from fusion
or figuring out what to do with all that
carbon dioxide in the world and managing
the nitrogen cycle and so on I have a
good feeling that ceramics are going to
help solve at least one or two of these
problems and and at least from the first
problem that solar energy some materials
such as fused silica are used to make
crucibles to me
very cheap and efficient solar cells
basically each crucible is filled with
an ingot of molten silicon that
solidifies and crystallizes and it's
sliced and to make a solar cell and no
other material works quite like this so
where there are things that are
happening in the world to make soil
energy at least cheaper for now and
hopefully there'll be much more jumps in
technology to make them even more
efficient just overall in the quest to
make the world greener and to use less
energy ceramics are enabling many key
technologies like the windmills the
solar cell manufacturing nuclear waste
containment and oil exploration and
recovery
no matter which way you look any extreme
application needs materials that can
withstand those environments and
ceramics sent tend to be though some of
the only materials that can withstand
the extreme environments so tying it all
together ceramics have been around since
the beginning of mankind really the
earth is a big rock hurling through
space which is really ceramic and as
technology evolves and progresses the
world is going to use more ceramics and
technology is going to go ahead at a
faster and faster pace
I brought some parts that you guys can
pick up and touch it see at the end
I brought the silicon nitride bearing
I've brought evaporation boats boron
carbide an armored tile and an armored
chest plate and also something I made in
college which is a glass full grippe
edge is made by harnessing the power of
lightning and channeling it through a
bunch of different materials and it
creates a hollard a hollow tubular
formation so I brought that for you guys
to see as well thank you
and does anybody have any questions yeah
so um one question you talked a lot
about how energy-intensive all this this
all is and energy seems to be going
through the roof what does that imply
well it doesn't apply to much it just
implies that they're not cheap
is it ceramics always cost more if you
need to buy them is then it's typically
steel or plastics but other than that
not much it takes a lot of energy to run
the lights computers but it does what it
what I like to think about is just that
takes so much energy to put into it it's
all stored inside the bonding of the
ceramics and it makes them stronger and
last pretty much forever yeah
so normally in chemistry you learn that
the bounds that have no energy are
stronger because they're at the bottom
of the energy well so are you sure
you're not just instead trying to
overcome an energy barrier and falling
back oh yeah of course you are
definitely overcoming energy bars but
the level of that energy bar is a lot
higher than a different material at a
different lower energy or you ever
overcome the higher energy to get to
this hill rather than a hill down here
