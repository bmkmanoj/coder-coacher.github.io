Claudio Kishan up here he's gonna close
out G tak for us with this last talk on
drinking the ocean finding XSS at Google
scale but I want to say one thing he was
a little intimidated by the matrix
opening he had his own skit and then he
sort of decided not to do it so let's
just give him a clap for being the last
one up here and so thank you let's go
drinking well thank you and thank you
all for being here so late in the
afternoon hopefully you're not asleep
yet
try to fix that so my name is Claudio :
I'm a security test engineer at Google
kind of like the title the only issue I
have with that it's kind of difficult to
explain that to my mom she seems to be
quite convinced that engineers are
supposed to build bridges and for that
reason most of our conversations today
look a bit like this it's kind of set
well with that so remorse here is not
what do I actually do a Google well the
sexy line is that I am a hacker so I do
security the not so sexy line a more
truthful one is that I look for bugs and
web bugs that it turns out that the
security webparts most of the times are
actually cross-site scripting XSS so
before we do have a bit deeper into that
and many of you know what an XSS is
raise your hand please okay it's great
it's more or less what I was expecting
but just to be sure that everyone is on
the same page let's take a minute to go
through what an exercise is and how it
works
so at a very high level and exercise
vulnerability happens when an attacker
can execute its own JavaScript
JavaScript he controls really inside the
victims browser in the context of a
vulnerable web application now how this
looks like in the real world small s
like this so you have the attacker
you can tell it's people that is sending
a link to a user which for some reason
as his monitor filled with coke the user
will now click on the link and it will
hand up on a vulnerable application now
what will happen at this point at least
in the most classical vex
is that the application will process
this request and the request will
contain a payload the evil JavaScript
and the attacker crafted and this
payload would be issue it back to the
user and it's browser will have no way
to know if the JavaScript that he is
receiving is a good one or the bad one
that the attacker injected so it will
execute it and it will turn into a
puppet owned by the attacker now how
does it look like from a code
perspective which is a bit more
interesting well you mainly have two
families of exercises the first one is
the one you have on top it's the old
school XSS if you want it's the most
classical one there is a request and the
server this is Java snippet very lame
Java snippets or is Mike holder you can
see the request is taken as an input
from the server process it and sent back
to the user
classical XSS now of course it can be a
number of sources it doesn't have to be
the requests it can be a database but it
doesn't really matter in our model the
second one is the most interesting one
it's new school XSS everything there
happens inside the browser as you can
see the payload there lives inside the
document dot location dot ash which is
the part of the URL after the ash target
that is never sent to the server so you
don't even see it happening from service
perspective and then it gets each read
back inside the dome and executed
through the inner HTML statement now
keep this in mind while we go through
this presentation it's gonna be useful
whenever I talk about these two specific
examples with my mom which we do every
week on Friday
usually as a complain she says come on
this is not something that happens in
Google right I mean it's just excuse for
you to play games
it turns out that yes it does happen at
Google as well seventy percent roughly
of the X of the four security bugs that
we observe are XSS so this is huge
problem however this is a pie chart and
as you know pie charts are never
truthful in this specific case the data
is from the vulnerability reward program
what is the VRP for a beauty world
problem it's one of the many initiatives
that Google has to make our application
more secure the core idea is that we
reward researchers for finding bugs so
they keep finding security bugs they
tell us about that with fixed
and our applications are eventually more
secure now we awarded around $800,000 in
the web program alone that's a lot of
money that's a lot of bucks so it is
real problem and people out there
testing and looking for it and that's
why this presentation will be about how
we try to fix this thing at a scale at
Google scale but before we get there how
are these people actually looking for
exercises there are a number of
techniques out there in the community
industry and the academia on how to test
for XSS most of them don't work or at
least work in a very specific narrow
case that is good enough to take
whatever paper out but they don't work
in the real world so what we what we
actually observed is that what works is
the Christmas Eve approach so you know
when you were a kid you had to wait when
raps the the all the presents that were
lying under the Christmas tree and
before that you wanted to know what was
inside so you took the present and shake
it trying to figure out what was inside
this is pretty much the same approach
that we have we try to listen to the
sound of the application to figure out
if an XSS is there so today one of the
most effective ways to test for XSS is
just buzzing we send a test attack in
which contains a JavaScript payload then
we look at the response from the server
and if the payload is there chances are
the reason XSS well it's actually quite
reasonable that there is an XSS the
payload shows up now this approach has
many shortcomings but at least for me
the main shortcoming is that if you
spend your entire day looking for XSS
like this so every parameter every page
every application manually going true at
the end of the day you look more or less
like this that's me
after a day of testing for XSS bad you
don't want to do that so you want to
come up with a better solution and this
talk it's about the travel the our
journey in building a security testing
tool that could test for exercise okay
so what are the four main points that
I'd like to get across and those are the
four requirements that we add when we
set we started building our testing
tools well the first one was that we
wanted to build a false positive free
testing tool this is extremely important
with security because if you report a
security bug people are going to fix it
very quickly
be very worried about it and you can
only report false positive so many times
before they start ignoring your back in
the talk before mine we saw how
important it is to report truthful
things when you deal with security and
yeah it is extremely true the second
problem of course was capability most of
the security testing tools out there
cannot cope with the sheer size of
volume of pages that we have people and
finally we wanted it to be completely
automated and possibly usable by normal
human being not just security engineers
so let's start with the first one false
positive free how hard can it be
well the basic approach that you can
have is that you just grab the HTML that
gets sent back from the server
remember request server sends back
response you grab through the HTML and
you find out if the payload is there it
turns out this doesn't quite work
consider this approach this is a
situation where you have a no script tag
and your payload ends inside a no script
tag well this is complete false positive
unless you can prove that you can escape
from the no script tag because that
javascript is never gonna execute so no
doesn't work you go back to the drawing
board and you build something better you
build something that has some context
while understanding of HTML I can
actually parse HTML and identify when
the payload is ending in a part of the
code that is going to be executed well
not enough you can now understand that
you're inside JavaScript but you need to
understand exactly what JavaScript is
doing to understand if your payload is
going to be executed so if exercise body
is there in this case for instance we
ended up inside that JavaScript string
so unless we can escape out okay this is
not a part if you report that to a
developer you would say yeah sure not
not real bad so again like the drawing
board and now you need to understand
HTML and full JavaScript syntax all a
lot of fun but you can call it and it
will work at this point you're more or
less capable of identifying XSS we know
we are false positive because you
understand it HTML you understand
JavaScript so funny enough the problem
with this is that you're not going to
find a lot of exercises because modern
web applications look more or less like
this there are small block of HTML and
then too big
JavaScript components that do all the
work
so in order to be able to look for your
payload there you need to download a
transcript execute them and then look it
through the dorm with the technology
that we just discussed about so you have
to do better you have now to build
something that understand JavaScript
executes it considers the dorm and so on
we went to all these in very nice by
plan and we ended up with something more
or less like these components so back to
the drawing board needs to be better you
need to scale this doesn't scale so we
figure it out that if you have HTML Dom
JavaScript and whatnot I mean this looks
a lot like a browser right and it turns
out that we are also building a browser
so why not let's use a browser a very
long story to get at the end to using
Chrome fine how do we use it though
because yeah you use Chrome but of
course the most natural approach is
instrumenting the browser and look
through the parsing code of the browser
and if you pay load shows up good well
it's very hard the parsing code is
extremely optimized it changes with an
incredible speed of course because of
the fantastic job over the developers so
you can do that but it's really hard and
we didn't feel like starting doing that
so we took the usual approach and sorry
we took a different approach and we try
to look at the problem from another
perspective
so so far we've been discussing about
detecting the presence of a payload from
there deriving the presence of a bug how
about instead we try to actually
exercise the bug actually exploit the
bug and attack the results of that
exploitation well turns out that is more
or less works the way we have taken is
to inject a JavaScript function inside
the browser so it's fermented outer add
a function a call back the function and
if the function gets called back it
means that the payload which contain the
call back has been executed so there is
an exercise in the page and there is
really little chance that this is a
false positive right true again if you
try to do that actually out there it
turns out that stuff breaks if you
inject arbitrary JavaScript into
arbitrary pages
websites won't like it some applications
will not like it so okay okay doesn't
work it was getting frustrating at this
point so we went back and we tried to
find a better way this time it's an easy
one there is a functionality in Chrome
which is very handful we can use that
functionality to call back outside the
context of the page and we can also
monitor for call so that functionality
what is that
well the debugger as easy as that so the
way we finally managed to detect
exercises which basically zero false
positive I get back to that later is by
looking at the bugger so to an extension
where you can side the debugger we then
use a debugger call as our payload so
not any random JavaScript but an act was
call to the debugger we load the page
and if we get a callback point okay
that's an exercise it's extremely
unlikely that you will find a bugger
called in production code now I said
close to false positive free there was
one case that one developer left at the
bar get call into production code now
I'm pretty sure that he did it on
purpose so they couldn't say that our
approach was completely false positive I
will find out but at the end of the day
these words now there is a lot more to
this but this is the sex interesting
part using an out-of-band detection
model to get exercises with false
positive in with the complete false
positives we approach now for the second
part this was a lot of fun now we
actually had to scale this approach
because now we ended up I think Chrome
as our detecting mechanic detection
mechanism and we had to scale these to
all of Google interesting challenge well
it turns out it's not that difficult if
you think about that because Google has
a lot of ways to scan things so we used
all publicly available or less
technology to scale our approach App
Engine for the web interface we use the
Google compute engine to start virtual
machines and run Harmy of chrome workers
that will then swarm over an application
and test it the key intuition there was
to use a pin task queue feature
available in App Engine to split every
single scan into smaller tasks this is a
common approach in web testing
right split up huge job and then you
just spread it over a bunch of workers
this is what we have done and in the
process we also managed to play with
some of interesting techniques
technologies that we didn't have to
chance to work with before so with this
approach we scaled to some thousands
workers and we can now scan most of the
static pages throughout less than one
night at this point which is pretty good
how about the third point this is an
interesting one I like to spend some
time on automation so if you think about
automation the Google mantra is really
automate everything that you can
possibly automate right we want to
ideally we want the developer to click a
button and something magical happens in
one second and it gets the response back
and it fixes box this is the ideal order
we can detect exercises with no human
interaction so it seems our job is
pretty much done right well
unfortunately as it often happens when
you're testing you're doing web testing
you have to take care of coverage
because yes you can find exercises
provided you can actually reach the page
that has some exercises inside so this
was a very big problem for us the
largest problem there of course is the
nature of modern web applications we
were dealing with applications that
didn't really care about being trolled
right Gmail why would you approach email
ideally this is not been designed with
that in mind so it's extremely hard to
extract all those links inside the page
and use them and links are literally
everywhere in modern web apps xhr remote
and sorry javascript execution html5
features everywhere okay we've been
through this before right we need dorm
JavaScript and so on let's use a browser
and be done with it and let's go home
and have a beer turns out no again
doesn't work this is a very
well-established area of research I
believe there are at least some
prototypes out there that do complete
kraut browser based crawling now if you
try to scale that to the sizes that we
needed it to scale it just turns into
something horribly slow flaky and
efficient of course you can do it but it
turns out this is one of those few cases
that we couldn't just throw out where
the problem
and solve it the PD because I loved it
but no you can do it so we had to go
back to the drawing board and find a
better solution to make it faster better
and so on well it turns out that the
solution in this case was in the nature
of web application itself at least the
ones that we observed if you look at
them hard enough you will start to
recognize small clusters of pages so
these clusters are pages that are
tightly linked by easily crawled links
think about the menu that has all the
links once you reach the menu getting to
the other pages is reasonably easy from
there you can take some steps an
on-click event an interaction with a
component a java script called something
like this and you end up in another
cluster of pages now this is something
we didn't know really know if it was
true or not but we sort of it seems
reasonable so we gave it a shot in order
to make this faster we use two different
tools all the HTTP part all the simple
plaster part you can pretty much scroll
with existing tools that are insanely
fast in this case we use skip fish which
is a tool that was developed by two
fellow Googlers it's a security scanner
and it's now open source and it's
insanely fast at rolling this kind of
website so we'll use that seems
reasonable
then we recrawl those pages using a very
lightweight approach using our Chrome
browser and we keep doing that until we
reach another cluster and then again
skip fish finds another bunch of pages
and we keep going until we think we
covered the entire application fine
this approach seems to be reasonable but
of course until you see it actually
working it's just worse right so we gave
it a shot we implemented tested tried
and it turns out that even with this
extremely simple approach you can
augment a number of URLs do mine by at
least two orders of magnitude which is
kind of cool
of course this doesn't tell you much
about the percentage of application that
you cover that's completely different
problem right you might as well still be
missing links but in a comparison of
sheer volume of URLs that you are
finding is still a win now
take the numbers with a grain of salt
because of course there might be some
degree of the application and the
initial numbers of URLs that you're
gonna mind from Gmail but just an HTTP
crawler is not that exciting so it's
easy to do better still it's better with
a very very very very limited effort so
we managed to crawl in a very simple way
combine HTTP with Chrome sorry
browser-based crawling and that's some
very interesting results what else did
we do well the last point was at least
for me the main takeaway of this entire
project there was a big team behind this
effort that I had the pleasure to work
with and there still is and I think the
main takeaway I had was that security
people cannot possibly design any kind
of interface it's just bigger over their
capabilities it's not do most of the
interfaces and the tools that security
people I've designed look a bit look a
bit like this thing right it's a coffee
pot for masochists it's just horrible
and and often they don't even realize
that you ask them why why don't you why
don't you make something better why
isn't 25 flags form underlying argument
could knock me off sure so we didn't
actually do that we asked for a UX
expert well pass and it did an amazing
job I believe but why did we actually
care because no one else did before so
why did we well I think solving the
scalability problem is only half of the
issue if you can scale and scan thousand
of millions of URLs starting from just
one you still have to have someone that
gives you that first URL and then looks
to the results and fix them so you need
to have users and it turns out at least
this is what our experience internally
ditched us that unless you make a tool
usable easy and I was going to say
appealing but that is from appealing to
the users they simply won't use it our
end goal was to give this tool to
product teams not security because
that's how you scale security people
despite being very vociferous are only a
limited amount so they can't really
scale and you don't really want to be
the human factor the bottleneck of your
system so we ended up with an interface
that is incredibly simple
you literally only have to enter the
name of the scan and a bunch of target
URLs and a couple of more details like
the authentication if you really care
about that but we figured that out to
make it early and then we just go and do
our things and we'll get back to you
with the results and that's literally if
there is nothing else that the user has
to worry about and since the results are
supposed to be false positive free they
are then you just go and fix the bugs
that's it so if you slept so far time to
wake up and it's summary time the wave
for things that we went through doing
this very short talk about security it's
really exciting to talk about security
to testing people because I think they
carry even more the security people
that's different so the first thing we
did is we leveraged the browser to
exploit but instead of just detecting
them the second thing we scale the
infrastructure using publicly available
technology Google technology at that and
the core intuition there was the score
to scale horizontally even to a single
scan finally we proved at least in our
empirical tests on cool applications
that by simply combining HTTP then
browser crawling you're you're able find
a lot more targets one word on this why
do I say URLs and not States because
most web application testing you care
about states of the app right so you
click the your URL URL doesn't change
but the application is different well
that is true but from an attacker
perspective what you care about is URLs
because you want to have a URL that you
fought and sends to someone if you have
destruct that someone to go to a page
and then click on a button and then spin
three times on the spot and then click
on a button this attack is not going to
work might just as well ask him to
execute the binary or tribe Java
strictly in the URL bar so to complicate
it we're after stuff that the attacker
will actually use finally we really
really wanted hard build a self-service
tool that could have been used by people
outside of security not just the
security team but the product teams and
the thing if there has to be one
takeaway is exactly that one this is
something that we learned from the
testing people we learned that you have
to give developers no excuse to write
tests well it's the same for security
you have to make it so easy that there
is no excuse
to you not to do it not to run the test
so when you go back to your organization
talk with the friendly security experts
there there are people to give them a
big kiss and try to talk with them and
figure out how you can help them scale
the testing that they do because most of
the time there are a lot of lessons that
they can learn from the testing
community on how to scale the approach
just like we did that was all for my
talk a big thank you to the organization
and everyone who has stayed so late an
amazing team that made is all possible I
forgot the name of the UX Esper so I'm
gonna call him out explicitly thanks
mats I
you did an amazing job at that thank you
yeah Thank You Claudia that was
fantastic I mean I like every talk that
we've had so far I learned two really
important things one
I'm never gonna buy a coffeepot from
Claudio and two if I don't fix my
security bugs he's gonna kiss me so I'm
definitely good so with that I can see
some questions are getting formed here
so why don't we go ahead and take a
question right here yeah hi I'm an
segment EF ski from cognate Poland I
wanted to ask because there are many you
know security scanners available on the
market but they are set to detect only
the basic box and it is said that human
inspection is always recommended so I
wanted to ask if all the box you find
with your tool or if some bugs are being
fined by a by a human by manual
inspection is the your tool like 100%
replacement for a human inspection as
much as I'd like to say yes the answer
of course is no the end the end goal of
our team is to replace the entire
security team Google with tiny PHP
scripts but I can say that too loud so
as a matter of fact there are always
corner cases and complex and difficult
to find box so yes human interaction is
the security experts are not going to
lose their job because of the tool but
think if we can find the majority of
simple low-hanging fruits we can raise
the bar that's the key insecurities
raise the bar for the attacker to find
bugs exploit yeah thanks for that
question looks like we have another one
over here but alright please you deal
with authentication like in your
endpoint I just say go to gmail.com how
do you deal with logging in and stuff
like that well we build this with from
day one with Google in mind so all of
the Google authentication mechanism are
built in in in the application we can
support more one of the many things that
we add I didn't really get to talk about
is we have a chrome plug-in that you can
install in chrome and then we'll send
the authentication details of course
about testing account to the application
so that we can test but in general yes
that's that's a very very difficult
problem that we think we solve the bit
better than the others because we we
knew exactly what we wanted to fix that
apps great thank you
name where you work and your question
please Iran from the obamas
infrastructure team in Google so how
about using an existing like web other
tests that a lot of teams in Google have
sort of to source the initial URLs or
maybe to do something smarter that's a
great question so yes that's the answer
and we we want to do that in general we
add a history of trying to source the
URLs from end to end tests this is what
what usually provides a lot of URLs we
found it a bit difficult because of the
structure of URLs in testing
environments often they lack things like
access ref protection and so on so there
bit hard to use but yes this is
definitely a good thing and we trying to
do that we're not quite there yet but
yes we like to do that and people should
do that I think using end-to-end tests
for security is a fantastic idea Julie
I'll take one question from the
moderator here it says is the excess
tool going to be released as open source
and can you exclude URLs as part of
setting up the tool ie URLs that point
to places you don't want them to point
so I start by the second one and of
course excluding URLs is easy we can do
that and
thing most of the tools out there can do
that so yes it's a bit more challenging
to know when you were adding side
effects so when you were hitting your l1
and that caused something else weapon on
your lb that's kind of difficult to
figure out so we didn't we didn't do
that just yet about the open sourcing I
think a lot of the code there can be and
probably will be open source it I'm not
entirely sure about the entirety of the
project because our of course many
things that are very cool specific I
think the core ideas we will try really
hard to get them out there together with
the code to support them as we did with
other testing tools great with that
Claudio thank you very much I was
wondering actually if this is was his
wife or not it actually her so it's my
job to say thank you to everybody and to
sort of recap what we've you know all
seen and heard hopefully we accomplished
what we wanted we got everybody in the
community talking to everybody else I
hope you took at least a dozen things
away from the you know your
conversations your connections people
that you've met I know I certainly have
the talks today we're just I I was I
thought they were fantastic all the way
right up to you know Claudio is here at
the end it was it was great you know
having you know Jonathan talking about
appium and how he's trying to solve like
this multi-platform problem and how it's
getting pushed open source seeing you
know a vet and Brendon talking about you
know data and how it impacts you know
media and like how they're trying to you
know present these well rendered maps
yeah there are just so many great talks
I'm you know I would love to go through
all of them but they were just fantastic
with that I would actually just say
thank you to some people
there's often many unsung heroes to pull
together you know a events like this so
I wanted to give a shout out to the guys
in who have been running all of the live
streams and all the capture everything
they're over here in the far left corner
for me so thank you
I would like to say thank you to the to
our transcribers who I have noticed even
if we use bad English they actually fix
it for us so thank you we have had our
our signers here the whole time you know
helping to you know bring everybody in
into the conference so thank you for all
of your great sign language our catering
department I don't know lunch and
everything seems that showed up and a
great it was fantastic so thank you to
them and the last thank you I'd like to
give is to all the organizers and you
know name attribution is very tricky so
I just tried to capture a lot of
pictures and so all the pictures and
everything that you see are the the
people who have contributed everything
from you know speaker selection the
sending notices to you know helping make
sure that you know we got here and got
what we needed so to all of the
contributors to my fellow Googlers and
beyond thank you very much
and with that one thing I was gonna try
is I was gonna ask all of the speakers
that spoke to come up on stage and we're
gonna try to get a big group photo
you're welcome to stay for that if you
want to that's great
otherwise you can meet us in the lobby
if you like to grab a drink with all of
us we're gonna do the same thing as
yesterday go up to water tower and have
a drink and celebrate hopefully what was
what you have all at least hold this is
a fantastic GTECH so thank you for all
of your participation and with that I'll
have the speaker's come up and if you
want to stay great otherwise I head
upstairs thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
