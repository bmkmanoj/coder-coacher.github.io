mcnemar to Google so Bruce is this
president and CEO of technoserve one of
our most important and earliest partners
Bruce has an amazing background a jd/mba
from Stanford a former Peace Corps
volunteer in Paraguay he has worked in
investment banking he's been a
consultant he's worked at three high
tech startups all of which i think has
prepared him well to take a business
approach to poverty alleviation
technoServe is the recipient of the one
of the first google.org and google
foundation grants of half a million
dollars technoserve takes an approach we
love at Google towards poverty which is
working with entrepreneurs in countries
to develop jobs develop opportunities
and develop income for themselves we are
working with Bruce on an
entrepreneurship development program in
Ghana and the centerpiece of which are
part of which will be a business plan
competition as well as providing seed
funding for the entrepreneurs so with no
further ado welcome to Bruce thanks
Cheryl and thanks all of you for coming
out I think maybe it's appropriate at a
tech talk that we start with some very
low tech and we're going to try to show
a very quick video that I hope just
gives you some sort of Flash images of
kind of what technoserve does and I
wanted you to see that and my marketing
department insisted that you see it so
this takes all of about three minutes if
we can
drinking the distance but not the
distinction where the line between the
haves and the have-nots as we know our
world is a global village linked by
global trade communications technology
and environmental concerns drinking the
distance but not the distinction where
the line between the haves and the
have-nots has grown wider and more
intolerable we know that closing this
device requires one way of thinking and
practical solutions for real change to
evolve we must go beyond revolving
cycles of a 3d we know the world too
consistent economic growth is driven by
investment in job and wealth creation
and we know how we know how to create
may know how to creep circumstances to
help people to help themselves we know
how to help empower men and women in
poor rural areas of Latin America and
Africa to build businesses that create
income jobs and economic growth for
their families their communities and
their countries what we do is identify
entrepreneurs guide them and planning
marketing operating and expanding their
businesses with appropriate techniques
what what we do is empower small and
medium-sized businesses to help them
develop business plans secure financing
and find markets to distribute their
goods what we do is change the economic
landscape and plant seeds of opportunity
impacting whole communities entire
regions and countries what we want now
we want to note is to multiply the
results press our success and expand the
reach of our economic empowerment model
what we want now I want is to spread the
word on how a market-based approach
using sustainable business practices to
address poverty can work what we want
what I want now is to add to our ranks
of investors with government NGO and
corporate strategic partners what we
want now is yours yours your support for
every one dollar spent technoserve is
realizing a three dollar return on
investment turning global poverty around
from cycles of despair into
ever-widening circles of success from
the ground up empowering entrepreneurs
one business at a time technoserve
business solutions to rural poverty
and we've actually got another couple of
video clips and I love your feedback at
the end of this you think these actually
tell our story as Cheryl said our
approach is one that's very consistent I
think with what motivates people at
Google and has motivated this
organization from the start and that is
that entrepreneurship provides powerful
incentives for organizing for organizing
effort for in our case and in poor parts
of the world for motivating people to
help themselves are we start with the
premise and you've heard it all before
that it's it's one thing to give a man
to fish but teach a man to fish and you
affect his his life permanently our
mission is as Cheryl had alluded to is
to help entrepreneurial men and women to
do just that and the way that we do that
is I think captured pretty succinctly in
the tagline that you heard we're about
business solutions to rural poverty and
that's what we do and we've actually
been doing that for a very very long
time we've been we were started about
almost 40 years ago by an entrepreneur
ed Bullard had started and run a
manufacturing business in Connecticut
spent about a year with his family in
Ghana as part of a religious mission and
came back thought thinking I know some
things about business I've now had an
exposure to poverty I think the things
that I know about business could be
helpful in alleviating some of the
problems that I've seen in Ghana he left
the manufacturing business and started
technoServe and our approach since then
has taken our lead from EDD it's markets
can work for the poor it's starting a
community let's identify market
opportunities for addressing the
problems the communities face and then
let's work together to build businesses
to address those problems technoserve
ourselves we work in Latin Latin America
and Africa and have for most of that
time right now we have offices in about
11 countries six in Africa and five in
Latin America and we do work in other
countries as well we have about 350
people working for us worldwide and only
25 of those in the state's most as you
would expect are out in the field doing
work for us there now I've said that
technoserve is about business solutions
to rural poverty I think the thing
add to that it's business people
thinking about business solutions to
world poverty so I think that may be
different from a lot of people who work
on these issues in the nonprofit world
my background there Cheryl said is in
business I have a private sector
background until a year ago but my
background is not unusual for
technoServe most of my senior manager
well actually six of our country
director has come out of McKinsey as do
our two regional directors I spent some
time in McKinsey as well so as a little
McKinsey mafia even within technoServe
as a matter of fact I think we're the
largest nonprofit employer of former
consultants anywhere in the world but
the remaining country director is even
in each run a program come from a
business background and again most of
the people work for us in the field
Tanzanians Ghanaians el salvador anos
they come from business backgrounds they
may have MBAs the local management
schools they may have worked for a
consulting firm in the country and I
think that legitimizes us in the eyes of
the entrepreneurs with whom we work and
I think it's something that you all can
relate to and I think part of what i
want to share with you in this
discussion is the idea that the set of
skills that we collectively have as we
think about entrepreneurship as i think
about busy building businesses are very
relevant as to some of the most pressing
problems in the world and there are ways
that each of us can contribute to
solving those problems applying what we
know I want to talk about our own
approach to the problems you know how do
we do what we do and it starts with I
should give you a little more history on
this as I said at the start we used to
start in communities very poor rural
communities and start there and say okay
we're located in a community inside
Ghana or Tanzania starting here what are
the prior the possible markets for what
this community can grow produce etc and
that worked pretty well for us I think
though at about 25 years we realized
that perhaps that's not the most
scalable way to approach the problems of
poverty to get at it at the size and
scale that we wanted to do it so for the
last 10 years we've shifted that around
a little bit so instead of exclusively
starting in the community base we've
said let's
start at a country level let's think
really smart about what are the
opportunities for this country if you
think about real sources of sustainable
market advantage is a competitive
advantage or comparative advantage start
from there pick some sectors or
industries where you think actually you
could build businesses here and then you
could leave and those business would
survive and thrive because the people
here are particularly adept at that
because they have some advantage that
will enable them to thrive in the market
and that has been a shift in our own
thinking such that today we'll go into a
country and we'll do just this and
because we're focused on rural poverty a
lot of times we're thinking about
agricultural products so we'll look
broadly and let me give you an example
of going into Mozambique and saying wait
a minute there's lots of opportunities
here but some very particularly
attractive ones in tourism in
agroforestry in cashews and then
focusing our efforts there because
resources are scarce and you got to make
bets and you got to hope that the
investment you make pays off so starting
from that of outside in approach and
this is this is a business approach
where are you going to put your beds
where you going to make you I'd make
your investments then we work back to
the entrepreneur or to the community now
as you think about businesses or value
chains for any particular business that
you would do that here that's what we do
in the countries in which we work so
think about something that you might you
might eat today and think working back
from there there's a whole lot of steps
that have to happen and that value chain
to get from the farm to the table that's
the first the first analysis we do we
say okay there's lots of steps along
here where there are opportunities for
us working with entrepreneurs to get
involved and to exploit opportunities
and marketing efficiencies to build
businesses around them and by the way
are the ways that we can do that so some
of the value comes back closer to poor
farmers as if you think about it you
know any product that you buy for ten
dollars here there's probably something
like five to ten cents that's going to a
small holder farmers in the country in
which it was produced are there ways to
make that
piece of the pie bigger the closer you
get back to the farm gate and that's
part of our mission as well we identify
the business model and you'll see this
and I are we've laid out our approach
we've done it here starting back here
and saying okay what's the business and
then saying what is the particular
opportunity in that business and then we
say alright where is the entrepreneur in
all this and who is that person with
whom we're going to work to build a
business and to exploit the opportunity
we're trying to exploit so once again
it's and part of what we're doing with
google is how is a process of helping to
identify entrepreneurs and I want to
talk more about that in a minute but
then it's working closely with that
entrepreneur it's thinking about
business models it's thinking about a
business plan it's thinking about what
are the technical things we need to know
to make this business succeed and it's
actually building a business and I'm
going to talk in a second about I'll
give you a very concrete example of how
we do that get that business to some
scale and then try to replicate that
experience so that you're not only
affecting poverty of the level of one
business but you're doing it at an
industry level and that's ultimately our
goal because that's ultimately how you
get you address this problem of how do
we scale is how do we take this from
operating at the level of business so
something that has impact for a lot more
people because ultimately it's those
people it's that employment it's that
job is that income creation it's the
wealth creation at the local level
that's going to make the difference it
can make a sustainable difference for
the communities in which we work I said
we're business people thinking about
business solutions to rural poverty I
think just by virtue of where we come
from and the kind of work that we do
we're able to partner with a large
number of major corporate partners in
ways that make sense for them and I part
of that comes down to speaking the
language of business but part of it too
comes down to being able to identify
opportunities for corporations real
market opportunities for corporations to
work in say Tanzania or honduras in ways
that they'd never done before to get
involved in a way that actually affects
their bottom line and part of what we do
is try to work with both entrepreneurs
and corporations till
length or two to say all right there's a
value chain here if you're peet's coffee
can you plug into a value chain that
we've built with Tanzanian coffee
farmers for sources of your coffee and
if we can put that partnership together
Pete's wins smallholder farmers in
Tanzania win and that's a sustainable
model that's going to be around five
years from now 10 years from now long
after technoserve has left we also
partner with organizations like
Mackenzie for obvious reasons and we do
that in both formal ways and informal
ways I guess the informal aight
characterize we have a lot of X McKinsey
people river well we've done global
studies for example on coffee
competitiveness and where should where
should where is the global coffee market
going and then therefore where should
technoserve be making hits beds in in
terms of developing called the coffee
industry Google I sure want to talk a
lot more about that partnership and I
will do that at the in the second half
of the presentation I should say to that
this business ethic and our Board of
Directors similarly they they like you
or successful entrepreneurs or involved
with successful entrepreneurial
endeavors or their investors or their
business people who had that mentality
so I want to i want to emphasize
throughout that business can be a
solution to rural poverty business
people in these countries are going to
be the catalyzers for that but there are
business there are opportunities for
business people in in the United States
and in the developed world to to make a
difference and they can do that either
by working to strike up partnerships
that affect their businesses as they do
Enterprise in those countries or to work
more closely with businesses and you
know we provide opportunities to do that
and I want to tell you a little bit
about the end of this presentation about
opportunities for Googlers actually do
some of just that now I want to talk a
little bit about make this more concrete
for you about our experience in
Mozambique with cashews because I can
theorize about all this but it's only
when you actually bring it down to
actual examples that is real at all and
as I said a few years ago we went into
Mozambique and we said all right
mozambique and I don't know how many of
you know Mozambique's history but
until probably the early 70s Mozambique
was a real African success story
particularly economically it was a
powerhouse and then for the succeeding
15 years it was wracked by civil war and
a failed experiment with Marxism such
that several million people died in
industry was decimated and it's been a
very slow road back for that country we
came to Mozambique six years ago and did
this sort of industries game so what
makes sense here for Mozambique again
thinking as you would think about what a
real sources of opportunity here and one
of those sectors was cashew until
nineteen seventy Mozambique was the
world's largest exporter of cashews and
I bet there are people sitting in this
room who may know who what country now
is the leading exporter of cashews it is
India by a long shot of both raw cashews
and processed cashews but mozambique by
virtue of climate by virtue of culture
by virtue of a history of an and by
virtue of labor costs we thought had
real opportunities in the cashew
business we also thought not just raw
cashews but why not do some processing
in country and again why that because
that's a chance to bring value back to
Mozambique a lot of the value and this
gets captured in the people who process
it that people who package it the people
who market it the people who distributed
can some of that come back closer to
farmers we actually identified a
manufacturing process in India that had
been used in India for about 15 years
pretty labor-intensive but nevertheless
a real processing critical processing
step there's a technology that we
brought back into Mozambique and then we
identified Antonio Miranda who has our
touchstone entrepreneur in that case and
I would say that the entrepreneurs we
work with are not necessarily the very
poorest of the poor it's difficult to
start a business it's difficult to start
one here having been involved in
startups most of them less successful
than Google and it's Tripoli it's ten
times difficult in the developing world
where things that we just take for
granted infrastructure communications
networks access to capital just does not
exist it's in that context it takes
people with some real entrepreneurial
vision and it helps to have an education
it helps to have some access to whatever
networks they are so we're not talking
about the poorest of the poor our target
ultimately is the poorest of the poor
those are the people who have jobs those
are the people are working who are
providing inputs into these businesses
Antonio himself had a college education
he fled the country in the Civil War he
came back intent on starting a business
and his family had been involved in
caches before we worked with Antonio for
about two years very intensively and
it's like management consulting we
helped him get the business concept we
helped him write the business plan we
worked with him on getting access to
capital for his initial investment we
had a guy sleeping in a tent with him up
in the northern part of the country for
three months as they built this factory
and in night in 2002 and and trying to
opened his first factory it employs
about 300 people this is in an area of
Mozambique where there's no formal
employment it is destitute extremely
poor and I've had opportunities to visit
it and you fly in there today on a you
know it's a pretty bumpy trip in but you
see what some economic activity
cash-based activity in an area can do
you see it's not just at the plant but
you see it in little businesses that are
now growing up around the plant to
support it to provide inputs to provide
retail now to people who have cash for
the first time and so you see this
follow-on effect that comes out of it
not to mention the fact you know have
300 people working there his first year
in business he had something like eight
hundred thousand dollars in revenues
again employed these people and was
profitable his second year he opened a
second plant and since then we've opened
11 more of these plants in Mozambique at
this point they're having they have had
the effect of revitalizing an industry
and that's the kind of impact that we
want to have but again it's working
through every one of these steps so
working with Antonio helping to actually
improve some of the enabling some of the
regulatory constraints that are facing a
lot of these countries many times it's
its legal constraints it's tax tax
restraints that make it very difficult
to do a business and we try to help at
that inner side
to free to to work through those
constraints as they affect that business
and again up here I want to talk a
little bit about this Sam beak brand
these 11 cashew entrepreneurs got we
help them organize last year into a
trade association and they together and
say she actually a privately held
company with shareholders and they
collect their product for export and
they ensure that the quality is right
that the phytosanitary conditions are
met for export and as a bulk exporter
now they have marketing power and
bargaining power as they deal with
importers in Europe and the United
States we worked with young &amp;amp; rubicam to
come in and help them brand this that's
the Zambia and it's now available the
United States and I think I may not be
available in your stores but if you go
to Arizona I know they're eating a lot
of it down there and ultimately that's
the group that's going to take over
where we leave off our job ultimately is
a work ourselves out of a job right and
they now are taking advantage over
things like training about capturing of
best practices and about promulgating
continued success of what they've been
able to achieve so far in three years
now we're not going to be working in
cashews and Mozambique now that said
we're now beginning to roll that out in
other parts of Africa and again here's
some of the impact last year some of the
of what I've described last year these
fourteen plans Dantonio has to and so
does another produce a lot of cashews
purchased cashews for the first time in
a really regular way from 40,000 farmers
who received premiums for their product
that they just hadn't had before and
that premium translates into real
tangible life-altering benefits for
people I mean the difference between you
know fifty cents a day a dollar a day a
dollar fifty a day for from is
tremendous and created employment at the
same time that's our baseline of
business it's thinking smart thinking
like businesspeople about interventions
about working with
people about catalyzing their efforts
and then ultimately it's about leaving
but leaving behind what we hope are
working businesses and industries and
again it's it's an approach i think that
people in the private sector can
appreciate much more readily than people
who are traditionally the providers of
what we all international development i
wanna i thought it would be interesting
larry page actually came when we looked
at some of our work in kenya around some
dairy producers there in May of last
year I want to show you a quick video
that highlights basically what he saw
and I'd like for you to sort of get a
glimpse to the work we're doing in 2002
the dairy farmers in yala asked
technosoft to come in and assist them to
set up a milk bulking and cooling center
that would make dairy farming a viable
option as a business and as a way of
life on the first day of in tech we got
in excess of a thousand litres of milk
supplied by more than 500 farmers yala
has continued to grow today iniella is a
10,000 litre cooling center they
turnover in excess of eight hundred
thousand dollars every year in cells and
the cooling plant itself supports 3,500
farmers and indirectly impacts more than
20,000 families in the town and there
are Gua where the cooling plant is based
this town was completely almost dead
they are really work any life at all no
business but now they're people are very
busy here some art we'll matura met or
even photocopies are here now now Yara
is a blessing the people who have
invested in our savings and credit
account hourly ripping fruits the
Pharmakon by one of the best of the
cowls and a build a good house the
Pharmakon pay school fees for their
children we shall have now made it very
able for the students of this area all
to acquire education I'm sure after
about one or two years we shall be able
to start on our through that advice that
we have got from technosoft in the past
people have blamed everything on poverty
but now nara is showing people that we
can write poverty from their own Gardens
that's good news to me and once we bring
a farmer who has been selling two liters
to say Oakland then prove it will be a
thing of the past thank you very much
that's at one level let me show you
another short clip from some of the work
that we're doing is this is the story to
entrepreneurs victor in research

so those are little slices of techno
sort of life and a couple points about
that one is I said we work along the
value chain well you saw in one instance
in derry how we were working at the at
the production level we were buying from
farmer groups farmer groups that we'd
organized but the real work was not at
the level of the plant in horticulture
in Latin America in that latin american
example of what you were seeing was
first working at the farm level to get
that right and you saw those that sort
of mini greenhouses that actually was a
pretty big breakthrough for farmers in
area but then further up the value chain
we were working to establish linkages
with in-country supermarkets it's not
always about exporting to the United
States many of the real vibrant markets
for what we do are actually in country
is just getting the supply chain right
along then again it's applying business
principles I want to talk a little bit
about another set of activities we do
which is very relevant to to you here at
Google and that is around trying to
build entrepreneurial capacity in a lot
of the countries that we work in and
Cheryl had mentioned the outset that
Google is working with technoServe in
Ghana on an entrepreneurial development
program which is anchored around a
business plan competition and it's a
national business plan competition and
this is we've sort of highlighted here
some of the things that we think about
when we think about business plan
competition is generally but it's
there's two things going on here one is
about a process by which you can
actually help jumpstart and start actual
working businesses and there's something
else is happening to by virtue of that
process by virtue of the examples you
start to get a bead on building an
entrepreneurial culture because in many
of the countries we work that just is
not there now i will say that that's in
contrast to some of the other countries
where we might work in the future but
part of our mandate in these countries
we feel is to help to establish that and
the business plan competitions are a
great way to do that now as we think
about the plans that we run and as we
work through some of the planning with
rachel and others on on their program in
ghana one of the important things to us
in the spirit of leaving program
was behind we can't work there we ought
to work ourselves out a job is to help
build local capacity and interest in the
local business community in making these
programs work and making them succeed
because one they have meant there are
many benefits to the country in that but
to we hope that they're actually
business benefits for the business
community in seeing a development of a
thriving small business sector and again
that is part of our objective and as
part of the approach that we use as we
go along now this business plan model
that we use actually came out of
Mackenzie Mackenzie designed a a
business plan competition in Germany in
the mid-90s an attempt to stimulate more
entrepreneurial thinking particularly in
East Germany they took that actual model
down to South Africa a lot of people who
work at technoServe came out of McKinsey
South Africa and we've adopted that to
use in the developing world now the way
it works and the way and I'll describe a
little more about how it's going to work
in in Ghana is relatively
straightforward we market these broadly
and you know in the in the Ghana case
it'll be market it nationally and you
know guess what even if people don't
participate there's finally some
attention paid to the role of business
and the possibilities of business and
this in environments where that just is
not highlighted so marketed broadly and
from that you're used to solicit
business concepts and through a sort of
a gradual winnowing process you Whittle
that down to a workable number of
business concepts from there it's a
process of training and I actually want
to spend more time on this we talk about
Google specifically training one-on-one
training classroom training mentorship
opportunities for people in the business
community as you again refine the
business plans and work that number of
competitors down to what we what in the
end is a set of winning business plans
but again it's training it's mentoring
and coach coaching it's designating the
winners and then really importantly and
I think we've only learned this over
time it's not enough just to say you
want great there's prize money at the
end that will help seed your business
but it's not enough just to say then go
out into the world after care what we
call after
there is is it's apparent is often the
difference between a successful business
that comes out of this and one that
doesn't and aftercare is often around
things like continued access to capital
it's some of the things that as you know
business incubators incubators services
shared services for that some of these
small businesses its business to what we
call business development services can
we get the local accountants consultants
banking sector involved with active with
these businesses in ways that actually
help them but also help the businesses
and it's networking opportunities for
the alums now I said we'd started this a
number of years ago first in Latin
America so we've rolled this out
gradually over time trying to perfect a
model and I will tell you that even in
technoServe we start with some
skepticism I mean does this really work
in the sense that long term it creates
businesses and I'll talk about that but
over time we've learned that it has I'll
share some numbers with you so we ran a
program in El Salvador several years ago
a second one Nicaragua two years ago a
second one in Nicaragua we're running a
third run in Nicaragua this year and
again we're expanding these in Latin
America and this year for the first time
we're taking the model to Africa so you
see listed here in 2006 a number of the
national business plan competitions will
be doing in Africa we're also
considering plans implementing what
towards the end of year in Nigeria and
again that will be with Google's support
we're looking at Mozambique as well now
as I say there was some skepticism even
within technoServe about does this model
really work in a developing country
context and what we found based on as
you saw this sort of trajectory is in in
Central America think about a program
that has ultimately it works with
intensively with 60 businesses 50 60
businesses those are the ones that get
the intensive hands-on training we went
back and looked at some of the results
of these a couple years out and saw that
in terms of just people trained about
317 entrepreneurs or part and small
partnerships out of that we had 72 new
businesses and 91 expand
businesses based on their experiences
business plan competitions that's over
150 businesses out of about 300 that's a
fifty percent success rate that's damn
good in any country that's that's better
than you'll do here and some of that
I'll tell you is a function of what the
training you get some of it is a
function of a very real phenomenon in
these countries and it's very hard to
start a business but if you can get it
right there are market inefficiencies
and market opportunities there that can
really be exploited in ways to make
business is successful so coming out of
that process we created almost a
thousand jobs and we're pretty precise
about how we measure our own impact so
we invested something like 1.4 million
dollars in these three business plan
competition we had revenues incremental
revenues because that's the only thing
we feel like we can measure it's what
are the additional revenues that came
out of this of about eight million
dollars in the first couple of years so
that's a heck of a return on your
initial investment and these businesses
I mean that's just going to keep on
giving long after our involvement so to
date these kinds of results show us this
is a pretty powerful way actually
creating businesses that work and you
can see here I mean there's their
quantitative measures of this but
oftentimes the most fulfilling thing is
for us to talk to people have actually
started businesses themselves and you
can see some quotes hear from you know a
variety of the entrepreneurs with whom
we worked
I understand this is out in a context
where there just is not support for
these kinds of activities is new often
times and it's certainly pretty new
phenomena in Ghana so we're also you
know branding his program per Gessle you
think that's important so you dare to
impress is the brand that we're using in
Latin America GT hada is the brand name
that we're taking to market in Kenya and
that means effort and Swahili and the
brand down here at the bottom believe
begin become is the brand that we've
collectively worked to in Ghana around
the competition that we're starting now
and again with support from you guys all
of them are intended to convey effort
self-motivation and belief and even the
I know I'm not a brand guy myself but
the latter this is a ladder it's meant
to be it's the entrepreneurial ladder
and you'll see it gets progressively
smaller the further up you go one is
hard to get further in starting a
business but to their progressively less
involvement by other people it's more
and more on your own the further you get
up the ladder and that's how it should
be so let's talk about the the specific
stuff we're doing with google in Ghana I
don't know if in many you know much
about Ghana about 21 million people
living there forty five percent of them
are desperately poor that is their
living on less than a dollar a day the
actual income per capita in the country
is three hundred eighty dollars they've
had their own government problems over
the last as many African countries over
the last thirty years but they seem to
have in place a nascent but thriving
real constitutional democracy about
sixty percent of the labor force is
involved in agriculture and of course
that's oftentimes the sector in in which
we work so believe begin become that's
that's that's the brand and that's the
the program with which Google and
technoServe are now involved in design
let me lay out for you the process and
it does track
what I described up front of a general
process for these at this point we're
planning on kicking this off in March
and again that's this broad marketing on
a nationwide basis to would-be
entrepreneurs now we'll tell you when we
announced this in I guess it was
november that itself got a whole lot of
attention in ghana you may not think
google means much in pretty remote parts
of the world but it sure has traction in
ghana and you're talking about an
international brand and we had calls
from universities we had calls from
entrepreneurs we had calls from
government officials all of them were
excited about and somehow i wanted to be
involved in this phenomena in part
because it's a model that works in part
because we've been in ghana for almost
30 years and in part because google was
involved with this so understand the
power that the google brand has to
actually mobilize people to do good in
developing parts of the world so again
we're kicking off in March and again it
follows the pattern that I laid out but
more precisely will we expect to get
over five hundred five hundred to a
thousand submissions who knows
ultimately how many of that will be and
winnow those down over time so the first
tranche of 250 to 300 who will will
bring in for a one-day business planning
workshop and out of that ought to come
more tightly more coherent business
concepts there will be a further
winnowing process and again we'll get
down to a workable number of about 60
and in June kick off a pretty intensive
business training process with them that
goes on for some of these competitors
over the next several months and again
that's one on one training it's
classroom training it's mentorship
opportunities particularly with business
people from the local community although
there may be similar opportunities for
people in this room and I want to talk
about that and in July we expect to get
to get down to a group of 20 finalists
and then we will select winners
september-october kind of time frame and
those winners will receive cash for
their businesses but also importantly
I've talked about this after care
component they'll also receive through a
voucher program that vouchers that
they can use to engage again local
providers of business services whether
it's a consult consulting firm an
auditing firm if they need legal help
they can use those vouchers to engage
that and again that helps their business
and it really helps there's an ecosystem
that has to happen around this and it's
not just a business itself right those
services are important if you're trying
to build an overall entrepreneurial
context which these businesses can
thrive so I talked about opportunities
for Googlers and we have been working
pretty closely with the folks here at
google.org to identify what some of
those might be and there may be people
in this room who should take note and
who may be in Ghana in mid 2006 and
we've sort of laid out a matrix here of
different ways that we can engage with
Googlers you know most immediately would
be to actually be working with
entrepreneurs in Ghana and there may be
some opportunities to do that similarly
working virtually with individual
entrepreneurs from Hyderabad or from
Mountain View or whoever it might be or
program support for the overall program
efforts both in Ghana in country and
again remotely these are some examples
of the kind of work that we've outlined
that might be possible for Googlers and
I think there are in this organization
probably thousands of people who
unbeknownst to them it could actually be
very helpful what as I trying to say all
along what you know is useful the kind
of things that you do every day are
really really useful your knowledge base
is useful in fighting poverty and this
is a very very immediate way in which
you can do that and really get involved
whether it's actually evaluating
business plans and this is opportunities
in Ghana there are guest lecture
opportunities again I describe classroom
opportunities that we make available to
the entrepreneurs in the competition
it's working again this one on one
engagement take on maybe 35 clinical
clients in the process
we will have an award ceremony and at
which we hope to have seen your google
representation in Ghana where we award
the ten winners of the competition and
then there will be documented program
support just generally as we really get
through the heart of the competition
itself with the with again with the with
the one on one engagement with the 60
entrepreneurs and that's over a three
month three month period and again some
of these opportunities you can actually
do remotely as well although some
obviously lend themselves is much more
closely to work on the ground and you'll
see some of those are exactly the same
so again these dates are approximate and
the commitments are approximate but
there will be opportunities and there
will be ways for you to work with the
team here to express your interest in
those in the days and weeks be weeks
ahead now I don't know if any of you
were taking notes and this will all be
available i'm told on the google website
but here are here's the information you
need actually to get involved and so
with that I should shut up because i
feel like i've been talking talking
talking talking talking and just to see
if there are any questions either about
technoserve or about international
development more broadly or about the
competition itself
so modest so what song are we doing
anything
in plus 100 on Somalia
the question is are is technoServe or to
conserving Google doing work in Botswana
in particular countries Botswana Somalia
did you say Mozambique we talked to I
wasn't be we are not yeah but there's
probably two reasons one is a lot of the
work that we do ultimately depends on
funding so we get private sector donors
corporations and we use that to leverage
government funding and we have worked in
Botswana in the past and likely will in
the future and I'd love for us to see if
we could do something together either on
this model or another model with Google
in Botswana Somalia again technol surf
has been there historically it's a hard
place to work right now just because of
the instability and security concerns
and again there's not a lot of you know
firstly donor support for going in there
but we're keenly interested in what
evolves there it's just as we are in
southern Sudan where you know these are
post-conflict in some cases states where
they're actually our opportunities to
get in and to begin to lay the
groundwork for real economic growth we
had a team on the ground in Liberia in
December assessing opportunities there
and there's real hope for Liberia now
for the first time in a very long time
just had democratic elections and those
seem to be free and fair and this is a
country sick of civil war and really I
mean the infrastructure has been
destroyed once thriving industries have
been destroyed we think their
opportunities go back there and build us
up again and we you know we'd love we
will do it and I think there may be
opportunities for us to do that with
with Google and as i mentioned we're now
contemplating seriously doing something
in Nigeria which is a different profile
of a country with Google
find me
Oh
question is what kind of financial
relationships this technoServe have both
with partners funders potential
investors I would say and with the
businesses that we work with and let me
take those one at a time with the
businesses that we work with we do
collect some nominal fee but I will tell
you it's a nominal fee and as to ensure
that seriousness of the endeavor but we
are making we are a what I would call a
smart subsidy to catalyzing that
business of that industry and we say
that is just the way it is we need to
get these businesses going we need to
kick start them we need to catalyze that
growth so it is ultimately donor funding
that's funding most of what we do and
that's our relationship with what I'd
call pure donors it's we conceive of a
program we may shape it with the donors
and with their funding we go in and
provide the programmatic support then
there's a class of relationship with
corporations which in some instances
it's we're working with them to identify
market opportunities there may be
actually fees in it for us if we can do
that but there are actual business
opportunities for them so we play a
catalyzing world that kind of
relationship may be funded by a donor
but it happens to read down to the
benefit of the corporation and then
there's a an emerging relationship with
investors themselves increasingly there
I mean access to capital is a
requirement to run and grow successful
business anywhere in the world it is of
it is so much more difficult in these
developing countries but there are an
increasing number of interested
financial intermediaries who think that
there may be opportunities in Africa in
Latin America in developing countries so
you see it in from a couple ways you see
putting together equity funds or debt
funds to invest in these countries and
you see when we hope altima tlie this
really see the commercial banking sector
thinking differently about how to fund
these small and medium-sized businesses
our role in that is is twofold we don't
run a fund hello we have been encouraged
to write a fund in part because we're so
close to these businesses
but the role we can play in that is to
actually bring businesses to these funds
often is the experience that there's
actual money but they can't find good
businesses on the ground we're on the
ground we're working with good
businesses in things like that Google
business plan competition we're very
close to that so we can identify and
then there's a role for technical
assistance post investment so after the
investment technoserve would come in and
actually help the investee s as they
take their businesses to scale thank you
