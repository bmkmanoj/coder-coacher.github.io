thing about that Santa is about how the
service is synchronized in the for any
normal web service you have many
different people doing a vast number of
different things that aren't
synchronized at all and so they tend to
average out with Santa Tracker it's
unusual in that you have you know
millions and millions of users doing
exactly the same thing so as one user
spikes or put it puts in an expensive
request you've got several million
others doing doing the same thing at
exactly the same time so for those who
don't know it this is what it basically
looks like it allows children to follow
Santa as he flies around the world
either if you're young or just young at
heart and we have two versions to it one
uses the Google Earth plug-in as you see
just there with animated Santa flying
around and then second version using
Google Maps for those platforms or
devices that don't support the plug-in
and as you can see his Santa's got his
work cut out for him to sell as well
delivers about two billion presence over
the course of 24 hours and about 800
million cookies Wow that's what he's
eating so that was a 1.6 million QPS the
main takeaways from the talk actually
that I thought would be useful to
summarize was the first synchronized
activity you can expect to have some
spiky behavior and so it's really
understanding that and spreading the
load that is the essential thing that
we've done over several years to make it
more reliable and easier to manage and
so originally we had problems where the
the spikes were much larger than we
anticipated and they weren't spread
enough the other thing of course cash
everything
the third thing unfortunately we've got
this is kind of an escape valve it's
very hard to estimate QPS for an event
that happens once per year
so you need to make sure that you have
some escape mechanism so if traffic is
higher than expected that you can deal
with it via other means and then the
last one is to check data because any
mistake that you make is magnified by
the large audience that you have so the
for the earth client what happens is
that it jitters where the user is
looking plus or minus two minutes so
that basically when you load the when
you'e load the earth plug-in version
multiple times Santa will be slightly
ahead or behind of the map's version but
this means that the that any spike is
spread over a much larger period where
this most commonly occurs is when you
transition from ocean to land when
you're going over ocean the QPS is
relatively small when you transition to
land it becomes much higher so you need
to make sure that that happens gradually
rather than all in one go and the the
other thing is that you've got to find
every single case where some spiky
behavior occurs okay we've missed issues
in the past and it's always come back to
bite us caching everything the original
design for this when I first joined four
years ago had achieved dynamic
server-side code in it and so depending
on the time it would serve a slightly
different file and that meant that it
was quite difficult to develop deploy
and test this because you have to make a
like code change for any code change and
push a binary to do that and also it
meant that if you had any issues it was
difficult to adapt it in real time so
over the last several years basically it
got to the point
okay all right okay so so steadily over
the years we've replaced all of that
dynamic server-side behavior so that now
the service runs completely on static
files there is no code run server-side
at all and essentially basically you're
pushing the complexity into the browser
using javascript in the plugin which
allows you to have a very rich
experience but to be a fairly a much
simpler architecture to allow this
higher QPS and it's much easier to test
and deploy this and it's also much
easier to cache it as well because you
can use edge caching from GFE and you
can or in ISPs or elsewhere in the stack
this is an example of way what happens
when you don't cache something this was
something where we actually set the
cache control headers incorrectly
for a flash file that used to be in the
site years ago and the initial spike
that you see just here is when the
client when it reaches midnight it will
refresh the page and start loading the
functionality which tracks Santa and so
there's a big spike at that point that
is somewhat to be expected and we've
done things in the future where we just
say don't refresh immediately but just
refresh over random 30-second interval
but what happened afterwards was that
this Swift file because the caching
wasn't set incorrectly it was
periodically refreshing every five
minutes and then as soon as you fix the
caching it dies away to something that's
perfectly normal and fortunately this
was you know done using a static service
static content service which means that
it can handle a fairly high QPS and so
this didn't end up causing an issue but
it's kind of thing that we have to guard
against so
one of the questions is though is how
does the route get updated in real time
if you imagine that of course we don't
actually know exactly where Santa is
going to be and so you know in
collaboration with NORAD we get updates
and then show that to the audience but
there's virus mysterious mechanism we
don't quite understand
Santa is able to update these static
files for us we haven't figured out yet
how he's doing this there is some
questions about you know whether he's
doing it ant in a sort of like a sort of
a good manner or if his black hat Santa
but you know based on my working
relationship that we feel like we can
trust him and that it's worked it's
worked out very well in the past and so
these files are updated mysteriously and
then it's used to drive the experience
that people see in the browser but what
this means is that it's very easy to
control the experience and you know
updating it or making changes onew
requires a data push and there's no the
only code in there is JavaScript which
again you can push by updating a file
yeah so the the other big issue with
something like this is about how to
manage the QPS because it is so
extraordinarily high and one of the
problems is that when you have an event
that only happens once a year it's very
difficult to predict what the load will
be because you don't have this sort of
like monotonically increasing
month-to-month growth and so at the same
time I was very interested in being able
to say to marketing that you should feel
free to push it as much as you like and
us being able to guarantee that we can
handle the capacity whatever it may be
so although we actually
sorry although we work on estimating
this as much as possible what we also do
is to have a number of escape vowels in
there and so that if the QPS ever became
too high we can limit it down to an
acceptable level and all of these you
know have to operate very quickly you
know there's two of them so that if one
fails the other can still be used and
the primary thing that we have for this
is something that allows us to limit the
or change the altitude that Santa runs
out so that when Santa is flying
depending on the altitude he flies at
the QPS per user will vary you know if I
just so the mechanism by which it works
is that there's a JSON file on static
content service and that every 30
seconds that that is then fetched
client-side and if there's any change it
then applies it within the browser two
important things with that is that you
have to put a random offset a random
sort of like suffix on the URL to make
sure that you bust any caches because
you absolutely cannot tolerate this
being cached at all and then the other
thing is to make sure that you want to
smoothly interpolate the behavior so
I'll just give you an example of this
right now if we bring out Santa here so
this is going to load the local version
this is going to take a moment to get up
and as you can see Santa is coming up to
Neverest up here and so this is the
control file on the left and so
basically by changing that value and
then saving it what will happen is that
eventually I'm just showing it in
Firebug here eventually it will reload
that file and then smoothly interpolates
the altitude
raising it upwards and when as Santa
sort of like increases altitude the the
speed of which he's traveling over the
ground stays the same but because it's
done at a higher altitude the earth is
more distance and it ends up loading far
less data and there's always a moment of
anticipation of like will it actually
work but there we go all right so so you
can see Santa is now flying earth is
still moving but the earth is now moving
much more slowly and so at any given
moment we can you know trade off the QPS
and user experience to make it to make
it sort of like possible for back hands
to handle it and what this means is it's
kind of unusual that you can do
something like this you know imagine if
s I'm not sure how many s Ari's in the
audience but if you at any given moment
it could just reduce the QPS of a
service just so you can fix some s you
it would be wonderful to have it and
this is the only service I know of that
can do something like this ok I'll just
quit that out and get back to the talk
so this is kind of this is well this is
kind of but this is the kind of route
that Santa will take as he goes around
the world you can see that he starts in
Russia goes tends to go in north-south
routes following different time zones
and obviously visits an enormous number
of stops and you know this is this is
the route that he just took back only a
few weeks ago but the the important
thing about checking the I'll show that
a moment but the important thing about
checking the data is give you an example
of one of the years that I got it wrong
in fact it was the first year I was
working on it
and so you know in cooperation with you
know Santa we wanted to cover a lot more
cities so we got more data and Santa was
very cooperative on this and that when I
was entering some of the city names I
made a mistake with one of them
okay now you have to imagine the
situation this is the story that was
told to me in the headquarters of Santa
tracking operations is at NORAD in
Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado
Springs and so what happens is that on
Christmas Eve they have about 1200
volunteers come in and answer phone
calls all day telling little kids where
Santa is and I've been there answered a
few phone calls the kids are so cute so
sweet they they they're very very shy
but it's wonderful talking with them and
they show the Santa the Santa tracker on
big screens at the end of the room so
there was this point where these two
generals were talking there's one
general from the United States in the
second general from Canada and the US
general looked around at the screen and
he saw this okay you notice at the
bottom left-hand corner where it says
Toronto United States and so the u.s.
general saw this and I thought well
let's try and do our best to avoid a
diplomatic incident here because Canada
and the u.s. actually collaborate on
tracking Santa and so what he did was he
just kept the Canadian generals
attention for like that
two minutes stretch until he moved on to
the next city and it was all fine again
but he look back at something like this
and it was always a concern that you
could make a mistake like this so the
list was checked not just I mean I not
only worked on the list of the cities
but I had two other people independently
check it as well and unfortunately that
we corrected some mistakes in it but we
didn't catch this one
and so on the day of the event I was
looking through all of the emails to
send personal replies to everyone
apologizing for the error you know
explaining what happened and promising
that we will not invade Canada ever
again
and so fortunately we have a fair amount
of goodwill for the service so it it
didn't it didn't escalate to a
diplomatic diplomatic incident the other
things that notable about Google
actually is interesting share is that
one of the reasons that we can do this
is that during Christmas time there's a
global trough of traffic I mean this
happens not just with us but just about
any other Internet company and so it
means that we have extra capacity for
handling something like Santa and that
the teams involved also I mean there's a
lot of people shown a lot of generosity
in making all of this happen I mean we
have people working on this in Mountain
View San Francisco Zurich Sydney and
Boulder Boulder Colorado and it's it's
this sort of like camaraderie and
generosity that makes all of this
possible you know it's a lot to ask
somebody to say that you know I need you
to volunteer for something this is not
your job and we're going to do something
that's technically very demanding and
you're going to be on cool on Christmas
Eve
you're probably going to have to be
online on Christmas Eve to watch it all
and make sure it works out but we I feel
very grateful to everyone for committing
to help out with that and it's been a
wonderful wonderful experience to have
okay and so that that despite what you
might do there's always going to be some
surprise this is one of my favorite ones
that happen a number of years ago this
so paraphrasing this says good evening
and Merry Christmas I'm an immigration
officer and customs officer in Los
Angeles California working on Christmas
Eve and it goes on and it says where
does Santa report his entry and his
declare his merchandise
does he have special visa that allows
him not to present himself and a waiver
to present the merchandise for
inspection we were just wondering and
this is a customs Border Patrol officer
and and you know it's now I think three
years later and and we we haven't
drafted a response yet and unfortunately
the issue seems to have been dropped
okay
and so for that part I wanted to open it
up to questions and then I'll have some
more stuff afterwards all right hello
yes yes so the serving happens worldwide
and you know like many Google services
just its district it's distributed
geographically so that you can get a
better latency depending on whether the
user is the other big thing about it is
that most of the load of this is borne
by the edge caches of Google and so that
you know your edge cache can serve data
from almost anywhere and it only has to
make a limited number of requests back
to the Google Earth backends to actually
fetch the data so it basically needs to
manage about I mean clients often have
like 10 queries per second and they have
to manage that over you know four over
you know four minutes so there's like
two two and a half thousand URLs which
is constantly shifting and so it's
actually a very small amount of data to
do that
yeah all right okay so the question was
about the jitter is plus minus two
minutes now and how much narrow we can
make it um we do get feedback from
people talking about how they notice
that the earth earth plugin doesn't
quite match up with the maps version and
that one of the things is that as over
the years as we pushed more and more
push to use the edge caching more and
more it means that we can handle more
QPS and spicier behavior so as we reduce
the jitter it would become more spiky
and that the answer is that we'll
probably would start reducing it as of
next year but that's going to be a
question for the new tech leaders
working on it yes that would be that
would be a talk thank you
