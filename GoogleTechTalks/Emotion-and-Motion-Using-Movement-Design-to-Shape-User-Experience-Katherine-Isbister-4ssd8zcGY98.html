you and we are very happy to have
Catherine isbister fraiche added GDC as
part of the serious games at google Tech
Talk series Catherines a professor of
computer science and digital media and
the director of the innovation game lab
at NYU among many many other things
Katherine and I have been in an ongoing
conversation over the last year about
games and their potential impact on
society education and human interaction
and what I love most about Katherine's
perspective is the way she combines the
reflective academic and the serious
gamer sort of comes together in one
person so please join me in welcoming
Katherine isbister to Google well I'm
super excited to be here it was
definitely worth sacrificing one day of
GDC and I hope you'll agree with me i'm
here to talk today about one of my
passions as a researcher which is how to
bring more sophisticated understanding
to the design of movement based
interaction so i want to start with the
question of whether people think this is
really the future of interface how many
people remember seeing this movie oh
it's no sound remember Minority Report
right and this kind of like data glove
thing and these sort of really somewhat
sinister gestures and is this how you
guys want to want to interface with the
computer of the future how many people
think that would be really cool and fun
it's okay if you think so yeah raise
your hand and wave it excellent idea
okay so few people i'm going to show you
what i think would be really cool the
audio on my laptop so i hit mute okay
here's what I think would be really cool
as the future of moving and interface
see if I can get the center
so you can hear her friend egging her on
and they're having the best time and
it's a I'll turn off the sound it's a
really happy silly wonderful social
experience and I actually think movement
has the potential to to bring this to
interacting with computers and i'm not
totally opposed to the darth vader like
approach i think that can be really
intense and cool and fun but i think
that approach is a little bit
over-represented in how we think about
movement and technology now here's
another here's another idea how many
people play dance central on the kinect
a couple people okay cool I saw the most
amazing talk about this game at GDC this
week and I highly recommend it if you
guys have access to the GDC vault go
check it out they go through I think
like 10 or 12 prototypes of Dance
Central and how they figured out how to
teach people how to do the dance moves
how to have moves that weren't weren't
too hard what was fun about it and so
forth really really sophisticated and
what I liked about it is it showed that
it's actually possible to get people
doing really interesting full-body
complex movement as part of engaging
with technology and you know as we have
things like the kinect but with a lot
better resolution and ability to track
us we will have access to that kind of
motion right and and I think this game
shows that it's actually possible to
make movement like that accessible and
really fun and really interesting and
that's another paradigm and I'll get
into into why I think that's interesting
a little bit as we go on
so the truth is that the future is
already here right I mean now is the
time especially since last year with
with with the advent of the move and the
connect when almost everybody has in
their home very sophisticated sensor
based ways to engage with the console
machines sitting in their living room so
how many people here have a connect how
about a move anybody have the move how
do we where people have the wii right
okay and also this is scaring the
bejeezus actually out of the games
industry which is that these kinds of
platforms now have really sophisticated
sensors and multi-touch and cameras and
so forth and are starting to have really
amazing experiences like games and
gaming experiences themselves and
they're a much much broader market and
they're even more of a bridge into
everyday interaction with technology
right so essentially the future is
already here you already have a palette
of movement based devices that you can
use to create interactions with software
right and I have to show this how many
people have seen this video this is
really impressive okay one person it's
amazing this is a cat interacting with
an iPad and you're going to laugh at me
about the idea of trans-species
opportunities with platforms but I mean
think about pet insurance is anybody
here have pet insurance now for their
cat or dog you wouldn't believe the
giant market that pets have become okay
so I mean I'm kind of being
tongue-in-cheek here but on the other
hand I'm not it's what has happened with
the iPad the iphone is that there's
become a tremendous number of
applications for little children okay I
have a four-year-old and she grasped the
touch-based interface right away okay
just like this cat basically his cat is
playing with this imaginary stuff on
this screen just like it would with you
know a real ball and that's pretty
astounding right there are also
researchers who have been studying how
the elderly interact with touch pads and
I found similarly that people who get
really lost with the mouse and keyboard
and really complex menu structures
much easier time dealing with multi
touch interfaces so this is just so
going to be so ubiquitous and and people
are going to be doing more and more of
their everyday computing on these
devices people and their pets okay so
that that's just pretty awesome truly my
dog deleted my homework right so you
might think because its movement and
movement is something we do every day
that this is really intuitive and easy
to do but the truth is it's really not
it's actually really hard to design good
movement and gestural based interfaces
and it's really easy to lose the gains
that we've made in designing all these
consistent rules for things like
graphical user interfaces if you want to
see an excellent rant about this i
highly recommend on Norman's rant about
how you know touch-based interface is a
step backwards in terms of consistency
and all kinds of things and also I would
refer you to this really great talk by
the harmonics team at GDC about how many
mistakes they made along the way in
trying to teach people how to do these
dance moves and how complicated that
turned out to be so you guys are really
data-driven people this is a concept
that will write uses a lot that I find
really useful which is this notion that
you know if you just go into a space
without really understanding it you can
without realizing it design towards
local Maxima in the design space and you
can achieve something really great for
this little design territory that you've
decided is the ultimate and the best
possible choice but you could just be
way off base in terms of what would
actually be optimal I'm thinking about
designing the solutions and so I'm going
to present you two of these that I think
people often fall into in designing what
are now called natural user interfaces
or newyz it's kind of the buzzword one
of them is making the mistake of
thinking that the person should act like
a machine in other words if you look at
even some of the gestures with the
connector if you look at that Minority
Report video you can see these sort of
robot like does anybody remember the
robot dance right like some of those
gestures are very robotic in linear
right
and part of that is because that's
easier to recognize so how many people
have ever seen very nervous system by
David Roca be anybody let me show you
the video while I tell you this story so
David Roca be is a really brilliant
Canadian artist and he was one of the
first people to design a reactive system
that would would would track your
movement see if I can just cut right to
his his interactions with the system
which looked pretty kooky he's kind of a
kooky looking guy okay so basically what
the system would do is it would generate
dynamic music and this was in the 80s in
response to David's movement so we cry
he hand crafted this whole thing and he
in his gallery style artists so he told
this wonderful story I was at the bamf
Institute and he told a story about this
horrible thing that happened to him
which is that he took this piece and he
installed in the gallery he tested it it
was working great he was ready for
opening night all the people came in and
it didn't work at all it wasn't
responding to their movements at all and
he was like what happened he was
completely freaked out he tests it
himself it's still working fine so he
goes back and he looks at his videos he
was videotaping himself interacting with
the technology the system had trained
him to move in these bizarre ways okay
he hadn't trained himself to move in
really strange ways that the tech picked
up extremely well it happened completely
unconsciously and so he was able to use
the thing brilliantly like a like I'm
like a master of this instrument that no
one else could play it because it wasn't
actually intuitive at all and i think
you know it's great that we're really
plastic as human beings and we've
definitely taken advantage of that over
the years with these you know with all
the limitations we've had with
processing power we simply had to behave
more like machines for the machines to
understand what we were doing but that's
really no longer the case we have the
processing power we have
commercial-grade sensors out in people's
living rooms and we don't need to move
like robots anymore but I think we still
carry this strange kind of local Maxima
of act like a machine in how we think
about crafting and designing these
interactions okay
the other one that I think a lot of
people fell into in designing the early
Wii games that I think Nintendo was
masterful at avoiding was it's the same
thing as the problem with endlessly
chasing the ultimate VR augmented
reality situation which is being overly
literal literal about creating highly
realistic movement and their harmonics
guys actually told a really interesting
story about this they said that they
were pretty close to locking down for
development and they had come up with
all these dance moves they work with the
choreographer they're ready to go and
then they started doing testing like
really extensive testing and they
realized that how they had thought about
the progression was they would sort of
gradually unlock moves and there were
certain moves they were putting towards
the beginning that they thought were
really easy but even those moves were
incredibly hard for people who weren't
good dancers to do and they had gotten
all caught up in having this highly
realistic and really engage in
choreography just like real dance and
hadn't think been thinking enough about
what was accessible and approachable and
engaging for this tremendous market they
were trying to reach so they actually
did a really funny thing they had they
posted internally and asked people
who've had like two left feet who are
like white males who hated a dance like
everybody who totally hated to dance was
always traumatized by going to any
school dance they got them all like in a
bus and took them over to the dance
studio where they had been working on
the game and they had an emergency
re-engineering of the choreography like
basically a sort of like a basics like a
dance for dummies kind of training
session where they they quickly came up
with some moves that were super
accessible to somebody who really felt
like they had two left feet and and they
said oh that really really saved the
game because they realized you know it's
not about being Michael Jackson or
whoever Lady Gaga right playing this
game it's actually about offering people
this kinesthetic feeling of being
wonderful dancer and you and you
probably do that better by giving them
moves that are kind of easier that they
could really pull off because then they
feel really graceful so it's the same
thing with designing you know game
worlds you want to make people you want
to almost think of like a hyper reality
where you're you're
logically grace more graceful and more
interesting and more flawless in your
performance than you are in everyday
life right you don't mean it's like even
in The Sims it's kind of bizarre that
you have to you know take them to the
restroom I mean it's kind of like a
funny joke but you know you rarely see
that in movies they're parts of everyday
kinesthetic reality that we really don't
need to imitate and we certainly don't
need to do that an interface either I
think people get excited about that as a
challenge and go chasing that and
certainly from a technical perspective
it's really interesting to see how
precise sensors can be but it doesn't
mean we always want to design in exactly
that way so how do you tackle this
design challenge well one way you can do
it is you can actually you know offer a
cash prize which is what happened there
is this openni connect library and
primeSense sponsored this competition
and they wanted two people to create a
natural web browsing interaction and
this one was pretty cool I actually
tried to see a demo of it at a GDC but
it wasn't working which is the bane of
all demos let's see if I can skip to the
swimming part this is really kind of a
cool idea which is basically that you
swim through the web and this is
actually a free library that you can
directly hook until you can go buy a
kinect you know we use it with unity 3d
which is a game engine but you could use
it pretty much with anything and this
guy hooked up his web browser so you
swim forward to open the link and then
you sort of backpedal to back out of a
link and kind of swim to the right swim
to the left right it's a very dreamy
kind of you know pleasant and relaxing
way to interact with the web now I'm not
saying this is the be-all and end-all
and and of course even if you had like
10,000 applications developed in this
way and people voted on them you still
wouldn't really understand why do they
work why are they successful so
my answer to tackling this question is
to wear many hats some of which are very
silly we actually made these hats in my
lab but what I do is I combine thinking
about this problem from a human computer
interaction approach and a very
designing approach and using my
background in social science and having
a deep respect for what games commercial
games have already begun to do in terms
of making the user experience really
important the moment to moment
experience so these are some of the
weird things that we do in my lab we
build strange valuation tools this is
called the sensual evaluation instrument
ask me later if you want to know what it
does we build research prototype games
that allow us to pull data out of the
games and do controlled comparisons and
interesting things with them and I'll
walk you through a project like that
today and I have books and other things
you can read later if you want to so I'm
going to tell you today a little bit
about this motion and motion project
that we've been doing is trying to
tackle this question of how do you how
do you start to develop a design
language for interesting movement based
interaction so basically my approach is
I go to the social science literature
about how people work and I try to
figure out where are the sweet spots for
thinking about how to how to use a new
technology that's going to work really
well with people and then we've been
creating games as research instruments
because I think you have to have fairly
rich prototypes to explore some of these
ideas you have to have something that's
dynamic and engaging enough that you can
see if it's working or not all towards
applying this to interesting application
areas including education so and that's
how Matt and I actually met so some of
the social science we're using and I can
get into more detail on any of this if
you're curious one thing is the physical
feedback loop how many people know about
this phenomenon one person so let me
describe this study basically these
social psychologists told the people in
their study that they were going to test
out a hands-free interface they told
half the people that they had to hold it
look deuce-and-a-half like this this
activates your smile muscles and this
activates you frown muscles okay at the
end of this interaction with this device
the people who have been unconsciously
smiling rated the device statistically
significantly higher than the ones who
had been
frowning right and they never really
realized that they were doing this so
this is a really powerful thing in us
and this is why your mom said stand up
straight and act confident because
that's part of how you decide how you
feel you're getting signals from your
body so with a game mechanic if you if
you have somebody performing as if they
feel a certain way they're going to
start self labeling as feeling that way
so that's a really interesting and
powerful effect that we can use another
one is emotional contagion how many
people have heard of this or maybe heard
of mirror neurons that kind of thing
okay so so the theory is basically that
since we are social animals from way
back we are it's evolutionarily very
viable for us to be very susceptible to
one another's feelings so if so if one
of us gets really alarmed the others are
like oh what's wrong you know so if
there's some danger in the jungle then
we can all quickly respond to it so what
that means is that we do that all the
time even with media even with things
like TV if somebody looks really sad on
TV if you watch the person who's
watching and they're really into the
movie they start to look a little sad
too and in their brains a little to some
degree it's kind of the same as if they
themselves were feeling sad so it's
super powerful and this really comes
into play with performative and physical
games like broad body games because it's
so much more legible when you're
witnessing the game it's a lot different
than console play which sometimes has
that zombie look like you know you I
mean there are intense feelings going on
but you can't really see them from the
sides but when somebody is playing
adventure on Kinect you can see them
getting excited and so you're much more
likely to get excited too and then kind
of an extension of that is this whole
notion has anybody ever done the stadium
wave yeah a couple people this is super
fun it's it's weird how good it feels to
get into synchrony with other people and
they're all kinds of strange studies
about this like here's one you can try
in a meeting take a sort of a strange
posture and then wait and see who also
takes the posture I guarantee you
probably one other person will it'll be
the person who agrees with you the most
is kind of most on your team it's the
weirdest thing so you could so this is
why like sales people they actually will
imitate
your body language to get you to feel
like you're in sync now think about game
mechanics and move the mechanics you
know when you have two people doing
things you can actually have them doing
stuff together they'll feel they'll feel
more trust and liking for one other it's
it's swell so how we approach this in
the lab was first we started to unpack
the wii games that's what was out there
at the time to really break down with
more nuanced like what was happening in
terms of movement in those games what
was engaging and not engaging about them
and whether we could start to create
some dimensions along which we could
design basically and then we did a
series of studies in our lab and also
out in school actually because we're
part of this games for learning
instituted NYU and then we created this
research prototype so I'm going to just
show you little segments of this process
and right now we're building a math game
trying to make use of some of these
ideas so we plan a lot of week games and
looked at you know what kinds of
movements were fun and weren't and why
and one thing we realized was that
happy-go-lucky loose movement is much
more silly and positive and friendly
than sort of tight controlled movement
and I'll show you these two videos this
is actually an actor performing along
certain dimensions of this lebon
movement announced it's like a dance
notation but it's a really a really
great illustration so this is floating
this is maybe more slow than a lot of
mechanics we saw the people liked on the
wii but just really light and joyful and
mellow and happy trip you kind of right
and contrast that with this the sort of
slashing motion this is this one on the
on the right is super fun if you're if
you're doing like a Star Wars lightsaber
game right because you feel like whoa
I'm really powerful it's kind of kind of
has this whole different vibe right but
both both kinds of movements are pretty
flowing and and allow the rest of the
body to get into the game and that was
something that we saw that seemed to be
really important just to like a little
micro comparison here is a game called
we cheer that people did like a lot and
it had it so basically a cheerleading
game but even the guys in my lab we're
like a cheerleading this is fun you know
because
it had fairly free flowing movements and
it allowed the rest of the body to get
involved this was a game called boogie
superstar and it was also a dancing game
but basically they took this approach
where you had to move like a machine you
had to do your movements to a very
strict metronome so all of a sudden you
were kind of doing the robot as you were
dancing it wasn't nearly as much fun it
was much more mechanical and complicated
to try to do so we're starting to see oh
wow there's actually some nuances of
movement that seemed to really shift the
character of how people feel about
interacting so I'll show you some
footage from my in lab study and we did
just video recording these are some
dancers doing we cheer also because we
were sort of curious about what happens
when there are people who are really
super good at the kind of thing the game
is teaching as opposed to people who are
novices do we get really different kinds
of motion and one thing you can really
see in this video is if you look behind
the two who are performing you can see
how engaged the the women who are just
watching are and how they get so into
the action emotionally can see it in
their faces and they had really
interesting things to say also about how
you train movement and how the various
games did a good or bad job of training
movement and that's another interesting
factor in terms of if you're going to
innovate new interaction strategies you
have to think about how you're going to
teach them so I won't show this footage
because this is middle school girls and
you know we don't usually show the video
of classroom studies but essentially
what we went out and did was I wanted to
validate this intuition that everybody
has this intuition that more movement is
more fun and leads to more energy and so
forth but I couldn't find any research
that really validated that so we did a
study where we had low medium and high
movement Wii games solo is Mario Kart
medium was we cheer and high was we
boxing Zen be played wii boxing it's
like / it's like super vigorous right so
we went into the schools and then we had
these little clickers and the girls
after every round would self rate how
they were feeling like how happy have
frustrated how much fun and what would
their energy level was just so we could
see what would happen and we actually
did like ours
hours video coding afterwards for level
of movements we could validate for
ourselves was it really low medium and
high and yes it was so our hypothesis
was well you know everybody thinks that
more movement leads to more positive
emotion and energy and so forth what we
found interestingly was it didn't seem
to be related to fun or sort of positive
emotion but it was definitely related to
energy levels so the more you were
forced to move in the game the more
energized you felt at the end which is
you know I mean not surprising but it's
good to check it out and we actually
have a lab on movement analysis analyst
coding video now looking she's really
interested in whether she can actually
see frustration as it forms in the body
and since we have all this self-report a
frustration data at a pretty micro level
she's going to use that to cross-check
her observations so that's sort of cool
so then we went on to create a research
prototype oh and I have a paper about
that work if anyone wants it it's in
submission right now but I'm happy to
share with you so then we did a research
prototype and of course you know there
are a lot of things that vary between
mario kart wii cheer and wii boxing
besides amount of movement right so the
most ideal way to test out this theory
is to actually design a game where the
only thing you very is movement and so
that's what we did and we use these
silly hats because when make sure that
people would move a lot because
sometimes with wiimotes people cheat
they figure out the accelerometer thing
they and they're less likely do it when
they have on their head also it was just
really fun so let me just show you a
brief little video about Riggle
one of my students can close this music
we also had him do pen and paper
measures to see how about compared with
nodding your way into self reporting
your emotions mmm she might be less
objective we started would be really fun
nice to date this video they took a
video of me playing the game and put it
up on our website as a revenge
yeah these are good people did start
pushing one another when they played
this game to knock each other off
balance just 30 min mistake that's
Chelsea's happy dance cuz she won so I
think you guys get the idea so this is
actually a work in progress presentation
at Chi I don't know if anybody's going
to be there in May but we'll have the
game set up so you can come and play it
if you want to so what do we found we
found the same pattern that we did with
the school study which is that and you
can see the little graphs here you know
for four valence which is positive
versus negative emotion it was equally
fun really to play the game whether you
had the movement or not but we got we
definitely got a significant effect for
energy level people felt much more
energized afterwards and we also got
this really interesting effect it was
not it was not a significant effect but
something that i'm planning to go after
which is people who played with the hats
felt much more of a sense of social
connectedness after going through that
experience compared to the people who
played with the keyboard so it sort of
underscores the interesting social
aspects of thinking about this stuff
okay so let me talk about how we're
using the stuff in relation to like
practical concerns while I was doing
this research somebody showed me this
fascinating study how many people have
heard of this power pose study okay one
person this is just really bizarre but
with some people from Harvard and
Columbia and they they had people either
be in this this high power pose or a low
power pose for 10 minutes and basically
they made them spit into a cup before
and after and they measured their
hormone levels and then they also
offered them some fake money to like
make a bet to see how risky of a bet
they would make
people who stood in high power poses
they're like literally their
testosterone went up their cortisol went
down and there are much more likely to
make very confident and kind of risky
bets and people who were forced to stand
these low power poses just for ten
minutes had had a significant it had a
significant impact on them like
biochemically as well as behaviorally
which is I was like whoa so I started
thinking about that I started thinking
about kids who have math anxiety because
I've been in this games for Learning
Institute and I was like I've already
seen how I can change people's energy
level what if I could literally make
someone feel more confident while
they're doing math and then maybe that
would kind of break the cycle of them
being really anxious right so we're
actually we have a little this is super
rough it's much more polished now I
would love to be able to show you guys
the demo live but you'll just have to
see this super crappy like this was like
in January basically we came up with
this very very simple math game idea
which is your landing fractions on a
number line okay and so in one condition
of the math game you have to keep
expanding the number line in order to
catch the fractions so you're
inadvertently taking these really strong
power poses and I actually ran this past
the woman who did the research in New
York City and she's like oh yeah that'll
be great she's going to look at our
prototype so just to double check in the
other condition you have to keep the
number line kind of small and you have
to constantly catch things a little bit
lower to the ground so you're being
forced to stay in the low power post
condition so we're piloting this this
spring in a local middle school and if
it if it goes well there's this really
interesting experiment in New York
called the school of one which has
highly customized math learning and
they've said they're willing to actually
pilot this to a much greater number of
kids so I would just be so excited if
this actually works and I would have
loved to learn math this way but anyway
this is just a show like a super
practical use of this in case you were
starting to feel like oh this is so evil
empire like influence people's feelings
you know very insidious so it can be
used for the forces of good I guess what
I'm trying to say and then in terms of
next next steps I'm really interested in
building from these kinds of
research-based building blocks to
rethink how we approach gesture I feel
like we have a window of opportunity
here where it's not all totally set in
stone it's you know how would like the
whole story about the Dvorak keyboard
and the QWERTY keyboard and so forth I
think we have this moment now where it's
not all completely locked down where
there's a chance to actually get some
really interesting social and emotional
considerations into play in these
devices that we all interact with every
day and I think it has all kinds of
implications for people's wellness for
education for all kinds of areas I
personally would instead of sitting on
my butt at my desk all day sorting email
out of my inbox like why can't it be
more like gardening or like cooking
together like why can't my mundane data
processing tasks actually be healthful
and social for me and with these kinds
of devices there's not really a reason
why that can't happen except for a lack
of imagination in my opinion so this is
like a like a recent open library of
multi-touch gestures I mean I think this
kind of work is very valuable and fine
but it just it feels like that robot
thing all over again it feels like okay
let's all act like robots and come up
with these very efficient sort of least
common denominator movements I think
there's a role for that kind of thinking
but um I would rather see something like
this right like why not have gmail
taichi right like why not I mean if you
have a connect in your living room
couldn't you sort your email that way
and two folders wouldn't that be great
you could do that in the morning maybe
it wouldn't be so horrible to go through
your inbox right you wouldn't have to
declare in inbox bankruptcy you'd be in
so much better shape after sorting your
email book Oh sort of my email you know
I'm just saying and personally I think
the way to get there is first of all to
really understand the science of what
happens to people through movement and
three gesture and dive into that side of
things understand essentially how we're
hardwired and how we use these things in
our everyday life and really think about
moving with that material and it has
huge impact on our emotions on how we
connect to other people and move
there's this research that that I read
recently in the times where you can't
just go get an exercise bicycle for 30
minutes and sit the rest of the day
you're in just as bad a shape as
somebody who never got on the bike right
so we need to find a way to incorporate
movement all day long and to our lives
and so I think that this there's a lot
of possibility there and so I guess it's
an incitement to think past the more
robot sort of local Maxima into another
space it isn't necessarily gestural like
hyper realism but is something that
augments our everyday lives in really
wonderful ways and in case you think
this is not practical I want us to tell
you the story about the pretty ATM
machine has anybody read this in an HCI
textbook so basically i think this
research was done first in japan and
then validated an Israel that for some
weird reason people would report
identical button structures as easier to
use on more aesthetically pleasing ATM
machines it was like easier to use and
it did seem like it was more efficient
for them they're actually being more
efficient so the Israelis who replicated
the study were like ah we think we
figured out why this is so and the
reason is because of this thing called
mild positive effect has anyone heard of
this basically it's this idea that when
you're in sort of a mildly happy mood
you're much more creative okay you
problem solve better so the Israelis
theory was you actually make people
slightly smarter by putting them into a
little bit better of a mood through the
aesthetics okay so if that's true for
graphics I think that would be very true
for gesture and I think that's part of
the reason why Apple is kicking
everybody else's but with their early
multi touch devices okay because they
figured out this gesture thing really
fast and I have a colleague who talks
about how that that initial how many
people have an iphone okay that initial
interaction were you were you unlock it
she she compared that to petting a
little kitty cat she said the very first
interaction you have with that device is
like a little caress it's not like a
button press and it's not like i mean i
love android too but it's like those
unlock the little connect the dots
things like right but this is like ah
right and so I think this is is pretty
potent stuff right so so and maybe this
is partly because my husband's allergic
to cats and I can't have a cat but I
would like all of my technology to be
much more like you know playing with a
kitty cat then or the kitty cat can play
with it for that matter rather than me
having to eternally do the robot so that
is my top I'm happy to take questions
so I was trying to understand the second
part of your argument connecting it to
the first race is that even in areas
like if you're trying to design a
gestural you I not for fun purposes but
for you know quote unquote serious
purpose is having people have fun with
it a little bit and being in that mild
positive effect is going to make it more
useful user interface absolutely so let
me give you an example so right now i'm
working with a professor who does
security applications at my university
and we're working on authentication
techniques and he's really interested in
the biometric aspect of it but my
argument is people hate typing in
passwords they come up with crappy
passwords they use over and over again
if you design like kind of an awkward
annoying gesture if you design a gesture
that feels really good to do guess what
people are going to comply more so there
are very practical areas not just sort
of a subtle more positive ethic but also
just we can change how much people want
to perform certain at tasks they may
have to perform any way through the
design of the movement so would you say
it's safe to say that you could adopt a
similar research approach even if your
act designing a successful UX even if
you're even if your goal isn't to make a
game oh absolutely at what so I think
game developers have an evolutionary
pressure on them which is that consumers
either buy or don't buy the game only
based on whether it's fun so they're at
the vanguard of understanding that
moment to moment engagement and how to
maintain it so I'm actually an HCI
person i came to games because I was
like why do avatar and characters work
in games and nobody could make it work
like remember the microsoft paper clip
that's how i got two games so I actually
think games are a very interesting space
to watch more for that experiential
expertise I I agree with you that I
think the games are on the bleeding edge
of UX design and theory I really do but
I'm a hardcore gamer coming in industry
sir
I just sort of following on from that
question um so I've been reading a
little bit about games and one of the
things I've been reading which I'm not
sure if this is a mainstream view is
that one of the things that's fun for
people who had games is that they have
unnecessary obstacles that people
actually like games that are difficult
and challenge them but that necessary
obstacles are not fun in the same way
like if you know your boss puts a lot of
obstacles in your path right not
actually fun for you yeah so when um
doing experiments on on how fun these
sort of movement based games are how can
you separate out the part of the fun
that comes from an unnecessary obstacle
that might not be fun in a real-life
interface know the kind of fun that's
like through the grace and sort of happy
aspect of them event I think it's I
think it's a deep consideration of
mapping you know I mean if you think of
you know Hutchins and Norman and like I
think you want to map that that arc of
experience of kind of the Navi the
knotty problem like not naughty like you
know a you but Kate and OH TTYL like
that's fun to unravel too and that is a
big part of what games deliver they sort
of deliver this whoa I'm really
frustrated I'm doing something really
hard oh that was so great this kind of
arc of experience like I don't think
it's all about easy fun I think that's
only like a first layer of what makes
games compelling so definitely what I
presented here is more that surface of
these people's way into the move and
experience but I think there's also like
if you think about the move which is
Sony's device it's probably the most
accurate of the three devices and I
could really see people developing very
refined ways to move through data or to
investigate things that are very
kinesthetic and precise and there might
be some kind of like pulling weeds in a
garden there might be some very
laborious parts of that that are
strangely satisfying right so is not
just all about like ease yeah I need to
give that impression I just actually
have two questions but one was the the
cheating you mentioned I have a couple
of friends who bought the wii they have
all the gaming consoles and they bought
the wii and the guy beat zelda kind of
like laying on the couch just like
flicking it because he figured out all
the motions yes and then it was not
really any fun
what have you seen in terms of is it a
type of user who cheats or is it a type
of game that causes the user to cheat
are there ways to bring them back and
get them engaged yeah I I think it's a
combination I think if you're a hardcore
gamer and you're used to the precision
of a console device like a handhold
controller the designer has to really
win you over with the movement based
interaction and the wiimote is not that
accurate so I actually gave a talk at
GDC last year about the nuances of
designing that kind of kinesthetic
realism and I contrasted like star wars
the force unleashed which was this
lightsaber game which had some really
great movement stuff but also some
really complicated combinations of
buttons and movement and people would
sometimes kind of back off to the
flicking thing with another game which
now I can't remember the title but
basically it was all button stuff so it
maintained the tight control except for
like going in for the kill which was
like this and so it just isolated the
most fun crazy like crescendo and and
the hardcore gamers love that because
they didn't lose the control and they
still got kind of the the big payoff
movement right so I think it's a
combination right where's if you come to
these games without any gaming
experience something like have you seen
boom blox it's sort of like Jenga like
you pull out the little the little tiles
like that one works really well it's
very natural and intuitive and fun
because there's not all that baggage
about precise control embedded into the
genre and the audience and the
expectation so I think it's kind of a
mix God so it's not about that well it
is about the type of person there there
are some people you have to win them
over or you're just there in train and
something and stuff also I think like in
the least in the u.s. like like guys
have kind of like performing physically
doing crazy things physically is like
okay like there's definitely that kind
of tendency to that was actually my
second question was my favorite thing
about the Kinect is the menu navigation
really intuitive to just learn how to
work your way through a game but then I
really didn't like dancing and unless
I've had enough drinks yeah and I have
the same thing on my tablet so I'll dock
my tablet to a bluetooth keyboard and I
type my email away but I like touching
and swiping
the major actions yeah but I haven't
seen a lot of games that support that or
do you know if games or if developers
are aware of that of that combination of
of more buttons and then menus for just
sort of swiping and partial elements I
think you're going to see more
sophisticated mixes in the next year and
how Kinect games operate I mean I think
that was such a radical evolution and I
think Microsoft put out certain
standards and I think everybody's still
getting the hang of that blend plus with
Kinect you've got the voice recognition
right so it's really hard to figure out
what the right combination is but I
think we'll have a hybrid world we will
still have to type sometimes but if
language recognition gets really really
good and you know we're not in a crowded
environment we may talk to our computer
a lot of the time you know what I mean I
think we'll have to think very
multimodal and maybe that will allow
these gestural interfaces to do things
they do well like i do think sorting and
it's the same thing as you see how the
ipad the apps on the ipad are very
different like I'm really interested in
seeing a movie on the iPad like how do
you do video editing with just a touch
based interface and does that feel good
and try it on Android two little boys
yes sorry I don't mean to me and
actually for app gmail on the gmail on
the new android tablet it's actually
pretty nice because you can you can just
swipe your emails into boxes so you have
this nice flicking motion yeah I'm done
with that email i will then let the
nigga type hi so to start with I'm
having a great deal of trouble
connecting with what you're saying I
guess you know I'm white I'm male and
English I don't drink hey um my favorite
computer games are logistical games
right I like managing buses and trains
and I get really frustrated that the
interfaces don't have macros because I
want to type a program that explains
what I want the train to do and I have
it executes and I do not want any real
time elements at all thank you very much
yeah um so you come from another planet
I'm sorry at the same time
actually work on gmail and I came to
hear you talk because I was thinking so
how can gmail be better how can we
because I've gone I all my life I've
been waiting for physical manipulations
to happen to data I always wanted to
send files by dragging them across to my
friend and letting my friend have them
so but I still can't put it together and
maybe it's because of I have trouble
with the emotional connection yeah at
the same time I need my mail interface
to be something that will work when I'm
on the bus I need it to be something
that works when I'm in the office I need
it to be something that works when
there's someone else in the room with me
and dancing isn't going to do that even
if it possibly provides some of the
ideas so this is a pathetic question
help me put these things together well
so I think I have to I think you have to
imagine that this is a modality for
interaction and that it will be valuable
in the future to bring people's bodies
into play and engaging with their
everyday digital work life right so that
sure I don't think it'll ever go away
that you want that especially with
something like email where it's very
tech space and you're reading it you
need to have all kinds of different
screens and in that kind of
standardization I think you should see
it more as another Avenue into engaging
with that data right and in I mean maybe
another way to look at it is going to
consider all the work that's being done
with data visualization and exploration
and thinking about you know I think
about people like you know I know people
who work at places like Pixar who do
like 3d modeling and touch is a very
promising way to help those people who
were who were who were manipulating
things to do their work in a more fluid
and approachable manner and that may
turn out to be the case with data
management and visualization to some
degree for all of us including things
like email you know
like how many things do I have from this
person versus that one those kinds of
big picture global view things things
like sorting I mean I don't think it
would ever replace you directly coding
an application I just think it's another
layer it's another lens that can come
into play it's just like how we were all
struggling at first with how do you put
the web on a small mobile device do you
completely change the interface you know
things like online banking that look
really different do you try to find some
way to have some standard I mean it I
see it as the same struggle and I mean I
I think um there's a really wonderful
book by this woman call Maxine sheet
johnstone that's all about getting into
your physical body and trying out
strange exercises to make you aware of
the manner in which you move through the
world physically like she has things
like make up your bed as if you're
you're frantically late ok now make up
your bed as if you just got back from a
two-month vacation in Hawaii and then
she sort of walks you through notice how
you tuck in the sheets it's like and
noticing how that makes you feel like so
i don't know i mean i think that you can
get it as a have it on my um my kindle
reader so like i would encourage you to
explore that if you're kind of like what
what is she talking ok so so I realize
is I realize is a second thing that I
should be asking which is you're talking
about things that people do for fun but
what about intellectual pursuits what do
we know about how people behave and how
they move when they're doing something
intellectually I know what I'm talking
to someone I lean forward I lean back
there are changes in my facial Express
if I'm French I move my hands a lot and
i think if i took a movie of myself
playing with Lego which is a physical
pursuit i greatly enjoy hmm you'd see a
lot of those things going on they sort
of not conscious things that I'm doing
in order to manipulate the world but
there presumably exploitable cues
absolutely um I think there are
prospects definitely like like that
there's these parallel systems of
approach and avoid that are really well
documented in how people behave
physiologically and that's sort of a pro
movement right like you lean in you're
interested you're engaging versus the
kind of shrinking back I mean there are
some very practical pragmatic sort of
survival based areas of this work so I
just want to jump in and see is there
anybody on the remote locations who has
a question
so I have a question that's more for
like power users or hardcore users going
back to like both of their points so for
instance like in my case when I play
games I'm like very competitive so like
almost competition level and so I'm
wondering like so for all these things
it's very convenient and it's very nice
when you try to introduce it to new
people who don't know anything about it
but then for me for instance like I
can't like the reason why I don't have a
we connect or like any of those is
because it just doesn't work for me like
it's it doesn't work like I can't get
you know how many of our actions I need
in order to write feel like I'm doing
what I need to do so do you have any
like plans to address or try to help
like hardcore users really transition
over well I guess I think that hardcore
game genres that have evolved on console
controllers are a really beautiful thing
that I would not want to mess with it's
sort of like I've skied my whole life
and when I was like in my early 30s I
tried out snowboarding and snowboarding
is great but I was like yeah I suck at
this I don't really want to master this
it's kind of drifty I can't ski super
fast on a snowboard and I sort of
abandoned I was like I'm not interested
in this I already have this other thing
I'm doing so I wouldn't think of it as a
substitution like oh you as a hardcore
gamer now have to use this thing I think
some of the developers made that mistake
I don't think that's true at all it's
like telling somebody who plays the
violin okay now your violin is gonna
have a lot of buttons and you'll blow
into it like an oboe wow isn't that cool
don't you want to do that with your mom
it's like no okay well for some people
that's cool but you know what I'm saying
like I don't I think that that's a
that's a confused message that somehow
propagated in the press and I mean I
think I think of console gaming like
that is sort of like the virtuous of
piano playing like you wouldn't just
change the piano we're creating
different instruments for engagement you
mentioned a couple of examples where the
motion to play the game makes you feel
better such as the the smiling when you
have to write smiling versus puckering
or frowning have you studied at all how
much those factors lead to
repeat play or like more play no I
haven't I think that'd be a really
interesting question and I'm actually
starting to think after my research that
what physical gaming really does is it
changes your arousal rate and then use
other cues to decide what the valence of
your emotion is so the physical feedback
stuff with with the pen was your face
and your face has the more hardwired
kind of positive negative valence stuff
but I sort of think with the body I
don't know I think there's the approach
avoid axis and I think there's energy
level but I think we do a lot of
contextual labeling of oh I feel really
and then it's either terrified or
excited based on what's happening in the
world so but I think that's a really
interesting question I definitely would
follow up on that so has there been much
work on using motion interfaces when
there isn't visual feedback which it
seems almost all games rely pretty
heavily on that yeah I've been wondering
about for example in cars where you you
shouldn't be looking at all the controls
and everything else or on your phone is
there some useful results there that can
help very useful scientific results but
I've seen some pretty interesting
strange independent games and there's a
real movement among the game independent
game community to get away from social
gaming where you're both still staring
open-mouthed at the screen like they
were like wow we really want people to
look at each other while they play so I
think it'll be an interesting space to
watch but I don't know of any sort of
scientifically grounded non-visual
literature hi there you talked about
avoiding the local Maxima in your search
space which I was very interested in
your example of the dance central where
they did all this polish and then the
last minute they brought in what I guess
was their target users and they couldn't
use it is that well
it sort of crept up on them I think I
mean they they tried really hard to make
it super accessible they did realized
early on that someone who absolutely
hates dancing they could never really
make get up and dance they're like well
we have to have some buddies at least
willing to try but I think what they did
was they got so caught up in working
with the choreographers and planning out
the moves and they themselves became
more expert at the moves that they had
that classic thing where they kind of
lost their beginner's mind and then when
they when they went out and tested it
they're like oh no it's too hard and
that happens all the time with games
it's a big problem in gaming I guess the
follow-up was you also talked a little
about like perhaps you could say how
much polished you need in in like a
prototype do you think when you can get
something valid out of the testing yeah
like it sounds like they went really far
before they did no actually that's why
you should get a hold of their talk
because it literally showed all of their
prototypes and one of their main points
in their talk was you have the moral
responsibility with these dynamic
systems to fake your way into a good
enough prototype as early as possible
when you can still make changes and they
were super creative about it they did
Wizard of Oz stuff it was really cool I
was like that's why they're really good
at what they do and I mean I've got
really intrigued by the culture of
design at harmonics it's like how did
they do that because a lot of HCI people
don't do that right and but yeah I mean
I think the trick is the dynamics have
to be tight but the visual of fidelity
doesn't always have to be so tight and
that's not how we usually think so I
mean and that was the nugget I took away
but I don't think you have to have
highly rink you have to have highly
resolved timing to see if one of these
things works but you can fake that a lot
of the time yeah yeah
they said one interesting contrasting
comment so I'm a project manager who
loves working on projects that have
engineers like Steven jr. yep who thinks
so critically about every little bullet
and but what I do is I get up on the
board early in the project and I gesture
and I gesture how the data is going to
flow and I would love it if my gestures
just turned into the program one day yes
or if there was a way to us to both sit
around the table with Lego blocks and
build the application flow and hit
submit and you know off it goes so I
think the combination of the two really
works it sounds like a very cool app I
hope you guys build that thank you very
much you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
