on google maps and I'd like to introduce
Neil seiki the founder and CTO of zero
motorcycles I'll let Neil really
introduced himself more properly but I
think you all know thanks for having me
it's a pleasure to be here you know I
always heard a lot about the Goo Goo
campus and this is my first time here
and that's you know it's exciting to
meet all you guys and now to see if all
the rumors are really true about what
goes on over here so you know I'd like
to kind of its kind of have an informal
talk here and you know you guys can tell
me kind of more about what you want to
hear about because I've got a lot of
stuff I've designed this electric
motorcycle and this company but I've
also done a lot of product development
and I'm willing to talk about everything
you've anything you guys want to talk
about whether it's a business
development kind of topics or battery
related topics you know because we've
got a small crowd here I think I'll talk
for a little bit and then we can have
question and answer and you know you
guys if you have a burning question guys
can certainly stop lien no i'll try to
expound on anything you want but my talk
is electric motorcycles and other cool
stuff just because i wanted to frame
this with the idea that you know i
didn't just create this motorcycle in a
vacuum I didn't take a gas card
motorcycle and stick a battery pack in
it it was really a ground-up design
which really involved a lot of skills a
lot of product development that I've
been doing for 20 years with my own
product development company so I thought
it was important that I kind of go
through my history a little history
about stuff I've design and kind of will
let you give you an idea of my thought
process and how I overcame the problems
with designing electric motorcycles and
and how we got to where we are today one
of the first things I did when I was in
college was I was the project manager
and chief designer for a human powered
helicopter and this was the first ever
successful human powered helicopter and
I have a master's in aeronautical
engineering and really the thing that
enabled the
helicopter to get off the ground and
really if you think about it this is a
major accomplishment I mean it's one
thing to fly an airplane forward but to
lift yourself straight off the ground
purely by your own power is just it's an
order of magnitude more difficulty than
an airplane and this thing required a
really really strong structure because
what you can't see in this photo is the
the wingspan of that rotor is a hundred
feet in diameter so it's just this
massive spar all carbon fiber you know
we made it in the same same cleanroom
that the Space Shuttle boom arm is made
from its got like a hundred thousand
dollars with a carbon fiber in it and
it's used and it really pushed the
limits of carbon fiber structure
technology and an airframe structural
dynamics and and really it was a really
a great way to show that you could make
helicopters really really efficient be
much more efficient than any other
helicopter out there you know I think we
calculated this is sometimes something
like 300 times more of a power-to-weight
ratio than a conventional helicopter
technology so it was an interesting
project for you know combining
aerodynamics and structural analysis but
I also worked on other things after
college I went to work on that I had a
friend who was a flight test engineer
and he was actually the pilot of this
airplane it was developed by the German
government in cooperation with the
United States government to well its
primary mission was really a spy
aircraft it was a low-cost kind of a
poor man's you two aircraft that could
do surveillance at eighty thousand plus
feet you know where you couldn't get
shot down easily by missiles and things
like that and but the other use for this
was the National Geographic Society
purchased these airplanes to do really
the first close examinations of the
ozone layer the depletion of the ozone
layer because it could fly incredibly
high and it wasn't flying so fast it was
heating up there they could take
atmospheric samples from eighty six
thousand feet and what what happened was
a friend of mine who is the head of
taking the first flight in this thing he
came to me with the problem of you know
he obviously his first concern you know
more than setting it out to be record
was to not die and these flight tests of
these kind
crazy you know state-of-the-art
airplanes are actually incredibly
dangerous for these test pilots and one
of the problems with this airplane
airplane also has a hundred foot
wingspan was it in that atmosphere at
80,000 feet the air is so thin there's
just nothing to push on your propellers
almost going supersonic you're pushing
as hard as you can on to almost nothing
no air resistance to keep the plane
aloft if it gets into an uncontrollable
situation a spin situation you have so
much inertia on there he was very
worried that he'd never recovered he
would just spin it their idea to the
ground and die because there are so much
there's so much yah mo motions and
there's so many complex dynamics that
you can't really model successfully with
the computer so I designed this model I
thought well let's let's model it with a
ten-foot scale model and we'll
instrument it and figure out the forces
and we've learned some really
interesting stuff about how that when it
did get into a spin there was almost a
you know the amount of G's that you'd
have laterally and this aircraft in a
spin was almost lethal and what we did
is I designed a drag chute for the back
where the pilot could open a drag chute
and get the Plain pointed straight down
and stop it from spinning at least with
the plane straight down he could be he
could have he gained enough velocity to
regain control on the flying surfaces in
order to pull it up out of a dive so it
was a it was a kind of a a modification
to the airplane really for safety and
really to allow this airplane to you
know explore the outer regions of our
atmosphere and a really interesting
project that was at the time I was
working with him and I was also working
at NASA doing a lot of research we are
pure research I did a lot of laminar
flow aerodynamics kind of research but I
also got to do a study with the state of
California looking into transportation
solutions for the California corridor
and we were examining electric vehicles
hydrogen vehicles conventional gas
engines gas turbines things like that
and examining from a California policy
level as to what should the state of
California fund from a bond initiative
kind of perspective in order to put in
the infrastructure to allow us to get
away from the gasoline
engine because even even when I was
doing this project and working for NASA
20-some years ago you know there was a
big impetus for cleaning up the
environment it's something that's been
around for 30 40 years I think even at
the time we did public opinion public
opinion surveys and found that 30 the
environment was still like the
number-one concern for people even 30
years ago so this is not a not a new
phenomenon the cleantech phenomenon and
the environmental movement's it's really
something I've really been waiting for
waiting to come to a head for our
governments to do something about it for
private industry to make vehicles that
are you know clean for the environment
and fun and provide a practical solution
and working in conjunction with the US
government and state state governments
to provide us you know some sort of
solutions because obviously it's not
enough to just you know want to be green
and want to have a clean car you've got
to have a good alternative that is cost
effective and reliable and all the
things that you really need to
practically have a revolution you know
if you want to clean up the environment
so this one this is the Egret which I
want to say is built about 25 years ago
20 20 years ago something like that and
it was kind of not well covered
obviously because this is a semi secret
project you know because it didn't have
a lot of help do reconnaissance missions
but they built two airplanes this was a
hundred-foot version of the airplane and
they built a hundred and thirty foot
version called the Stratus and I think
the only photos I ever saw this thing
was on aviation week that magazine that
has all the we used to call it aviation
leak because they always were taking
photos of every every top secret project
at the end of their words camped out at
the end of the runway wherever at taking
pictures of these top-secret vehicles
and publishing them and they said this
this magazine so it's not a well-known
thing but it is in the records the
record books as a still kept holds the
world altitude record oh this is the
model of it so the real actual airplane
had the this is the scale model that we
redeveloped and an interesting project
we had to had to scale not only the
aerodynamic surfaces and the volume of
it but scaled a nurse's
we had to scale up the the mass moment
of inertia and all the accesses so that
was a real true flying model and then
put it into these spins and dives and
see if you could really recover because
you could learn a lot about the handling
characteristics of aircrafts it's a very
it's a very difficult science
computational fluid dynamics I think
people don't realize how I really early
in the in the process we are with
computers having enough power to really
handle tough computational fluid dynamic
problems especially when we get to these
you know these these border conditions
where we're running almost supersonic
where viscosity is a large factor it's
you know it's easy to predict inviscid
flow you know we don't have the
viscosity of the liquid but accounting
accounting for all the wheel will world
factors like air heating and viscosity
and transonic behavior of air flow where
we're actually you know quite in the
early stages of getting computers that
have enough computational power to fully
predict handling characteristics of
full-blown aircrafts so we're still we
still rely a lot on models and feel the
pants you know simulations and take your
best get guess and build an airplane and
send test pilot up and hope he doesn't
die kind of thing that's a there's still
a lot of just you know really hairy
flight tests that goes on that a lot of
the companies don't we talk about but
there's a lot of tests test pilot stuff
that gets crashed and they rely on
outside testing companies to come in and
fly these aircraft and then some one of
the crazy things I did is I've developed
a lot of products with my product
development company but I've always been
I've always been an avid Mountaineer
rock climber and I've climbed up El Cap
and Half Dome and you know I've traveled
around the United States climbing and
just spent months climbing anyway I
developed these lightweight sleeping
units for sleeping on the side of the
mountain like you know if you ever go to
Yosemite you see guys you know pinned up
on the side of that sheer cliff 2,000
feet up and and sleeping in it and what
it was is coming up with a really
lightweight high-tech structures that
could could easily be unfolded and
working with exotic metals like
aluminum and I've got a patent on this
and sold it to the biggest rock climbing
equipment company in the world and
they've been producing these things I
think they just recently stopped not
making is but i but i had just a little
I've done a lot of different products
and it's just an example of how
lightweight structures I was able to
apply it to a different kind of consumer
product and and then I built similar
versions for Special Forces 44 stretcher
units you know to try to replace the
really heavy stretchers for soldiers
wounded in battle they need to whip out
a stretcher very quickly and get the
people off the battlefield since their
their policy is to leave no one behind
they really have a big problem of
burdening down people with these heavy
stretchers and getting them off of the
battlefield battlefield so which brings
me to mountain bikes so a little bit
closer to electric motorcycles but kind
of give you the full scope of what I've
done with my career as a I started
designing mountain bikes a while ago I
guess 18 years or so ago and I'd work I
do other products at the same time but I
developed a lot of mountain bike
technology because I've always been an
avid motorcyclist I really wanted to
bring full suspension technology to
mountain bikes and like this this
particular bike I designed with Santa
Cruz mountain bikes you know it is one
half dozen national World Cup titles and
it's probably one of the longest-running
full suspension bikes out there in
production it was really a landmark kind
of full suspension bike but we we took a
standard rigid mountain bike frame and
put front suspension on it and rear
suspension and worked out all the pivots
and linkages so that you could pedal it
and you could have an active front and
rear suspension so really provides a lot
more of a fun ride and you can go over
really rough terrain but it was a it was
something that I you know motorcycles
have always really been more dear to my
heart with I've been spending a lot of
time designing mountain bikes and then I
worked with a lot of suspension
designers and shock manufacturers to
come up with different bikes like this
bike was bike of year for 2006 and I've
designed a lot of products really at the
very highest end of the mountain
industry to push the technology this is
a patent I have for a virtual linkage
system meaning that it's got more than
more than the standard three bars or two
bars for the the linkage system it's got
a four bar linkage system which means
that it doesn't always pivot on the same
location that the center of rotation for
the swing arm moves as it goes through
its travel so it's got what's called a
virtual pivot because it moves as it
goes through its stroke but it wasn't
wasn't it was an example of really
thinking out of the box here for this
industry about what we could do with a
different kind of mechanical system to
really give an unexpected result for the
suspension industry and that you know
one made by cover year and the haro
mountain bike still sells a full product
line of bikes based on this suspension
technology and we're still going strong
with that but that was kind of what I
did before and in the last 5 or I guess
six years now I've been developing
electric motorcycles first in my garage
and and then later forming the company
in January 2006 and it was really like I
was talking about it was really my
desire to to combine my research at NASA
with my love of motorcycles and one of
the big questions I had to ask myself
why why electric and this is something
we studied at NASA and really the
electric powertrain really has so many
advantages compared to everything else
hydrogen and turbines and and any other
you know even the hybrid technologies
because the powered wake potentials are
just incredible one of the things that I
found in doing my research 25 years ago
or 20 years ago was that the military
had torpedo motors for you know pushing
torpedoes through the water they have
300 horsepower motors which are about
this big and they're tiny tiny motors
and they were that the military had
already developed electric engines that
were incredibly small and powerful for
pushing pushing weapons through the
water so really was just I was just
waiting for all of the military
technology to come become available to
the private sector so I knew that power
to weight ratio potential was incredible
and was definitely already developed
just needed to get out to the private
sector electric vehicles of course
greenhouse gases are just a fraction of
what you develop with a gasoline engine
I know people say well it you're
generating electricity and in the United
States we have coal-fired power plants
but even a coal-fired power plant in the
United States even given the line losses
of electricity that goes from the
coal-fired power plant to your home
experiences at three percent line loss
plus of all too little transition losses
it's still like seven times more clean
than a burning gasoline an automobile
and it's because burning gasoline in an
engine is just so inefficient it's such
an incredibly inefficient use of that
power only twenty-five percent of it
goes into actually driving the vehicle
forward so much of it just goes into
heating the air and making noise and
going out the tailpipe so electric
drivetrains make so much sense and and
then there's practical considerations
like mechanical reliability my electric
motors have one moving part in them I
mean they're just as very little go
wrong versus a designing a gas motor
with all these Pistons and hot parts
that falling apart and vibrating
themselves to death when you think about
it you know there's there's no way I
could have ever designed a gas engine I
still to this day I could I couldn't
even begin to design all the pieces and
gas engines it's just so incredibly
technical and it's only because it's
been around for a hundred years that
that gas engines are the dominant form
of transportation but if you had to
start from scratch there's no way you
develop a gas engine it's just way too
complicated there's too many moving
parts and too many parts to fatigue and
they're all metal and subject to these
thermal problems and it's just a big
mess but electric motors are a single
moving part the rotor operating within a
magnetic field that doesn't wear out
it's really elegant simplicity that's
the last point about it as electric
motors also have a much broader speed
range and RPM range then then gasoline
engines so there's it's so much more
applicable for vehicles because you can
go from a standstill to top speed and
have constant power all the way through
that range you dislike these motors are
current limit in their first little
initial part of the startup but
after that you've got all of the torque
available basically all the time but
there were a few challenges when I
wanted to develop this and really it was
about battery capacity and battery
safety you know at 10 years ago we just
have lead acid batteries which of course
are just really really heavy compared to
lithium-ion technology that we had now
so those are the challenges and then my
second question I had to ask myself was
why why develop motorcycles why is the
motorcycle the right thing to start off
with alleged vehicles and really the
person alee it was a lot more fun I
think motorcycles just more fun than
cars so there you have it it's quicker
to develop because they're very simple
vehicles with the engine and drivetrain
just developing a car it's just that but
also as a challenge that that I don't
think I could do because there's so many
parts to making a car and making it you
know robust and not squeaky and the
heating and all of the cabin and the
noise quality issues of designing a car
it really is difficult but motorcycles
are much quicker to develop and they
also have lower price points when and
when we we talked about this a lot with
the state government level is that
there's always this with any trend or
electric vehicle change there has to be
a low-cost a gateway kind of device that
really lets these vehicles become
mass-market you know it's like Henry
Ford right i mean there were gas cars
before Ford made Model T but they didn't
really have a lot of sales because there
were just as such an elevated price
point what ford did was bring into
automation bring a Model T down to
everyone's price point everyone could
buy and then cars you just saw them
flourish gas engine cars and that's
really what I wanted to do here is to be
the Ford of electric motorcycles or
electric vehicles to bring an electric
vehicle down to a price point that's
palatable to you know everyday consumers
we have a street bike at ten thousand
dollars in an offer a bike at seventy
five hundred dollars and that's you know
that's a little bit of an elevated price
point compared to their gas counterparts
but it's really not it's really not too
bad the double-edged sword here is that
the low price point also meant that the
you had to watch the cost of goods sold
the cogs of these products really
carefully you had to add to use a lot of
my
experience with mass production and you
as you see and I'd been in the bicycle
industry I've been designing motorcycles
also in the motorcycle industry I've
used a lot of my manufacturing contacts
and manufacturing techniques in order to
bring down the cost so we could we could
develop a product that it's not only the
right price but the right technology and
the right performance combining all
those three things combining them to be
fun this is a picture of my my son and I
just like to show those pictures because
it's it really is the essence of our
company and that's you know having fun
and being virtuous at the same time as
being environmental and having having it
all really having a fun vehicle you know
I'm I like performance vehicles I like
motorcycles you know driving a real
economy car just you know doesn't really
just doesn't really get me excited and
you know riving a like an electric
scooter or a Segway you know it's it's
an interesting product i like the
segways a great example it's a great
product and great technology but you
know going 15 miles an hour on the
sidewalk and getting stopped by little
curbs and stuff like that it's not
something like I really wanted to do
it's not fun and I know from developing
consumer products for all these years is
that you know what when you comes to
selling something and it's something
that needs to be a gateway vehicle to
really change people's minds about
electric vehicle technology it's really
got it you got to combine fun and
styling and and make a great looking
vehicle to get people used to the
technology and to accept it to accept
the new paradigm in spite of the fact
that it's you know that's new and
unknown so I wanted to make something
exciting fun performance great looking
product in order to win people over and
so they change their minds about
electric vehicles and get this get this
electric vehicle revolution going but
there was a battery problem so this is a
lithium-ion cell and this is of course
far better than any lead acid batteries
we had out there but because it has you
know many times more power to weight
density than lead acid batteries but at
the time a few years ago the state of
the art was these lithium-ion cells that
have these welded tab technology and
it's not something that I
a that this is something that I really
considered a problem I still consider
this a problem for all the electric
vehicles out there that have this welded
tap technology it's because you got this
problem with the lithium-ion battery and
you guys are probably a little familiar
with this with a sony laptop problem is
it lithium-ion batteries if you get them
too hot they'll just explode into flame
and yet you have to have this problem of
how do you attach a conductive tab on to
these batteries you know usually you do
it with the resistance welder and you
get the battery hot and that itself
destroys the battery and the more
current you want to carry through this
welded tab the thicker you have to make
it but then the thicker you make the tab
you've got to weld it on with more and
more heat and you can get around it with
some some different ways but I wanted to
come up with a way that we could conduct
a huge amount of current from these
batteries and do so in a way that would
cool the battery at the same time and
that's the that's the essence of our
technology here which is a way to have a
highly conductive current carrier that's
just mechanically fastened to the
battery instead of being welded on there
so we don't destroy the battery in the
welding process and though and allows us
to use a huge huge current carrier so
our battery packs our battery packs can
carry up to 300 amps through them which
is a crazy amount of amperage you know
the frames we weld these frames at 220
amps of current in order to melt them
the metal so you know we have big fat
cables inside of this battery and we're
carrying huge amounts of currents huge
amounts of current through this thing to
get all the performance that we want to
get you know kissed current there's a
lot of very variables an electric motor
but basically you can think about it as
current is equal to twerk an electric
motor and voltage is equal to the RPM so
the more current you have more torque
you have more torque you have the more
acceleration you're going to get on your
vehicle I mean obviously you can you can
trade off to work for rpm by V gearing
it but if you want to have lots of
torque and not have a drivetrain where
you have to gear down you know from a
huge amount of revolutions rpms to very
small amount of our pants which take a
multiple stage gear reduction unit if
you want to do it a single gear
reduction then you're really pinned by
to do lots of having to have a battery
pack that has lots of current output
that's the nucleus of our technology was
this high current conductor but it
really wasn't the only thing that we had
to develop we had to develop we had to
develop a superiority in a lot of
different ways you know we have the
cleanest battery like I said with all
this electric power and current capacity
we also used a landfill approved battery
that's a Canadian made cell that little
cell you saw before that's typically
made with cobalt or the other toxic
metals and we found one that is made in
Canada which is all clean it's a you
know that the metals are bound tightly
with a salt molecules so that it's
actually landfill approved in both the
United States and Canada and I like to
say that you can you can actually eat it
even though I've never ate one but it's
a it's so clean and non-toxic you can
actually eat the battery but we had to
combine that with not only the cleanest
and most powerful battery technology is
really wanted to combine it with the
lightest weight structure and the
lightest overall vehicle weight because
one of the problems with electric
vehicles you know and just to kind of
use the Tesla motorcars and example is
if you just take a car like they're
converting a lotus rolling chassis and
putting electric motor and battery in it
if you convert an electric vehicle or
convert a gas vehicle excuse me to
electric you end up with a vehicle it's
heavier than the gas vehicle because
it's not really designed to be an
electric vehicle it's not designed to
have the power train correctly it's
designed for a lot of vibrational
resistance because their engines always
shaking everything apart in the car so
there's a lot of structural requirements
which are unnecessary and you've also
because the powertrain is so light the
electric powertrain the gas-powered cars
are designed with all this structure for
carrying this heavy gas engine and the
fuel tank in there you really need to
design something from a clean sheet and
that's what what I wanted to do with
custom design thin wall aluminum frames
and this is where i used my techniques
in the mountain bike industry to make
really the lightest weight aluminum
frames and the lightest weight aluminum
components and that puts puts the
vehicle weight in like our off-road
bikes weigh 150 pounds in their
corresponding gas bike weighs about 250
pounds
when it's when it's full of gas so it's
it's a little bit more than half the
weight and this street motorcycle you
see here is 225 pounds and the
corresponding gas motorcycles maybe four
to five hundred pounds so it's a lot
lighter and then that lets us use ass
much smaller battery pack because the
problem here is that the the caught it
for the cost problem that talked about
is that the electric vehicle it has a
very expensive battery pack and if you
want to minimize the amount of battery
pack that you need for the vehicle you
really got to go through the painstaking
process of divining designing all the
components around it custom to be really
light so you can get away with the
smallest battery pack you can possibly
use so you get the most range out of it
the most performance and for motorcycles
there's a safety aspect because
eighty-five percent of injuries are when
the motorcycle falls in your leg and
breaks your leg so it's they're quite
dangerous when they're heavy and this is
being at 225 pounds oh okay I'm sorry
yeah they the motorcycles there when
they're lighter they're a lot easier to
ride to handle better and they're a lot
safer so it's it's a lot of safety
advantages performance advantages and
cost advantages to custom making
lightweight aluminum vehicles which are
ground up kind of projects and that
really gives us the most performance and
like i said i think i think for electric
vehicles there really needs to be this
watershed electric vehicle that just
trounces gas motorcycles or cars that
really has better performance is lighter
and is safer and the the operating costs
of course of electric vehicles is a
fraction that of a gas the gas
counterpart I haven't really put up
there the cheapest because it doesn't
sound good but our electric vehicles are
about penny per mile to operate and
they're just it's almost free you can
ride around most step motorcycle riders
right about 10,000 miles a year so it's
a hundred dollars of electricity for the
all year riding around it's just it's
just free to ride electric vehicles
because it's so efficient that it
converts electric force to propulsive
force you know very very cleanly with 90
plus percent efficiency so it's it's
also the cheapest and making our company
and with a new product that really is
very reliable we don't have the service
burden of changing oil changing fluids
as I wanted to make a different kind of
company and really the last item is
really about customer service and I
think we had an opportunity to to really
work with our customers and provide them
the latest technology and updates for
their motorcycles one of my design
paradigms that I used was that I wanted
to make a modular motorcycle that has a
completely modular engine a modular
battery pack and suspension very easy to
work on to get change the parts and this
is something that the automobile
industry has totally forgotten about and
it's something that I read about with
Honda Honda's first products they
brought to the United States one of the
reasons he was able to make huge inroads
on Detroit was that the early Honda's
were really easy to work on very modular
easy to repair and mechanics loved
working on early Honda's because not
only with a high performance high
technology but he spent the extra time
to make it so you can service the things
and get the things replaced and and when
you're a new brand and you're a new
customer you're buying a new one you
know motorcycle you haven't heard of you
don't want to have to worry about fixing
it you want to have a clear path to
getting a replacement part and putting
it in yourself or having a mechanic do
it and having it just take a few seconds
so you want to have you want to have a
motorcycle that's really upgradable and
it's durable and serviceable and Detroit
unfortunately you know I think we're all
familiar with this is really all about
planned obsolescence about making these
cars that are difficult to work on
difficult to upgrade that will last a
finite amount of time and it's really a
sad state you know I have been in the
aircraft industry I love telling this
story is that you know aircraft industry
is actually the same way I mean we as
engineers we have directives not to make
airframes that last forever like one of
our case studies is the douglas michael
douglas dc-3 remember those old
airplanes and you see him still flying
around africa and that was a company
failure because they made these
airframes that last forever basically
you could fly dc-3 forever hundred years
from now you can put new engines and
that thing and that was a financial
failure because people never had to buy
another
ec3 ever and at that point they started
teaching engineers you had better make
an airframe that has a limited life
cycle a limited life span because we're
never going to sell another airplane
again and it's that philosophy really is
gone over and almost every consumer
product you have nowadays but especially
in the automobile industry absolutely
yeah by technology although you know
he's still yeah right yes absolutely
that's a really good point and what we
what we've done here like I can't walk
away from liquid that we have a modular
battery pack you see the big square
white thing and basically we put all the
electronics in one easy to service box
and when it comes time to upgrade I
really have really really forced our our
frame designed to be around this modular
battery system that also holds all of
the like controller and battery
electronics and so when it comes time
time to upgrade or replace the battery
pack it really is like changing a flat
flashlight battery it's about building
in our components in a modular system so
that the parts that that do become
obsolete like the battery pack like you
said can be upgraded but the things like
the frame you know I mean frame design
and technology really it hasn't had a
lot of shifts and you know how things
are constructed for quite a long time I
mean you have you have subtle
refinements but I mean the the chassis
and the you know all aluminum frame
design and swingarm design and the shock
and suspension I mean it's it's it's
evolved very slowly over the years but
you're right you're not going to you're
not going to see wholesale changes in
the frame i think this this frame i've
tried to incorporate every modern
manufacturing technique and structural
technique and do it I think our
customers will be riding riding this
frame for gosh you know 10 10 years 20
years but you're right it changing the
motor controllers out batteries out is
liebig a big concern of our customers
and it's something I wanted to build in
the motorcycle is to have everything
everything modular so when we do the
instrument cluster it's an instrument
cluster with a big plug on the back side
and you just two bolts you take that
into instrument cluster out and when we
come up with new micro processors to
stick in that thing and give you better
fuel gauge and warning lights and
electronics and rider interface systems
you can just throw that out or recycle
it and we can provide the latest
technology for you speaking of which one
of the things I've been really been
excited with is you know some sort of a
google phone app of just being able to
put using a google phone as a dashboard
where we just stick that in the front
and maybe can make a phone call and get
your maps and where you're going and
also have the your speed readout and
trip distance and things like that
really incorporating the motorcycle be
to work with you know consumer
electronics like like a google phone or
an iphone or something like that really
really where we're we're really doing
this I think in order to get good good
customer service because I think that I
think the problem with all these
electric vehicles are coming out they
really aren't designing to be very
upgradable or very friendly and this is
a big barrier to getting people to adopt
this as this fear of buying it something
that's going to be obsolete so we really
want to work really closely with our
customers to provide great service
upgrade their bikes give them all the up
latest updates whether it's software or
hardware and you know keep their bikes
on the road
yeah I think we're yeah I think we're I
think we're upgrading we're changing our
warranty policy a little bit obviously
we have you know if there's any defects
you know we'll take care of it 100% and
then we have we're working towards a
no-fault warranty I've used this in
industry this is something new I don't
think I don't think we have on the site
but work we're working to it towards a
no-fault warranty policy and that's
where for a little extra money you can
purchase a no-fault warranty and then no
matter what happens to motorcycling you
guys have going motorcycles you notice
these things go down they get crushed
and they fall off the back of your car
and whatever there's all these things
you know they motorcycles that have
things happen to them and the no-fault
warranty has been a really big success
with other companies where no matter
what happens to it if someone runs into
it when the part when it's parked you
know we'll replace it at costs you know
you can get yourself a whole new
motorcycle at two years if you want you
know if you feel like you really want to
create the whole entire thing so I think
we're working on a ten percent increase
in the purchase price so our that's one
of the warranty programs we're going to
have we have our one year or I think we
obviously you have a we have a you know
will forever warranty the motorcycle
against defects that's not a problem and
then as for normal use wear and tear i
believe our warranty right now is one
year all inclusive and then we'll all
the components have their individual
manufacturers warranties which are which
are really good we have had no problems
with our vendors replacing parts and if
they're our vendors have a problem
replacing the fork and like that then we
just use you we suck it up and give
customers new forks and we'll deal with
the vendors so we have a customer
service person at our company and this
is something I really wanted to grow the
company around is where you could call
us up and ask questions about your
motorcycle and get really good answers
from the factory being a motorcycle
customer all these years I'm always
frustrated with my honda kawasaki you
know you the dealers know nothing really
about the technology what's going on and
you can't ever ask them what the right
thing is to do they barely know how to
fix the bikes so it's we've gotten great
feedback from our customers that they
can call our company and get somebody
who assembles these bikes all day
a straight answer and what to do and
then they'll usually send a part out
sender if there's a problem we'll send a
replacement part out even before the
customer sends their their old part back
to get them hot swap off replacement
parts so you know we've been selling our
bikes like on amazon.com and you can
read the feedbacks we've got all five
star feedback and we really try to take
care of our customers because we have a
model that we don't sell through
dealerships because I I tried to sell
these motorcycles through dealerships
and it really wasn't a good customer
service experience the customers really
complained because the dealers really
didn't know the technology and really
had to take it on myself to make a good
customer service department in our
company and we have great local reps
like like George here that'll handle all
technical questions and service aspects
let you demo ride the bikes and really
really help you with the motorcycle and
and then plus work it doesn't hurt that
we're just in Scotts Valley so you can
always come over to the shop and and get
your bike with debt and you know we
really really like to work closely with
our customers especially these early
early adopters to help them work through
any issues and a lot of our customers
like to make modifications and things
like that and you know so we like to we
like to see what our customers are doing
to our motorcycles too so just a little
bit about our products we started with
off-road motorcycles mainly because
really the offer of motorcycle sectors
is something that that needed quiet
operation you guys probably remember
like when I started the business like
the first couple months after I started
selling these motorcycles there was a
couple that that's strung a chain up
across the dirt road in los gatos
because the dirt bikers were coming by
their house every Sunday morning at like
eight and waking him up and they got so
tired they strung a chain across and
that caught the dirt bike rider in game
like 115 stitches across his neck almost
kill the guy and a couple you know got
charged with manslaughter attempted
manslaughter it's just a horrible
situation but it really highlights the
problem with off-road riding and normal
gas motorcycles they're loud and
obnoxious and and I love a loud
obnoxious motorcycle but my neighbor's
hate the motorcycles anyway my kids have
young kids they hate the noisy motors
that
too so even my wife doesn't like that oh
it's a motorcycle so they had to go and
we needed a silent way to enjoy offer
writing something that was also
lightweight that didn't leave a big
footprint so we developed the off-road
products really to service this need for
something quiet you could ride on your
own property or County property or
places that that that really just can't
have the noise because the most people
don't realize that offered writing is
not tech not technically illegal it's
the noise it's what they know what
there's noise ordinances in most Coast
most coastal counties even some of the
inland counties have passed noise
ordinances and really you're violating
noise ordinances when you ride off-road
vehicles and that's what the tickets for
and that's what you can actually get
arrested for yeah yeah this is part of
the problem of gearing down from a high
rpm electric motor to the rear wheel you
need to slow down this this mechanism a
lot and that's why that's why we wanted
to go with low voltage lower turning
lower rpms per volt motors that required
a lot of current and that's why we had
to develop this battery pack it puts out
a lot of current so we can spin our
motors slow enough to drive our vehicle
forward oh yeah that's a good question
these lithium-ion batteries have a very
flat voltage profile so they're not like
lead acid batteries before the olden
days we just get or nickel nickel nicad
batteries which just continually
deteriorate the voltage these these have
initially they have a little voltage
drop but then they have this really wide
stable platform so our motorcycles are
very even powered all the way through
their charge right to the very end where
it just starts dropping off power but
it's just one of the inherent things
about lithium powers is very very nice
and even all the way to the end
it is true i mean but i think that yeah
getting getting a hoppity but even even
less efficient electric motors are still
90 plus percent efficient you know
versus 94 I mean it's it's it's a pretty
it doesn't really affect your range that
much but you're right there is a problem
of dumping off the heat with these
electric motors which is why you know
we're you know we're constantly working
with electric motor manufacturers to get
really good high performance permanent
magnet motors which is what drives these
vehicles because they're very light very
small and can take very high current
there's just an example of how light are
off road frame is it's just the whole
frame is 18 pounds including the rear
shock it's just feather light and this
this frame you see here this is all
hollow aluminum and it's like three
times thicker than a coke can it's
really light and incredibly strong just
it's just feather like 28 pounds for all
that frame in rear shock and someone
asked earlier this is our first about
about the supermoto this is our first
street bike which is a bit of an
off-road / street motorcycle supermoto
as a style of motorcycling which is
popular in France it's called super
motard and it was this racing circuit
where you had to drive on this road
circuit and then do a little bit of dirt
and then do a jump because everybody
loves seeing jumping but I wanted to
develop this because in San Francisco
especially you really need to get your
motorcycle up and down curbs you know if
you want to park it and the one of the
joys about having a motorcycle in the
Bayer is that you can park on the curb
you know park anywhere it's it's just
great you can write it up and you know
I've taken this to the city and ridden
motorcycles around the city so much it's
just so great to park it right in front
of restaurant get it up on a curb and go
up and down stairs if you need to I've
taken our motorcycles into elevators and
up and down stairways and all over the
city we've taken it in the building and
everywhere because it's clean and
there's no flammable liquids in it so
technically you actually you can take it
in a lot of elevators a lot of freight
elevators in there in the city so you
take it inside and supermoto is a great
first product for our company because
it's kind of a new stylish kind of
motorcycle
and I think you guys would really you
know it's it's it's if you haven't
ridden supermoto before it's really fun
because it's a lot of suspension travel
like an off-road bike but you can it's
fully street-legal with street tires you
have an incredible amount of grip you
can go around fast and super moto
motorcycling is not about high speed
it's not like a gsxr1000 where you you
know you're trying to go 200 miles now
or something many like that it's really
about going around traffic riding in an
urban environment where you really are
doing mostly city streets where you're
actually averaging 12 miles per hour but
you want to get stuff like stoplight
really fast you want to get up and down
the curb to park your motorcycle you
might do a little bit of freeway travel
with it you know just zip on the freeway
to go a couple exits but it's really for
the urban commuter and that's what this
product is the first product I wanted to
develop as a supermoto because it's go
anywhere it's made for urban
environments we're also going to have a
hard bags hard luggage for this thing
that's really excited about that so it's
really useful and you can have fun and
it's a penny per mile to operate and
it's a it's just a fun kind of
motorcycling it does yeah this is a has
a 60 mile an hour top speed you can
change it a little bit you can we gear
it for a little more top-end but then
you lose the acceleration the taller you
gear it up and the reason I wanted to do
that is because it doesn't have a
transmission so it's a it's it's a
single front and rear sprocket I wanted
to do that just for simplicity I mean
obviously I could make it this has
enough power to push well past 100 miles
an hour but for one thing is you do go
100 miles an hour the air resistance is
phenomenal and your range is going to be
terrible so it's not the most range
efficient thing to do is be riding in
100 miles an hour and I so I think the
the problem not being able to go really
fast is it's not only when you use it on
a daily basis it really isn't that big
of a deal it's really made for these
little short commutes where you're going
to grocery store going to work going to
get lunch you know if you if you want to
ride for more than an hour in some place
really most people take a car I mean I
read tens of thousands of miles each
year but if I have to go someplace more
than our
a genitive taking my car anyway so it's
a great addition to a car not really to
take the place of cars and replace your
main vehicle and just a picture of the
bare frame the technology here we're
doing is just the all-aluminum frame
structure with a really you know
lightweight components and it's
interesting to this this technology is a
called hydroforming and what it is this
it's the aluminum tube when you put
high-pressure water in it and you put
the tube inside the mold and it expands
out and makes any Italy any shape you
want it's incredible technology they've
used that in the automobile industry for
a while and you see it another the
mountain bike industry and it really is
for some reason the motorcycle and she
has really been slow to adopt this kind
of technology that other industries have
have gone to I think it's because a lot
of the traditional aspect of
motorcycling you know really hasn't
called for this new frame designs and
nobody really wants to push the
technology barrier and frankly the gas
motorcycles really haven't had the need
to be lighter really is just electric
motorcycles that really have this need
for a lightweight motorcycle because you
have a limited amount of power a limited
amount of range and the battery pack you
need to maximize range and range in
performance by getting the weight down
and it also is about of course using the
least amount of raw materials possible
when your your automobile or your
motorcycle you know if you want to be
very green and environmentally conscious
you really want to minimize the raw
material usage in and everything you do
so that's about it and and you have a
George here's our local sales contact
and you know you'd for sure answer more
questions and you know we're going to
want to have some demo rides out after
the talk here so you guys can come out
and ride the bike we got a couple bikes
out in the parking lot then you can talk
to George about you know if you want
more demo rides they want to get your
friends on the bikes you know certainly
certainly you know I can come back and
talk more about any of the technology
aspects i know we just have an hour this
time but you know there's a there's a
really a lot that goes into this mode
cycle that I haven't really talked about
we've got innovative parts and all kinds
of designs for preventing the batteries
for thermal banting of the batteries and
you know kind of advancements of even
even the brake pedal I like to give an
example it's a it's a brake pedal with a
hidden spring inside of it just to make
it neater and cleaner and nicer looking
it's a solid billet aluminum brake pedal
it's the lightest brake pedal in the
market same with the kickstand it's the
lightest kickstand it's a hollow
aluminum kickstand and we made to be
very very lightweight and being very
lightweight you know it doesn't require
a big spring to hold it up so there's a
lot of little little things that you
know I could go on and on about in this
motorcycle but we've got a lot of little
little design improvements a lot of
advancements in the battery technology
and electronics that I think is really
interesting this is a straight this is a
brushed DC motor yeah and we've we've
been experimenting around with some of
the brushless motors because it's a one
of the things people ask about is what
about brushless motors and the brushed
motors unfortunately they've been around
for so long they've really developed
reliably high reliability for brushed
motors they last like seven years in
between brush changes that just last a
long time so we've had really good luck
and we haven't changed over to brush
technologies just because these are so
proven to be a reliable motor so it is a
DC motor controller and then just shoots
straight DC electricity into the brush
DC motor so it's very very simple and
it's also very cost effective because
these kind of motors and controller
setups have been around in golf carts
for decades so it's a very robust very
reliable motor controller we use that
just frankly it's hard to change it
change from it because it is so crazy
reliable it's been in the market for for
15 years it's got a great track record
they have great service and we've tried
lots of brushless motors and they're
very finicky and all kinds of software
problems with getting them working and
liabilities just reliability is terrible
one of the things you don't want to have
happen as a runaway electric vehicle you
know goes to full file but brushless
motors are really finicky about their
software and their how they control
because it's obviously a brushless
motors a all software
controlled speed controlled motor it's
when the software goes down or freezes
it can put you in a dangerous situation
so a brushed motor is a lot more robust
and proven this one at perfect google is
paying for transportation costs yeah
there's an outlet there's a plug right
on the left side of the motorcycle you
just plug it into any wall outlet one of
the great things about electric
motorcycle is you don't need a
specialized charging station it only
takes about 10 amps of current high that
actually it's a little bit more it's
like 15 amps it's a thousand watt
charger at 110 so it's so you know it's
a little bit more but it it's it's
enough it's low enough current so that
you can run lights on the same outlet
and still not cause a circuit breaker to
pop you plug it anywhere at the home or
any just any household outlet will be
fine and that's a big advantage for an
electric vehicle especially a new
electric vehicle where you don't have
charging stations everywhere I just got
back from Paris I did a PR tour in Paris
and the city this they have like twenty
thousand outlets in Paris and they're
planning on putting a lot more in the
next it's pretty amazing you can plug in
your electric vehicle almost at any
street corner in Paris enough it's
amazing Europe is so progressive as far
as electric vehicles go and we're
probably going to sell half of our
motorcycles in Europe because they are
so much more appreciative of clean
technology and of course their their
land that they have in the area that
have is much more limited than the
United States but you know we're excited
to sell for the American market because
people really want these electric
vehicles and they really wanted to work
and you know the sales have been really
fantastic we we had a six-month
backorder list for all of our off-road
products last year and I'm sure we're
going to sell out we've already we've
already worked through a lot of the
sales on this s bike which is we're
going to start shipping this in a few
weeks once we get our certifications and
we've already got a long backorder list
for these bikes so it's it's really
going to be exciting so
one of the tough things with any new
vehicle company is always making money
and with selling out your production is
well actually you know from a business
standpoint it actually it is because I
do have a lot of experience doing mass
production of these kind of products I
mean in the bike industry I've got
probably five or ten percent of the
market the designs that I've made in the
high end of the full suspension market
so I'm used to telling you know tens of
millions of dollars with a product and
and getting it that kind of
manufacturing going so although this is
a very elaborate and high-tech
manufacturing technology it's also very
simple to mass-produce and you know I've
working with the largest fork
manufacturers in the world the largest
rim manufacturers we're already are in
mass production for this thing so it's a
lot different than than buying these
custom cars or something that's a
one-off thing it's we have a lot of
experience at zero sourcing these
components from the biggest
manufacturers in the world and we have
volume production going already so even
though even though this year we have a
limited quantities available lambing
next year plan is the course to to keep
on growing their production units up at
the same time I don't want to over
extend our company and make 10,000 of
these the first year we want to keep the
limited number so we can make sure we
can sell out make sure we keep track of
our customers again this customer
service thing is a big issue with me I
don't want so many customers we can't
answer the phone or I can't answer the
phone personally if someone has a
problem so I think in this first year we
have to really it's not about just
making motorcycles it's about putting in
the whole customer service
infrastructure and making sure all of
our guys can answer all the questions
and then maybe next year make a lot more
motorcycles so we can service all the
people we have all the customers so this
one we made 600 of these and that's
that's for slotted for this year and the
off-road we have I think 400 of the
motorcycles through right around a
thousand is all we're going to sell for
this year
under typical usage about five years
you've gotta you gotta you know it's the
it's hard to exactly calculate because
you know it it depends on how deeply you
discharge it whether you maintain it
properly and how hot the environment is
heat has a tremendous deteriorating
effect to these batteries but we know we
say around five years and and really
though the truth is I think that the
technology is advancing so quickly like
I I talked with a lot of startups here
in the valley and talking with a lot
about battery manufacturers technology
manufacturers and they're coming out
with really much better batteries even
the next year so even though i think
these batteries will last quite a long
time i think we will going to be up will
be upgrading our customers batteries
sooner than their they're done you know
in probably every other year every third
year we'll probably just upgrade
customers batteries because you'll be
able to get longer range and more life
cycle and we'll offer those upgraded
batteries at cost and the cost of these
things is just going down down down
every every year so it's pretty
incredible i I'm not really worried
about giving out free batteries or cost
at cost batteries in a couple of years
now years from now when people need to
have the newest technology in their
motorcycles we'll have a good
relationship with our customers and
provide good customer service that way
right now it's half so that's actually
question right now its lithium-ion it's
just incredibly expensive but like i
said it's it's coming down about twenty
percent a year it didn't come down at
all actually last year because so many
companies got into the electric vehicle
space and car companies wanted to do
electric vehicles and then that lithium
on that lithium ion batteries got in
short supply they got in such short
supply that they actually stopped
innovating the battery industry but one
of the good things about the recession
or maybe the only good thing about the
recession is that it's freed up battery
supply and so we've actually gotten some
big discounts on new batteries plus
there's reason now for the battery
companies to innovate because they want
to have this competitiveness it was a
funny situation it's an interesting
story last year there was actually so
much demand for batteries the factories
were running 364 days
a year flat out and all these companies
in the valley they made these
advancements of lithium-ion batteries
and the manufacturers refused to install
any of them because they could they were
totally over booked for the sales of the
batteries last year's technology they
already had and we had a terrible time
getting any of our manufacturers to put
in place and the new technologies but
that totally changed around 180 degrees
now all of a sudden they don't they
can't sell all the batteries they make
their they need a competitive advantage
versus the next guy because they're not
selling every battery you know 364 days
or the production so we're going to see
a lot of we're finally going to see a
lot of battery technology advancements
and a lot of cost reductions on that on
the packs
yeah I don't think there is a real Lola
my think it's like microprocessors it's
I think it's a you're going to get about
I've made the graph it's about twenty
percent deterioration for capacity
dollars per watt hour if you will of
capacity a 20-percent deterioration and
that in that equation so you can either
get twenty percent more capacity the
same costs next year or you can get it
just the same battery pack next year
twenty percent less but i think that the
technology keeps advancing there's
there's so many different advances are
just around the corner little little
technology increases that give us twenty
percent more capacity or you know a
little bit more power output and or
reduce production and cost I know
probably I know about ten companies in
the valley that have technology that
just needs to be integrated into battery
pack systems and the other thing that
happened with the battery industry in
general is that two years ago a lot of
the venture capital guys got into
investing in battery factory factories
and they're just about to become online
with new factories that that can meet
the demand of the future demand for
electric vehicles and also will have
this newer technology so we've we've
been at this dry spell of supply on
batteries but that's just about the over
because we have we have both new
factories coming online plus a lot of
new technology which is going to drive
prices down and when this is a and this
is a cylindrical battery these I wanted
to use these batteries because it's the
safest by far the safest form factory
it's a steel encased battery and I
wasn't crazy about using like aluminum k
store or even worse those a lithium
polymer batteries which are like a kool
aid pouch battery pack because if you
get a puncture in these batteries that
they will you know a puncture and a
flame they can go up in flames and so I
use a high-pressure steel can sell and
that's been in use in the power tool
industry and it's past all these
regulatory tests for for dropping your
power tools off of a 10-story building
and this is a hot this isn't your normal
battery pack that's in the hand drill
but it's in that commercial products
extremely high power extremely vibration
resistant shock resistant impact
resistant and that's that's the
technology we prefer to steal a case
cell
of course very clean so prismatic sigh
think have their place and I think too
it's an exciting thing to think about
it's just there's that there is the
safety issue of the larger form factors
as far as heat dissipating heat and
impact we just sold some bikes to the US
military and we have to we have to take
rounds from hypersonic bullets through
this thing so crazy you know but that's
it's really an interesting story the the
guys in Afghanistan the real problem
with their elec ATVs and gas motorcycles
is not that they need to silent
motorcycle I would really flabbergasted
what the problem is is these gas
motorcycles they they put them on the
outside of their personnel carriers in
the snipers that's the first thing issue
is the gas can out of it and they're
just tired of having these flaming
things outside the vehicle because you
know that they absolutely don't want to
put them inside because obviously you
get a round inside the vehicle and
exploding gas can you just killed
everybody inside the vehicle so they're
certainly not going to put these things
on the inside they want on the outside
and when they're outside and the extra
gas cans they just get shot up
immediately and the things a big mess so
they're really excited about this thing
that there's nothing that blow up and
and it's kind of sniper proof okay oh no
it won't work but they just don't want a
flaming mess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
