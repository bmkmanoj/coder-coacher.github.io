coming out
so I thought I'd start by saying a few
words about what this talk will be about
be cute when I wrote the title and I
realized that it might have been at the
expense of clarity so hopefully once you
hear what I'm actually going to talk
about you'll still stay so the idea here
is that technologies are don't exist in
a vacuum they're embedded in social
processes and social institutions and so
as much as we'd like to think that we
can create tools and let them out in the
wild and they'll have very specific
effects that's usually not what happens
and historical studies of technologies
tell us this for lots of technologies
from the past so as a sociologist I'm
interested in the various social
processes that influence and the various
social factors that influence how
technologies get used and how they
diffuse and then in particular as a
sociologist I'm also interested like
many other sociologists in how resources
might be differentially distributed
among the population so there's that
aspect that also goes into my work so
I'll start by giving you a little bit of
background on a few pointers and then
I'll show you all sorts of empirical
data to back up my claims mainly
focusing on three studies that I've done
so I'm sure a lot of you have heard of
the term the digital divide very
basically understood as this binary
concept of people either have access to
technology or not and very much
understood is this good or bad so once
once you're on one it's great you've
crossed the divide well basically my
work what I've argued is that that's a
very simplistic approach because even
once people do go online significant
differences might remain as to how they
actually use technologies of what they
can get out of their uses and so this is
what I've called the second level
digital divide in my work and mostly I
focused on skill so how will people
skills different using the medium so
next I'll give you the overall
conceptual framework that informs my
work and then I'll talk a little bit
about the challenges of data in this
realm and then I'll talk about the
actual data that I have okay so the idea
is that we have users right now users
have certain backgrounds they bring
certain things with them they exist in a
in society they take on certain
positions this means they have a certain
socio-economic background they have
other attributes right and all these
then will affect not only how they use
the medium but also the context in which
they use media and so it's best to think
of this context as two types one is the
technical context and then the other is
the social context and the technical
context is fairly obvious right what
kind of quality machines do you have
connection kind of software do you have
etc and then the social context is
equally important in that who you know
who's around you what types of people
you know who can you learn from who is
advising you can you turn to when you
run into a problem who do you have to
share your your gadgets with those might
also influence how you're able to use
the medium then the next step in this
process is how all this relates to skill
so the idea is that all these factors
have mentioned so far will influence
users skill and so users will differ in
their level of ability to make use of
technologies and the next and this is
probably the most relevant here is I
argue that all those factors including
skill that influence what people
actually do online so it's not simply
whether someone might have interest in
something or it's certainly not just
random that someone will go to go to a
certain website or sign up for something
but these various social factors
actually influence the types of uses to
which people put the medium so I think
that's where you guys probably have the
most interest now as a sociologist I
have one more step in this process
that's a really big interest to me
that's sort of the million-dollar
question that's really hard to get an
answer to and takes quite a while and
that is does all this then feed back
into people's actual position in society
so does your scale and in particular the
way you use the medium then influence
your position does it influence your
socioeconomic status does it influence
your general well-being are you getting
something out of it that actually
improves your life and if yes does that
depend on all those other factors okay
so I thought I'd take a moment to see a
few words about what I think of when I
say Internet skill because that's not
necessarily obvious and I'm certainly
open to people adding things to this
list so one is knowledge of netiquette
and just simply how to use communication
media when you're actually communicating
with other people simple example would
be use of BCC in certain situations then
there's this idea of knowing how to
contribute so whether that's
contributing to online conversations or
actually posting material content online
knowing about various tools that help
you create things or post things or
share things then there's idea of
knowing what's even available online now
this is one of those factors that I
would never have
actually thought of until I started
conducting interviews with people and
talking to people about their uses and
realize that whereas I think all of us
in this room when we think of a question
we sort of assume oh there must be an
answer to it somewhere online maybe we
won't be able to find it but it must be
out there somewhere whereas it's really
fascinating to see that lots of people
just don't even realize what's available
and if you don't even realize it's
available then you're never going to
look for it let's say you do realize
it's available so then the question is
can you actually find it and then how
efficiently can you find it so are you
going to take five seconds are you going
to take 15 minutes and then a few other
factors there's the issue of credibility
and being able to assess whether
sorcerer message credibility and then
there are privacy and security concerns
as well that are related to skills so
this is my list of skills most of my
work so far has focused on those three
of knowing what's available online being
able to find it and being efficient in
doing so but I'm expanding my work to
include all the other factors okay so to
recap the questions that guide my work
and that I'm going to try to them the
answer to some extent today so are there
differences in skill among Internet
users if yes what explains these
differences how might skills skill
differences influence what people
actually do our line does I to use vary
by type of person and then the question
that I don't really necessarily have an
answer to what we can certainly start
imagining what the answer will be is how
does all this influence people's life
chances okay so as I said a word about
data concerning people's internet uses
when it's not about logs right so this
is what I have in the title which is
beyond gigs of log data and the idea is
that while we can get all sorts of
information from the logs of what users
actually do there's lots of information
that's not in those logs and that's
usually the type of information that's
actually of interest to me I mean logs
are interesting too in and of themselves
for sure but I haven't
just and lots of things that just simply
don't come through something like log
data and unfortunately it's been pretty
hard doing research in this realm as a
social scientist because they really are
not many data sets available and
certainly not rigorous data sets so
partly there's just little out there
what is out there is very basic so if
you're lucky to find a social science
data set that actually has any internet
questions usually all it has is whether
someone is an Internet user maybe how
much they use the internet almost never
what they actually do online and
certainly very very few nuances also
data sets are rarely comparable so
there's not one universal way of asking
these things they're fairly new and so
you might have a data set here data set
here but they asked very differently
about even very basic things so you
can't really merge the two data sets in
compare there's also this issue of lack
of universal and established terms and
ways of asking about things so even
something as simple or seemingly simple
as how frequently are people online
that's in no way a simple question when
it comes to survey research and then
finally the the that everything online
is a moving target fairly obvious but I
mean you know let's say we're interested
in studying use of social networking
sites well if you want to do that for
years ago first of all users don't think
of these as social networking sites so
that's not really a term you can use on
a survey if you mentioned an example
well something might have been popular
three years ago today no one's using it
how's that than comparable over time so
those are some of the challenges the
most rigorous data set in some sense and
certainly for the US is general
population is the current population
surveys computer use an internet
supplement which was administered by the
Census Bureau and the bureau of labor
statistics but they actually stopped
doing that in 2003 so since then we have
no data certainly from that large entity
that collects extremely high level data
about people's internet uses so people
either collect their own data or have to
rely on marketing surveys that don't I
mean they're hard to get but even if you
get them they usually don't have the
kind of correlates that
really of interest to social scientists
so those are the challenges and this
basically explains why I've actually
collected my own data for studying all
the various questions that are of
interest to me because they're pretty
much no surveys out there that ask about
skill in a way that would be helpful to
for my needs okay so as i said i'll i'll
talk about three studies here and
gradually answer the various questions
that have suggested are of interest so
one question and this relates most
closely to the user experience folks
here has to do with how average users
find information on the web and i did
the first part of this research five
years ago and then followed up this past
spring this was done in new jersey in
our county mercer county which includes
trenton in 0102 and then IV visited I
went back to New Jersey this past spring
and we interviewed as many people as I
could find from the sample I'm not going
to get into too much detail about the
methodology here but feel free to ask if
something's if you really want to know
something that you think would be
important to understanding the findings
but basically what i did was i used the
fairly traditional sampling methods for
trying to get a random sample bought a
residential list and then started
sending letters and calling people to
request their participation once they
came into the university lab i had them
fill out a couple of surveys for
baseline information and then i also had
them sit in a machine and look for
various types of content now the goal
here was not for them to look for trivia
information little factoids rather i
wanted them to look for things that they
might actually look for in their
everyday lives and that might be
relevant to their everyday lives so
those little things that were flashing
on the screen are the types of
information people were asked to look
for they had unlimited amounts of time
to do this and there were also no
restrictions in terms of what platform
they use they could either use a pc or
mac they could use whatever browser
they're used to using so a third of the
sample actually ended up using AOL
because that's what they use
and there was no default homepage so it
was completely up to them to replicate
as much as possible what they usually do
and so the outcome of this was being
able to develop actual measures of
people's skills understood as efficiency
in finding information and then from
that deriving survey instruments that
actually work well as proxies for actual
skill now traditionally there's there is
definitely literature that looks at
people's computer skills and Internet
skills but these are what we can call
self-perceived skills meaning people are
just asked what they think their skill
is now I have a paper that looks that
shows that based on data from the same
project that there's a very strong
gender effect with that question so
despite having equal level equal levels
of actual skill women tend to
underestimate their skills or men
overestimate the point is that there is
a statistically significant difference
that's completely accounted for by
gender only so it's very tricky to rely
on those self perceive measures if we if
we want to know about actual skills so
that's why it was important to develop
some instruments that are better proxies
than the traditional ones used okay so a
little bit of data about a little bit of
what I found some of the findings so I'm
reporting on eight tasks that these
people did and this is a cumulative
distribution function of how long they
took and this includes this graph
includes both people who gave up and
people who are successful but it's
that's all randomly distributed actually
along the graph so you can see from here
that some people were done with eight
tasks within six minutes but others took
over 45 and so this we can consider a
basic measure of skill that yes there is
actually divergence right because some
people are done very quickly while
others take significantly longer so then
let's see what might predict skills how
can we explain different rates of
success the task that was hardest for
the sample called for finding a third
party website that compared different
presidential candidates views on
portion and so the study was right after
the two thousand election so the
relevant thing was here here was
comparing bush and gore and their
thoughts on abortion there were several
websites out there that addressed this
question but even given unlimited
amounts of time forty-three percent of
the sample couldn't do this at all they
just couldn't find such a website so
then I thought okay well how could we
explain the difference well first again
people took varying amounts of time
considerable difference in how long they
spent on this task and then what I did
was using regression analysis legit
regression just looking at the outcome
of success versus failure with this task
and looking at the effects of all sorts
of variables right age gender time
online etc what I found was what made a
difference in successfully completing
this task was whether a person used what
i call a refined search query i'll tell
you what that is because i think people
here think about that term differently
so basically did the person type in a
search query that included information
both about the political side of this
question and the fact that it was a bad
abortion right so then i created a dummy
variable where that i put that in the
model that if you typed in that kind of
a refined query then you got it one and
it turns out that basically predicts
whether you're able to do this or not so
if not surprisingly if you just type in
abortion you're not really going to find
that type of a website but a lot of
people did that I'm interestingly before
I put this variable in age is what
predicts completion but then once you
can once you you add this variable the
effect of age goes away which suggests
that older people are probably less
likely to know this part of we find
their their queries but it's helpful
because people tend to think that older
people are less skillful online but we
don't really know why per se a lot of
the comments I get is that their motor
skills are different but motor skills
don't really account for the kind of
differences that we find in this kind of
a study so i thought i'd show you some
of the hurdles that people run into now
these are things you can certainly know
from logs as well but I
just thought they would be interesting
these are all actual examples from
studies so people will search without
using spaces when asked when they why
they do that oh well we don't use spaces
and email addresses or web addresses
either this is the kind of thing that
you don't know from the log right you
know from the log that they didn't you
don't know why they did it another
common mistake is people writing in URLs
with spaces in them and browser still
don't deal with this too well just that
I think this is my favorite here and
it's just interesting that they have
this concept that there's the dot-com
somewhere at the end but they don't
really get what's going on and so you
could say here okay well this was in
2001-2002 well by time they must have
gotten better and this was probably why
I went back to we interview the people
because I wanted to see whether they had
so in this last spring I reabsorbed 44
of the people and again by definition
these are people who've been online for
over five years right because the
initial users in my study the initial
people in my study were already users
that and so here are just a couple of
examples of what people did this spring
again people who've been users for over
five years here's an AOL user
interestingly even though a relevant
response was actually here on the screen
she didn't find that so she got sort of
confused by the camp find website error
then here's another example where the
person trying to get guest things but
runs into complete error and again this
is for people who've been users for many
many years generally I've found in the
analyses of the data that how many years
you've been a user doesn't really matter
it's how frequently you're actually
online that matters okay so spelling
mistakes again this is something you
could certainly know from logs so why
don't people notice them well one reason
is that they still get results even if
they have a mistake now granted the
results are fewer but they don't really
realize that the unfortunate part is
that websites that have the spelling
mistakes probably aren't the most
reliable sources so it's a problem for
these people to be pursuing those
responses now also is there anything
more about
spelling mistakes that could be relevant
in any way well for example there are
people who list items on ebay with
spelling mistakes right those items are
going to be found by fewer people
because they have those mistakes which
means if you listed something with a
spelling error you have less of a chance
of selling it and certainly of having
higher bids on it so here we have lots
of items that misspelled this word so if
if you make spelling errors or typos
that's going to be a problem now if
you're really on top of things you know
about this website that lets you not
have to sit around guessing what
mistakes people might have made you can
actually type in the correct spelling
and it will tell you how people have
misspelled things so there's the one
that we saw before but it'll give you
all sorts of other ways that equipment
can be spelled because look at all these
many ways that it could possibly be
spelled so you could still say okay well
who cares so people make spelling
mistakes some people make them some
people don't well it turns out that it's
not randomly distributed who makes a
spelling mistake and who doesn't so if
it's not randomly distributed then some
people are being disadvantaged by these
mistakes more than others and so from
using data from this study I was able to
look at what actually predicts making a
type or a spelling mistake and it turns
out that so the higher your education
the last likely you are to make these
mistakes the more experience you have
the less likely you are to make mistakes
but again the point is that it's not
randomly distributed so certain types of
people are being disadvantaged by this
more than others okay so more generally
speaking findings from the study showed
that by far the most salient finding is
that younger people are better at
finding things and are quicker so more
efficient there's also a relationship of
Education to scale and then experience
an autonomy and autonomy here meant
having different locations where you can
access the internet so these findings
suggest that there are potentially
concerns about digital inequality social
inequality because if people were better
educated are getting more out of it than
there there might be reaping the
benefits more than those who are in less
privileged positions
I wanted to say a few words about the
social support variable it's very hard
to get at quantitatively so here I turn
to some of the qualitative data from the
study some of the interviews to show how
much people's social surroundings do
matter in how people are able to do
things or find things or take advantage
of the internet and they're mainly two
ways one is if you just have people
around you who know things you hear
things from them informally they give
you advice you pick up on stuff and then
the others if you run into a problem you
can turn to someone who can help you my
favorite is the one in the middle where
this woman you about Google but didn't
use it throughout the entire study and
then she says how if she needed it in
the future well anyway she'll just call
/ her son who's in another state I
college to help her look stuff up and
tell her what the what the results are
so that's pretty interesting I thought
then there are also limits that are
imposed on someone due to the social
context and this has to do with having
to share the media at home with others
in your household or having others to
take care of who simply take up your
time so here's a stay-at-home mom with
kids and doesn't really have time to use
the internet and this is an interesting
case of the mother simply not being able
to get to the machine because her
daughter's always on it so that limits
her ability to really develop her own
skills ok so now on to a next study so
given that the most salient finding was
age I wanted to look at whether we could
find skill differences in the nationally
representative sample of young users so
what I did was I had some left over
funding and so I did a survey not a huge
end this is basically what $20,000 will
buy you the response rates not not as
high as would be ideal but again it's a
unique data set that has information on
digital literacy and refined measures of
types of uses and both of those are
pretty rare so this is the
a skill measure that I serve a measure
of skill that I developed and used here
it's much less influenced by those
gender factors that I talked about so it
works better than simply asking people
about their skills it seems that rating
your level of understanding of certain
items doesn't quite have the same
relationship to simply how you perceive
your skills otherwise more generally
speaking these seem to work better so
basically taking that as the outcome
variable what predicts higher level of
understanding of those internet related
terms which in the previous study seem
to be a good proxy of actual skill what
I found here was that education is
positively related to skill yet again
however once we control for autonomy of
use and experience the effective
education actually goes away so this
lets us see what's going on in terms of
why is it that the more educated or
better skilled we're really it's because
they have they have they tend to have
access at home and tend to have time to
use the medium more then another measure
I was interested in is diverse types of
uses understood as just what are the
types of things you do online it's a
it's a summary variable summary measure
of all sorts of things you do online and
the idea behind that is the more things
you do the more ways in which you might
be able to benefit that's one thought
and here that's also positively related
both to education and skills so the
higher education but better your skill
the more things you're doing online so
again the idea is if you're already in a
more privileged position you are
probably benefiting from the media more
than others okay I'm now moving on to
the third study that I wanted to talk
about here the interest was okay let's
look at a completely wired population
and so this is a study on college
students but it's it's a
it's a very diverse group of college
students so I'm not serving northwestern
which is where I'm on the faculty
because that's not your average
population instead I'm doing this study
at the University of illinois-chicago
which is a which has an extremely
diverse student body is one of the most
highly diverse in terms of ethnic
diversity colleges in the US their
significant number of students who come
from families were there the first in
college and their family also lots of
immigrants etc so it's a very diverse
sample which is of interest i
administered this survey last year so
less than a year ago and there's one
required class on campus and that's
where we administered the survey on the
point here is that there's no selection
bias as to who's taking that course and
then no selection bias as to who's
taking the survey so we're really
getting a representative sample of the
the college campus and we have a very
high response rate in this call in this
case this is the study that thanks to
graham from macarthur and from NSF as
well we're continuing this year so
actually starting this coming Monday
we're going back to UIC and we're going
to administer the survey again and it
should be really interesting to see how
some of these things turn out over time
okay so to recap what are the questions
of interest in this case well they're
similar to the questions that we've been
looking at so far what is it that
students do online are their skill
differences among them what social
factors might influence their skills and
types of uses and then the final one is
not what I will talk about today but
that's what this grant is from for for
MacArthur it's can we improve students
skills we're going to do a random
assignment training intervention to see
whether we can improve students skills
over time okay so this is definitely the
wired generation there's no question
about it they've been online for many
years lots of hours on the web per week
those are only web hours so they don't
include hour spent on email and chat
they go online several times a day
several locations not surprising okay
the majority have cell phones again not
what do they do with their cell phones
they do all sorts of things although
interestingly I fairly low number for
now are going on the web and using cell
phones for email but again it'll be
interesting to see this year's cohort
and how they compare okay in terms of
gadget ownership again there they're
very well equipped to be to be playing
with media and using media most of them
have either desktop or laptop computer
so the idea here again is to control for
access as much as possible and look at a
population that really does have access
any is online often and what can we tell
about differences in their uses multi
tasking generation they're doing lots of
things while they're online this is
important to note for people who are
looking at different media uses and
thinking about how internet use might
displace up other media uses because it
might not be displacing other media uses
given that they might just be
multitasking okay so I was interested
first it looking at email use there have
been some reports some people are
starting to talk about how this
generation doesn't use email that much
anymore and I was somewhat skeptical
given that I am a college professor and
I know that my students don't use email
um so I thought I'd test that here it
turns out on average students use two
email accounts the majority of them do
use their campus accounts that would be
of interest to administrators who tried
to communicate with them and then
otherwise this is the breakdown of what
what emails accounts they use in terms
of the other free services out there so
I thought you might be interested in
okay so seven percent I thought this was
interesting that seven percent only used
their you I see you've all account i
found that surprising because you think
in this day and age they would just open
a free account somewhere given that
that's going to have limited utility
over time
okay so I thought maybe you'd be curious
to see if I can find anything out about
is our gmail users different in any way
from the other users and so I did find a
few things one is gmail is so you're
more likely to be a gmail user if you're
a man versus a woman in this sample a
finding that is not true for any of the
other services so all of the other
services are equally distributed by
gender and then I thought whom what else
could we look at well it turns out that
if your computer science major you're
much more likely to be a gmail user than
if you're someone else and then I
thought who doesn't this sort of sound
like the people who work at Google so
anyway again none of that actually is
true for any of the other email
providers so there's no major no field
of study difference for any of the other
ones now one thing that might be going
on here is that I also looked at so i
have a question on the survey about do
you use only one search engine or more
and about forty-five percent of the
students only is one search engine and
eighty-five percent of those use google
only and then I looked and those are
most so they tend to be men and
computers and so more likely to be
computer science major or that's not the
right way to put it so if you're a
computer science major you're more
likely to fall into that category so
maybe it's just that through knowing
about Google that's how information
about gmail spread much what it is but I
thought it was interesting to note that
it's not it's not random event that
someone uses gmail it turns out for now
it isn't anyway okay so
then I was interested in skill as usual
their various measures on the survey for
skill this time I'm not presenting the
ones about reading your understanding of
different terms although the findings
for those are the same as here I had
various questions scattered around the
survey that can be understood as
measures of skill they're not
necessarily asking whether you
understand something so for example the
first item the question actually asked
do you use an aggregator or feed reader
and the answer options were yes no I
don't know what it means to use an
aggregate or feed readers so even in
that context which is actually would
suggest a lower rate of people saying
don't know because they could have just
said no sort of in Norma they actually
know what it is forty-one percent said
they don't know what it is and again
think about how this is a fully wired
young mostly 18 year old college
population I that figure about not
knowing what an aggregator feed reader
is by the way is consistent with the
level of understanding of RSS which was
on that one to five scale where
eighty-five percent said they have
absolutely no understanding of what RSS
is so I think it's a good reality check
for those of us who live our lives you
know think about web 20 and all these
new things and I'll have some more data
on on the reality check by the way but
anyway again this is a young population
if anyone's going to be using these
things as they it's them if anyone's
going to know what these things are it's
them and they don't only about a fifth
actually knew what all of the above is
right so the majority don't know at
least part of this so then I was
interested well ok so what predicts
knowing this stuff and being more
knowledgeable about various internet
services and terms and so the the
findings I report here are based just on
bivariate stats but several of the
factors hold up even a multiple
regression so basically these these are
the groups that are statistically
significantly that have a lower level of
understanding of those items on the
previous page of the
statistically significant levels so
women understand those various items
let's the men people who who have
parents with lower levels of education
understand things less people who don't
have a computer understand things less
again there are these factors of so
different positions in society and how
does that transfer to your knowledge
then I was interested in what people do
online and so this is a list of
activities this was measured on it was a
spectrum with several times a day daily
weekly monthly let's the monthly how
often do you do it and so this is
aggregation of people who do these
activities either daily or weekly and
there tend to be both for school work
purposes and and entertainment it's
equally there I think some of the things
probably again it's hard to measure so
for example very few say that they visit
dating or matchmaking sites I suspect
what's going on is that they're doing
those kinds of things on say social
networking sites and they don't think of
those as dating and matchmaking sites so
that's just another example of how it is
hard to study and measure some of these
things depending on the population
you're studying so again I was
interested in whether users background
relates in any way to these activities
and so again i created a summary
statistic and of course one could
disagree eight a look at specific
activities etc but again similarly a lot
of those groups that highlighted before
they tend to do fewer of those
activities on the previous page
regularly and the variable of interest
skill is also related to activities
again so if you know less you're doing
less so finally I just thought I'd put
up this this slide because it's
interesting and I think sometimes
surprising I mean it depends on how much
you're in touch with reality frankly but
so these are data again from about 11
months ago and I'm sure some of these
figures will have changed and some of
them I'm sure have not changed and I
will be very curious to see what figures
we find this year when we redo the
survey starting next week but so they
is figures for people who use use it
sometimes or often so I anticipate
seeing a changes in the numbers for
YouTube possibly for facebook not much
else ok so just briefly what's the
puzzle in all of this for Google in
particular well doubtedly google has
some wonderful products that I'd be the
first to admit some of them are awesome
of all those many products it has
released they're basically two that have
gotten significant market share right
we've looked at the gmail numbers not
really sure you can say that some of
these are fairly recent entrance and
things might change but so far there
isn't necessarily evidence of that based
on even the little data we've looked at
so far it's not surprising some of this
might be happening we know that women
tend to be more likely to I think there
are data that show that they're more
likely to use chat and the communication
types of media but if there are less
likely to be gmail users then you know
that's not surprising that they might be
less likely to that say Google Talk
isn't taking off that much for example
so so I think there is that puzzle and
seeing what types of people atop what
types of products could be interesting
and what needs to go beyond ones user
base to figure that out ok so a few
concluding remarks hopefully I've showed
you convincingly that people's
background does actually influence their
types of uses and their skills and
skills influence types of uses as well
and all this might result in
differential opportunities and then
finally understanding a tools diffusion
has to be based on more than looking at
the use the existing users of those
tools and understanding what social
context what is the social context in
which people use the internet to
understand better why they're doing some
things and why they're not doing some
other things so that's it copies of my
papers media coverage etc
my website thank you my people skills do
you mean my policies
what techniques that the most effective
in
okay so the question is given that
skills matter what are the techniques
that might help people improve their
skills I'm repeating their questions so
others will know yes well that's a very
good question and that is something I'm
working on for this training
intervention right so the idea is come
up with training that where we can try
to improve people's skills well I think
some of the findings suggest that even
very basic things make a difference so
again this is something I think you
could know from logs that even the this
basic idea of having refined queries a
lot of people don't understand I think
also explaining certain tools that I
don't think it explained very clearly
would help it's not clear what would be
the best method to do so right so
obviously every web sort most websites
have a help page about page clearly
users don't look at those I think more
user studies are necessary I think there
are a lot of things you can't figure out
until you do user studies with the
average user and not with your friends
for example in though in I've been
pre-testing so we're going to do
observations on the students after we
survey them this year and I've been
pre-testing that some of the tasks that
we want to give them and one of them
involves looking up the location of
something and the people who ended up
going going on google maps it was really
fascinating to to recognize some of the
limitations in google maps in terms of
usability that you only see when when
you when you test with with average
users but also things like RSS i mean
i'm not convinced it would necessarily
be that helpful actually to everybody
which is why i suspect it hasn't taken
off but i don't think they're explained
in a way that's relevant to people's
lives they expand their they tend to be
explained in how they're relevant to a
techies life or journalists lives
because those are the people write about
this stuff but yeah me I don't know
there's a silver bullet solution per se
I think it's a myriad of things
part of it does require some time
investment on the user's behalf right
and that's tricky Lily so first question
was was when I'd weather like the number
by my quality of ties people have
predict their skill just cuz I'm
thinking about when I was in high school
and had friends who play like networked
computer games they're all guys would be
like no it's a guy thing it's like I
really didn't have access to that
Network and like could I take that first
I'll take that first so the question is
whether people's quality and types of
ties or size of networks or something
ISM basically whether qualities of one's
networks predict people skills or what
they can learn the hypothesis is
definitely that yes they do and this is
what I was referring to as being
extremely difficult to measure now
there's a whole other method out their
social network analysis that one can use
to to study these sorts of questions
it's it's a pretty elaborate method
that's pretty expensive to latch on to
other existing survey methods if you
already have a big study so that that's
one challenge there and I think you had
if you had a focus study that really
just was only looking at social ties you
could try to get some of this it's still
hard certainly on surveys it's extremely
difficult I've been working on this for
years initially I asked people the
number of types of people they could
turn to for advice and that didn't seem
to work as a variable then I proceeded
to asking people whether there was an
especially knowledgeable person in their
network and who was that person and that
doesn't seem to tell us much so so far I
have haven't really made the kind of
progress on this as I would like it's a
difficult question but I think you're
definitely right that you're referring
to people hang out with people who are
like them and like to communicate with
people who are like them and here if you
have a woman in a group of men that it
would be difficult for that woman
possibly to get information share
another question right so the question
is do I have any findings about this
issue of whether access or types of uses
improve people's life chances so that's
a really difficult question that
requires really rigorous investigation
requires launch to nor work right
because you need to control for a whole
bunch of things you need to have
baseline measures or where people are at
and then see where they will be at at a
second point in time and how does all
this work in so that's a very complex
study I'm working towards that with my
current study I mean my my hunch is that
yes definitely based on the findings we
have so far which is that we're
certainly finding positive relationship
of education and some of these other
things to how you're using the medium
but I think this is something we have to
continue to work on saw some other hands
okay from the servants you've done
skills such that someone trying to
develop the pool they have the log data
and so kind of see how their users fail
to do things so you kind of marginal
user like the person who actually tried
something and it succeed so it would be
possible to extend usability down from
the person who almost gets it or is
there a sort of Leon broader you know
step so like you can't kind of do a
refined sir hmm okay so the question is
whether i find it to be a spectrum of
skills that cracked so this sort of a
continuum that's fairly equally
distributed or whether they're discrete
jumps i think looking at the data the so
for example the at least the skill
measures of the level of understanding
types of items of which i have over 30
on this survey so it's even more refined
it's a normal distribution so I mean it
seems like it's pretty much spread out
it's not like you have a few people know
nothing and then or a half don't know
anything in the half know everything no
it's it's it's it seems to be pretty
much a continuum you
so that is hard to gather the sort of
reverse social science data sets I know
that it is in other fields there are
existing data sets that are you know
being kept secret like there is the
young green violet this like the Navy
and so here there were things like a ll
the watchers are very then leaked them
they they actually handed them over to
researcher yes all right well so your
surgeries to where you know I'm very
supposed to be private and what you know
as all the service companies have big
database Moloch worries but if you went
nasty hey can I see like
especially after they all case right so
gilded getting access to that data would
be meaningful help with the AOL theta
much more useful than you know the
surveys that you okay so the question is
whether getting access to some of the
proprietary data that exists would be
helpful for research for example Jake
mentioned the AOL log data that were
released to some researchers that were
then released completely publicly which
then had repercussions lots of privacy
concerns etc and so whether if I had
access to logs like that which I do I
mean I you know I could get those a all
data and I did um would that be more
helpful than data that I have through my
surveys now the answer so this goes back
to the title of the talk which is beyond
gigs of log data which is that there are
definitely limitations to log data so
some things it's really helpful for
which people at this company and others
certainly know and in that sense it's
very painful for me to collect even data
from a hundred people and their little
logs that I then go on coding when I
know that you know within a minute you
collect about you know a hundred
thousand times as much and that's that's
pretty painful that said as I said those
log data lack all sorts of covariates
that don't that don't exist in log data
that I would have in studies of the sort
that I'm able to look at in conjunction
with looking at the logs so I guess the
answer is for certain research questions
having those log data are extremely
helpful so for example I wouldn't have
to guess well how many people make typos
or how many people use refined queries
because you have the data right there so
that would be helpful and it would be
really lovely for me to see more
publications off of those data because
then I could cite them and refer it to
them but otherwise I think there is
definitely a need for these types of
data another reason is that log data are
always by definition well unless you got
it from say an isp as opposed to a
company like
but if it's from a company then by
definition those are only log data of
that particular company services and
again that's going to be that's going to
have limited utility if you want to join
eyes to the average internet user there
was a question back there and I've seen
some question is that in the gradual
questions do early ancestors were not
with answer and such as in two ways in
which you can
questions will make them more
mm-hmm okay so the question is that
there are other ways of measuring skills
for example you can present people with
scenarios where you ask them what was
the example it was ok so for example can
you tell how can you tell the web page
is secure do you know if these were open
ended or they were multiple choice ok so
the end I would say the open-ended ones
have more utility once it's multiple
choice it's easier for the programming
for one thing just by random just
randomly you would have a certain
percent who would get it right the
problem with open-ended questions is
that they're obviously extremely
expensive to to code and deal with and
incorporate into the data set so we try
to limit open-ended questions because
they're so expensive it's a good idea
we're definitely still working on asking
about skill in different ways we have a
few new questions that's going in the
field next week if open-ended wasn't as
expensive i would love to use it more
but it's just it's almost prohibitive
you can question is can you have access
to the questionnaires I've used you
could certainly email me and I'm happy
to share material there's also some of
it has been published and the the items
are on there you had a question everyone
asking you will respondents permission
to access this or networking dinner
ticket for school
the question is how I asked my
respondents to access their social
networking data to get at some of the
questions my question for you is what do
you mean by their social networking data
so you're asking specifically their
blogs or the information account
information about specific services they
actually use that's what you're asking
about oh I see so the permission to ask
facebook yeah for their friends networks
I'm sorry what did you say I was asking
whether what he meant was specifically
whether he was asking for the graph of
the Friends Network okay so specifically
for example the graph of the friends
networks okay well I haven't thought of
that I can think of a few issues with
that I mean it's an interesting idea
it's not clear it would certainly tell
us a few things but again it limits
usage to one site I suspect few would
say yes but you could always try me it's
worth trying it's always worth trying
again what would you get out of it you
could you could certainly get a network
map you would I mean it's the idea you
would also get ok the problem is that's
still just one side and one activity and
so you have to assume well even if you
get access to all the messages they
exchange on there what percentage of
their general message exchange happens
on that one site ok so just the network
map could be interesting again it's less
than eighty percent use it it might be
higher this year even if they do use it
it's not clear to what extent so it's
not really clear what it's really
telling us what we're trying to do this
time around what we didn't do last year
is ask more questions on the survey
about social network site usage where we
will ask more and actually more
generally speaking we don't have that
much information in the last survey
about communication so how often are you
text messaging friends how often are you
calling them etc but similarly as my
answer to Lewis question it's just it's
a whole other undertaking to try to be
mapping and I realize your idea is to
sidestep the cost of collecting those
data by getting this in an automated
matter I think the problem is that even
among college students even with
Facebook you're you're not necessarily
getting their full network and
especially with a population like you I
see half of them don't live on campus so
that it's not quite the kind of college
campus that is the case in some other
schools and so I think the networks are
actually much more complicated that
might not be reflected on their Facebook
accounts
