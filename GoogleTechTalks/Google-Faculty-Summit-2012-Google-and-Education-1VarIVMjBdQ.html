responsible for Google+ at Google I want
to take a little bit of time to describe
Google+ to you and tell you how I how I
think we fit into the education
opportunity I first wanted to share an
on goal the non goal is that the kids in
the back of the room are on Google+
instead of Facebook it's okay with us if
that happens but that's not why we're
doing this I want to share why it is
we're doing this and if you think about
googles mission to organize the world's
information make it universally
accessible and useful to people to think
we could do that
absent understanding the user deeply
understanding the user was a bit of a
conceit it sort of worked for a decade
and it got us to a certain plateau but
we really believe that the opportunity
to understand the person on the other
side of the query will transform
everything that we do so today it's
rather amazing if you think about it for
most people coming to Google with our
most popular service they Peck in 12
keystrokes they hit Enter
we send them on their way they're happy
we make we make billions of dollars it's
all good you know nothing wrong with
that picture but we don't know much
about the person on the other end of the
wire absent the characters they pecked
in we know their IP address which we can
geo locate to help serve them content in
the right locale and language we know
some cookies we dropped on their browser
the user agent but for most users we
don't have a lot of durable information
we're sort of like Rain Man you know you
sort of tell us you're into kite surfing
on Thursday you come back on Monday we
forgotten you're starting anew with
Google every time and we think that if
we deeply understood who a user was who
they knew and what they cared about
every service we provide could get
better not only better search but a
better phone a better browser better
Gmail yes better ads you know that's
part of it too and that's really the
underlying motivations around why we're
building Google Plus from the Google
perspective now from the user
perspective being late to market is
never fun this is not the preferred
option but we are late to market and it
gave us an opportunity to do a lot of
learning both what was working for users
and where we had opportunities to
differentiate and do something different
and so we talked to users we we looked
at products that were out there in the
market and we came to a couple
realizations probably not too surprising
but the first one is that privacy
actually matters people care about
privacy and the situation people find
themselves in now I'm at least
personally my Facebook friends graph
includes people who I went to
kindergarten school with people who are
my neighbors my real life family people
have met at conferences people I
absolutely have no recollection of how
they became my friend I've got about
2,000 friends and it's a completely
diverse and diffuse audience at this
point if you will and not only could we
not take a meaningful AI class together
there's almost nothing I could say to an
audience like that that is meaningful
and what we find is that conversation
degrades to least common denominator so
it becomes stuck in traffic on 101 and I
just checked into the Olive Garden you
know that's the level of discourse that
tends to happen when you have an
audience that is not contextual there's
none of this sort of affinity that's
bringing us together these are people I
know with some definition of no and so
what we introduced is a new model for
how we think people interact in the
wheel real world we wanted to bring that
online and we created something we call
circles so in the real world you're
limited by the physical environment
there are these things called walls and
I understand that sound does not travel
through them much and there's things
called distance and it gives me this
physicality that gives me context I know
when I whisper to someone what that
means and where the the content will
travel and I know when I stand at a
podium like this I know who's in the
room I can look around and understand
the context and that's what we tried to
introduce with circles the
reintroduction of context so that people
can have more meaningful conversations
by understanding who's in the virtual
room together and this has been
something that has really resonated with
users the goal of our system was to
build something that was as good or
better for a whisper as it is for a
shout meaning as good for private
community
as email or Facebook and is good for
Public Communication as services like
Twitter or blogger in terms of standing
at a podium and reaching an audience and
we found that in practice people do in
fact use our service this way we have
almost a 50/50 split between people
sharing privately to circles and people
using our platform is a public means of
expression to find their audience one of
the things I've this is actually
user-generated we didn't design this
with with this goal in mind but users
have told us Facebook is for people I
know Twitter is for people I wish I knew
Lady Gaga and Kanye and Google+ is to
find people who care about the same
things as me people I share an interest
with now we have a long way to go to
further develop that but if you think
about Google itself people whisper those
interests into Google all the time if I
type in kitesurfing we have a real
opportunity to connect you not only to
web pages that contain those characters
but communities of real people who are
kite surfing aficionados experts in my
neighborhood friends of mine who might
be into it that I didn't know all kinds
of opportunity to connect people around
this interest graph so that is very much
one of the things we hope to serve and I
think you heard in the previous
presentations that for that reason we
see social connecting people around
topics of interests as a huge
opportunity the other thing I wanted to
briefly touch on is improving the state
of social networking from where it is
today is something we have called
hangouts hangouts is in some ways not a
new technology but it's really been the
purview of rather dedicated high-end
systems its video conferencing it's the
ability to connect people face to face
and people meaning multi way video
conferencing we allow up to 10 people in
a virtual room to connect together and
we provide this for free using standard
commodity hardware things like laptops
and webcams and standard internet
connections and we use infrastructure
that Google has built over a decade
things like YouTube serving
infrastructure allow us to do this at
scale and with reasonable cost it's also
a platform so it's not just about video
conferencing you can screencast
you can actually write dedicated apps
within the hangouts framework that do
very interesting things so if you're
playing poker it's sometimes helpful to
look someone in the eyes and see if
they're bluffing so people have done
things like casual gaming within that
they've done virtual whiteboards within
that framework it's very new and
exciting and one of the things that we
added was the ability to broadcast a
hangout so not only content people hang
out and interact together but a million
people could watch that interaction and
we have seen uses in things like
politics where President Obama did a
town hall meeting with six citizens and
that meeting was both simultaneously
broadcast to hundreds of thousands and
subsequently watched by millions on
demand so there's many many use cases
like this and many of them are in the
broad category of learning I want to
tell you about a few some of these are
explicitly learning sort of higher
education some of them are more ad-hoc
one of the most popular videos on
YouTube is how to tie a bow tie
right this is sort of experience all
learning that's very hard to do absent
video video is a great mechanism for
conveying lots of information early on
in hangouts we heard a story about a it
was actually from an intern someone who
was interning at Google over the summer
and he told us the story of his brother
who was a hospital or who is a doctor at
a hospital in rural Kentucky and in that
hospital a child was brought in who had
been shot and it was a spinal cord
injury and the surgeon there did not
have the expertise locally to really
confidently proceed with the surgery and
so using a Google hangout they connected
with doctors in a major metropolitan
hospital and live in the surgical
theater doctors guided them through the
surgery that was successful and the kid
can walk and it's a happy ending and you
know we did not build our service with
that use case in mind I'm not sure it's
even HIPAA compliant to sort of happen a
you know hang out in the surgical
theater but we're learning from these
unexpected use cases the things like the
stuttering community have gotten
together in Google Hangouts the deaf
community people are doing language
instruction and the ability to both have
a real-time close
community but share that as a video
artifact after the fact and broadcasts
that during the presentation opens up
many many possibilities we're building
this for the ages as I mentioned this is
not about you know Google wants a piece
of the social networking action this is
a long-term vision for Google that will
change our interaction with every user
of every product that we have so it's
very ambitious and will take a very long
time but the opportunities are many we
care a lot about the education
opportunity you know if people come to
our service and they water each other's
farms and throw sheep at each other
that's okay but again that's not why we
did this we think that the world
deserves better discourse and the
opportunity to connect with experts and
people who are passionate about
real-world things is something we want
to offer to people not just to blurt out
in 140 characters but to really engage
face-to-face to have discourse threaded
conversations to connect about things
that they're passionate about and raise
the quality of both conversation and
education that's why we're building this
and it's increasingly becoming a
platform we've sort of tried to compress
a decade of social networking into the
past year that we've been in market but
increasingly we're opening up the api's
and inviting developers and publishers
to contribute to this platform and so I
feel like years from now my hope is that
a lot of education will be happening on
top of our platform and we're building
it with that in mind and so with that I
think we can move to the panel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
