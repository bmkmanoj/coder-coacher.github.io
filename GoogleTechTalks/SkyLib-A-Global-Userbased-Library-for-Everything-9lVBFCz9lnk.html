I used to be a guide of google com now
I'm guided sky live.com and I'm guy at
Skyland calm now because I believe that
the way we consume stuff today is broken
I'll tell you why I think it's broken
and what I intend to do to fix it but
first let me ask you a little question
what do these objects have in common
I'll give you a little bit of time to
think while I introduce these objects
first one is a bicycle rack and then we
have the art of computer programming by
donald knuth which answer sure some of
you are familiar with we have a waffle
machine we have the complete series of a
lawal DVD set in a big box we have a
keyboard some ice skates precision saw a
barcode scanner string cutter and
something that we call a puck get in
Norway it's for making traditional treat
lefse we have a set of screwdrivers and
last but not least suing machine
that's great yep besides the fact that
you can borrow all these things for free
on Sky lib and all slow right now that's
exactly what I was looking for they are
occasionally being used but usually
collecting dust so what usually happens
when we need something like this is we
go to the store buy it new object is
created and we use it once and then it
goes on to spend the rest of its
miserable life collecting dust on some
shelf or in a drawer or even worse in
the garage
I showed this slide the different
audience a couple of weeks ago and there
was an American there and he immediately
exclaimed that this wasn't even bad
garage it could have been way worse and
he's right you can see this continuous
strip of floor all the way to the door
at the back so you know you can tell the
state of a garage by the rock climbing
difficulty of the simplest route to the
door in the back so there are lot lots
of interesting things you can do with
garages but apparently storing a car in
it is falling out of fashion because uh
study this year found that
three-quarters of american households
cannot fit a car in their garage because
all the clutter that's there this is
what i'm going to be talking about today
first i'm going to tell you a little bit
about my personal motivation for
creating skylab then i'll go on to talk
about Skylab and i'm not going to say
too much about it because solid is live
you can go there and try it if you want
to and then i'll move behind the scenes
and give you some of my experiences with
using Google technologies to build this
product so this is the Grim Reaper slide
the fire and brimstone thing we are
using more resources than the earth can
sustainably produce so we have this new
holiday that's so it's not a public
holiday but is a day that's celebrated
every year and the strange thing about
this day is it moves every year it's
called global overshoot day and it's the
day where we've used up all the bio the
sustainable capacity of Earth it keeps
moving forward I believe it's august now
once it reaches some
july first will be at two planets of
consumption versus we only have one
planet so it's a little bit of a paradox
how we managed to get to this point but
to explain it you can think about a
forest you can chop down more trees than
our regrow them every year for quite a
number of years until you run out of
forest one other thing that we can take
away from this chart is that not only is
our footprints increasing it's actually
accelerating if you look at the carbon
intensity of our economy the last 40
years it's been the amount of carbon
emitted per GDP has been going down by
about point seven percent a year and you
would think that with the recent focus
on sustainability and climate change
that that number would be accelerating
that we would be better at using
technology to create goods and services
in a more efficient manner but the last
ten years have seen no change in carbon
intensity it's actually the same as it
was ten years ago so it's kind of
stagnated and top two reasons for that
is one moving up moving production to
China and places where the carbon
intensity of production is higher than
it used to be in the Western world and
the fossil resources that we are using
fuel our economy are getting third or
dirtier and harder to get used to be you
you you know put a straw in the sand oil
will just flow up now you're digging oil
out of the ground in the tar sands of
Alberta is kind of getting harder to get
up and the amount of emission per barrel
is increasing
and as you can see here the carbon
footprint is the largest single
component of this total so where is that
coming from well the traditional way to
look at it is to look at it by fuel
source so we'd have this diagram that we
call call the oil there be some natural
gas deforestation and cement making the
agriculture but I like to turn it around
and look at the other end of the
pipeline from the consumer point of view
because I think that's more useful in
terms of figuring out what you can do
yourself to decrease the footprint here
you can see that from the consumer point
of view the household carbon footprint
the largest component is from mobility
that's your car getting around
transportation but there's also a large
component in the lower left here that's
manufactured products and that is the
embodied energy and carbon footprint
associated with the manufacture products
that we buy and use and that's not
including food and food and clothes they
have their own separate thanks so that's
about 17 of the total so when people ask
me if I'm trying to save the world I say
no I'm only trying to save one seventh
of it and the other six seven someone
else will have to deal with which isn't
entirely correct because I do care about
the mobility part to a couple of years
ago I made them this there's a traveling
salesman solver for Google Maps you see
Google is present and I think it's one
of the examples where you get all the
incentives right because you're saving
time you're saving money and you're
saving the environment by visiting when
you're driving around through multiple
locations visiting them in the right
order
back to stuff and the carbon footprint
of stuff this is a chart that concert
rustling would love it's it contains a
lot of information and then you can see
on the x-axis the carbon intensity per
dollar of each of these product
categories so C to the far far right
here you have the things that give the
most pollution per dollar spent and you
have red meat I actually did the math
for Norway where you would if you buy
and say a hundred dollars worth of
gasoline and you light it on fire you
would pollute less than if you bought a
hundred dollars worth of the red nique
it's a very very efficient way of
polluting and the size of each circle
here is the total amounts for each
product group that's emitted so that's
you know the amount of money that we
spend on each group x this carbon
intensity and the largest circle here is
one of the white circles on the left
it's a auto vehicle manufacturing parts
that's not driving your car around
that's producing the car actually the
second largest hair is tools and the
supplies and there's also a large white
circle with appliances and equipment so
those are the circles that are more
interesting to me when it comes to
Skylit because I think there are lots of
underutilized items lying around in
these categories
so let's dive into an example of this
when we are looking at actually don't
don't panic here see it's a beer but
don't panic because the bear does really
well in this sense it has a very low
carbon footprint per dollar you see one
liter of beer ends up at about point six
kilograms and how much is beer where I
come from in your lives like ten dollars
per happily here so you can safely spend
your money on beer and that's going to
be better than most most other things
you can do but it's interesting because
you see how this life cycle analysis
works one of the things that surprises a
lot of people is that the transportation
component is not very large because we
hear a lot about these you know products
to travel far and that's you know it's
obviously worse than having products
that travel short but it's actually a
small portion of the total for many
different categories of products so if
you look at the the biggest part here
its manufacturing and the biggest
component of that is power supplies so
that's powering the factory usually
electricity but that electricity comes
from you know a mix of power sources
where there's a lot of fossil fuel you
have grains because to make bear you
need grains and the farmer has a
diesel-powered tractor uses fertilizer
etc etc and there's a brewing process
and there's a chemical reaction going on
to produce that alcohol which has a co2
by-product there's some trucking and
that's not the trucking to get the
finished product to the market it's
moving the ingredients to where they are
put together so it's earlier in the
production chain then you have all the
packaging yeah glass aluminum
metal and you have a variety of smaller
things so they're not very large but
they do add up transportation will ski
by truck a little bit by air and rail
but not very much and then there's a
pretty big thing on the trade side and
that's lighting and electricity for the
fridge in the store where the bear is
waiting to be bought and there's also a
warehouse part component on that but in
total the beer does pretty well so now
you can imagine me having learned all
this we're spending way too much
resources we're polluting way too much
and everything that we do has a carbon
footprint and my computer breaks down so
I have the choice of tossing it out and
buying a brand new one or I can try to
fix it naturally I tried to fix it fix
it turns out the hard drive it's the
component that went down so i order a
new one and what better to replace it
with an SSD disk so I get my SSD disk in
the mail and I'm halfway through the
process of replacing the disk you know
the screen removing all the little
screws in my macbook pro and I meet this
tiny devil of a screw with a different
pattern and a little googling later
reveals that it's a t6 torx screw and I
need a t6 torx screwdriver notice again
the use of Google technologies so I I go
on a quest to try to find this
screwdriver and turns out to be pretty
hard to find the first store I go to the
man who helps me look through all the
screwdrivers in the store sums it up
when it's as I guess I guess you're just
not meant to open that computer of yours
so thank you
oh but I didn't give up went to the next
store and I found a set of screwdrivers
where one is the right screwdriver so I
know that screwdrivers to have a carbon
footprint associated with them and i
know that i'm only going to use one of
the screwdrivers in this kit of
screwdrivers once so i try to reason
with the guy selling the screwdrivers
and it went a little bit like this so i
wasn't very successful but the idea of
Skylab was born so I went home and I did
a little exercise that you can do as
well you grab your favorite map and you
draw a circle around where you live
radius this circle is 200 meters so
that's your immediate neighborhood and
then you try to count or estimate the
number of households inside that circle
and then you multiply by the number of
items that each household has now the
average household has how many items any
guesses
any other
so by by the time a child reaches the
age of seven it has an average 500 twice
or has received that number of choice so
you're a little bit on the low side
although these numbers are from the
United States so they may be different
for Europe it's about 10,000 so within
this circle we have about 1.5 million
items and if you go online and you look
at the biggest product catalogs out
there that's 1.7 million items and they
have pretty much anything that you can
think of I'm sure there's a lot of
overlap here but I also think that you
can see that there's a huge resource
sitting here and most of those items are
not used daily so say hello to Skylab
what Skylab does is it makes your stuff
searchable the problem with the
inventory on the last side is it's not
searchable if you want to find your t6
torx screwdriver you need to walk around
the neighborhood and welcome people's
doors and it's socially awkward at least
for us in the regions and you know they
may even they may not know that whether
they have t6 screwdriver or not because
they didn't index their stuff properly
so Skylab uses a bit of mobile magic
here to accomplish the indexing of your
stuff it's not that your your phone is
actually going to crawl around and map
this stuff but you can walk around and
use the barcode scanner function on your
cell phone scan barcodes and the app
looks up various databases online tries
to find all the information you can
about the product and puts it in your
private inventory it's very important
that we find as much information as
possible because that makes it
more searchable for others if you're
adding a kit of screwdrivers it's a bit
tedious to list all the different types
of screwdrivers that are in there so
this should be done preferably for you
if the information that we find
automatically is incomplete then we ask
the user to edit it but then all other
all subsequent users get to benefit from
that added information when you add an
item you choose who can see it so it
could be just your friends could be
friends of friends that way you reach a
lot more people and you still have some
degree of trust it could be everyone
most of the items that are shared on
Skylit today are shared with everyone
and is about 1,000 items in the mainly
in the oslo area in norway that are
shared you can share just with yourself
I know quite a few people who use a
search engine for their stuff you can
share with different groups you can
create group for the building you live
in or your employer workplace can have a
group for your sports club alright
whatever and you can also yeah those are
the most
now that we've indexed the stuff we can
search it and this works pretty much
like your favorite search engine you
enter the search query what you're
looking for and you get a list of
results with Skylab it's incredibly
important that you find what you're
looking for within a short distance of
where you are because if you have to
travel 500 kilometers to pick up that
book that's actually worse than them
creating a new book book so the carbon
footprint of a book an average book is
about equivalent to driving
gasoline-powered car 130 kilometers it
gives you an idea of the radius
preferably your neighbor has this so you
can walk 50 meters and get it oh and if
you're searching on the cell phone in
the app it uses your present location so
if you're traveling like me you're in a
different city and suddenly you find out
that you need the camera tripod or
something to take good pictures then
we'll actually find the one that's
closest to where you are so to the
behind the scenes part Skylit runs on
Google App Engine I'm using Java on
pension so you have the Java Duke here
you can actually share it's actually
shared on Skylit for some reason this
Java Duke doll so if you want to borrow
it you can reason I went with Java is
it's the language that I'm more familiar
with among the three languages offered
by a pension yeah Python you have go and
you have Java and the other reason is I
can reuse some of the the data objects
with me in Java on the Android
application
that's shallow too now the reason I went
with App Engine is because of its
scalability so in 2011 a terrible
earthquake and massive tsunami hit Japan
one of the things that tsunami did was
it knocked out the power plant at
Fukushima and there was a lot of fear
about radiation in that area and the
days following the event the disaster I
was looking for information about
radiation values and I couldn't find
them in a format that that was useful to
me it turned out there were measurements
of radiation but they were hidden inside
PDF files that were generated in
Japanese every 15 minutes and these were
measurement stations on in elementary
schools around Japan so this german dude
German and engineer his name is Marian
Steinbach he scraped those pdfs and made
csv files of the measurements and then i
took those csv files put them into a my
sequel database on my personal homepage
server and plotted them on a map and you
could actually click on each of the
measurement stations and you can see the
historical values again notice the use
of the google chart api here now when i
was done building this and it only took
a few hours i sent an email to Marian
Steinbach they thanking him for the data
and he tweeted about it and then 20
minutes after that I get an email from
my host Bluehost telling me they have
closed my account due to excessive loads
so it turned out it wasn't just me who
looking for this kind of information a
lot of people are interested and this is
one of the situations where App Engine
really excels because it scales with
traffic it automatically spawns new
server instances for you when you see
more traffic but a lot of developers are
initially disappointed when they go to
App Engine because when you're
developing your app and you're
developing it on your own box with the
my sequel server running on that same
box and there are like 20 records in
your database and there's only one
person hitting it that's you it feels a
lot snappier on your one box than on
Google App Engine that's because even
though there are only 20 records in your
data store on App Engine it has all the
infrastructure to scale to 20 billion
records it has the load balancing and
the data store isn't running on the same
machine as your business logic code so
they're actually remotes kohls going
back and forth and I think these two
images illustrate the difference between
speed and scalability here because we
only one passenger the Formula One race
car is a lot faster than this huge bulky
ship but with thousands of passengers at
the same time it doesn't move at all and
the bulky ship does but with one person
it feels I feel slow that's not to say
that I haven't done a lot of performance
tuning to try to get attention to be
faster because that's one of the things
that you will be doing as a developer on
App Engine you will spend a lot of time
on this
one of the things that developers in
general are not that used to is
struggling with start at time because
when you're deploying your java app in
normal circumstances you know you have
your deploy script it starts the running
the program and that startup time can be
pretty long if you're if you have those
massive frameworks that manage your data
and you know web templates or whatnot on
App Engine because it scales and because
it spawns instances when you need them
server instances that startup time
becomes crucial because let's say you
have zero instances running because your
app isn't hasn't gotten very popular yet
then the first guy who comes to your
service is going to have to wait for
your program to start for the Java
Virtual Machine stark and it takes some
time if you look at the chart here you
know there's only a tiny bit at that
time that's the actual processing and
the users request most of it is start at
time there is a way to solve this you
can specify that you always want at
least one machine running and you can do
that with the free quota that's provided
on App Engine you have to enable billing
to do this but you don't actually have
to pay because you'll be right under the
free folder with one machine running all
the time but whenever you need extra
instances whenever a new server instance
starts a user dies it dies in the stands
that he has to wait for this new machine
to spin off
it's something that I haven't been able
to figure out how to solve yet what I'm
doing right now is I have two machines
running at all times so this doesn't
happen very often but for this you know
automatic scaling to work well it would
be nice to never send new users to new
machines until they've actually done all
the startup yes it's an open issue on
that pension right now the other problem
that I've been struggling a lot with
when it comes to App Engine is sometimes
App Engine is slower than it usually is
so it doesn't have much downtime but it
does have some slow time and if your
start time is 20 seconds during those
slow time periods it can increase to 40
50 and maybe 60 seconds and there's a
hard limit on each request at 60 seconds
so if instance startup time is more than
60 seconds they don't start at all and
that translates that downtime or a slow
pound into actual downtime for your
application so there are a number of
things that you can do to speed up by
start a time on a pension getting rid of
the heavy frameworks is a hard sell when
you've written all the code but if
you're just starting out it's something
that you should consider when picking
framework if it looks like the figure
here with lots of different boxes and
lots and lots of features it could be
slow when it wants to start up i'm using
a security framework called Apache Shiro
and it's a very lightweight framework
actually but it does use reflection as a
java language thing for initialization
and that was super
super slow on App Engine need added
alone 10 seconds of startup time on good
days so replacing that configuration by
i nee any files with configuration
that's explicit in your code makes that
you know takes it down to less than a
second so avoid reflection so here's my
Christmas wish lists number one user
facing requests should not be sent to
cold instances and number to improve
Java instance startup time and I
actually have a suggestion for how to do
this because you don't actually have to
improve the startup time you just need
to increase the request limit if that's
possible for start-up requests not the
regular requests but if startup requests
could take more time than Java
developers can use their you know heavy
frameworks that they're used to and as
long as the first issue is solved no
users will be killed in the process and
google recently introduced this awesome
full text search api that holds a lot of
problems it can do a lot of cool things
for App Engine and I'm using it but as
long as there's a hard request limit on
number of requests to it per day at
20,000 it's not very useful because
every time you index something and put
it into that full-text search api you
use one request there's no batch way of
doing that so you know skylab contains
about 10,000 more than 10,000 items now
if I need to re indexed up for any
reason say i want to add the field or
something then i first have to remove
each document which takes one operation
and then add the new version of that
document and then I've blown my request
folder for that day so those three
things would make a very Merry Christmas
indeed and if there's no Google santha
in the room it would be great if this
could be
forwarded to the google Santa yeah and
learn some sources that I want to show
so if people are interested they can
actually look at the the data for the
slides that's about it next time you
need something one of the usual suspects
of dust collection remember that Skylab
exists and if you can't find what you're
looking for make sure that you put it in
the cache skyline after you've used it
thank you no questions yes it's simple i
was at Google before and the reason I
left Google is actually I felt homesick
I wanted to go back to Norway if I
didn't have this idea then but I think
yeah that's a great point because with
with Google's resources you know
obviously it's easier to get that
critical mass of users that but that is
necessary to make this whole thing
useful yeah
I yes I did consider the other providers
but given my background I always felt
that you know Google is the best and
actually there's a difference between
App Engine and Amazon as platforms
whereas amazon you do much more of the
configuration on your own and it doesn't
auto scale you actually have to request
the extra instances yourself and you
have to deploy to them and you have to
do a lot of things that you get for free
with App Engine not a the sre type of
guy so I want to do coding but I don't
want to do maintenance and deployment
scripts and all that sand without pinch
and you have that use you you have the
deployment in a web interface it's
really simple you can do you know
traffic experiments you can direct half
traffic to the new version you get lots
and lots of stuff for free
yes so a scallop is available on the web
at scallop calm and in the google play
store I'm building an iphone app because
people are nagging me it's not that I
particularly like Apple but yeah so the
iphone app is the next step
yes so the plan to get the critical
amount of users is to focus on a very
small geographical area so I kind of
pick the battle ground which is going to
be likely around University campus in
Oslo and the student housing areas where
people live close they live on limited
budget and yeah they have the technology
in there pretty tech-savvy
I
yep
yes that's one of the main features a
lot of people borrow from others are
they length to others and then they
forget about it so it's kind of like
giving away the things or Scylla does
have a record of your transactions
within the system so you can see who's
borrow right yeah yeah so this isn't
yes this hasn't been done yet I'm
working out how the burrowing should
really work in practice to be the best
at camp one of the things is a limit on
how long you can borrow something and
when you have that have the opportunity
to give reminders and you know try to
make the exchange part easier I I have
focused on the search part for now
mainly because I'm just one person
developing it and there hasn't been that
many transactions yet so I think there
have been about 20 non me your
transactions so far but yeah I think
that's one of the next things that I
will be working all the transactions
themselves and making it safe and very
convenient and helping you remember what
you should do yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
right there
yeah yeah actually that's a super idea I
think yeah yeah I think that the the
messaging is good and hopefully and I
haven't looked into this but maybe it's
easy to integrate with google talk and
have a some sort of religion yeah it's
great to suggest them I'm planning for
that the only integration right now is
with log in you can login via your
google account and your facebook account
and it pre feels some of the information
about you your name and picture but
that's coming that's just a limited
development bandwidth from my side right
yeah there is a simple inventory thing
right now but it can be made a lot
better i think right now it's just a
list of your things yeah yeah and it
would be super cool if you know in a few
years you'll have some sort of indoor
navigation thing so the phone will know
where where you were when you index the
thing
I know I know libraries do this but they
have some sort of barcode on the side of
the book so I don't know if it would
work yet but maybe it can be done yeah
as I'm just because you have the the
Google Goggles thing right it does
recognize yeah or put it in your google
glass and then you can just walk around
look at the yeah yeah
right
well thank you for showing up and thank
you for making great technology and keep
keep moving the world forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
