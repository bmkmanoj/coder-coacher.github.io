you for everybody to stuff up this
together I've asked a features here to
talk about something near and dear to
our heart ADHD I just those with it so
those we get to work with us and
hopefully to help them understand that
nothing we do is intentional but I'm
going to we're here listen to her not me
so and I'm gonna go find my note well
thank you guys seriously for coming I'm
so excited about this I'm safety
tourists and I am an accidental selling
author because if you know me you would
never think that I could do what he
liked becoming an author and definitely
not um not a best-selling author
um I'm super honored to be here and
honored that that does he took the time
to UM get me out here and found the
importance of just what we were talking
about understanding ADHD and really what
I want to talk about is understanding
our superpowers because um it really is
amazing when you start digging down into
a EHC and you realize that it's so much
more than than being distracted or
hyperactive or whatever okay so even my
cute little audience rule with is please
do not remain seated if you don't fancy
these and pace in the corner you can
jump in the back you can do whatever you
don't have to keep quiet during my talk
because it'll be weird so like any time
you guys wanted to play sitting like
yeah high five six bucks like some
Miller II um Lochte stones if cetera
will be in the corner this looks like if
you have a large audience
um so they'll be a lot some down because
I've noticed that when I do be hot that
a lot of times they're conceived less in
the seat or a bad lift in the corner or
whatever so I'm not going to be able to
remind you okay so the first thing I
want to talk about is the ADHD brain and
we're going to kind of get down and
dirty on the 8080 brain I want to give
you guys kind of like my back story um I
was not diagnosed until I was 33 years
old which was like 10 years ago
and so kind of growing up um I knew that
something was different I just didn't
really know what it was
so my whole life you know I was always
the life of the party the fun lovin
party girl um pretty distracted all the
time and had a hard time getting through
school got bad grades um gotten fight
got a lift knit a couple times like I
was definitely the girl living in Kansas
looking for stimulation in all the wrong
places so um basically I actually didn't
even know I had any use in my brain
until I took my ACC test for college and
he got the test scores back and my
friends and I were all kind of like you
know comparing and we all looked at my
like process cuz there was any juice in
there whatsoever
so um I always have a hard time got
kicked out of my school um that was for
fighting they told me that since I had
bad grades if I could get on come back
to school and get on the honor roll then
I could stay in my school which I met I
was a CD student sometimes enough I
spelled class the bottom of summer
school every single summer so they said
okay you can come back to your home
school but you have to be on the honor
roll and I was like done so my junior
year I got to go back to my school and I
was on the honor roll for my junior and
senior year because I cared not about
full I cared about being with my friends
so that gives me the motivation to make
good grades because other than a few
classes my teachers didn't they weren't
really teaching in a way that I
connected with or understood so so that
was in high school and in college I mean
it was the same thing you know I took a
I think I came home with three credit
hours the first semester and then the
second semester I dropped out and then
the third semester I was like okay my
parents will kill me if I don't make it
to college so I'm just going to slam it
and I actually finished college in three
years because I took 24 hours of
semester and 18 hours in the summer and
that again was it was because it won my
turn I'm going to do this because I want
to do this because I want to show you
guys I can do it but I'm doing it on my
turn so I just slammed it graduated got
out of there and I have to tell you
about this I when I was preparing this
speech um my business partner I was
talking to him like you know the
pressure in bubble and he is that kind
thought it was alive and and it she
seemed kind of looked at me and he was
like oh by the way I was told that I
have to keep this PG 13 so I'm
attempting to do that okay I might grow
something ugly go out there - let's keep
it pg-13 rating doesn't matter who told
you - that was a bougie beautiful oh the
really good this is good I mean every
question
so anyway okay so I can personally all
right cool
so so basically you know the pressure
and blah blah blah me looks at me and
he's like it's not a stupid
it's not about you it's about everybody
that you're talking to and Wes you're
imparting and so I just wanted to bring
that out because it is literally that
flipping perception helps me so much and
so we're going to talk about that later
as a coping skill on how we can flip our
perception to take it from a dangerous
issue
- only if the situation um okay so let's
talk about the down-and-dirty ADHD brain
and basically we know that we know that
there are two primary neurotransmitters
that are associated with ADHD one of
them is dopamine and one of them is
norepinephrine with crazy about this is
that some studies suggest that our tribe
only has ten to twenty-five percent of
what a neurotypical person has in
dopamine and norepinephrine and why does
that matter it matters because with low
those low levels of those means we have
things like in facilities searching for
the stimulation whether it's good
stimulation bad simulation I didn't care
as long as my brain lights up doctor I'm
looking for not probably got into the
most trouble and while I did get
arrested why I did try drugs and
everything else um another part is
opening is that sort of if you're
lacking in it you have that lack of
emotion sometimes you feel numb or
something happens and you feel like you
should feel a certain way and you don't
and then you feel crappy about yourself
like how many times I thought I was
probably a serial killer in the making
because I had no emotions about kind of
 scream the most poor memory brain
fog fatigue no motivation low libido
these are all things associated with
your low dopamine levels
norepinephrine is associated with your
attention and if you're distracted or
not so so we're working with these
double chemicals with low chemical among
both sides these low norepinephrine is
inattention distractibility count focus
you have literally no sense of time
whatsoever you're not interested in
things you're not really alert and you
can't
never crap and you're depressed and
you're anxious so I mean I can't think
how many of you guys have any of those
issues so the other thing with ADHD is
they have something called comorbid
conditions 50% of us have a comorbid
condition whether it's anxiety
depression OCD bipolar you know learning
disabilities um tic disorders like
Tourette's syndrome sensory processing
do you guys any of you guys have any
sensory issues where like smells and
feels or lights or anything overwhelmed
view sensory issues are cues and I'm
autism spectrum disorder a lot of people
have autism with ADHD or up burgers with
ADHD um I love this I put these into my
nose and I only did it like Franks and
then I forgot for the rest of the
presentation so I have a site called
brain gangster calm right mindful
techniques and not one of them so
everybody I don't care how many we all
need to take three deep breaths
and oxygenate our brains because when
we're stressed and our shoulders are
tense you are durable diaphragms are all
stretched we're not getting the oxygen
that we need to our brains especially if
you're working at Google um okay I want
to talk to guys about this really really
really awesome awesome buzzword that I
love because it's the closest thing that
I have ever found to jiving with what I
feel ADHD is about and when I when I was
diagnosed I decided I was going to write
a book and in order to write a book I
had to build a platform and so I created
a Facebook page which is athe superhero
and now it has about 250,000 followers
on it but what was so cool about the
Facebook pages
I started observing with their
interactions I started seeing this
enormous picture of what a DAC was and
the way that a DHT is perceived and
promoted as a disorder stops making
sense to me because I noticed that as
opposed to like this disorder
we actually have human characteristics
there are these human traits that are
associated with our tribe that are not
disorders and for example like it's
weird but but our tribe tends to have a
really cool sense of humor and so and
and a charismatic personality so it's
not just like oh I can't do math it's
like there are different things with
these different people and I just
started wondering like how is how does
this work it's like my my example in my
head was if you have two monkeys or say
I don't know I don't know what isn't a
monkey or what is call them like you're
not but say you have two monkeys okay
one type and one type is really great at
climbing trees really great at climbing
trees the other type is the monkey but
it's a different monkey it's really
great at gathering food but the one
that's gathering at credit gathering
food have a disorder and the one that
can climb trees blossom because he can
climb shades it's like hey bitch I can
gather food like let's work together you
climb trees all gather food so it was
like it doesn't make one monkey smarter
than the other one it's just a different
variation of what they can do so I
started thinking like this is not a
disorder like these are true human
traits were just variations with these
different skill sets and to separate us
and to put one of us in a corner and say
you're not doing it right
is booked it it is is because
you can't do what I can do
so how is this a disorder disorder come
from us not being able to function in
this size because we're not root but we
want to gather we don't want to be
up here climbing trees you know what I'm
saying but let's work together so those
kind of like and and so this buzzword
neurodiversity it's so amazing to me
because it's saying there's no if all
variations there's no one great
particular thing that you need to be
because all of us together are combined
are what is going to make this world
move forward with our renovation side
our logical side we need all of it and
that's what I mean I noticed that in
politics in religion it's all about
meaning my might you know I'm going to
box myself in right here and this is the
right way to do it and it's like how
about let's just pick those those labels
away and think about the people in
politics you know of course with all
their crazy stuff going on but it's like
we have Republicans Democrat blah blah
blah but deal that we have people in
each side that have these amazing
strengths that we can work together but
but it's never like that it's always
just about me me me me me so I love the
neurodiversity and um dictionary.com I
googled it said neurodiversity is a
variation differences in neurological
structure and function that exist among
human beings so we're not looking at it
as something pathological we're looking
at it as a normal variation like you
have black hair you know you have
lighter hair it's a variation of humans
and it's a variation of our brains and
eyes whether neurodiversity and then
they talk about how well neuro diversity
is kind of complicated because
everybody's neurodiverse well that's
true and it ends in that neurodiverse
kind of part
we have the neurotypical and the neuro
minorities right because our world is
neurosyphilis weed Riven it's you know
paying your bills getting to work I was
getting our Christmas cards you know
blow blow blow blow it's not it's not
driven for both sides I love this
specific school theory that supports you
guys familiar with comm Hartman I love
the way this guy thinks because he's
like a money guy but then he ODS was
cool other side anyway and he has the
punter versus farmer theory and in the
hunter versus farmer series he talks
about where it's just the same variation
you have the hunters and you have the
farmers and the hunters are very Simpson
an intuition driven right so we can just
be like Holland Holland Holland oh my
god I hear something you know I'm going
to chase after this guy is bad annoys oh
my god is that danger that's how we work
farmers are like I'm going to tell this
ground I'm going to plant a seed I'm
going to patiently water it I know that
it's going to grow and that's great
because we need that but we need you
guys to so it's a variation we have the
hunter we have the farmer and if you I
love that series you guys want to look
into it and she talks about the traits
you know as it appears as a disorder
view so like just say for example
attention as a disorder of you and we
don't have long instances fans as a
hunter of you know we know what we're
constantly monitoring our environment
and as a farmer view the farmer are not
distracted they are like I got a lot of
my stuff I have to pull the weeds you
know so it's cool II like you can look
at this chart I'm not going to read it
to you but there are really cool things
and it just kind of promotes the fact
that there is neurodiversity and maybe
we're like making this all along um I
think the biggest thing
that I understood when I was learning
all this stuff is that I didn't realize
there were so many different layers to
how complex we are as humans and that
there are different not just learning
styles but processing styles and
different ways that we even perceive the
world which is so crazy so the couple of
things that I want to talk about is you
know we all know about being an
introvert extrovert but sometimes we
don't know how that really affects us on
a daily basis and you know linear versus
nonlinear thinking it's a speaking style
and so these are the things that we're
going to talk about and so we're really
going to dive into like who we are and
and understand and start kind of
clearing up this mess of this stuff to
be that people around us as to put on us
you know and made us feel as if we are
really affecting just self-esteem I
think because we just feel like we're
not doing game right and this is a map
of the introvert and extrovert brain and
I love it because it's totally true and
you have to understand that when you're
an extrovert and when you're an
introvert and in our ADHD v is totally a
mix of both but but then we all have
certain traits of each side but the
biggest thing when you are trying to
figure out if you're an introvert or an
extrovert is how you you recharge do you
recharge by being by yourself or be
recharged by being around a crowd of
people so that's the one the one thing
that you can say okay I'm an introvert
I'm an extrovert but then like I said
you know we we can take from both sides
so on being an introvert getting energy
from yourself you get drained by other
people and you need privacy's mentally
rehearsing before speaking no lie I'm
not kidding you I have to say Tomalin
words sometimes and I will literally say
in my head like 20 times before I ever
get brave enough to say them out loud
and and even if I want to have a
conversation with someone I do the whole
conversation in my head even their side
like I will sit an hour we'll have the
whole conversation then coming you know
and then I'm like alright alright I got
this and then I know what's going to
happen so I'm prepared for it so we
learn by observing if sustaining years
like that we learn by observing um
loyalty to a few close friends I was so
true because I have a ton of friends I
have a ton of friends but I only have a
very very very close circle of people
that truly truly know the essence of
Stacey here and we can complicate the
when we're when we're wanting to if it's
something that we're interested in we're
reflective on things extrovert totally
opposite they get in Vega in their
energy some interaction and from other
people and they feel energized by other
people they're open they think out loud
you want to be the center of attention
they're comfortable like jumping in the
new situations you make lots of friends
they're distractible they're impulsive
and they're risk takers and that sounds
you know very familiar so um when we get
into this really cool linear versus
nonlinear thinking and I loved it I
loved it because it's so cool and when
you're a linear thinker it's like this
line you solve issues by going from A to
B to C to D to e and it all makes sense
when you're a nonlinear anchor we don't
have a line we have like this whole huge
circle and we think in most multiple
directions of multiple times and we pull
a lot of our information from inside of
us when you're logical you're taking the
and you're you have the facts so this is
how you're going to make your decision
and you make your pros list and your
cons list and know when you're when
you're a nonlinear think you're doesn't
matter like stop like giving me
information I have the information I
need I have a big picture give me the
big picture because if you're just
trying to tell me one thing after one
thing after one thing I'm not going to
connect with it because I don't know
what I don't know give me the big
picture and I'll still in the little
pieces and then I'll know what I don't
know and then I'll ask questions then
I'll connect and then I will learn the
material and who okay I have to see how
many of you guys relate to the auditory
sequential with the filing cabinet
that's nicely file there's no pile okay
what about the facial hey guys there's
got to be visual basil and it's so funny
because this is the stuff that drives my
husband absolutely crazy and with visual
with basil the biggest thing is that we
organize this is the thing that really
drives my husband ed I organize by
piling okay out of sight out of mind
for me if I put something in a file
cabinet
never in my life who I remember it's
there if I throw something in my closet
never in my life will I remember is
there so I have my floor closet or my
floor drove my chair cause it like I
have my piles and then I'll just pull
the clothes from whatever's in the pile
like I never touched the closet and
sometimes I'll be like oh my gosh I
totally forgot I had that because out of
sight out of mind and well let's talk
about the visuospatial because the
auditory sequential we're all visual
spacious here so we came in pictures and
and and we have very good visual
strengths like if I'm remembering where
something is my memory is not oh yeah I
lost over here I work over here my
memory is
I see this little whatever this not
citizen and I'm like okay there are only
four nuts around here so I'm going to go
find it so I think in pictures when
people tell me things I visualize
everything like that's why if people get
too graphic on things on my bed because
it's like real in my head so anyway
we're a whole part learner it's just
like we were talking about that whole
nonlinear holistic view of things
because we see so much more we see the
big picture and when people are logical
and linear they tend to be inside that
one little spot right but we see more
than that and not something with my
business partner too he is more of that
that linear thinker so he will he will
be in that top seeing out fires and I
will see things that will happen
how about will affecting much for now
and so that's kind of not really where
we argue a lot is is just finding in
that face and me seeing projecting what
it's going to turn out like and him not
believing me then what we have to go
through the process and then it's like
oh yeah you're right and like a purpose
right so in a few big picture problem of
seeing the big picture II miss Aviva
housekeeping housekeeping my house is
not cluttered but if you go to Wyatt
from the duct you could like seriously
write your name in it because I can tell
when something I come in and I can tell
if something is kind of a mess but I
will never ever see details I will never
be like oh yeah there were pens on the
table because when I come in I just I'm
seeing this whole thing and if nothing
stands out at me I'm not going to notice
anything um
so visualizing words spelling and we
organize our own way we arrived at our
solutions intuitively there is so much
intuition that we use in our time it's
insane and I've got something else that
I learned um I thought I was weird
and then I started learning that the
intuitive thing is a huge part of our
type you guys all have like strong
intuition yeah where you can you can
kind of like feel how everything is
doing like it's more feeling as opposed
to thinking sometimes and long-term
visual memory is good short-term memory
it sucks
we're turned off by drill we turn off by
repetition we don't want that we want
our own way of solving our problem so
just tell us the problem but don't make
it right your money down like this this
map that these kids are doing it cool
now and they're like that the core
whatever its qualities I just get so
annoyed I don't want to think about it
don't make it too dot if we come up with
the ants and we came up with the answer
why are you care how we came up with the
answer so that's the stuff that we have
to look at when you're a visual spatial
and this is something that really
affects kids in school and up and in in
our job to course we have uneven grace
cuz we don't care about something and
some things we love and not what we're
going to put our energy towards because
that is what is lighting our brains up
if you're giving me something that I'm
not interested in my brain will shut
down in a heartbeat and that's all there
is to it it's not because I'm lazy
it's not because I'm being a pain in the
ass because my brains like sorry about
does not do anything for me okay so then
let's talk about the other thing that is
really really impact 88 years which is
the sensory processing issues and crazy
because kind of like our brain does not
have the ability to determine what is
something we should be paying attention
to and something that we can ignore so
when we are in a room we're looking at
the life I hear the fan of the projector
I see that being blinking over there
um it's like all of these sensory issues
in my brains Glen hey hey hey hey hey
hey look look look look look like and
I'm just and that's why it's like so
overwhelming when you have these sensory
issues because things like fluorescent
lights can throw you off you're trying
to be productive at work and you have
fluorescent lights above you flickering
and there's no way you're going to have
a productive day um some of the some of
the symptoms that are just kind of like
behaviors that you'll notice with people
that have these sensory issues is like
the touching thing I'm I'm pretty
hardcore not being touched if I was not
expecting it and I definitely don't like
touching like wet laundry when I was a
kid I was at school I was in elementary
school and they made us take a milk with
every lunch and you know how they're all
like moist and gooey on the outside of
the wax carton and it drove me crazy so
I started wrapping a napkin around the
milk so I would not detect it and then I
remember looking around one day and like
the whole lunch room had their milk with
their napkins wrapped around it and I
was like yeah boy that's how you do it
but those sensory issues they are a big
deal nation affects our lives so much so
when we don't know that thought is
something that's affecting us it's hard
so these are some of the things you know
were affected by what we eat the case
the texture were affected by smells were
affected by sound my daughter used to
just freak out every time to flush the
toilet when she was hit - she had the
same issues going on so so these sensory
issues are are really important to
understand because then you'll
understand like some of where your
reactions are coming from or your kids
reactions are coming from but you know
like I don't like getting my hands wet
so I you met my husband
I'm not going to touch wet laundry like
I'll dry I'll dry you know off old but
I'm not going to touch what laundry you
know I'm not going to do dishes because
I can't stand out in my aunt with um
yeah the odors we hear the background
noise which is super SuperDuper
distracting we have these empathic
tendencies and this is I feel like
something that is the least understood
because we're kind of on the cusp of it
not being so Loulou now like it used to
be like in plastic like vision still
energy is weird you know that sounds
like like a metaphysical stuff but now
they're starting to determine obviously
we're made of energy are all everything
that we do puts off energy and of course
it makes sense that we can read that
energy through our own energy systems so
it's not blue anymore I don't feel silly
talking about it anymore because it's so
common with our tribe I just feel like
it's very very important to understand
because this is something that is just
so hard as a sensitive person to try and
and you know take these I am going to go
through the 30 most common traits of an
impact because because I feel like it's
not important um we just know stuff you
know when someone is lying we have a BS
meter like no other so we know so we can
feel stuff we get these these I call it
an impression so when I get an
impression i have to wear i will get
beat with it until i kind of deliver it
to who I'm supposed to deliver it to so
for example just laughing um I managed a
reggae band new roots and you know in
the music industry you have to build
some you know sketchy people so I'm
constantly scanning I call it scanning
I'm scanning people I'm feeling their
energy I can feel intentions so you can
feel when there is like an intention if
there's a good intention or a bad
intention so I spend a lot of time kind
of feeling intentions well there's this
guy that um that we work with and I've
never even met him in person so I've
never and I never had an issue needing
to scan him because he was always on the
up-and-up
but the other day or last week I just
got this strong impression like this - -
a DS of SU - ad this new - ad - su - ad
hell-lo a who is the business partner
you need to tell him and I hate it when
that happens because I look like a total
crazy person when all of a sudden
someone gets a text and it's like who
knows a pop of gut feeling that you know
don't think I'm crazy
so anyway and so finally I was like all
right I sent the text to my business
partner I said hey I'm just telling you
I'm getting these impressions this dude
is shady and and he was like I can
confirm that after what happened last
night and it was this whole crazy story
but it just shows you like success that
we're picking up even if the person that
you're picking it up from most of time
they will not confirm what you're
feeling and as a matter of fact a lot of
times they will deny it and then you
really feel crazy but what I have
figured out is that I'm right every time
every time so now I don't even if
someone doesn't confirm it or if they
even deny it it used to just make me
feel like confused because because the
words and the energy don't match up
right and not so confusing and so anyway
so now I just I just test it but and
being in public places can be
overwhelming because we're getting
energy from every single freaking person
so when I used to go to the mall it was
like protect myself and just haul
through and just try and get or Airport
for crazy whew I'm watching Bing bong
keee cruelty tragedy I went and son
Vedic doctor because I was just
suffering from such massive anxiety this
was before I was diagnosed and um he
told me he said you have to stop
watching the news you can't watch the
news like you can't watch the news and I
stopped watching it and I'm telling you
my I've never had anxiety ever again
because everything that was happening
everything on the news all the bad stuff
it just layered on me and layered on me
and layered on me and when you are an
empath or you are sensitive you're
feeling everything for other people too
so it's not just your oh if you're
 your your your you
know I'm saying so it's so overwhelming
that sometimes you don't even want to
leave the house and you stay inside and
you kind of begin to this little ball
and your energy just all sucked in you
can even pick up physical symptoms off
of other people and a lot of times the
impact of these these kind of digestive
order disorders because where you get
that energy is right here that's where
you're kind of feeling the energy and so
if you're getting that just crap going
in there a lot of people can suffer from
like irritable bowel syndrome all those
things where where you're you're storing
hat toxicities we're always looking out
for the underdog um strangers want to
offload their problems on you my uber
driver from the airport to the hotel
here was a prime example this guy
probably pulled me his whole life story
and he was after we got out of the car
he was like I have no idea why I just
told you all that and I'm like I know
because that happens to me all the time
I'm constantly fatigued we're drained in
our energy because we're constantly
creating energy for other people or to
protect ourselves from other people's
energy
it takes a lot of effort to be able to
to kind of bounce that energy off and
keep a protective circle he results I'm
drawn to feeling whether your
earth or whether your acupuncture or or
like I'm a Reiki Master so because I
understand energy and I can feel it
I can manipulate it and that's why I
learned Reiki because it's such an
awesome tool to be able to manipulate
energy that way and I know I'm sounding
crazy but I promise like in 10 years you
guys will all be like oh she was right
um a lover of nature and animals I think
that's probably obvious this bored or
distracted easily if not simulated
you'll notice that these all these
things these things that make us up as
people start to overlap and it's like
this ADHD thing that they're talking
about it's like well that's kind of like
gets bored or distracted you know it's
kind of like a combination of these
other things that we have with the
personalities how do you reconcile I
have you reconcile 1560 what do you mean
Oh need for solitude and gets bored or
distracted if not simulated well the way
that I do it is when I am trying to get
my energy back is my need for solitude
so I go back and forth now if I am too
much if I have not been around other
people or I've not been stimulated I
start feeling that too and so then I
know and that's what we're covering
let's talk about balance I can jump back
now I recognize when I need to jump back
and forth so we do need stimulation we
do need that we can't feel stagnant but
we also don't want to be over stimulated
so it's just you jump back and forth
depending on your needs at that time um
you can't do things we don't enjoy that
sounds like ADHD - yeah we're not going
to do anything that doesn't light our
brain up we strive for the truth
eighty-eight years if there's one thing
that will piss us off it is something
that is unjust if we see something that
is not fair that is not just that is
something that will make us inste pissed
and that's another thing with 88
years is that in stupas quality because
well it's called bouts of rage I call it
passion yeah we get that we get that
insecurely and we love obviously
adventure freedom it's out now not
liking clutter that's the one thing that
is I'm not sure about that one because
on one hand I do like clutter it just
has to be my own kind of clutter so I do
like clutter I feel happy when I'm
surrounded by all my little weird stuff
on my desk but it has to be my own stuff
um routine rule controlling totally
imprisoning slept we cannot handle
anybody trying to put us into a box or
structure of a too much we're great
listeners as uber driver will tell you
we definitely have a none tolerance the
narcissism and I think that just goes
with that full and you know let's not
not being okay with injustice and
utility till the days of the week which
is so funny to me because you know when
you're like oh my god it felt it stays
Friday it felt like Thursday all day
there is something to that because when
when if you don't know what day of the
week it is the collective we all know
thing we all know it's Thursday so the
collective is putting off this it's
Thursday energy so sometimes you can
those are the kind of weird things that
you can that you can read into if you're
really in touch with your energy appear
movie shy loose this connected man that
happens a lot because when we have too
much going on will shut down and I'll
talk about that later but um yeah when I
first met my business partner and he
thought I was like a total snob because
I had no interest in anything outside of
what was going on in my head I was open
to meeting people at you know and so we
can come across that way and I think we
also come across that way because we are
afraid to be authentic with most people
because
we're creative kidding guys and our oven
is nistrim past there was a list from
the hoodies oh let me put on the mind
Unleashed and I can give you guys copies
of the site so you guys have all this
information I'll be able to share those
that you share with me so I'm perfect
alright so I want to talk about our ADHD
superpowers because the thing in all
ADHD superpowers is that they really are
amazing if we are given the tools to
actually use them um
eighty-eight years are incredibly
creative we have the massive
problem-solving ability like I said
earlier a really awesome sense of humor
charismatic personality and the enhanced
Wishon but those superpowers that we
should use and aren't really invited to
use very often is that driving hyper
focus hyper focus is the most amazing
thing in the world we do not we don't
know time we don't have to pee we don't
have to eat we don't have to get out of
our chair we have literally transformed
ourselves when we get into that flow
state we are in space at this point
there were not physically connected to
the earth there's nothing grounding us
there's nothing pulling I found we are
in the state of flow and um this hyper
focus when we get in that flow we can
sustain it for hours and hours and hours
and that's what's so crazy about ADHD is
people get so confused like oh you're
distracted oh you can't concentrate on
paying your bills for ten minutes but
you can you know go do this for seven
hours and it's like yeah because this
does not do anything for my brain this
just shuts my brain down this makes my
brain excited and my brain
is going to go towards less exciting
because also I am all about
I want something to light my brain up so
it's confusing when there's when when
you can hyper focus but you can't focus
and that that charismatic personality I
have met so many people and and on my
Facebook page is getting to know all
these people and I can tell I can
honestly tell a lot of times if I'm
talking to someone and in my head I'll
be like oh yeah I know I know this
person because it's just this this
they're kind of more like ah out there
and funny and and crazy and wacky and so
generous the biggest hearts in the world
because there is that that sensitivity
and that empathic tendencies that they
have I'm so smart so smart and that's
what makes me the most dad is like I
said I didn't know I didn't even know I
was smart and not that my ACPs were say
anything because they don't but I didn't
even know I had like any juice in there
whatsoever but now as I've grown older
and I've kind of just came in control of
my own life and said alright I'm not
focusing on your stuff that you
guys think I should be doing I am going
to focus on what makes me happy and I'm
going to focus on the things that I'm
going to focus on my strengths because
why am I going to put any energy towards
doing this that I don't want to do
why am I going to put any energy towards
towards things that don't make me
passionate and don't make me you know
have this Drive and and I'm so driven by
helping other people that I had to dump
I had to dump to in order to do this
Facebook page and do this book I had to
dump stuff that just didn't make sense
to me which was like you know Christmas
cards and you know that weird stuff and
Mike holidays and like the weird stuff
that all these other people put on me
and I'm like wait a second I think these
holidays are dumb like
am i stressing out about this usin
valentine's day or whatever like it
doesn't I don't even dive with it and
I'm supposed to be doing all you know
what I'm saying like so I just don't
stop stuff I just got tired of and I
figured out like I'm this is my life at
the end of the day this is my life and
I'm going to do it the way I need to do
it in order could be happy because when
I'm happy
my family's happy my friends are happy
everybody's happy when everybody's happy
and a strong sense of airiness up that
is such a thing which I just love and
also gets me in so much trouble
because I can't stand even I lady and
target was just screaming at her child
and it was so excessive because normally
I would never get into anything though
so excessive this baby was probably
three years old and this lady was just
and I just felt that fire raise up in me
and and you know it just wasn't there
and I let that leave you know in you
know that's not cool that you're a like
what do you say how do you treat your
kid when you're at home and be like how
are you communicating this way so anyway
it just need a trouble a lot but but I
fight for things that I believe in and
I'll fight hardcore for it because I
think got the trait that we were given
because our rule meet that so much you
know so all of these things it's like
what how can we contribute with these
superpowers how can we contribute to the
world it's not remember not about what
you did it's about it's about everything
else it's not about me it's about how
can I take what I have and and
contribute to making this place an
awesome world women um
laughter the romantic Scotland I'm going
to have to totally just not agree with
it all - I'm probably the least romantic
person but Jill me um but I'm engaging
conversational skills you talk to an 88
year you will never run out of stuff to
talk about
because we
know so much about so many things that
it's always like an awesome conversation
we can always jump in on anything the
compassion that we have you know our
persistence and our resilience living
with this and I'm talking about the
superpowers but living with them is a
nightmare
it is the biggest struggle and if it's
not just an occasional nightmare it is
from the second you wake up until the
second you go to bed a nightmare and
sometimes the way that we get through it
is day by day and sometimes hour by hour
and sometimes it's like minute by minute
because it's a constant source of
outside troubles with how our family
pursues us how our thousands or partners
receive us how our hips perceive us how
the TCA precedes us and so it's so I
don't I don't want to make it sound like
ADHD is like the best thing ever
freakin sucks it sucks and it's hard and
it's a struggle but basically this is
what we're working with and we really
don't have a choice in the matter and
it's you know more than sugar for
sure but but at the end of the day we
have to start looking at what we do have
then how we can make a difference with
these strengths that we have and it's so
funny because you know these pygmies you
take these people like I said it's like
we do have strengths that other people
don't have so it's not like there's this
deficit it's not like there's this group
of people and we can't do some of that
stuff that's right how it is this group
of people we can't do some of that
subscrive of people they can't do some
of this so so we have to start thinking
in broader terms of the collection of
everybody meeting together to form this
this this foundation that is fused and
strong and
and a team and teenagers so these last
few slides this is kind of like the
here's everything you get because you
are low on dopamine really here's your
bad list of six slides and here's your
here's your process there is what people
perceive as bad they're not are things
that come on now really am i a bad
person because I vote you Christmas card
like Nakhla stuff so crazy why is the
stuff that would put me into a
depression that's the stuff that I would
get so overwhelmed by then I would go
into a depression or the cave or
whatever human stuff like that so I'm
like yeah so I'm like okay you know yeah
we can't we're not good at that stuff
what it's like you want me to do
Christmas : or do you want me to put
that energy towards building this
massive Facebook page of eighty-eight
years that every day are feeling better
about themselves like what matters here
what matters like I can come up with
coding field famous and this is my
coding so for Christmas card y'all hang
getnum not my cooking skill and you're
going to like it or you're talking like
if I don't care because I'm happy I'm
happy
and so so it's just not perception it
it's still having coming like a support
group like my husband knows my strengths
and my struggles and so if he just jumps
in when he needs to and we've been
married for like 16 years at this point
so which is rare for an 88 year um so
but because of that because he he so
much accept me for who I am and has gone
through this process for me or with me
and now understands the physiological
reason why do stuff and it's not even
trying to cut them up like so I dude
that's how my brain works that's what it
is you know and so so once you start
owning your stuff like I'm telling you
the hardest part when I was diagnosed
with the people around me
people around me made me selection and
it was like you're not doing that you
know like I said my mom bless her heart
she is a logistics engineer he has to
look linear you know she doesn't have
any of the depression and anxiety and so
I'm exploding into the world like wow
and she's just like okay well you need
to get organized and you need to not
cross innate and you know that was her
way of fixing me and she thought he
needed to fix those parts but it's like
okay no no no because it doesn't matter
you're not going to help me I'm
unhelpful in that area but take me over
here and I'll show you like the magic
let me show you magic it's not enough
stuff so um yeah this was the stuff that
brings of Chinese horror time management
we cannot matter time because we have no
sense of time time in our head does not
exist and so unless you really build
those muscles and you know you can build
these muscles and I've had to build
muscles especially in the
introvert/extrovert name you know I'm an
introvert and being a damn manager I
have to deal with venues and everything
else and you know a late nights and
music and and I had really build those
extrovert muscles whereas before I would
just have hardened heart having to go up
and talk there like a venue guy but now
I still those muscles I built those
muscles and so now it's easier I don't
even really think about it so you can't
build muscles so damn it do it can you
want to not because somebody's asking
you to do it or forcing you to do it or
or have their own plans or why should
you and do it for you that's what you
need to do this organization now we're
not organized we can't plan we can't
prioritize difficulty with paperwork
hell no you know what my husband died in
a fight every year on a come time for
red meat improve filling out the form
and it's a joke because our lady that
takes care of man is of the whole thing
and what so come to him it she'll be
like hey Amy just fill out your red
forms and he's like getting to space and
she's like everything after it seems
like it so it's like a joke but we
cannot do the paperwork forgetfulness oh
my gosh let me tell you guys how many
times I have driven this to Arkansas
when I should have been going to
Oklahoma from Kansas seriously because
when you and if you guys ever do that or
just like mr. Turner because you're so
in your head and you're just like on on
autopilot
I shall I'm telling you I have to put my
DP up on no matter where I'm going even
if I know how to get there because I
will not turn I will just drive straight
forever so my GPS is not like this is
how you Gator my GPS is like turn best
turn right now turn so yes and the
inconsistencies the one thing I say
about archive is that we are
consistently inconsistent and that is
because we are in a constant state of
reacting to our environment so our
behavior depends on the environment
we're in our behavior is inconsistent
because our environments are
inconsistent so we're not the
inconsistent or inconsistent ones is how
our reactions are and how we have to
have such strong reactions to our
environment impulsive decision making
yet I mean we all have our impulsivity
and you know sometimes it's a good thing
and sometimes it's a bad thing sometimes
it works out sometimes it doesn't but
but they're all tools like these are
tools that we can use and and and we can
do really amazing things with them if we
just start putting them in that frame of
mind worth of tools
um you see other stuff associated with
ADHD important substance abuse Awards
child abuse family conflicts
underemployment smoking eating disorders
basically with our our low dopamine
levels we are looking for anything
that's gonna light us up so drugs yes
alcohol yes porn yes
I'm shopping yes and and these things if
not these if these things or bad I mean
you know you don't want to be like doing
meth or anything but I wouldn't mind a
little joint now and then but what I'm
saying is these things aren't bad but
but we're self-medicating sorry that's
again but we're self-medicating and we
are going overboard so if we balance it
out like you know going out and drinking
occasionally is fun you know I'm going
shopping occasionally is fun and you
know I don't know if you want to watch
porn I mean it doesn't do anything for
me but I'm sure it could be fun like if
you do it occasionally but it's when we
do it too much and we're self-medicating
with it that we can become unbalanced
and and as 88 years we we have a hard
time obviously kind of controlling those
impulses and then when we get into it
something we want something to make us
feel good we want that dopamine drop and
then we so we filled a dozen you drop
and then it goes away and we're like I
need some more dopamine so since then
just this continuous cycle and so what I
do is I try to do other things that will
give me that so can we drop a I eat
foods Vic's victim you a dopamine boost
see I do things that give me a dopamine
beautiful I mean I slightly endanger my
life sometimes but it feels good it
feels good to go on adventures and I'll
go on road trips and drive somewhere
I've never seen because even on a road
trip even if you're just like I'm going
to go take an hour and drive somewhere
random and you're seeing new things
doesn't matter if it's a farm or
whatever these new spice and everything
like your brain up so there are natural
ways that we can line our bringing up um
without kind of going towards these left
healthy Austin that is me getting
arrested for real and I didn't really
know that he was going to keep the
handcuff on because my husband was like
my get a picture um so these things poor
driving records you know all of these
things that have to do with not being
with the controller impulsive is about
trying to self-medicate supported this I
was arrested because I got a ticket on
New Year's Eves and I actually caught my
hair on fire
which is why my book was named Kirsten
I'm taking our vampire I got the ticket
it was three tickets okay three tickets
it was like great whites and no
insurance and Lola well then they had a
warrant roundup so of course I didn't
pay my fee and whatever so so they um
they actually came and got me and
arrested me in front of my children and
uh and then took me with them in the cop
car on to gather the rest of the
criminals which was like the best day
ever
I was like I was in a funk before that
happened okay
after I got arrested I was like high for
six weeks
my my chemicals were just on point
because it was it was so funny I mean it
they were really cool and we would go to
places and you know they'd show up and
not there was like SWAT team style to
like it was hardcore it's like I hope
they didn't do that in my neighborhood
but and of course all the neighbors
found me getting arrested too but but um
and then they come back and you know
nobody would answer the door they come
back and I'm like you know they
were in there go around the back like it
was so cool because it was lighting my
brain up I was totally engaged with it
so I mean honestly like getting getting
arrested was like one of the best days
ever and it totally flips about
whispering and gave me those chemicals I
needed what I figured out too is that
roller coasters will be the same way so
if I'm feeling I'm feeling that good
feeling and I need to get a light my
brain up I can go ride a roller coaster
and that will help me for I don't know a
good week and a half so it's just
learning you sweetie to like not let me
up okay I'm going to do it again
we disorders are crazy like most the
time if you don't have a sleep disorder
you probably don't have ADHD because oh
I think the baby was like that is a key
thing with ADHD is either not being able
to go to creep not being able to stand
please a lot of ABH years are on
a schedule where nighttime is their time
and it doesn't jive with you guys having
to be at work at 8 o'clock in the
morning so um I'll go to them okay
fellows would you get worked not only
quantity exactly it doesn't drive the
fun confidence and type of medicine no
it doesn't matter thing if you're like
if your medical your medication it's
like to 8:00 in the morning to 5:00 in
the afternoon and it's one of those is
working yeah yeah and it's like and some
people can't even take a bit like their
third if their third dose because it
messes with their sleep so much and I
run around like an unmedicated maniac
most the time and left and I happen to
have an easy time getting to sleep I
just can't stay asleep but a lot of
people are are those night out like how
we roll um it's easy to see why we how
do we have such a hard time when it
comes to executive function skills
because not all 88 years are impaired in
their executive function skills but a
lot of us are and that's where those
executive functions of where all the
stuff like organizing prioritizing focus
alert
you know modulating your emotions and
using your your memory and your recall
and self regulating your emotions
that's all executive function if you're
an 88 here without those executive
function skills I mean that shows you
right there right there and not one
little thing and it says you from
attitude mag I'm calm by the way I have
to tell you guys they are the most
amazing online resource I love them they
have saved my life they have so much
material about everything if you want to
get online and learn about 88p so that
out of food marathon they are amazing
but yeah so suits so we're we're sis do
in a normal person executive function
you can analyze it half you can plan how
you're going to dress it you can
organize assets you need you have a
timeline you know what you have to
done in order to be done and you ship
the sex if you need to if you don't have
that if you don't have those executive
function skills then um you know we're
not working with anything um oh here's
another one of the mindful lifestyle
techniques so this is something that's
really cool a lot of times we have
problems calming ourselves right whether
we're mentally or physically agitated
and proprioceptors are what we have in
our body that that send message a
message to our brain telling us our
brain where we are relative to space ok
so so when you're proprioceptive are
activated its pacing to your brain ok
you're all good you're standing upright
you're you know you're doing everything
you're supposed to do and there's this
calming sensation so so something that
you guys can you know if you talk to
your kids or whatever at what I notice
myself hearing this all the time and I
will just sit there and squish my arms
and it's activating those proprioceptors
and it's telling my brain it's all ok
you're all good and it gives you that
kind of relaxing and I can do it in my
hands too so it's just it's something
it's a really great tool that you can
use and you can find more that stuff on
brain gangster calm and art I'd also
have to deal with with the three T's
which is like the insane cycle of
perfectionism procrastination and
paralysis right
look at my Magritte you come in when we
have these big long-term projects
there's no deadline so it just feels
like it's going to go on for freaking
ever and none of us are good at
long-term projects like we want to be in
kick-ass on the project and then beat it
and go on to the next one because that's
that's how we can sustain that focus and
not how we sustain that interest because
after a while when a projects going on
too long we're not we're losing interest
in it like it's not like I thought like
it should so with this profession to the
note
time's it it will fall on on a project
that we're doing because um you know if
the especially when we're those those
whole learners a holistic learner earth
we have this black and white concepts of
what the whole picture should look like
and when we're just getting started on a
project because we have this grand
vision of what it should be when we're
starting the project we're going ok I'm
gonna do this wait this is this Pulitzer
Prize winning sentence right here no
okay I'm going to start over okay so
it's like if we can't do it perfect then
we will procrastinate on it right we
need to do it perfect well then you
start procrastinate you guys know what
happens when you start procrastinating
that stuff turns into a monster like it
could be a phone call how many of you
guys hate phone calls making phone calls
it's the worst thing ever right like if
I have to call like a doctor's office or
it or what love ya in terms of you know
you I can't do it my husband is the
phone caller because I cannot even force
my so it'll be like okay I'm going to
make the call and then the next day it's
just like this is that doesn't feel fun
I'm not going to do that and then it
just gathers this this this intensity
and it turns into a monster and then
finally like you're forced to doing you
like oh my god that gives me one minute
and I just waited three months three
months to do it it's so crazy so yeah I
mean we was just messing all of the
paralysis it's because you can always
choose to not do it undefined long-term
project right oh yeah you totally can
but sometimes you can't choose you know
sometimes you can't and so so with the
paralysis I mean and I'm going to show
you tips like when we can't choose there
are ways that we can hack our brains to
get through that so huh
when there's a consequence right exactly
yeah it's a much more well that's the
thing it's like it's like and I'll talk
about this later but it's like
when when when we're doing something
that we if the world was perfect we
would not choose to do it and if
somebody else especially will build
resentment towards that person for
putting us in that situation right so
it's not healthy for anybody so yeah
I'll talk about that in a little bit but
with this with this perfectionism the
way that I that has really helped me is
this 80/20 rule it helps me just get
started because we're before I was
trying to be perfect in every single
thing this when I thought the 80/20 rule
it was like okay you know what I'm going
to lay down a foundation I don't care if
they're out here if there's misspellings
I don't care what I don't care if it's
not you know complete thought I'm going
to lay it down and I'm just doing is the
80% I'm spinning I'm spinning twenty
percent of my time laying down the 80
percent of the foundation and then then
when that's all done then I go back and
I will spend 80% of the time perfecting
that last 20% and that's really helped
me so that I don't get stuck in that
that then and then I don't have to
procrastinate because I'm like I'm not
putting any expectations on myself you
know there's nothing to procrastinate
because it's not an issue I don't have
to worry about it being perfect and it
takes a lot of pressure off so the 80/20
rule I just love and balance is so huge
with us and and I want to talk to you
about the cave because the cave gets the
cave it gets confused with depression a
lot and for us the cave is it's just a
safe place to go when either were
overwhelmed or we're over stimulated or
we have just come off of like a big
project you know how like big projects
to flip your app and and so the cave is
there and even if you just need to like
maybe something happens and you need to
process some information when we have
stuff going on around us we're not
processing information
we're basically like dodo dodo you know
China so there's no processing going on
so that stuff just stays in our head and
it just muddled up and muddled up and
nothing becomes clear anymore and so the
cave is like it's not depression it's a
space to go to process it's a space like
sometimes when I process I will sit on
my couch and I will look out of the
window for an hour and hour and a half
and I don't have any involvement with
what's going on whatsoever I just let my
brain do its thing if it makes sense I
don't care I'm just letting it do its
thing because that processing is so
important and it's so hard because when
you come home and you've been so
overstimulated at work all day and then
your kids are like oh and your husband
like I need this when I need this or
your wife like I need some time and your
look like I I need to like have some
alone time and people take it so
personal when you when you need a loan
time they think it's them and it's again
what's our thing today my gosh you did
it's not if I need some alone time
it's I need the process I need to figure
this stuff on when I do I will be a
better wife I will be a better mom I'll
be a better friend because I have
cleared my head and I've allowed you my
brain what it needs to do and we do it
we do get it confused with depression
and what's really scary about the cave
is that it feels like you're going to be
in there forever like you don't know
you're going to pop out of it and you're
pretty much numb you have no emotion and
you again feel like oh my gosh what's
wrong with me and and there's nothing
wrong it's like it's like okay the pixel
right the pixel it can stay charged for
how long I do write which is amazing it
puts off this energy but as the day goes
obviously the charge gets less and less
and less and less okay
well that's like us obviously we're
putting energy out but then when we
when we plug the phone in this is a
pixel when we apply those phones okay
will you plug the phone in um so it's
you know say we have 10% we plug the
phone in and I'm like oh I'm going to
make a call on it oh I better look
online oh I better and it's like my
existence
why is it still at 2% you're using it
you're not letting it fully retards it's
never going to retard if you don't leave
it alone and just let it get back to its
full charge and so that's what we are
like we are like that in that we have to
I cannot even tell you enough how
important it is to implement this in
your life and to educate people around
you that you have to do this because if
you don't you will be in that cave
forever and the worst part about the
cages when you don't understand what it
is you fight it because you think it's
suppressed and you think it's whatever
you think it you feel bad about yourself
because you're there you feel bad that
you're putting other people through it
and so so you know we have to we have to
let ourselves go through that process
how are we doing on time I'm still
recording that if we can that's true oh
yeah yeah yeah you're always good what
we go through one but a little bit
better so I'm basically you know it's
about balance we have these basic needs
for our time are these excessive alone
time processing time our retard time
simulation going into float structures
but not structured that is a sum on us
structures that allows us to move within
it but doesn't but tethers us so that
we're not flying away if that makes
sense and we need to grow we are
creatures that need to grow and evolve
that is how we are and our need for
freedom we cannot have people telling us
what to do and where to be and
everything else and that again that
needs for fairness when we run god it
looks like addiction depression anxiety
disease weight issues high risk behavior
this is the thing about balance when we
don't we don't like on a teeter totter
right
normal neurotypicals would balance late
they stand in the middle of the
teeter-totter
right and they've gone that's not how we
roll we are like what it's like we're
like back and forth this is how we are
balancing constantly constantly just as
our every single day and these people
that are like look at us aren't you
exhausted yeah it's exhausting it's
exhausting existing this way it is so so
give us these coping skills let us you
only need to make it through 81 years of
this and the best this is the best thing
I love the same though on me and I
want to fit on you don't have people
saying you should do this you should do
this you should do this you should do
this because they don't know you they
don't know how you work they don't know
how do you think so don't on me and
I want it on you release all the
expectations of the people surrounding
you because it's because it's
coming from their point of view not
release the expectations that don't jive
with you just like I said with the
Christmas party it didn't join with me I
know I might have Facebook people see my
pin all the time why do I have to sit
there and go through the stress of the
holidays which is totally insane for 88
years anyway
laugh at yourself the stuff is funny I
mean the things that I have done pulling
gas pump out of their sockets and I mean
it we do funny slowly it is funny he has
to have a sense of humor about the stuff
that happens and so stop beating
yourself up set yourself up for success
by you know enlisting help from your
your family and your friends and and
tirelessly explore your passions because
that is something that will motivate you
drive you like you up and make you
engage with your surroundings and make
you engage with other people connection
is so important and a lot of times we'd
disconnect from people because it's true
but so if we're doing it on our turn it
can be so positive so going to Bissell
and you know on the on when you're
finding your passion you you can't bury
yourself before you start by having
expectations like say you're like I
really love jewelry to buy me but how am
I going to make money on it we don't
have to make money on it don't put them
on yourself like let yourself explore
your customs without having these
expectations so you have to make money
or you have to do this or you have to do
this because you want to jump in and
roll around in it and see what it feels
like and if you do jump around and roll
around and you gain knowledge and then
you feel like you've learned enough
about that happen move on to the next
cotton like people or so oh you can't
focus oh you're always interested you
know I never sleep in a bunch of stuff
and I want to know a little bit about a
lot of things so if I want to move on to
another passion with me that's my thing
that's what I want to do and that point
I know so much about so many things
because I allow myself to do that and
it's okay to be a jack of all trades and
master of none in the work environment
having leaders that delegate half by
strength versus just a job title is a
trend that is just so helpful and I
worked in a corporate environment and I
worked for the spread in the president's
office for a young restaurants
international which is like Pizza Hut
KFC so I you know working for the
president his admin was my boss and she
was so freakin smart about seeing the
gifts that I had and so she delegated
that way she delegated these six people
by the gifts and not in their strengths
and not just by a title because because
I was never succeeded in that in that
environment if she had have done that so
obviously the best best creators are
seeing that have high accumulation
firefighters police officers yeah ER
doctor would you go by Calgary you talk
a little bit more about this just a
project oriented because that's a big
thing
are you having so many times we have
projects we did we have to spend time on
yes what do you mean by tests the don't
last long
hello the projects that don't lots of
those never-ending projects the projects
that are we going to last forever we are
balls to the wall that is how we roll we
cannot put that much energy that we put
into things for an extended amount of
time so we will go in with our whole
night but but we can't we cannot sustain
that energy so that's why those
short-term projects we can kill it on
those because we can if we can express
our energy and sustain it for the
shorter amount of time so if we get
handed say a big project that we know is
I mean just looking at it a you know you
need to be a year-long project oh if we
can have somebody that can help us break
down and breaking exactly sure here's
the here's the broke here's the big
project here's a big picture here's yeah
just part of it because we can see the
big picture but we're not seeing the
details and not why we have somebody
that can come in and they can see the
step there's a logical thinkers they can
they have that sense of time where they
know this deadline should be here this
deadline should be here this deadline
can be here subway yeah you totally have
to work together like we can't do it on
our own because it's just in our head a
massive project where we start what are
the yo what are we working with so
having someone to come in with a linear
mind and those skills to break it down
for you and that's exactly what my
business partner and I do because he can
see the whole he can see the whole
picture I build it because I can see it
I can build it but then see perfects it
so I do the ad and he does the 20 and
that's how you work out so well because
we have found hearing them together eh
see we have found that we have those
different strengths and then putting
them together is like the smartest brain
over so yeah and technology is on here -
um because it's because you're figuring
things out and we want to figure things
out like when I was a kid I had a drawer
full of
calculators and watches that we're
taking apart because I wanted to see
that inner workings like I wanted to see
how it works and so um yeah so
technology is life of great a great
thing okay so this is Chrysler TV as
this amazing guy Alan brown you can
visit him on Crestor tv.com
he has these TV shows that he does um in
these and and I'll talk about him a
little bit later but it's basically for
not just ADHD the entrepreneurs become
on computers mostly are ADHD right
there's just that like highly ambitious
parts of in so anyway in the workplace
um four point four percent of adults in
u.s. have ADHD eighty five percent of
them don't know that they even have it
and it cost the economy 221 billion
dollars due to absenteeism reduce
productivity vision fire showing up late
depressed and anxiety you name it
um so what Alan does on crecer TV is to
give you these brain hats and that's
what I was talking about earlier and
it's these ways that you can hack your
brain which we all know a hack is when
you go into the system and you kind of
flip some switches to gain an advantage
right and so the number one brain hack
is here it's a heart filled protein is
power ADHD brain do not do well with
simple carbs at all we are protein
powered people so in the morning if
you're trying to fuel your brain with
pancakes or waffles or bagels or cereal
or oatmeal and lots of steel-cut oatmeal
that has a fire in it you're giving
yourself a short burst and then you're
going to peter out and those energy
drinks it's the same thing and not only
does it do that but it's also like
killing your kidneys and caffeine is the
same thing so so you need to to have
especially in the morning this protein
that will carry that will carry you
through and not and what's feeding your
brain because when our grant when our
brain Peters out there's no oxygen to it
we can't even think and we don't even
know what we're working with is that
plain like you don't know how good your
brain could be if you were fueled with
the proper proper sources of fuel
so you know whether it is plant-based
I'm I'm actually vegan I do everything
plant-based I get all the posting I need
um or or if you're a meat-eater whatever
however you get your protein just make
sure it's obviously healthier protein
and then if you you know a lot of time
is at work you can see sugar and you
were talking about that back to your
life there's pot Smalley's there um and
under of course is just terrible but if
you fancy shirt is the best way to do it
if you eat some very fruits when you get
those nuts with it and now protein
extends that glucose so it's not just
like a short and then you crack it
extends it sustained your mental focus
if you incorporate that proteins harvest
kids because all the schools are not
free there's a crazy sister way all the
schools are not free oh no I know it's
so hard isn't it it's so hard for the
kids yes yeah you have to really get
creative on that um do what you're doing
now okay so basically you know when we
have something coming at us so it an
example is I know that I have to work on
this project but you know what else
sounds equally intriguing is that macaca
monkey video that I didn't want and I
really need to watch that too right so
that's my brain of doing this macaca
monkey video it's just as important as
writing your presentation and which one
sounds more fun a macaca whatever video
and so basically what Alan is saying is
you have to we have to physically label
something this is what I'm doing right
now this presentation is what I'm doing
right now anything else that comes into
the picture is BS and that's what you
say your BS so you light that up that
one thing that you're doing if you have
to put do note on your desk supposed to
do and it's about one thing do that
anything else that comes at you is BS so
do what you're doing now and when other
things come up just the rhythm getting
in the now means means that what
you're working on right there is your
issue any other things on your to-do
list we see these things of problems
like our to do list is problems to us
right it's not fun stuff it's problems
so when we're looking at our to-do list
we're like Oh which problem should I
start first well nobody wants to frickin
work on a problem so so we have to
change the way that we look at these
things and and and and not look at them
as problems and just say you know
there's no Pradas to-do list there's no
problem if it was a problem I'd be
addressing it someone spending was on
fire I would address it so I'm going to
forget about all this stuff it's like
knocking you know and get out of here
this is where I am right now nothing is
a song nothing is a problem have two
verses will do that is us changing our
perception on instead of I have to I
have to go do this it's stressful you
can feel in my body language in my tone
you know it causes a physiological
cascade of bad feelings the cortisol
drops because I'm stressed which means
I'm not getting oxygen to my brain and
so so when I have to do something as
opposed to you know what screw that I'm
taking control again and I'm choosing to
do this I am choosing to do this and you
can tell by my body language if I'm
choosing to I'm owning it I am powerful
I'm choosing it it's not going to run
over me I'm going to run over it so
can't your stuff from hats do too well
do I choose to do this and give your
amenities give yourself to this in a
bill give yourself permission to fail
because even if you start on something
and you say I'm going to set the timer
for 30 minutes and I don't care if I
fail I'm just going to get started
because you'd be getting started seeing
me on problem with right so give us just
say 30 minutes if you can't do 30
minutes give yourself three minutes give
yourself three minutes open up the
document and name it and save it and you
know what tomorrow you'll get on there
and you'll have started you'll have
already started so you push through that
barrier already
so those are the things that kind of
those brain hacks and that can help you
out so we can be happy as 88 years we
can be happy I am so happy go and put
flow connect or disconnect depending on
how you feel
serve others move your body look into
meditation and deep breathing because
there are so many benefits to it unplug
from from your electronics in your
social media and eat your feature
protein make your brain food
practice you're a long time check in
constantly with your moods and your
emotions are recalculate as necessary
expand your perception when you're
buried become introspective when you're
overwhelmed and you can even use on like
geographical balancing I use mountains
or open depending on if I'm going to
ground it or not
so anyway mind mapping is a great way
for you to organize your thoughts if
it's up a list if you have a personal
linear review and if you especially like
with the kids they can relate to this
and this is how they can see and you can
see everything clearly when you have a
mind map so anyway that is ADHD that is
understanding our superpowers and
there's so much information I hope you
guys go check it out and obviously go
check out my book here it's not typing
our hair on fire and you can find me on
Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and
Twitter and thank you so much for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
