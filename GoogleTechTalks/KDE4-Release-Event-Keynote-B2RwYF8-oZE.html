release technical innovation technical
excellence but we're also celebrating
the next generation of the UNIX aunt
desktop we're celebrating new stuff but
we're celebrating most of all
contributors people that people together
make up the KDE community so that's what
we're here for let's party 11 years ago
an international team of technologists
artists translators documentaries and
communicators started to assemble today
we form the heart of a global community
that is thousand strong we've worked
together across all divides human and
technical to create software for all
matters of people devices and systems
and in that time we've accomplished what
few thought was possible we've created a
coherent and innovative user experience
erected entirely in the open using a
process based on participation some of
us that participate are entrepreneurs
others are researchers or professionals
in our respective fields we were all
technology enthusiasts and together we
make que te and to celebrate the launch
of 40 I like to share with you what it
means to be que te it all starts with
freedom so as you know katie is a free
software project as in freedom software
and our core values suggest that we
should all be free to do various things
we express that in our software in
particular we believe that you should be
free to own your own data you should be
able to choose your vendors and you
should be able to explore create and
learn without artificial external
restrictions upon that I hear someone
clapping at the same time it's not all
serious as well you think that everyone
should be free to have fun while they're
using technology they should be able get
the work they need to get done done and
most importantly we should all be able
to connect with others just like us
through technology so when we started
Katie for designing it and thinking what
are we going to do with it there were
three primary principles that we kept
returning to over and over and over
again in our discussion
in our conversation there's my barely
see it first one was beauty we want to
make a system that was pretty and
beautiful at all levels we wanted to
make something that people would be
proud to show their friends that they
would congregate around when i booted up
on a laptop screen we wanted something
that would stand next to a proprietary
competitors offerings of recent years
and people go oh I want that one I want
the Katy one that's a pretty high bar
but we set it for ourselves and we said
we want something just drop dead
gorgeous we also want to make something
that was accessible to everyone now that
means people speaking different
languages should be in their own
language obviously for years we've
delivered a highly internationalized and
localized system Katie 35 for instance
is available in over 60 languages so
with 40 we're continuing that tradition
but we also want to extend our reach to
people with physical disabilities so
we've put accessible accessibility as a
prime goal in katy 40 and we achieve
that we also wanted to allow people that
traditionally didn't get to use our
software we want to give them access to
our software as well i'm going to talk
about that near the end actually we've
got some pretty exciting stuff there and
finally of course we wanted something
that was highly functional we wanted
something that had lots of features
allow people to do things in new ways of
and accomplish well their work and have
fun while they're doing it so we kept
coming back to these three principles of
form function and availability while
we're designing things we found that we
kept thinking about these three things
as well parody performance and promise
now what I mean by parity is people have
come to expect a certain level of
functionality from their computers they
expect to be able to go online and view
youtube they expect to be able to share
their calendars with their friends they
expect to be able to play videos and
audio they expect to have bail you know
have a solitaire game there are
expectations that people have from
computing it's part of our of our
culture now having personal computers
around for
few decades so we realized we had to at
least meet those those expectations and
that was really the departure of KD for
was we SAT back we realized that with
catie three we had largely met those
expectations you could share your
calendars you could go online and do
your web apps you could play games you
could do content creation so for four we
realized we had to add to that that
level of parity and we had to do new
things we had to do things you could do
now but offer them to you in better ways
in new ways and that was really our
focus on the performance but we weren't
just looking at 40 in fact at the end of
my presentation the last half hour or so
the presentation Russian going to look
at the roadmap for Katie for because 40
is just the beginning all right we've
arrived at the starting line so to speak
and Katie for is going to have releases
that go on for years so we couldn't just
think about four point oh we had to
think about what is this desktop going
to be in 10 years I can be difficult to
do when it comes to technology because
technology of course tends to be fairly
unpredictable but as technology craters
we have no choice but to actually think
about these things so when we were
designing our software for Katie for we
had to think about what are we going to
do in the future what promise can we
hold out for ourselves and for our users
in the way we design our software so as
we take a look at Katie for we're going
to see these principles time and again
these principles based on freedom we're
going to see the parody the performance
and the promise of Katie for now Katie
itself and for the non-technical in the
in the audience I'm sure there's a few
of you don't get too scared this is the
only a block diagram I have so how does
Katie get put together right we talked
about the community rate at the
beginning we're an international team
but the technology how does I could put
together well Katie itself layers on top
of the operating system whoops eleres on
top of the operating system we use a lot
of system frameworks an example of that
wat is d bus and Katie for we adopted
the d-bus inter-process communication
protocol it's something that as a user
you'll never see probably but it's what
allows their applications to work
together and talk to each other in the
background we try to avoid recreating
wheels that already exist if something
exists and it works well we try and use
that so we rely very heavily on a lot of
the frameworks that come with the
operating system one of the keys that
starts to set kte apart from every other
desktop operating system available it's
cute the cute library has put up by
company called trolltech and that is one
of our fundamental libraries that we we
build upon to create the KT experience
cute itself sits straddles kind of
halfway in between the frameworks and
katie platform and we'll actually see
where some of that bridging happens as
we go through the platform now we're
going to talk too much about the
frameworks the operating system or even
cute itself this afternoon we have one
of the chief executives from trolltech
they'll be here to talk about that so
I'll let him do that he'll do a better
job than I could we're going to talk
about it's going to talk about the KT
platform itself this is these are the
tools and the technologies that we give
application developers so they can make
really great software our applications
themselves and of course is what the
user cares about right it's like okay
frameworks libraries yay I get to the
good stuff well we divide our
applications into three pieces workspace
and the workspace is what you would come
to expect from a desktop the windows
explorer shell the Mac os10 finder we
have an equivalent of course for that
called the workspace that we deliver on
UNIX and Linux platforms but in addition
to that we have core applications and we
be taking a look at some of those core
applications these are applications that
we provide alongside of our development
platform whenever we do a release and
next to our core applications we have
Suites of applications we have an
application suite for education we have
a suite of desktop games and amusements
we have an office productivity suite k
office we have a personal information
management
eight many of you will be familiar with
contact our group our solution so we're
going to take a look at the kitty
platform and then each of these three
groups of software when we started to
look at what we wanted to do to the guts
of our technologies our libraries or
frameworks we started to notice that
there are these supporting frameworks
that are starting to emerge and we
thought well there's supporting
frameworks the kind of like pillars
aren't they and so in the community we
start to refer to them as the pillars of
KDE 4 and these are the supports that
hold up the entire system obviously we
have the core libraries and these really
are retouch ups of what we've been
delivering for the last seven years in
KDE to and katie three these are things
such as our component system k parts our
configuration system k config these all
originated in either 2 point 0 or 3
point 0 and what we've done in
four-point-oh is we've taken them really
to the next the next level so for
instance our configuration system now
supports multiple backends so that we
can do things such as allow
configuration to be drawn from say
directory services but in addition to
the core libraries we've known for years
we've brought a lot more to the table we
talked about beauty in one of the
earlier slides oxygen was a project that
was started a few years ago we had a
meeting in berlin germany called the
appeal project meeting where we kind of
got together and decided try to quote
some ideas what we wanted to do and we
invited artists usability experts
developers and even business management
people so we had a really interesting
cross section and this is quite new for
us I don't think a lot of free software
projects take that holistic approach to
developing software and it really paid
off because the artists could see what
we were doing and they embodied our
principles and our means of working made
their own and they formed a project
called oxygen why oxygen well it was
kind of a joke at the time we said we
wanted to bring a breath of fresh air to
the desktop so they called it oxygen
oxygen started out as a new set of icons
pretty simple sounding until you realize
that our desktop ships with well over a
thousand icons this is not a small art
project essentially they're painting on
a canvas in this big making thousands of
pictures we looked at what we did in
previous releases Katie to Katie one
katie three and we thought we could do
this a lot better so the artists teamed
up for the usability experts that were
there at this meeting and in subsequent
months and discussed how we're actually
going to approach delivering the artwork
so in katy for applications you'll if
you look closely you'll notice that
there's some really interesting little
touches in the back in the Elizabethan
era paintings were often framed in these
gaudy huge frames the frames themselves
were hand tooled full of gold gilt they
were art pieces of artwork in and of
themselves beautiful frames don't get me
wrong problem with it is he couldn't
really pay attention to the painting
because the frame overpowered the
content after that period there was a
movement towards extremely simple frames
frames that looked nice that complement
the picture but stayed out of the way so
with Katie for we decided we should do
the same thing so the icons that we use
in our toolbars in our menus they use ad
saturated color palette they're
simplified there stay out of the way
they frame the content of the
application give you access to the
features you need without actually
interfering with the content the content
itself however again to the oxygen
project has been made more vibrant than
ever than ever we'll be looking at some
of the the applications in the demos in
a minute and you'll probably see a lot
of the the nice icons in the file
manager for instance that really stand
out and breathe but once we had nice
icons we started thinking about that
everything else started to look not so
good in comparison so they said well
where can we go from here well how about
we design how the windows look how about
we design how the widgets look what we
do a cursor theme yeah that'd be good
how about we do sounds yeah that'd be
good too
so we re imaged the entire desktop from
widgets to icons to our sounds and it
all comes in this form of oxygen so some
of the really nice touches that you'll
see you may notice is the title bar for
instance and the content of the window
blend nicely together there's a nice
subtle gradient that holds it together
you run a non Katie for application like
an older kt3 application or say Firefox
whatnot you'll actually start to notice
the difference these little hints that
you may not notice immediately but when
you compare it to what we used to
deliver it's really a parent but of
course beauty they say is only skin deep
that's true you have to provide a lot
more substance than just beauty that's
where these next set of frameworks come
in one of the things we identified was
is kind of silly that computers with all
this horsepower and all this ability to
plug in devices and whatnot I can plug
in my USB camera I can go on a Wi-Fi
network and I can go to the next room
and going to another Wi-Fi network mean
this was Space Age stuff right 20 years
ago it's common today and yet our
software has really not been updated to
take advantage of these things so how
many people here have gone offline only
to have their instant messenger pop up
every five minutes saying I can't
connect to the online service why why
does it know about these things well it
turns out that especially doing
cross-platform hardware detection is
non-trivial and someone doing an instant
messaging application may not actually
be an expert and how to talk to the
operating system kernel or how if you're
on linux and if you don't run bsd and a
solaris box and a windows box and map
but you don't know what they provide you
have no way of testing so we wrapped up
a framework called solid that's about
hardware it gives us easy access to
hardware events so when i plug a device
in an application get an event you can
query how many pu cores do we have how
much memory do I have what is my system
setting the system configuration look
like
on the network let me know when new
networks become available what's my
power management situation now the
beautiful thing about this is we provide
a simple clear concise and go here at
API so that any application developer
even if you're not an expert with
Hardware can provide these kind of
features and we're starting to see these
features pop up in katy for applications
and it creates a better user experience
but even more importantly as the
operating system evolves underneath us
as you all know linux never changes as
the operating system underneath us
changes over time or even if we take our
applications to new platforms we don't
have to rewrite this code because solid
takes care of all the abstraction away
from the application developers mind and
puts it right within this framework so
you just say let me know what I'm on the
network and it will work regardless of
what operating system you're on and if
you are complying this program five
years from now another sore spot we
notice was multimedia multimedia and the
free software world it's been sketchy
and it's not because we don't have good
multimedia support we've actually
clicked that one a few years ago we've
got a number of really good systems with
a Z nor the end player or gstreamer
whatnot but we weren't seeing it in
applications and for the same reason as
Hardware proper issue it's too hard the
people writing the multimedia frameworks
kind of expected us all to be multi
media experts so if I was writing a note
taking utility and I want to record a
little bit of audio or let the user
record a little bit of audio along with
their notes I had to become a multimedia
expert so we didn't see a lot of
multimedia and now doing cross-platform
multimedia was even more difficult a lot
of applications we delivered in the past
would work multimedia applications work
on only certain platforms and we decided
that was no longer acceptable phonon
came in to fill that gap phone Ron does
for multimedia what solid does for
hardware it gives developers a
future-proof cross-platform clear and
consistent way to add multimedia
features very quickly to your
application how quickly
in around five lines of code you can
have an entire video player with seek
and volume controls in your application
this is going to bring multimedia to the
free software world now remember solid
with solid we can ask do I have a webcam
where is it give it to me with phone on
we'll be able to capture video in 40 it
does playback only the the capture was
uh was pulled out we want to be design
it's coming in for one a katie 4.1 that
is but these frameworks are going to
bring together new ways new
opportunities for developers so we can
actually say where's your webcam let me
capture it they put it to this mike
whatnot things that were black magic in
the past in free software VoIP and
presence for instant messaging is an
increasingly large part of people's
day-to-day use of their computers so
again we decided we need to fill that
hole too and we create a decibel decibel
which is still in development but how to
release just recently is a katie for
framework that builds upon the free
desktop org work being done with tapioca
and it provides the same kind of api
that solid and phonon do but for instant
messaging and for presence so we'll
start to see I think a lot more
pervasive use of messaging with decibel
acha naughty I just love that graph
because look so impressive acha naughty
what is I cannot II i was going to sound
a little bit repetitive because you're
going to hear this message over and over
and over again we decided that people
should be able to access their
calendaring and their mail and their
contacts a lot easier than they could
now they should also be able to the
performance side of it they should be
able to store as much mail and as many
contacts as they want they should be
able to get them on LDAP or local stores
and the application shouldn't have to
worry about it it should just simply say
give me a contact and all the
applications should be able to work
together so you won't have to reboot
synchronization issues so they're very
smart people in our pin group the /
information management group took a step
back did a very brave thing and said
let's not start with the GUI let's start
with the storage and retrieval system
and that's what I kannadi is all cannot
e is a unified a non graphical access
framework for all data related to
contacts calendaring and mail this is
going to allow us and already has
allowed us actually to expose this
information in place we never could
before we're going to see plug the
plasma desktop in a bit and one of the
things that that the automatic people
did was in just a few hundred lines of
code were able to bridge acha naughty to
the desktop so you can start seeing your
contacts in your mail scroll past in
real time as it happened and this is in
sync of course with your full group
where application cross many of us feel
that's one of the great untapped
reservoirs of talent out there our users
who are advanced enough to be able to
write in scripting languages say xmas
script or JavaScript Ruby Python we've
made it very difficult for them to do
this in many of our applications amarok
which is one which is our premier
multimedia application they provide the
ability of people to add new
functionality using Ruby scripts script
written in Ruby and an amazing thing
happened all of a sudden this little
piece of software could do all kinds of
things like fetch lyrics information
Wikipedia do crazy playlist manipulation
and we looked at that one that's a
really good idea now the K office people
working on our office documents wanted
to provide scripting support of course
perhaps not visual basic we want
something little bit better and of
course they cut the discussion came up
with which language and for those of you
who who know a few programming geeks you
may know that that's a flame war starter
right there yeah the people of the
Python East is and the rubyists and then
you know and then people like me saying
we need to keep it simple it's to go
with akma script cross allows us
two very simply add scripting support to
any cute for based application and
what's really cool about it is you can
write these scripts in the language of
your choice we don't make this decision
for you you're free to choose which at
which scripting language you want to
standardize on so if you're a company
and internally you use Python for a lot
of your stuff I understand there's a
company near here that does that maybe
you want to use Python to be able to
automate and control your desktop maybe
want to use Python in your office
documents and cross allows us to do that
as an application developer cross makes
it absolutely trivial again five or six
lines of code and you can actually
export objects from your application
into the runtime of the script and allow
the user to manipulate it sonnet is a
word checker spell checker and
eventually it will hopefully have
grammar checking as well they're working
on that I was really need about sauna is
it has the ability to auto detect the
language and it's multi-language from
the beginning this may not mean so much
to those of us in North America where we
converse pretty much daily in English
and only English but for those of us who
do business internationally or live
internet it live outside of north
america it's very common to have one
document in german another document in
English that they're learning French or
sometimes all three languages in the
same document spell-checking can be a
real pain in these situations well son
it allows us to say in this paragraph I
want it spell checked in German this
paragraph I want it spell checked in
Hebrew whatnot and it does this without
any configuration on the user's part
this is what happens when you give
people the ability the freedom to tinker
and toy and try new things this is what
happens when you're an international
project and they're not you know some
afterthought market over there in Africa
or Asia or whatnot it's there are prime
audience and you get these these this
level of internationalisation you just
don't see elsewhere dxs some of you may
have known this as G H NS we love our
acronyms get hot new stuff
it's a way to get updates over the
internet with just point and click one
of the things that we looked at was how
difficult we make it as technologists
for end users to use this beautiful
thing called the internet because the
Internet you can get all kinds of stuff
on the internets right but it's
interesting ask someone to change their
wallpaper go get a new wallpaper so they
fire up their web browser and they go to
you know digital wallpapers com or
whatnot they download one at sitting on
the desktop and they okay how do I do it
may well drag it to my desktop and we
make them go through all these steps
well dxs is the next version of get hot
new stuff it's a web service that allows
us to put directly into our applications
the ability to grab new data over the
Internet goes there we are so this is K
stars and I've got a whole bunch of data
in here and i actually just download it
while i was setting up this is i just
installed the operating system a few
days ago in here I didn't have all the
astronomical data well through dxs and
get hot new stuff I was able to grab all
of this information that is available
for free for personal use but we can't
redistribute it right so we give the
user the ability to actually grab all
sorts of astronomical data and it's
simply a click to install I've installed
the mole sonses uninstall I could click
again and i uninstall it this your
motion the user they need to know where
to go how to download the data where to
put it on disk then how to get their
applications to use it we've taken this
technology to freedesktop.org as well
this is not a que te technology per se
we're using it but it's something that
any of the the free software world or
the prior to world for that matter could
could use and this we have both the
server component as well as a desktop
component
this is one of my favorite topics social
semantics what the heck is that and why
is it called NEPA muck I don't know it's
a goddess of culture knowledge there we
go now I know Satan's is this is what
participation is all about this is a
European Union funded project it's one
of our research projects we have a few
of them going on in KDE and the goal
with this is to take desktop search and
make it actually useful for everyone
desktop search is a great idea right it
kind of brings google to your desktop
right allows you to go through and
search your files the short coming of
these technologies is twofold number one
you have a search app and it turns out
users don't want a Search application
they want all their applications to be
able to search so we need to be able to
put this technology in all of our
programs second of all people wanted the
information organized in a way that we
think now the computer may think it's
really cool to be able to find the word
giraffe in all five hundred documents
and it's happy with that I can find that
word all over the place as human beings
though we'd like to say i want the
giraffe picture that was sent to me by
email by john terpstra here he sends me
two wraps all the time I don't know what
that's about but ok being able to tie
contact information the provenance of
the information or where it came from
together with the metadata is what NEPA
muck is all about and then we put this
in all of our applications now neva muck
is a brand new technology it's a
research technology you're not going to
find this anywhere else we're really
taking the the technologies that were
tried and tested on the Semantic Web and
we're bringing them into your desktop we
use the RDF we have a defined ontology
that you build a pool and if you're an
RDF enthusiast you'll hear some of the
those buzzwords so we we have a system
inductor that we use we default to one
called street
and NEPA muck cooperates the street g2
store its data and retrieve it making it
very quick to access your information i
already have stores things in a graph
the graphs are hard to traverse and and
and and search so we store that
information street east region can index
it tied into our metadata so your ID
three tags and your mp3s the who created
that document if it's a if it's a office
word processing document for instance
and ties it all together and then you
can actually do these searches and it
pulls this information then you can
start to traverse the graph from there
so i can see what other animal pictures
john sent me recently because it's so
new we didn't have the chance to add it
to a lot of our applications but we're
going to see it in a little bit when i
start demoing the the desktop software
exactly what we see one example of nepa
mock in action and it's really cool
because you won't know when we show them
this application people don't even
realize that they're using search and
tagging and rdf clouds it's it's
seamless and with ray within the
application for the software developers
how do people here have developed a
multi-threaded application how many
people thought it was the easiest most
fun thing you'd ever done why'd all the
hands go down oh one person okay so if
you need a multi-threaded app go see
that guy apparently he likes it well
again we looked at that and went
multi-threading is very important
multi-core systems are increasingly
common slap chop i have here has got two
cores in it remember thinking back in
the day wow you know one day wouldn't it
be neat if we had these machines you can
pack around with you they be small
lighten up day you know just take
everywhere with you and they'd have like
more than one cpu here we have it right
the future is caught up with us but our
software again hadn't really kept pace
one of the reasons because writing
multi-thread software is non-trivial
right just like the hardware issue just
like the multimedia issue and it was
impeding our ability to follow through
in the performance and promised parts of
our goals so we took under her wing a
project that already existed that was
doing quite well
called thread Weaver it provides very
easy access to the worker thread model
you essentially create objects you're
going to put in the thread you can
schedule the threads you can say don't
start you know this thread before you
start that other thread so you have
dependencies makes it very simple and
handles virtually all of the the locking
and whatnot for you you can also set up
a thread pool so you can say I want you
know four threads now that's really cool
when you hook it up to again something
like solid so i can ask salt how many
cores do i have i've got four great
let's start up a whole bunch of threads
right so we can actually take advantage
of the hardware that it's running on at
the time it's running again these
frameworks are going to intersect in the
coming years in ways we can only imagine
cute concurrent is a put that up there
in the slide this is something that's
that's coming with cute for now and it
adds even more features for those who
are doing multithreading one of the
problems of multi-threading of course is
that it's often specific to the platform
you're writing it on so writing them all
they throw it up on windows might be a
bit differently running it on Linux or
writing it on Linux these technologies
again abstract away all the platform
issues so you don't have to worry about
the difference is you get a very nice
API that looks like all the other api's
you're used to when you're developing
with KDE or cute so we've got all these
frameworks and that may sound like a lot
of stuff we've done what's really
bizarre is that that's only a part of
what we've done that wasn't good enough
for us so back in that slide where I had
all the boxes we have the katie platform
i mentioned that cute overlaps it i
forgot to mention this one we were
talking about phonon phonon was a
technology developed within the kt
project in the open in the free software
world and trolltech has adopted it as
their multimedia platform as well and
cute 4.4 and beyond so it shows how
there's a symbiotic relationship between
all the players in this in this
ecosystem they didn't have to recreate
their own multimedia system and have yet
another API that everyone had to learn
and use we're actually sharing this API
and trolls like actually works on it
directly within Katie's revision control
repository or svn repository I think
this really shows
the power of the model where we get this
great set of libraries in the form of
cute all these paid developers to work
on that and trolltech also gets software
in return as well that happens to meet
their needs I think that with Katie for
we really shown how well free software
projects that are working in the open
can also cooperate with business
interests so the workspace as our
frameworks what are we going to do with
it well one of the things we noticed
with other operating systems and Linux
as well was people wanted to do really
cool window management stuff they wanted
windows that wobbled or transparent or
translucent or did lead neat little
effects when you hit them and this has
been available on Linux for a while now
compiz barrel if you're familiar with
that of course on OS 10 on Windows we
want to provide that and so we put this
this support directly within our window
manager and I've got a little demo video
here to show you some of the features
and functionality in our compositing
window manager that you get when you run
the KT workspace
a short garnish
some a really cool topping right there
is he's typing in and as he types
actually matches the window title so he
keyboard fanatics have a benefit for us
two bodies mom
so you may have noticed that some of
those effects are more useful than
others but what's really interesting we
talked about accessibility making our
software available to all people a lot
of those features you saw in that video
are absolutely critical to people with
vision issues you saw the free zoom and
actually it's oom Xin and you don't get
these big pixel blocks you actually get
the sumas if you're using an actual
magnifying lens this is very important
for for those those individuals who deal
with ocular issues so it's not all just
prettiness so I'm going to take you on a
brief tour here of some of our work
space applications we have a new run
dialog here that actually ties into the
search and metadata so you can type in a
keyword it will actually search through
your through your system and pull things
up it also will do things such as has an
embedded calculators you can do equals
and some numbers what's neat is it's
plug-in based so we can actually extend
it and add new types of matching runners
one of the ones that is being worked on
right now is ability to teach it new
things so you type in a word or phrase
it doesn't know you select that action
and I'll actually go so what do you
actually want me to do next time you
type that in and you can actually teach
your system how to respond it's kinda
like having a dog right so this is our
new file manager we we shipped conqueror
for many years and catie three and two
and it works very well it's an amazing
power tool not everybody wants a power
tool they don't want a big file browser
that does everything I personally love
conquer I'm sure many people here in
this audience do as well but for a
different audience of people who want to
just a file manager a simple way to get
around their file system and whatnot we
brought in dolphin now I love showing
dolphin because it it demonstrates so
many of the qualities of katie for
or number one you can see a lot of the
oxygen artwork that is new we paid a lot
of attention to usability so we have a
red crumb that we find that most people
find easier to actually use to navigate
around and you can do things such as
click on one of the buttons and go
somewhere else it really helps abstract
away the concept of you're dealing with
the file system of course you can still
click on it get your traditional you I
we still have network transparency see
if I can connect to a home here and
what's cool is when you go back to the
other we are this is my one of my
servers back in Calgary and when you
actually go back to the the breadcrumb
you can still pick your protocols and
your host name we really tried to take
to keep our focus on our emphasis on the
powers of KDE while making it more
accessible and approachable for people
now one of the things we loved is
animation to provide hints the human
mind has come to be adapted to a world
full of motion and as you can imagine
it's pretty useful to be able to tell
when something's coming at you with big
sharp teeth there was a time when that
happened to us a lot and so our brains
got very good at detecting motion and
over time we've come to rely on motion
cues to tell us when things are
happening we don't even think about it
it's just part of how our brain works so
we've spent a lot of time providing
these kind of natural transitions and
natural effects in katy 40 and we're
going to see more and more and more of
them as time goes on so if you notice
when i'm going to clear the the bar here
and i want you to pay attention to the
clear text button that's embedded right
in here as you notice it doesn't just
disappear in up here it actually fades
nicely in and out can you see that on
the summit you can good some some
projectors don't have refresh rate fast
enough to see it it's a very subtle
effect but the difference between
somebody just appears and disappears
some of it fades in and out makes all
the difference in the world it also
allows us to do things like get rid of
configuration options
we love the configurability of our
desktop because allows us to use the
software the way we want to right that's
part of the freedom of free software is
you get to decide how you want your
software to work the problem with that
is it often results in these
configuration dialogues that are full of
18,000 checkboxes so in a kitty three it
would not be uncommon to see a sidebar
like this and then decide the way to
deal with it I change the icons whatnots
to right click on it give them a little
set of options they can click through
great for power users not so good for
the average user so instead we thought
well what have what why can we just love
people to freely resize it and the icons
can adapt to that size and if you notice
they don't just jump around they
actually animate up and down as well
giving a very nice effect you'll see
animations in our in our previews on our
thumbnails over here on our information
bar as I change between different sized
objects which I need to find one and
they're all the same size for me today
great okay
oh that's because I'm on a remote system
let me go back to my home directory
there we go as you can see it's not
working for me today now great the the
icons actually do anime between the
different sizes and on the sidebar of
course you can drag and drop we've paid
a lot of attention to these kind of
little issues now over on this side
you'll see that I can rate a file I can
add a comment to it I can tag it very
simply a very familiar to anyone who's
used flickr for instance this is using
nepa muck so anything I do in this
little sidebar here to tag or rate or
add notes to it gets stored in an
application neutral storage system
street and NEPA muck so they can access
that same information from any other
NEPA muck enabled application this
allows one to tag and mp3 in the file
manager and then when the running a
Barack see those same tags and be able
to build playlist for instance on them
or use those tags to send them on to
your onto your iPod and that's why I
meant by being embedded right we don't
have a separate search app per se we do
have an interface for it but we're
putting these features directly within
or applications where people would
expect to find them if they're if you
ask them so where would you go and
tagged a file on the file manager I'd
open it up go to the folder and tag it
so that's where we put it and NEPA mutt
gives us the ability to do this what's
also really cool is with stretchy we
worked with freedesktop.org to come up
with something called decent we love
strange names Z some is a standardized
querying system so that we can replace
stre G with beagle or vice versa if
you're using beagle you replace with
stretchy and Nez some enabled
application can query that back-end so
we're not building hard we're not a hard
coding support for a specific engines so
that's our new our new file manager we
also have a new control panel called
system settings we've done a lot of work
on conqueror we have our help browser of
course and then we have our new desktop
shell plasma which unifies the panels
the task bars with widgets on the
desktop it provides us with a resolution
independent default interface what this
allows us to do is take these same items
and put them on even very small systems
or larger systems say on a TV if we're
going to make it part of a media center
or if we have our little handhelds there
is that fellow we're walking around with
the tripoli pc a very cool little piece
of hardware based on an Intel design
that has Katie on and they're selling
millions of them literally the problem
with as they had designed a UI for it
that fit nicely and there's small little
screen they had with plasma we're able
to provide or do a lot of the work on
the desktop and laptops where developers
live and then reuse vast amounts of that
work for a different form factor a
divisive with different form factors the
scripting we also provide scripting
support so you can write a application
or widgets in JavaScript with 4.1 will
be bringing in the cute WebKit which is
the reporting of the K HTML that became
WebKit used at Apple pervasively on the
iphone and Safari bringing it back with
WebKit we can actually display HTML CSS
in these little widgets right on the
desktop and with katie 4.1 it give us
the ability to do things like load apple
dashboard widgets directly onto plasma
and if you notice we've actually freed
everything up so we've got that I've got
a task bar actually on my desktop and if
people are wondering what what use is
that because I can't I can't ever see my
desktop that sits in the background well
we give you the ability to bring your
desktop in front of your windows so that
I can actually get to that task bar go
back to my presentation and it brings me
right no road we straight back to it
where is it was here somewhere I think
I've hidden it that's not good
so with plasmid we get this ability to
provide pervasive widgets written in
scripting languages that are resolution
independent we can make them smaller or
bigger and provides it gives us the
tools although we provide it in
four-point-oh a traditional desktop with
a taskbar in a start menu that you know
you can search again the search back
ends on to whatever search system you
have installed we provide the
traditional system it plasma is giving
us the tools to be able to reimage how
we actually provide then the the desktop
so here you see this the you know one
very early start of that which is
Twitter on your desktop I use all the
time now I never really use Twitter
before because I had to fire up a web
browser well now it's on my desktop it's
a control f12 away it pops in front of
my windows I type in it or see what
roofies doing for instance this gives us
a very easy way a very short path
between online services and the desktop
or your media center or your handheld
device so we're going to shift gears a
little bit and I talked about you know
promised earlier we weren't just
thinking about four point oh we're think
about what can work we go in five years
ten years maybe beyond that so we will
talk a bit about roadmap issues where
are we going from here right we've got
all these frameworks we've got this this
desktop that's this desktop shell it
started up where are we going oh I'd
like to share with you what our roadmap
is at the end of January this month will
be really will be tagging for release
four-point-oh point one will be
releasing a minor release every month we
haven't forgot about 3.5 because we have
a lot of users with very large
installations and they don't change
their their installations very often
right every five years seven years some
of them so in February we are tagging
for release three point five point nine
and I will come out with a new
enterprise version of our of contact and
then in July we'll get four point one
point 0 and then we'll start releasing
four point one point one every month 4.2
4.3 etc
so we were moving back now to our
release schedule a little bit release
discipline it was it was fun last two
and a half years of being able to
develop feature base release and go
crazy and julie's you know interesting
and innovative things but now we've got
the Foundation's laid our pillars are in
place our applications are coming
together and now we're focusing on
regular releases with noticeable
improvement in polish and feature
completion at completeness as we go but
here's what I think is the real could be
one of the real game changers
traditionally we have done very well on
Linux and the BSD s because most of our
developers run linux or bsd solaris is
an operating system that we are
purposefully targeting with Katie for
Katie three ran nicely on solaris but it
wasn't a lot of integration there wasn't
a lot of support from the solaris
community itself so we've actually
started an open solaris project a
project within the open solaris
community to actually manage the
packaging and the solaris specific
patches and improvements to katie for
now if that wasn't cool enough that we
had you know solaris the BS DS and linux
well we came to realization one day that
for every one of us programming on the
free operating systems there were
hundreds on Windows and Mac and we were
losing an opportunity here bringing free
software to all of these individuals and
giving them the same kind of really
great tools to create software that we
had and so in one sense Windows and Mac
had for a long time been kind of a free
software ghetto you just in really have
it didn't have access to all the stuff
we were developing on Linux and BSD all
of our frameworks as you noticed
abstract away the platform specific
details like solid and phone on and so
it happened that with Katie for we
worked on ports to Windows and Mac OS
now this isn't just a Linux
compatibility layer or some that we
layer on top of it it looks completely
for and you have to run an X server on
your Mac os10 desktop or anything like
that these are native applications they
run natively so they build it
like any other mac application or any
other Windows app these are in
technology preview right now they work
they build in fact we're going to see in
just a few moments here where's Ben come
on we're gonna see we're going to start
to see we're going to do some quick
tours and walkthroughs of the support on
Windows and Mac so you actually get to
see firsthand I just want this out so we
get to see firsthand what this looks
like and the goal is to deliver these in
a production quality for 4.1 now as he
may have imagined porting to these new
architectures was slightly more complex
and different than say porting to
solaris these are slightly different
these are pieces of slightly different
semantics and different backends we had
a support so ready to introduce Benjamin
read he is our lead Katie Mac Developer
he helps heard those cats and he's going
to take over and show us Gideon
Macintosh thank you thank you i would
like to start out by thanking the kitty
developer community in general for
embracing the new technologies in cute
for and the new build system and
everything else that made things so much
easier for us on other platforms see
mike has been a godsend cute for has
really made things a lot easier and the
transition was was much you know it much
more amazing than I thought it would be
there were a lot of times where things
just worked that I thought we'd have to
spend a lot of time making work so that
was that's very cool right now que te on
Mac actually in most cases is running
pretty well there's a lot of things that
work right out of the box you could go
check out KDE SI via era subversion
right now and build and have a working
application there's a lot of stuff that
went into that there was a lot of
development that the windows folks folks
worked on that I worked on that really
made it possible but in the end a lot of
the work happened in the community
and it was just a it was an amazing
thing to see how much things really
worked out with the new API so that just
made it all happen so I'm going to show
a few apps here this is Conqueror are a
venerable browser actually running on
Mac OS and it's working pretty well I
can go to a bookmark in theory and it
does have all the support k io support
that everything else does so you can do
HTTP and HTTPS and fish and all those
funny protocols that let you do wacky
stuff and it seems to be taking its time
of course since it's a demo also k stars
always good eye candy k star was not in
any way written with the mac in mind as
far as i'm aware but it actually looks
wonderful as a mac app it's one of the
first things i always show off when i'm
showing people with KDE on the mac also
an app that was originally developed
with the mac in mind it has a standalone
cute version is marble it's also
integrated into the KDE build and it
looks wonderful as well and if you look
everything looks like it should all the
menu bars end up on the mac menu bar
these are native apps they're not
running under x11 or anything i don't
have the xserver running oh hey my page
says that it loaded but uh you know it's
it's really quite amazing to see how
things have come together and the goal
is by KDE 4 12 really have things well
integrated to have you know a real real
finished release but if you want to try
it right now binaries are available
everything that i'm showing is from a
build that i did last week that you can
download off of the website that is not
loading in my demo wow there it is
ranger that users that think project org
slash KDE the binaries are universal
binary so they run on powerpc and intel
natively they're huge because they are
universal binaries so the everything
file they're all available through
torrent so that it's not destroying
anyone's web server the everything
installation package which is olive KD 4
plus K office weighs in at about a gig
so but that's it thank you so as been
pointed out it was amazing to see how
easy the software was to port over and
we really look forward to welcoming the
KT community or the Mac community into
the KDE community and vice versa and
seeing more people that are using the
mac OS and all of its wonderful features
and whatnot can actually engage with our
applications use them because we've got
some pretty good stuff too so the
synergies is great I actually had a
pleasant surprise recently I was in our
IRC channel which is Katie Darwin if
developers want to check it out I was
working on some stuff and someone had
said oh yeah I've been doing my k office
development on Mac and I didn't realize
that you know that anyone had really
been using it in earnest guy mostly I do
builds and I try things out and i play
with the guts but you know i'm i only
occasionally use the apps in the real
world as i'm still getting things you
know working and all that kind of stuff
so it's really neat to see that there
are people out in the community already
able to use it and use it for
development and just you know do their
own thing with it reach the developers
thank you very much thank you so
reaching out to developers was one of
the things we really wanted to achieve
one of the other things we really wanted
to achieve was to help the adoption and
spread of open standards and open
document formats this is key and
critical to maintaining freedoms around
the world actually if we can access our
data we can't access or information if
our government can't share information
with its citizenry if we lose our
information into a digital black hole
because in 10 years time nothing can
read that file format
have issues we have problems group where
is an interesting example of this
problem in action of a lot of people use
microsoft windows on the desktop you may
have noticed what is the most common
pervasive perhaps even the best group
where application on the windows
platform up till now anybody was that
yeah office which comes with outlook so
outlook gives people access to their
calendar and mail it's interesting how
look only looks really well with
exchange server you can support other
servers I've done it using outlook but
you start losing features it's not so
slick you get you know it just doesn't
look right interestingly enough
Microsoft is an overly eager to change
that situation and so unfortunately when
you choose a Windows desktop oftentimes
people feel that their only real choice
is to use an exchange server on the back
and you lose the freedom to choose your
technologies you choose a technology
over here and it forces your hand over
there so what if we brought a group or a
sweet that'd be familiar enough to
people that were used to outlook and
whatnot but what ran not just on linux
and unix not just on windows not just on
mac but in all the platforms that looked
identical in all the platforms worked
identically to all the platforms and
gave equal time to any group or server
that is supported well suddenly you can
have a heterogeneous environment where
you have windows machines mac machines
linux machines open solaris machines bsd
machines people using it on the desktop
your support team only has to support
one application those of you who have
supported outlook on mac and windows for
it you'll notice that they're not quite
the same app contact is so now you can
you can harmonize your support staff on
this one application same features same
bugs right across all the platforms
hopefully more features and bugs but you
also then get to choose which group are
sweet you use on the server you may be
surprised to find out but exchange does
not use a lot of open protocols a lot of
it's fairly proprietary
for those who would like to actually be
able to access their information using
open protocols and open formats you now
have the option to pick your server and
your desktop and they're not tied
together at the hip I think this is one
of the very exciting possibilities that
we're opening up by bringing our
software both group where software as
well as office software which we support
the ODF the open document format as our
native file format we bring these
applications to these other platforms it
opens up new possibilities and with that
I like to introduce one of the windows
the katie windows developers Holger out
Marcus here last name time gonna mess it
up you can say it I am Oliver Florida
there you go I can't do the our thing
holder is one of our Katie wind
developers he's going to demo for us
kitty on windows yes I do so okay so we
start with k stars
the interesting thing on this computer
is right now I did not develop any
things on this computer right now by
myself I just installed the packages
which are downloadable from our servers
I will show them show the servers in the
end and well this is K stars I'm not
really used to using it but it kind of
works we also have a marble
I'm a lot more used to the earth so you
can zoom in find Berlin and of course
for Windows users we need games
start on there anyway sorry
yeah so you can become mcse with this
thing well we also have Conqueror
basically running and for all us KDE on
Windows users we are quite used to well
using google like this and it works so
it feels a lot more familiar right now
okay something else to show we do not
yet have K office running we are working
on that we do not have yet have
Conqueror running we're working on that
but besides that it's quite usable right
now and we try to aim at being really
stable at KD for that one um yeah I want
to show how to get to install KDE on
Windows you go to windows start KDE dark
they will find a link to download our
installer it's some megabytes so I
didn't download it right now it looks
like this the interesting thing about
this installer it's it's a cutie binary
which you install on computers once and
then it downloads the description of how
to install which programs over the
internet so we are not distributing some
kind of packaged self-extracting XO
files once and then we leave the user
alone with this we enable the
opportunity to update things they
install it once and also when we have
for example k office running and I don't
know some months the additional
applications which will be available
then we'll show up in this installation
program so for example if we want to
install KDE somewhere we simply mark the
things we want to have then say download
and it shows additional dependencies and
then it starts downloading so it's
basically usable for normal end-users
and well that's about it so I think is
remarkable is again you saw k stars
marble conqueror on all these platforms
and there's not a lick of platform
specific code in any of those
applications right this all happens in
the framework layers so as application
developers you can write one codebase
you can develop it on windows if you
wish and you're not locking yourself out
of the growing Linux community or the
growing mac OS community or vice versa
if you prefer to develop on a free
operating system free software ring
system like linux or BST open solaris
you're not giving up the windows
community or if you want to develop on
Mac you're not giving up the Linux
community other with it so we're
bringing all these communities together
of users which really opens up the door
and it's been fascinating to actually
watch it unfold and happen and really
how easily it come together it's so
amazing we are only about like 5 to 10
people working on the windows stuff in
part time and we kind of made it to know
so I'm quite amazed about that
and when he talks about being amazed at
it realized that they'd have done k
office yet but they've done the rest of
KDE that's like four million and change
lines of code we're not talking about
porting you know a 10,000 100,000 line
application we're talking libraries a
whole suites of applications it's really
rather impressive so when for 14.1 comes
out to mention July that is our goal to
actually produce production-ready
releases but don't let that scare you
off because in technology preview is he
saw if they already work rather well oh
and don't worry you don't actually have
to run the Katie apps from the command
line in Windows you can always spot the
the x linux geek when he pops up the
console starts using it right but you
can actually you know put us put the
icon on your desktop or it appears in
the start menu and you can launch it
directly like you would any other
windows app i think what is also really
interesting is that the widgets as you
saw they didn't stand out as oh that's a
linux app right oh that's a windows app
on linux this has been some porting
efforts quote-unquote for some
applications to linux for instance and
it made it looks like a windows app
that's running analytics machine and
this again destroys that barrier so
we're really opening up the the
accessibility of technology to more and
more people
so here's a case stars again on Linux
just so you can now you've seen on the
other two platforms and we saw it quite
a while ago it's the exact same
application k pat ok pads quite quite
interesting I mean everyone needs
solitaire right so you have to have that
otherwise you can't be installed in an
office apparently now as you notice
there's these really nice smooth
animations things switching and turning
and what's neat is if I change the size
of the game it actually rear enders and
you don't get pixely bitmaps and whatnot
how do we achieve this well part of the
beauty thing again was we've pervasively
used SVG which is an open standard
format for vector graphics SVG actually
has a lot of capabilities some what
you're seeing here all of our games have
been retooled to use SVG so that they
can be themed easily and resize to any
size what's really neat is you can now
play cape at on devices that have really
tiny screens like Anna there you go I
can't see it anymore but it's there and
it is of course actually playable and if
I was on a phone that might make more
sense so we're taking these concepts
across the board with their applications
q tal talked recently released a windows
ce e port of their of their library and
it's amazing when you take divide these
desktop style applications to these
different devices how well the UI adapts
if it's written with resolution
independence in mind if it's written to
actually have a humane interface on it
instead of a highly instrumented with 18
million toolbars everywhere and of
course here we have marble as well
marble is really interesting because a
component it is an application but with
one line of code you too in your
application can have a spinning 3d world
it doesn't rely on OpenGL which is
really impressive in my mind a lot of
math going on the background and of
course you can provide different
overlays this might not be the place to
be talking about street-level mapping
parent all the Google people turn off
your ears no there's work started under
way with with the marble it is freely
zoomable as you saw on the other
platforms it also works on linux of
course if you zoom in right now you'll
notice we don't have street data we're
working with the project are starting to
irk the project called openstreetmap
which is all about freeing up map
resource information it's interesting
maps are highly proprietary usually
that's fine and okay i love google earth
so i should written with cute by the way
just why it's so easily portable across
the platforms i use maps google com all
the time that's great those are great
tools but i can't actually interact with
that data in a way that gives me the
freedom that I'm used to in dealing with
this sort of data so instead of trying
to free up someone else's data what the
OpenStreetMap people did bizarrely crazy
most of these ideas start with crazy
thoughts and ideas right was they said
well why don't we just get people to go
walk around the world with GPS devices
will record where they go and then we'll
upload all the GPS trails into a server
then other people that go on download
the GPS trails and then mark them up so
that they can label what the streets are
and and then we'll have street maps you
gotta wonder how many beers they were
having that night but great things start
with great optimism great things start
with a Dacia's vision and so we will
have eventually street maps where the
data is open where the application that
you access it is also open and you'll be
able to zoom in and see your
street-level mapping marble itself
already does tile-based rendering you
won't see it in four point oh thats well
hidden inside the guts of the code but
we can actually deliver tiles over the
network from a server and do the tiled
run during that we all have come to to
know and love in proprietary mapping
applications there's still be room for
proprietary applications of course
because they'll have features and
functionality that we probably just
won't won't provide but this is focusing
on people that really should have access
to this information
and just like with ODF which is being
the open document format which is the
iso standard format for word processing
spreadsheet and documents presentation
software it's being adopted by more and
more countries odf is you'll find it
countries in europe have started to give
the rubber stamp of approval so that all
there there's their files once we stored
in ODF format places in Africa I hope to
see more of it happen North America it
started it was tried on out in the great
state of Massachusetts and didn't quite
get through we saw some some pushback on
that but just as with ODF the adoption
is growing the open street maps we've
had situations i believe was the
netherlands that donated the government
had paid for street-level Maps for the
entire country and when they found out
about openstreetmap they said yeah
that's a great idea and donated the
entire set of data another country that
did vast portions of india has also
donated their data the united states
there right now in the process of
importing US government collated
information street level of information
of course you need for census bureau
right need to know what streets to send
your people to go ask for census that
information is right now as we speak
being crunched on the servers it's a
fairly big data set so it's taking the
months to actually rip through it but at
that point we'll have street-level Maps
for for the united states and it was
funny when i first heard about this
project I thought well I'm from Calgary
Canada so I thought I wonder if they
have now they won't have street maps and
my entire city's done it was amazing
this little guy here is just kind of a
closing feature later I really love it's
like any other desktop widget that we we
support you can rotate it freely put the
kitty upside down if you want you can
resize it and rear enders it's an SVG
what you're looking at here is four
lines of JavaScript provide a little
package little JavaScript file I dragged
it from my add widgets dialogue onto my
desktop and without the application
really no was going on it was something
running a little bit of JavaScript on my
desktop just like with cross we have the
ability to provide multiple languages
and we will eventually be providing
support for Python Ruby and whatever
else anybody feels the the urge to to
supply so I hope that I've been
successful in kind of giving you a taste
of where we are right now with Katie for
with the four-point-oh release and more
importantly where we're going I
mentioned earlier that you know we've
got years ahead of us it releases and we
do this platform has been designed and
built to last well into the next decade
we'll see just how far we can take and
how many cool things we can do but I
think we've built a foundation that will
survive and will allow us to do things
that just haven't been seen in computing
before at least on desktop computing
taking things out of the research labs
such as new pomoc and bring it on to
production desktop systems and is
interesting because it wasn't so many
years ago that we were chasing tail
lights right now I'm not that jostle on
the freeway we've actually overtaken and
we're passing our competition when it
comes to technology I'm really excited
about this and more than anything else I
am very proud to be part of a community
that is as vibrant literally thousands
strong as i said the beginning as
vibrant as
welcoming as open and is unbelievably
talented and intelligent as the KT
