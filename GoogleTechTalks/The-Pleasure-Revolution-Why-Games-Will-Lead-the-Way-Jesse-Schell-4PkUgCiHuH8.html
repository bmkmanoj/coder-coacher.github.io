and we are thrilled to have Jesse Schell
here to give a talk today I've been
following his work for a long time from
the dice talk to the game apocalypse to
the games for change talk he's given and
one of the things I really like about
his work is that it sort of it straddles
the commercial world and and trying to
make the world a better place
what he might not know is how many
different people he inspires outside of
game design I've got colleagues Rossdale
Editora who uses your work in
brainstorming it around everything from
UX to educational problems and then a
team that I work with in terms of game
based motivation and learning that we're
definitely inspired by our work so we're
very happy to have you here
thank you very much please welcome Jesse
Schell to Google hey everybody I'm good
to be here right so yeah I do a few
different things I run a company called
Schell games on the south side of
Pittsburgh there we had about 65 people
doing all kinds of different game
projects there I also teach at the
Carnegie Mellon Technology Center I used
to be the creative director of Disney
Imagineering virtual reality studio and
I wrote a book called the TRPA design
I'm curious that nice funny 10 talk that
I gave how many people here have seen
that few people some people okay cool
I'm just wondering what should be
recapping what shouldn't so I'll just
jump right in so yeah I think part of
the reason I'm probably asked to come by
today was a lot of the interest that was
generated from that talk that was a very
unusual talk for me because you know I
give talks about things all the time and
and that one actually suddenly you know
I figured was just another talk and the
next thing I know there's I don't know
200,000 views on YouTube or something
like that and how come you know I'm a
college professor I'm not at all used to
having people listen to what I say and
when I was talking about there was how
things were really changing in the game
industry and one of the big changes that
we've been seeing is game industry
traditionally is a very fantasy oriented
place it's about we put a little fantasy
on the screen and you have a controller
and you move through that fantasy and
that's what it's about but when we look
at the tree
have been happening in the game industry
in the past few years they're not
fantasy base they're much more reality
based we have facebook games that are
all about connecting with your real
friends we have things like the Kinect
and the the Wii Fit that are all about
using your your real body motion we've
got things that involve real objects
like it's your guitar hero and and the
webkinz and and things like that
and I started thinking more and more
about some of the trends in trajectories
that that are happening in that way and
combining that with the notion of
Moore's Law and an other technological
rapidity that's happening we're getting
to an age of disposable technology where
very soon we're going to be at the point
where every piece of product packaging
is able to have a CPU in it potentially
have a screen in it potentially at
microphones cameras internet connection
and I started thinking about well what
is it like what is a world like when you
start to have all of those things there
and then we start to be able to do
different things with human motivation
using those things and that I painted a
little picture that I think people found
up at least provoking right the the idea
being you know you'd wake up in the
morning and you go to brush your teeth
and you know hey good job 10 points for
brushing your teeth because you got a
Wi-Fi connected toothbrush right and
then more than that you know you've
brushed your teeth five times this week
so you're going to get a special bonus
points for that and then further you
brush your teeth for the full requisite
three minutes because the toothbrush has
a timer and so you get points for all
those things now who would want to give
you points who could possibly care the
the folks would make the toothpaste
because if you brush your teeth on a
regular basis three times a day you're
they're going to sell three times as
much toothpaste so if you just do it
once a day so they're going to come up
with systems to reward you to give you
coupons so you can get your your
toothpaste cheaper so then you go to
breakfast and you know you get your
cornflakes and in the old days you used
to read the back of the box while you
ate your cornflakes well now things are
different there's a tilt sensor when you
tip it out to pour the ball so you get
points for doing that and now you play
the video game you
on the back of the box and of course the
video game is connected to Facebook so
you can see which of your friends are
also playing the game and hey good job
of all your friends who eat cornflakes
and play the cornflakes game you know
you got the high score so you know good
job for you so then you're gonna go to
work and you get on the bus the bus I
don't want to get on the bus but of
course you're going to get on the bus
because the government is giving you all
kinds of points you know for using
public transportation that you can apply
for tax credit right and so you know
you're sitting there on the bus and
you're like well I guess I'm gonna play
a game and you could spend 99 cents for
Tetris you know on your phone but it
turns out there's coke trous and it's
free so you're playing that little coke
bottles are stacking up and that's fine
and then that suddenly reminds you like
hey I had that crazy dream last night
where my mother was dancing with a Pepsi
bottle and and then you realize oh
course it was the renter tainment system
and the renter tainment system is simple
it's a little thing goes in your ear and
it can detect when you've entered REM
sleep and then it starts to put
advertising messages into your dreams
and if you recall them in the morning
and you can kind of correctly identify
the products that were being put into
your dreams you get all kinds of big
bonus points which you can apply towards
those sorts all kinds of purchases so
you get to work you know on time good
job and you've been there you know on
time every day that week you know it's
Friday good job for you and you go and
you see you there's your office mate
he's right there and he says hey check
it out man I got one of those new e ink
tattoos I can change it to be whatever I
want but of course right now you know
he's got it set to what do you guys call
it a tattoo Gilad cents right you're
getting it set up for that so that it
kind of rotates through different ads
and you tell them dude here you're so
stupid why don't you put that so high in
your harm you should have put it down
low on your arm like me because everyone
knows the tattoo Google Adsense has
light sensors in it and it's only going
to give you points if like the light
sensors are touching it because we want
to know when people are seeing the ads
and just then you notice that your ad
and his ad are both Pop Tarts ads and
you know how this game works so you say
link sync
and he says pop-tarts and then you do a
high-five in the body electricity
sensors sense that you did a high-five
and so you're pulling some points and
points right and what the heck is the
point of that well the point is you know
you want something that's going to draw
attention to the ants and so they're
going to be these game systems that get
you to pay attention to the ads well
okay so then you're going to lunch and
you have dr. peppers all that week so
points points points points points and
of course you're gonna have a fifth one
because you know dr. pepper has a
special this week five dr. peppers in a
week and you know you get a big bonus
points so you do that then after lunch
you got a meeting and the meetings at
this other building and it's about a
half mile away and you could take a
shuttle over there catch a ride with
somebody but you're thinking you know
what I'm gonna walk because you're using
those Nike Plus shoes and the Nike Plus
shoes are connected up with your health
insurance company and you get like
points that apply to a discount on your
health insurance if you walk more than a
mile a day and further there's a
heartrate detector and if you get your
heart rate up above a certain level for
a certain part of the day you get
special bonus points for that which is
going to help with your health insurance
so of course you're gonna walk over
there then you're on your way home and
you do some shopping you go to the
grocery store and man the grocery store
is this crazy points festival that's a
huge headache to have to navigate so of
course you're going to pull out a phone
you guys probably would pull out this
phone but you pull out some phone and
the phones just gonna you in to tell
about groceries you want and it's gonna
do all the calculation and then BAM you
know you're going to get all kinds of
points for picking the right groceries
that are gonna get the best deals and
then you get home and and your daughter
says hey I got my report card I got all
A's and you're like all A's that's
awesome because you're gonna get a whole
bunch of points that you're gonna be
able to apply towards a scholarship and
I'm going to get the Barack Obama good
parenting bonus which is going to apply
the taxes so thank you very much
wait a second though did you practice
your piano today and she says well yes
of course I practiced my piano
you say well what score did you get and
she said well you know I got eighty five
thousand you know eighty five thousand
you've never done so well in that Sonata
gonna get 9,000 points from the Arts
Council which has the potential to go
towards an art scholarship so so go you
okay so after then you're gonna watch a
little TV
right maybe take a rest from all this
but but of course TV is a little
different now than it used to be well we
all remember the good old days remember
the good old days when there were ads on
TV and you'd skip them remember that
remember how crazy that was now nobody
skips the ads of course because every ad
is an opportunity to kind of get more
points and things because ever since you
know Microsoft kind of put the Kinect in
the living room which is a camera that
watches you all the time then they got
the Kinect 2.0 that can actually
effectively do gaze tracking at a
distance so they can tell exactly where
on the screen your eyes are looking at
any given moment every ad became a game
where you try and follow the logo around
and all kinds of things and you you get
all kinds of points and points and
points and points and remote controls of
course now have a little screen on them
and of course they're internet connected
you can see your Facebook friends
exactly what they're all watching on TV
at this given moment and you can have a
little video chat with them while you
watch the same shows and you play
multiplayer games together and you're
all getting points and points and points
it'll be a very very natural way to to
watch television so finally you're going
to bed right I'm gonna read something
just read and go to bed of course you've
got you know the new Kindle 4.0 and it
too has the gaze tracker in it why do
you need the gaze tracker partly you
want because it's handy it knows that if
you stare at a word for more than three
seconds you don't know the meaning and
it pops up a definition so that's kind
of handy but also Amazon's got that
whole thing where it gives book reviews
and you know people put book reviews in
but how do they know who's read the book
well now they know they know exactly how
much time you spent reading this book
and the more time you've spent paying
attention to the book or maybe you've
reread the book the more value your your
your review has online and you finish
reading this novel and guess what
achievement unlocked Microsoft bought
kitten bought Amazon I don't know if you
heard that's one of you guys is going to
bother my figure
anyway you but you've unlocked 500 now
and your your feeling Wow that's awesome
I finally read 500 miles it took me 20
years but I did I read 500 novels and
you feel proud but then you feel a
little embarrassed because you realize
man my 500 novel was this this kind of
crummy Star Trek novel and everybody's
going to know that because this
information is permanent none of this
information ever goes away right I mean
it used to be you know your grandparents
what folks did they read it and when did
they read them what foods did they eat
and where did they go and you don't know
any of that but your grandchildren your
great-grandchildren they're going to
know all of that it's all going to be
permanent permanent data and so the big
question that I think we face with all
this is this question of is this all
just going to be a bunch of gross
commercial istic kind of I don't know
sort of this disgusting mess or is the
fact that all this is going to be
monitored going to inspire us so maybe
be better people anyway so that was kind
of a little ending piece of that dice
talk that I gave that had it kind of got
people talking and thinking a bit and
after I gave that I was really surprised
at how how interested people were to
kind of talk about this and and everyone
sort of assumed I knew what I was
talking about and then I had some level
of expertise in any of this which I did
not and so I thought geez I better
figure something out so I spent the last
year and a half trying to understand
some of these questions about where is
this stuff going so I wanted to share a
little of that with you today so one of
the things people took away from that
talk is that oh we should get badges on
everything that you know people like
games games give little rewards and
badges and things if we just stick those
on everything it's going to be great
it's just going to make absolutely
everything better and and then and no no
that's no that's not at all that's not
at all right that's sort of like if I'd
been like hey have you heard about this
think chocolate it's pretty good people
like oh wow wow you're right this
chocolate is good we should put it on
everything
why don't we just put on everything yeah
we call it Chaka Fattah ssin yeah we
need to get some chocolate ocation going
on and I'd be like no wait stop please
give us a moment and and and then the
guy would say no no you don't know I
mean think about it like if you take
chocolate and you put it on ice cream
it's better right I'm like well well
yeah okay sure it's better oh I'm so
glad to hear that because I own the
world's largest cottage cheese company
we are gonna chop afire product and
triple our sales so we want your help
too - chocolate buy this and no no
that's not right now why that's not
right it's a little hard to think about
it's a little hard to put your finger on
if I ask you to draw a picture of why
watch often cottage cheese is a bad idea
it's just like it's just gross
and I just know from experience that
that kind of thing is gross but if you
had to kind of present me a like a
logical argument it would be a little
harder because we don't really
understand the the exact chemical
mechanics of what's going on there and
we have some of the same challenges
trying to figure this out with games
because man there's a lot of products
that's just like no chocolate is just
not going to help you it's it's not
going to help you sell more products
friend and the other thing about games
is like it's not like making games is
easy it's not like you just put it out
there and it just works and everybody
loves that there's plenty of bad games
that everybody hates because there's
there's subtlety and difficulty in
creating these sort of game structures
that people actually like the thing
everybody wants is this right you know
it certainly every day the things you do
and do the dream is perks and rewards
with the Disney Rewards Visa Card that's
what everybody wants to do we'll just
take what we've got and just add little
rewards to it and it makes it better
because pleasure is always additive
right if you just add more on topic gets
better but that's not true just like the
chocolate the cottage cheese sometimes
the combined in ways that's that's
undesirable and rewards can backfire on
you this is not this is a
counterintuitive thing this isn't
something that people intuitively grasp
but it's very much true and there there
are 30 or 40 years of psychological
research that
that in many cases the concept of giving
people rewards to do something in order
to kind of get them into the habit of
doing it is is often going to backfire
if you're interested in this there's
this great book punished by rewards by
Alfie Connery does a great summary of
the psychological research you know his
subtitle I love the trouble with gold
stars incentive plans A's praise and
other bribes because fundamentally what
they found is anything where you bribe
people to do something in order to get a
reward ends up not giving you the
results that you want it ends up making
people want to do that activity less not
more so one one of the the the first
studies was all about children drawing
pictures the children like drawing
pictures you give them crayons they'll
draw pictures here's a question what if
you pay them to draw pictures what
happens then well kids are like getting
paid so paid plus drawing pictures must
be just better well it's not really
better what what happens is it's true
the children draw more pictures but the
pictures definitely appear to go down in
an aesthetic quality right so you get
more pictures that are bad if that's
what you want then maybe you're okay
maybe that's good for you but the really
interesting part of the study is when
they stop paying and if they have two
control groups one where they they don't
pay them and one where they do the group
that they didn't pay them they have them
drop pictures on them afterwards they
still like drawing pictures the group or
you pay them and then you take the money
away they now become very disinterested
in drawing pictures the idea that when
you give someone rewards and prizes for
doing something it sends a message that
says this thing isn't worth doing unless
you have this other system in place
which is often the exact opposite of
what people are trying to intend when
they when they start giving you
incentives and rewards in order to get
you to start doing something so there's
a lot you have to be careful about there
and so then you have a questionable wait
am what am I going to do I love this
little video clip here from School of
Rock see if we get audio
now our audio is not too good you have a
magic knob or something no magical maybe
my master volume here
what kind of school is this
he's long time here
there will be no race our gold stars
forty minutes right so if you don't have
all those things you know what are you
gonna do right if you're like hey I want
this kind of gamification thing going on
but you don't have badges you know how
gold stars you don't have demerits what
what what should you be doing and is
there an approach that makes any sense
here and there's a great answer to be
found and if you find this book glued to
games by Scott Rigby and Richard Ryan
this is kind of a summary of this thing
called self-determination theory and
they took it an applied
self-determination theory which is I
think one of the most important
revolutions in the in human psychology
and probably in the last 50 years and
they applied it to games and I'll talk
through this a little bit cuz
self-determination theory isn't very
well known one of the things people
assume that games are all about fun
right if it's fun it's good and if it's
not fun it's not good and it's true that
fun is an important part of games but
it's not the only part of games and it's
not even the central part of games which
is kind of surprising and that's one of
the things that came out in some of
Scott Rigby's research was that the
things that keep people coming back for
games and predict long-lasting value in
games aren't fun but are these other
properties that happen to be the central
aspects of self-determination theory so
let's just talk through those real quick
because it's pretty simple the idea of
self-determination theory is that we
have our physical needs you know that we
all know about you know you've got to
eat you go to sleep and you got to
breathe and and all those things but we
also have psychological needs and
self-determination theory posits that
there are precisely three psychological
needs and then if you don't have these
you go kind of a batch of crazy right so
these are these the first one being
competence you have to feel like you're
good at something if you don't feel like
you're good at something in your life
you become mentally unhealthy second one
autonomy you want some freedom in what
you do and then the third one is
relatedness you know connecting to other
people and if you have all three of
these things you have a good shot at
being mentally healthy now the thing
that's interesting to think about is
this is these three things are things
that games are really good at games are
really good at making you feel confident
haven't you find your right skill level
and making you feel good at what you do
you have freedom to do play a game how
you want to play it and in fact a game
compared to say work you can stop
whenever you want and just walk away you
have you have this huge level of freedom
in games and most games are multiplayer
games in the in the grand history of
games the majority of them are about
connecting with other people so games
have an awful lot of those things so so
those are three different things to look
at when when you're thinking about this
and some people say well now wait a
minute I mean do we really have to get
into all the psychology stuff games are
just software systems we've make lots of
software systems games or software
system we'll make some of those it's
just another system who cares and you
could look at it that way but there's
some flaws with that approach and and I
love this example of the big red button
right say you know I said told you guess
what I've got this new tax software just
came out it's really cool all you do is
you get this big red button and you push
it you know you push it and boom your
taxes are done they're completely done
they're done weekly and we have
verifiable proof that they're done the
best that could ever be done in the
whole world you'd probably think that's
probably a pretty good he's a tax
software right Google might be sniffing
around that maybe we should acquire that
company right but if I told you that hey
you know big red button software we have
a new product everyone liked our tax
thing so much we decided we go into
games we have a new game it's called
Angry Birds and here's how it works you
press the big red button you win
and and you'd said that that's the worst
game I ever played is terrible right so
clearly there's something very different
between these two types of applications
there's something really really
different and you could say well it's
okay I guess it has to do with the type
of software but has nothing to do with
the software or the system it has
everything to do with the person who
uses it I have a friend who loves doing
taxes he really gets into it new tax
codes come out he wants to read them all
he's all excited about it when he does
his taxes he does from six or seven
different ways you know he'll what if I
do them this week cousin optimizing for
long term and this way for short term
and he goes on and on a dozen money
thinks it's great he loves it he does
his friend's taxes right but he hates
video games my five-eight him play Angry
Birds for an hour he he would just
whatever all right I'll sit through it
right so the difference here is the
difference between taxes for most people
or a half the thing Angry Birds for most
people is a wanna thing but that has
nothing to do with the thing it has
everything to do with the person who's
doing it and what they have to do versus
what they want to do so this is a very
important idea this hafta versus wanna
and and in terms of when people talk
about oh I want to gamify something it's
like don't I think what you mean is you
want to move it from the half the column
into the water column so then how do you
do that so the example this a little
further you know things that are have to
you know those are things that are Duty
I'm doing it because I have to a lot of
things tend to be fun work tends to be
on the half the side a play tends to be
you know on the water side slavery you
know that's probably on the half the
side in most cases and freedom that fits
the wanna side which connects back to
our self-determination theory their
efficiency this is an important one
Hazama is on the half the side and that
was one of the big revolutions right the
Industrial Revolution was all about
going from a survival economy to an
efficiency economy and how do we make
things more efficient so we can do them
better but the thing you think about
efficiency is you only care about it
when it's half the things nobody comes
and says hey remember I told you I was
going to take a two-week vacation I
figured out how to get it down
six days right yeah no that's no that's
terrible that's not what you want at all
because efficiency is not what you're
seeking in a Juana situation you're just
optimizing for pleasure you want to
figure out how can I get the most
pleasure into my vacation not not the
the smallest amount of time well that's
that's something but one of the big
realizations I had recently about the
nature of Halfdan Juana is things you
have to do are things where you are
avoiding a negative consequence you're
avoiding pain and suffering things you
want to do your mind is seeking positive
consequence and you know talk to you
know neuroscientist people there those
are different parts of the brain and I
think that's why this feels like such a
big flip of a switch when it happens my
friend who loves doing taxes he's
seeking positive consequences he's he's
looking for that moment when everything
lines up perfectly and he's got the
little optimized number and it just
feels so good to see all that whereas me
I'm trying to stay out of jail that is
the that's the consequent time I'm
avoiding now games fit into this because
well first of all they're they're
interactive and you know systems are
interactive but the thing about games is
they're designed entirely for pleasure
they don't have any other purpose if
they're not pleasurable they don't have
any point really and so more and more
people have started to turn towards game
designers as they've been realizing hey
I want to figure out how to put more
pleasure into my system I want to make
my thing more of a wanna system and and
hey you game people that's all you do
and games have a lot of things that
people like right I mean they they give
you the sense of clear feedback they
give you a sense of progress there's the
possibility of success definitely
because you know
if the game has made the game as
winnable and you know that whereas in
real life there's a lot of things we
attempt is it possible to succeed you
don't even know but with games you know
games give you mental exercise and
physical exercise and those are
pleasurable they give you chance to
satisfy your curiosity and a way to
solve problems and we love solving
problems and they give you a feeling of
freedom like we talked about I mean so
there's
a lot of things in games that we like so
when people talk about game of flying
things I don't think they really mean
make it like games
I think they generally mean give my
thing these qualities though some of
those qualities the games have how do I
get those into my my system because one
of the things that's changing in society
you know we went from survival economy
to industrial economy we're now moving
from industrial economy to a pleasure
based economy people don't choose a food
based on we hate which one's going to
give me the optimal amount of calories
and what's going to make me survive
through the winters
what am I going to like the most when
people talk about work it used to be was
well what job's going to pay the most
now we talk about well what's going to
be the most fulfilling I don't think in
the 1950s career satisfaction was like a
I don't know but I don't know if that
was a phrase back then but now it's
something that everybody talks about we
talk about it with school the school
have to be so terrible does it really
have to be so painful does it have to be
such a hafta can we make it into
something where kids actually want to go
and enjoy it and even shopping things
like cars look at the car ads there's a
few of them that are like yeah check out
our awesome gas mileage well that's kind
of about efficiency but but most of them
are about oh man it feels so great to
drive this car and you'll feel so
important when you drive this car really
cool people drive this car and you're
one of them right it's all about other
kinds of pleasures that you pick okay
that's just a slide so don't don't worry
about that
someone designed this and probably not
someone probably 40 dudes over eight
months arguing around conference tables
you know should it be stopped or should
it be halt you know it's a big thing
this was designed people said this is
the best way that we can provide this
information to people this was a
decision that was made this is the the
best optimal way to provide information
about problems with your computer
that's what errormsgs used to look like
now that we're in kind of a more
pleasure based economy that's what
errormsgs looked like
right how do we take this horrible
moment where our customers actually
showed up to use your thing and your
thing doesn't work at all how do we make
that into something a little pleasurable
well they at least give it a shot and
because the thing pleasure is like
really powerful right it's it's it's you
know avoiding pain and seeking pleasure
everything that the drive us as human
beings and our minds know this so they
keep pleasure kind of away from us they
make us do useful things in order to in
order to get it so it's it's tricky and
it's very complex pleasure is not just a
simple thing it's not just pushing a
button for somebody because we adapt to
things that are pleasurable and then
soon they're not pleasurable anymore and
and so if you're serious about I'm going
to make my system more pleasurable you
have to kind of step up to the
complexity of that and part of the
complexity is context people often don't
realize how much of pleasure is
contextual people will point to
something like say the frequent flyer
miles and they'll say you know hey
frequent flyer miles look they got they
got points they give you and they get
badges and they got prizes and they got
levels and it works great we'll just
take the frequent flyer system and we'll
put it on our system and it'll be great
because their thing is worked for 30
years and it's amazing and it's great we
just need to do the same thing but the
thing you have to think about is how
contextual this is most people to whom
the frequent flyer program is useful
it's mostly who its business travelers
right so now you think about the mindset
of your business traveler right the
business travel is is very very status
oriented the reason he's going on this
trip is because he's got to go make it
make a sale or give a talk or do
something where he's got to feel
important he's psyching himself up about
I can do this this is this is a thing
where I'm gonna feel important and what
do you know here's the airline company
right here who says hey you know what we
see that you fly a lot that means you're
important you know if you fly with us a
lot we're gonna we're gonna reinforce
that how
you are we're gonna call you you know
you're gonna be mr. platinum right and
you're like yeah I'm important I'm mr.
platinum and we're gonna let you get on
the plane first which is cool it's
slightly convenient but everyone gets to
see you standing there makes you feel
really important and it's better than
that they get to see you get on and then
they get on and they'll have to walk
past you they could have put first
thoughts in the back right think you
just reasons you could have done it but
they put it in the front so everyone
walks past and everyone can see you and
so you get this double sense of feeling
important so the whole thing is about
you know status and feeling important
now if I took the same system and I said
yeah this works so great we're gonna use
it at Toys R Us right and you go to Toys
R Us and it's like hey come on in you
spend so much money here you're now a
platinum level toy buyer good job
you'd be like oh my god I have a problem
I need to spend less money at this place
this is terrible right because you know
it's it's a different context it's a
context where it wouldn't make sense so
then you take the opposite context of
the of the frequent-flyer thing you like
the grocery store
no one's going around the grocery store
like on a flight in a Louisville grocery
buyer because that's know you're not
thinking about how important you are the
grocery store at the grocery store you
have a totally different mindset you're
trying to buy peanut butter and there's
these three peanut butter companies and
they're all trying to trick you and rob
you with their stupid little tricks
right this one it used to be a 16-ounce
jar now it's a fourteen ounce jar but it
stayed the same price right this one's
359 for 14 ounces and this one's 379 for
17 ounces and you're sitting there
trying to figure it God how am I not
going to get ripped off by the peanut
butter company not that you care about
saving 3 cents you just don't want to be
a chump right so you're sitting there
trying to figure out these pennies and
your mind is in this kind of save a
penny mindset so when the when the
grocery store says to you hey guess what
if you shop here a lot you'll save 10
cents on your ghusl and you're like yes
10 cents on my gasoline that's awesome
if you're at the airport and they're
like hey you fly a lot you can save 10
cents on
Selene you be like I don't need that I'm
too important to worry about 10 cents on
gasoline but it works really well for
them because they know the context so to
make these things work you have to
understand the context so we talked
about self-determination theory and
you'd think man let's just go and get
all the psychology stuff let's dig it
all up let's find you know find out what
the psychologists know and then we'll
understand this all because the
psychologists must know this the best
right that's what they do they know the
human mind and therefore they must know
everything about it let's just bring him
in here have them consult on our product
it'll be solved the problem with this
unfortunately is the psychologists don't
seem to know much about this
psychologists their focus tends to be on
preventing suffering and predicting
behavior in terms of creating human
pleasure they that doesn't seem to be a
priority for them and if you don't
believe me
go to their parties I've been to their
parties and I can draw only one or two
conclusions either they don't understand
about human pleasure or they just don't
care about human pleasure either of
those things is true they can only be
helpful to us to a certain point so if
you're going to try and figure out ways
to kind of put pleasure into your
products you've got to go much farther
afield and find people who know more
about it because there's so many kinds
so many kinds of pleasure right I mean
here's a bunch of them here and you see
how different these all are from each
other and they're all pleasurable and
every time I've tried to make lists of
all the different kinds of pleasures
there's always more
there's always something something
something more right I had a friend who
you know I was making lists I'm like
what do you think of this list and she's
like well that's pretty good but there's
there's so many things not on here like
what's not on here she's like wow like
you know I love doing craft projects I'm
like I got that I got expression she's
like no no I don't mean it I mean like
I'm doing craft projects and a lot of
times you get glue on your fingers and
it dries and then you got to pick it off
I'm like yeah so
what she's like I read I really kind of
like that when you pick it up
it's really just that really I love that
I don't know why and I just and it's
sometimes are I'm on the phone I'll just
be bored on the phone up I'll take out
the glue I don't even know I'm doing it
I put the glue on my fingers away frigid
dry and I start picking it off of it
well yeah okay pleasure is apparently
complex and multi-layered and there's
many many cons and so that's part of
what you have to do you have to look and
understand the many different kinds that
are there and so one of the things I say
is people say oh I want to gamify
everything I'm like do you do you really
I think maybe you don't mean that I
think maybe you really mean you want to
pleasure eyes your experience is really
what you're saying and if you want to
get more scientific about it maybe you'd
say you want to improve the motivational
design of your of your experience you
want to change the experience so that
people are motivated to do it in new
ways and in different ways than they
were before so in short you can make
your experiences better you can do it
and all you have to do is ask yourself
some simple questions given what I know
about my guests and I like to say guests
I know some people say users I know
that's the computer science thing to say
users but there's only two industries
that say users the computer science
people and the the illicit drug trade
they're the only ones and so I like to
step over and say guests because I think
it's a little more respectful so given
what I know about my guests why will
they like this experience and then how
can I get them to like it more if you
focus on those two ideas what do they
like how can I get them to like it more
you can find ways to make it better and
that's all I have thank you very much
to have time for questions Matt all
right I didn't - Zozi bridge
it's amazing
okay listen yes yeah all right so
there's a goofy doesn't call it
everything bad is good for you yeah that
he is but it's about how we are learning
more and more from games nowadays often
without knowing it and I'd like to hear
your opinion on my learning design and
if it's if you figure people see it as a
gimmick or an opportunities to learn
more while just having plenty I call it
a gimmick tunity
yeah no I have read that book it's a
really great book I mean here's a four
people haven't read that book it's it's
a fascinating argument what he's looking
at is the fact that IQ has been going up
steadily for the last 60 years and why
is it because our schools are getting
awesome or in awesomer and he argues it
no he argues that it's popular culture
TV shows are getting more and more
complicated and the appearance of games
and many other things are making us
smarter and smarter so this is something
everybody is all the people in the
educational space are looking at and
trying to figure out and unfortunately
on some level there are aspects of it
that are gimmicky because a lot of
people focusing on it are like well I
just want something shiny that's going
to help me sell my new digital textbooks
but on another level people understand
that engagement makes for better
education I mean it's almost obvious
that if you're more engaged with what
you're trying to learn you're going to
learn it better and so this now gets
into this hard question of if you're
really going to do this well and
properly you have to understand what
does engage people what engages them in
the right ways that they're going to
become engaged with the material and
part of the reason this thing is so hard
is because typically is it's it sounds
weird to say this but most educators
don't really know what they're trying to
do they if you ask them you know
specific questions about well what is it
how do you want students to be different
at the end of this you know a lot of
them just retreats you well I want them
to know the material in this book but
that's that's
really that's not really what these
things are about algebra is not about
knowing the specifics of algebra algebra
is about learning to think in a
fundamentally new way anyway when the
the key thing when it comes down to
creating meaningful educational software
and trying to how to figure out how do
you sort of add pleasure to education is
you have to look at what is it that I'm
trying to get across and what are the
problems with it what are the walls that
people are having because if you have
something that's easy to learn and
everybody can do it anyway
you don't need to change it but if you
have things where people are hitting
walls and they are bored with it and and
it is painful to do those are the things
you want to what you that you want to
fix and it's very complicated because
you got to avoid all that stuff about if
you give rewards the wrong way people
are going to get less out of it the what
I find are it's all about tricks in a
sense to get people to think about it
and then to be more engaged in other
words when you're doing it right you're
inspiring the curiosity of the of the
students curiosity ends up I think being
central to most of the improved
education sure I don't know to set the
microphone so he wins okay I want to
latch onto your you know learned because
it seems to be a little bit inconsistent
with your concluding slide even once
when you're shopping for peanut butter
you're fine yeah
there's nothing legible you get a laptop
- it's nothing
no you're avoiding well I get well I
guess the one thing I'd argue about it
the thing the thing I'd argue for is is
that yeah I'm avoiding a negative
consequence of getting screwed but when
I beat those jerks yes and I yes I
figured you jerks out and I won I won
the battle against the peanut butter so
there's a little bit of a chance of
something there but yeah mostly it's not
good but I'm sorry where were you going
with this well where I was going with it
was that it seemed that the conclusion
was a bit more general than mine what
your guests find is pleasurable and try
to enhance that and more like mind wipe
your desk is trying to accomplish and
get your guests to do related things so
a pleasure as part of that that's great
but if it's some challenge that needs to
be overcome and you're just gonna hurt
your even do would it be proud of
yourself well one way to phrase it is
but maybe another way to phrase it is
well you're trying really hard to
accomplish this thing so I just I wonder
a pleasure is really the central idea
here
I think I I continue to find it I think
pleasure really is sort of central to it
I mean just in the example of the of the
grocery store when we know there's a lot
of things that are not pleasurable about
grocery shopping and to the extent you
can kind of take the bad things away you
know that's you certainly want to do
that but then a lot of it comes from
sort of looking at the context of
grocery shopping what's in people's
minds and then and what can you do to
sort of add to it now there's parts of
it to get a little dark particularly in
the retail space
people are often shopping when they're
when they're hungry for example and
there's lots of ways you can trick them
and the reason we have so many impulse
buys right near the near the edge is
because you know you're susceptible to
those in a way you weren't before it's
more it's it's more pleasurable at that
moment to kind of indulge in those than
it was you know at the beginning and
sometimes that's selling you junk you
don't need but still like from
from the point of view of the grocery
stores mission that that's where a lot
of their focus ends up ends up being
sure yeah Daniel I think I think it will
help the Google will have more data in
other words
Yeah right yeah well I don't know if it
singing you can always stay ahead up so
it's it's apartment we've talked about
the business of our brains are good at
adapting to reward systems right one of
the because one of the things we know is
variable rewards are always better than
fixed rewards that's like an old
psychology thing and the concrete
example would be lets say you bring
bagels to work right you say I'm gonna
start bringing bagels working every
Friday you bring bagels to work the
first Friday
everyone's like whoa bagels this is
awesome and then next Friday hey cool
bagels in the front after that hey
there's the bagels I like that and then
like by the sixth Friday like everyone's
just like oh yeah there's the bagels and
then the sound Friday you forget and you
don't bring the bagels and people like
where's the bagels right so it's turned
into a punishment this thing was
supposed to be a reward if instead of
making doing them on a regular basis
where everyone acclimatize this to it
you bring them the same amount of times
say four times a month but it random
times then every time it's like oh it's
always a pleasant surprise so when you
talk about these sort of badge systems
it's exciting like the first time you
get to ten badges and then and then
level up and you're like yeah I achieved
it well if I give you another ten and
it's the same difficulty you're like I
know I can do that I mean it's not
exciting it's because the question again
gets back to curiosity that when someone
gives you a challenge the challenge is
interesting when you're not sure if you
can solve it if you know you can solve
it it's boring but if you're like noon
can I do this I don't know and then you
do it yes I can do it if I give it to
you again I know I can do that I don't
sure I'll do it but it doesn't matter
and so what they do is like oh you did
ten well can you do 20 and then well
maybe I can but then soon it gets so
ownerÃ­s it's like can I can you do a
million I could but God it would take
for arrogant I get so sick of it just
trying to get there and then you walk
away from the whole thing because
they're trying to find ways to modify it
so the key is to find ways to modify
things
that gives surprises without having them
you know grow and suffering and pain and
that's a difficult thing to do
but it you know in short systems like
that can burn themselves out I mean
there's no there's no two ways about it
the question I think is what do you give
the rewards for if you give someone new
challenges and new things to do and use
the same reward structure then that that
works fine
so
a bit of a selfish question
okay how old are your kids there's a ton
of great stuff for ages like three
through six and most of it is living on
the iPad is where most of its living
right now there's a there's a ton of
excellent stuff there now unfortunately
Apple doesn't seem to much care about
review systems and so there's very
difficult to find a quality filter but
there's definitely for further for the
younger kids there really is some just
world class stuff the problem after you
get past age six is the market is kind
of screwed up because before age six or
before age seven really before the age
of wisdom before the age when children
really learn the devil's Word you know
no you know if you go to a five-year-old
and you say hey you should check out
this game they'll be like oh sure okay
I'll play this game whatever you go to
an eight-year-old and say hey check out
this game they're like mmm nope not
interested in that
mmm that's not what because the school
client nope I got this other thing I
want let's do this thing
and so what happens is the parents can
kind of inflict all kinds of educational
software on their kids before that but
after that particularly once the kids
are in school they're like I've been in
school all day you can be hit me with
more school you get out of here with
that they want to do things that are
just you know sort of far away from that
so that's part of the challenge so but
the again the the best quality stuff
I've been seeing it even even just some
extent creeping up a little older is is
on the iPad because
they can just the the market economics
sort of support that you just got to
find it that's the hard part you poke
around on forums ask other people I can
send you a list of some that I think are
great anything that anything that duck
duck moose or nosy crow makes is is
totally top-notch and there's that
there's a thing that children's
technology review I don't you ever seen
that children's technology review is a
great reviews of soft of software for
kids and it partly entertainment partly
educational that that thing is a real
great guideline for for what's good for
kids anything else all right thank you
