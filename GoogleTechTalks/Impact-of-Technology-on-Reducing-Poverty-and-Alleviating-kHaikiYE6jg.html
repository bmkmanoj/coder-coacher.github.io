to present mr. Raju is the chairman see
of certain computers yes oh tim is I
don't you guys know about this is one of
the largest tech companies in India and
worldwide reach over billion dollars and
revenues and over 28,000 employees and
Mister Rogers has sort of seen this grow
from in the last 20 years or so 19 to be
exact to grow into one of the biggest
companies around so just to give you
sort of a background you know I can go
on and on about his business
accomplishments but today we're sort of
here to discuss some of his
accomplishments around foundations and
other nonprofit stuff that he's been
doing just to give you a recap he was
named Ernst &amp;amp; Young Entrepreneur of the
year in 1999 he was also data quiz IT
man of the year in two thousand and CNBC
also named them the asian business
leader corporate citizen of the year i
think all these things sort of tell
about what he has accomplished over the
years and as a matter of fact he's also
the chairman the current chairman of
nasscom nasscom is the national
association of services and software
companies and it's a very very well
recognized company organization but i
could spend the whole hour talking about
his accomplishments but the two things i
really want to discuss is the
foundations he has created the sub-team
foundation and the veradi foundation and
you'll go a lot more into details about
those two foundations along with EMRI
which is emergency response institute
and this is so dark in to 911 in the US
and you'll go a lot more in detail about
a she went good just to give you a
little bit of a background on the two
foundations verragio is actually focused
very much around sort of rural
transformation and as I said mr. Raja
will sort of give you a more detail I
can't do justice to to his organization
and Sutton foundation is more around
urban transformation so sort of the day
all the urban transformation in India
around people moving from villages but
trying to keep people in village
sort of providing entrepreneurship and
access to a lot of the services that
people are used to in urban areas in
rural parts so without further ado I
want to introduce mr. Raja to take the
floor thank you so much for this
opportunity to be here with you today
let me dwell I will take 15 minutes and
after that my colleague of anchored who
is the CEO of EMR I emergency management
and research insured how is going to
specifically talk about the retiarius
that we have taken in the emergency
management and research area which is
equivalent of 911 in United States we
have done some work and we're quite
proud of for the fact that we have made
significant progress I would like to
briefly talk about sathiyam for no more
than few minutes and after that shared
with you some experiences in initiatives
that we have taken on the corporate
social responsibility friend
particularly in the area of rural
transformation as a company we went
public in 1992 and when we went public
our revenues were less than a million
dollars and last year we have in fact
done 1.1 billion dollars in revenues
this is nothing compared to the
accomplishments of Google you have
achieved a billion dollar in in much
shorter period of time and every
internet user is one who appreciates and
is thankful for the kind of quality
services that we provide well that is
the case satyam computer services became
in this short period of
I the by far the largest company in the
state of Andhra Pradesh in India and we
were the first Indian first on the
Pradesh company on the padishah chairs
about 80 million people in that state we
became the first billion-dollar company
this means a great deal for a developing
country that there are opportunities
such as what one witnesses at a global
scale coming from companies like Google
and as a company we have always been
conscious of the fact that we need to do
something and and give back something
for the society before I I'd well into
that let me talk to you a little bit
about some of the changes that we have
seen in the company itself in the last
14 years or so we have gone through many
transformational initiatives the change
that we are witnessing globally is
demanding that companies reinvent
themselves constantly and this we refer
to as different waves of changes within
the organization and they are called
orbit different orbits within the
organization we have gone through six
such whales sit such such orbits the
first orbit began when we were servicing
clients particularly in the United
States by placing our professionals to
work at the clients places this is
called on-site consulting and thereafter
we became the first indian company to
have had a tiny satellite connectivity
between ourselves and a company in the
United States or John Deere and company
to have started providing services
remotely and this has
eventually come to be called offshoring
and we are quite proud of the fact that
we were in the forefront of this change
the next orbit for us was to prove to
our clients that they can get dependable
services from from us which meant that
we had to prove that our processes for
mature there for quality initiatives
such as sei I see em em level five or
six sigma or as ISO 9000 are the ones
that brought us the required recognition
among the companies globally and this is
orbit three for us orbit for for us was
reaching out to our clients globally and
to prove to them that no matter where we
provide the service Fram that we are
operating very close to where they are
and that meant opening number of centers
we operate from about 20 development
centers globally today and these are
called offside centers and in the recent
past this definition has been further
extended to include what is referred to
as nearshore centers in nearshore center
is one which has operations in a country
very close to the country where we
service our customers therefore canada
becomes a nearshore center for United
States and China becomes a nearshore
center for Japan this is also referred
to as right sourcing model within our
company to make the customer totally
transparent to wear these services are
provided provided from orbit 5 was an
initiative meant to bridge the gap
between ourselves and companies like IBM
Global and Accenture by acquiring domain
competencies and being able to provide
relationship management of a quality
that we only see in more mature are
companies we have made fair amount of
progress in that area we have reached a
size of about 29,000 people and this
year when we came together in our
strategy summit we told ourselves that
we have to move to the next step next
heartbeat and that orbit for us is about
leadership and innovation this is
meaning that we need to deal with issues
of importance such that we are able to
address the current issues and that in a
way extends also to corporate social
responsibility initiative as well there
is as much requirement for innovation
and leadership in corporate social
responsibility initiatives as there is
in a company like sathiyam in the year
two thousand one my father passed away
rather unexpectedly and as a family of
three offers and four brothers said that
we need to do something in his memory
and we recognized that the best thing
that we can do is to go back to the
villages where he came from where he had
intimate relationships with and
therefore we have taken up this
initiative which we refer to as the
plural transformation initiative we
wanted to take a holistic approach and
we have had in the last four to five
years a a great and positive I
experience in in doing so in these 150
villages there are about million people
and these people have a little access to
to technology little access to the kind
of
practices that we are so used to endow
in developed countries and particularly
in the corporate world and they lack the
right kind of leadership and we felt
that you know if only we could take
these back to them there is potential is
something that we would have managed to
give back so we have set out in the
initial stages itself certain principles
we call these core values the value one
is that we should involve people in a
developing country like India every
village may have something like 2,000 to
5,000 people and there are at least 200
to 500 man years of for competency man
years of for enough capable people being
able to do some tangible work available
and most of it does not get used well if
only it gets used well then the access
that we have by way of human resource is
very high and it amounts to millions of
dollars or crores of rupees so it is
with that belief you know we have set
out to pursue this principle of
involving people secondly we have also
believed that applying knowledge and
technology is most important the access
that we have to knowledge and technology
today is so high that we could by
applying it efficiently address issues
at the level of the downtrodden rather
very affect our very well and and
efficiently so applying knowledge and
technology was yet another core
principle the third was making things
happen we take this for granted in the
corporate world but that is not the case
when it comes to a developing country
and from when it comes to what the
government does and the manner in which
you know people are able to manage
at the grass root level so having taken
these as our main principles we have
gone about to identify about 54
different services within the villages
and of these about 30 are categorized as
delivery related services and about 20
to 25 or support services as support
services maybe something to do with
technology a support service may have
something to do with six sigma so on and
so forth there are 20 or 25 such things
and in the corporate world you would
call these again support services you
know you may have HR finance quality so
on and so forth the same things we felt
or the competencies that we have to
develop so that whatever is proven in
these villages you can then go back to
provide as a support mechanism for other
villages as this knowledge base is
extended in the delivery services we are
quite proud to say that we have made a
fair amount of progress we have set out
to achieve a principle which we have
called the hundred percent principal
hundred percent principal is about
identifying as to where you stand with
reference to a service and where you
could be with reference to what already
happens in more mature environments and
whatever this gap be in a way eliminated
in a matter of two to three years and I
must tell you that we have had a very
positive experience in addressing issues
such as managing water situation in
these villages about all the you know
every village has access to water but
they can also polluted and unless you
have a way of cleaning this water unless
you are able to have a mechanism of
delivering it they have to consume what
is
available so we have established mineral
water plants and these plants are able
to supply water in 12 litre cans at a
cost of one fourth of a saint and this
is dildo delivered similarly sanitation
is a big issue only fifty percent of the
houses have sanitation or facilitation
of fifty percent of the houses have
toilets we said that one hundred percent
of them should have toilet facilities
and you wouldn't believe that it takes
no more than few dollars to be able to
provide these facilities no it is it
costs you know more than seventy to
eighty dollars and you subsidize to an
extent of something like twenty dollars
at $25 so it is not a cost issue so we
have been able to make enormous progress
there four percent of the people suffer
from diabetes and most of them don't
have access to medical care we have been
able to provide this care at 25 cents a
day four percent of the people suffer
from hypertension again it costs you no
more than 25 cents we have been able to
address issues around I carry eight
percent of the people suffer from
problems relating to or the eye and it
may be a need for glasses and classes
cost no more than two dollars in fact
there are many organizations globally
who are willing to support Rajesh that
you have to have a mechanism to deliver
those services and the list goes on
there are 30 different services
identified and we are operating with
this one hundred percent principle as a
mechanism and we believe that in most
cases by the end of this year we would
have achieved the hundred percent of
principle I would like to know given the
limitation of time only talk about what
we have learnt what personally I have
learnt as an individual in doing so
generally are you operate with a mindset
that poverty is difficult to
eliminate and that it would take 30 or
40 years for a developing country to
become a developed country our
experience tells us that the issues at
the grassroots can be addressed in a
matter of a few years it doesn't take 40
or 50 years for a developing country to
become a developed country it would take
no more than a maximum of 10 to 15 years
and if it is done in a focused way as I
was reporting here in a matter of three
or four years we are able to provide
services at levels that can be compared
with what happens in a developed country
the second learning is that the
satisfaction in you'd arrive in
providing these services is far greater
than the satisfaction that you derive in
deploying your resources for your own
personal benefit therefore we have
always promoted this concept that when
you are giving it's an opportunity for
you it is not a favor that you are
providing for someone in fact it is an
opportunity that that person in need is
providing to you to service him so that
you can derive a great satisfaction of
having wiped tears of their faces the
third thing that we have come to realize
is that saving lives is a more serious
business than making money therefore it
is not those who are retired those who
find a little time once in a while that
would like to exchange it is to be done
with a focus there for anyone who is
volunteering and who is getting involved
you know we have a ratio of about ever
one is 25 for every full-time associate
within the company at least five times
there should be volunteers but those
volunteers cannot come there as though
they are doing favors you know they have
to commit themselves and then only we
are making them a part of what we do I
would like to very quickly state that
each of these services are regarded as
businesses where benchmarking every
activity again
the best that you observe and has and
and see happen in the best of companies
and we are saying that is the benchmark
it is just that you have to extend the
same level of service even when it comes
to servicing it need at a rural village
and we are addressing couple of issues
one is about each business having the
best assets that you can imagine and we
monitor them through a process called
the 6p model you would like to see the
people dimension at amateur level a
process dimension at immature level it
is the product which is about automating
things at amateur level proliferation
which is about adopting the best
practices pertain to know which is about
innovation and finally promotion where
you are able to effectively communicate
what you are doing so this is the acer
dimension the other dimension is what is
referred to as the five our dimension
everything ends with an R faster better
cheaper larger and today yet we are
saying that on these dimensions no you
have to measure the outcomes and we
believe that kind of focused attempt is
bringing about a greater delivery
mechanism satyam Foundation has adopted
a principle of having at least ten
percent of the people being encouraged
to be volunteers with Nick within the
company and we have an initiative called
the Magnificent Seven initiative and
magnificent seven initiative is about
having groups of seven people formed
among these volunteer groups to work on
being able to make a difference when it
comes to specific projects having said
this you know now I would like to have
my colleague vente clink it or talk
about EMRI which is an initiative as I
have stated to address the emergency
management issues in India thank you so
much once again for giving this
opportunity to myself and our colleagues
to present to you some of the work that
we have done
Thank You rose a very good morning and
Hammer I'm happy to talk about a MRI
basically we want to share with you how
we can signage eyes various entities
like a social entrepreneurship
partnerships innovation leadership and
technology how we can synergize each of
these entities and use them for saving
lives particular at the bottom of the
pyramid the whole project TMR is meant
for saving lives we envisage to save at
least 2 million lives a year by 2010 and
when we say is to take at least 2
million calls a day based on the u.s.
experience of receiving of you know for
the 300 million population they get
around 200 million calls a year and our
experience of last eight months tells us
exactly the same based on that we expect
to receive two million calls a day that
infrastructure those processes the
technology and the people is what we are
visioning to do while doing so last
eight months what we saved was 3,000
lives in these towns where we operated
extrapolating that to the country as a
whole will be able to save two million
lives a year and every young we like to
show you a small film for five minutes
so briefly explaining what p.m. our eyes
Ronon de- plenty Manu sha pasa watch a
pro know he puto
you the smart server you should move
today
you
when emergency strikes the prana or life
is in danger and this calls for quick
attention
unfortunately in India the emergency
rate his side with oval eighty percent
that's happening in the first are itself
the golden are and thus calls for a
responsible emergency management system
as an individual who's contributed to
the progress of the world and has taken
India to n be able hides mr. ramalinga
raju founder and chairman Sutton
computers has been one of the very few
to look at the humanitarian side of life
and one such effort is a MRIs 108 an
emergency management system set up
through public-private partnership to
reach out to the society in its hour of
need
the 108 emergency service is here to
respond to every kind of emergency
medical fire and polar's
108 is the first of its kind emergency
service in India and us proved to be the
lifesaver of thousands or in a very
short span dangs to the three cardinal
pillars of EMR eyes emergency management
system sends reach and care through
constant research iam our eyes efforts
have been to better emergency management
by working towards enhancing the scope
of sands faster reach and immediate care
taking off as a pilot project on the
fifteenth of august 2005 108 has been
responsible for saving thousands of
lives today the team of associates of
EMR I respond to thousands of calls from
across andhra pradesh reaching out them
wherever they are
in managing emergencies technology can
play a key role and providing the
support to the EMR I is satyam computer
services limited ln gamma e MRI is
backed by high-end technology comprising
voice loggers GIS GPS and a mobile
communication an emergency can be of any
time broadly they are categorized as
medical police and file in nature and
108 is equipped to respond to every need
under them 108 is backed a fleet of
life-saving ambulances and trained
paramedics will provide life-saving
treatment on the way to the hospital
with support from trained pilots EMR
eyes focus has been to take emergency
care to the poorest sections of the
society which accounts for about eighty
percent of our nation's population and
to give it the much needed special
status 108 is a toll-free number
accessible from both landlines and
mobile phones 108 has truly been a life
save yer too many alive both in the
urban and rural areas but many having a
reason to thank at EMRI is committed to
realize its vision of responding to 2
million calls a day by the y el 2010
p.m. RI knows there is so much more that
needs to be done and surely there is so
much more that can be done with the
active public participation what is also
required is the effective use of India's
wide and strong communications network
its growing technology and implementing
108 or
over the country to make India a safer
place for the common man Ron um d'ivoire
lupron n'they mahnoush aha also watch me
bra no he puta
you the smart server you should today
I'd love to share with you what happened
in the last eight months and what we
could achieve it also matrix and then
now how it was possible in terms of
creating differentiators at various
levels so but you must tell you this
project do not have been possible so
sooner but for the goal we could in a
more than first six months we spent time
in now finding out what are the best
practices so in this field of Emergency
Management and what kind of best
practices are there across the world or
what kind of ambulances have been there
and then we created a differentiator
some so I'd like to share with you that
in these eight points were able to
launch in 38 town saw in order for this
on the position one of the 29 states
with the population of 80 million out of
the thousand million population in the
country starting on 15th August at the
Hyderabad we launched till now 38 towns
when you ain't down this was launched
were the chief minister and 15th August
with the IT minister and then president
of india launched in bheemavaram on the
jan 9th and then 36 more towns for
launch term basically what we achieved
was 40,000 emergency calls me handled in
the last eight months and out of the 1.5
million emergency called so the balance
calls basically talked about inquiries
and what do you do kind of things which
we are transferring it to the ivr in
course of time and at a cost of one
dollar recall is what we have been
spending today to handle one emergency
call again as to what it costs according
to our study $43 years whereas we have
been able to take almost eighty five
percent of the calls in the very first
two rings and most importantly forty
three percent of the emergencies are
medical again as to estimate here it to
be around twenty percent term we have
been able to save three thousand lives
at a cost of three fifty dollars is what
it cost it to save a life form from the
time call comes taking the info sending
the ambulance taking the patient to
hospital we were able to do that in 35
minutes so in these medical emergencies
of close to eighteen thousand the three
thousand lives basically more than one
fourth are so close to that is from head
injuries of road traffic accidents
followed by traumas and then to the
pregnancies and pediatric ow this number
will keep going up as we cover more and
more rural areas some we also thought we
should devote the people who have been
doing this work outside llamar i have
been doing this work like some of the
individuals who show selfless heroism an
emergency is what we call dashi those
awards we gave it to 13 people who did
this kind of work also nurses who are
the emergency nurses who saved lives of
people in addition to doctors efforts
nurses put a lot of efforts we thought
we should recognize them under rewarded
21 of them media was extensively
covering 108 i don't think a day passes
without talk I 108 being covered in on
the padishah art sometimes in the
national channel saw in the regional
language as well as English Channel so
basically MRI was formed the last year
on April second 2005 the day on which we
signed the public-private partnership
with the government of andhra pradesh
this kind of vision cannot be achieved
unless there is a partnership from
government unless there is a partnership
with many people so from that day April
second of the signing the agreement we
said that it has to be a non-profit
Institute it cannot be prophet saw and
this read the dot on the top is the
customer who is suffering from
emergencies he is the emergency victim
who may not really bleed all the time
other than the road traffic accidents
like kar diya karo paralysis are
epileptic fits and that kind of things
are poisoning suicides it need not bleed
but it is an emergency of just about
ended within the one hours to save his
life from and so that the the one part
of 911 is handling emergencies the other
one called me EMS in u.s. where they
send ambulances we combined both of them
on
one roof saying that taking the number
taking the emergency victims information
and sending the help if it is under one
number Allah the processes can be better
and that is what we call as am part of
Emergency Management till such time the
help reaches the victim and the are part
of e Amara is a research part why these
emergencies are happening and can we
prevent them can we handle them better
and I part is basically training
institute part where we want to train
and the create value at various levels
who handle the patient so instead of
patient go into the doctor the hospital
can we add value before reaching the
hospital with a first responder who
attends to them at the house are on the
road are the emergency technician who
handles an ambulance and then the
doctors Wharton to him in the ICU are in
the emergency room at these three levels
we are designing training programs to
add value to the emergency victim
actually we have ventured to define
emergency because 911 has been here last
25 years is no need to define emergency
there we were to say it has to come
suddenly it has to threaten the life but
your property also can be danger you can
also think of an order of the life
getting disturbed or any of the
conditions involving medical or a police
are a fire together occurring at
individual level not at you know where
thousands and millions people getting
involved in the tsunamis and floods that
disasters are separate from these
emergencies which happen at individual
level which you are by and large not so
much attended to till now and these are
emergencies unfortunately occurred at
the bottom of the pyramid since the
population is that eighty percent that
is what we need to address and attend to
those emergencies and bring them back
from emergency the context is as we have
seen eighty percent of the deaths happen
in the first one over of admission that
is because somebody delaying and the
admission process and are taking or
inability to dial inability to get help
inability to get transport inability to
get a pre-hospital care led to the
deaths in the hospital in the first one
over itself on the top of it 136,000
mothers
every year during pregnancies
particularly doesn't happen during the
pregnancy it happens after the delivery
when the bleeding is unable to be
controlled off road traffic accidents
although the number looks to be smaller
but this is what is reported off but
unfortunately 4,000 for 150,000 people
lose one of their limbs every year and
then 200,000 which happen every day
emergencies are underreported not
reported not recognized as emergencies
this is the context of setting EMRI to
save lives from these emergencies and
give them the convenience what they need
convenience is a single number what they
need is a transport facility what they
need is pre-hospital care so we thought
to do this we must differentiate what we
are providing at various levels we said
the war in which where people get
differentiated in which way process the
technology ambulances on the top of it
campus has to be something distinctly
different with whom we collaborate has
to be different and why we are doing
research which is distinctly different
from any other 911 other institutions on
the top of it how do we train and advent
people these eight i would like to
elaborate the first one people what we
thought is we don't want qualified we
take sanam texts and the engineers and
that kind of thing for doing this job
what we need is someone who listens
someone who is positive first from the
time he gets into the ambulance this guy
instead of saying you will die you will
die he has to say you will leave so i
might say it's really difficult to build
that attitude on the top of it what we
expected them to be a little more
elegant in terms of his drive and
compassion on the top of it he cannot
afford to be subjective on getting our
treatment or he has to be objective he
has to be passionate about changing
lives more importantly we know how to
talk but this guy has to listen what the
patient is talking without interpreting
on the top of it treating the patient
with with love and compassion these
qualities are extremely difficult to
find out of if I in 30 thousand people I
get only 48 four point eight percent is
a success rate these we have seven step
interview process recruitment process so
thousand in the first process finally
comes to only 48 and then to get to this
600 people we were to recruit almost you
know 20 times of that and we call again
to give this kind of people status in
the society instead of calling them
drivers we call them as pilots on same
way instead of calling somebody as a
call taker what is called here in India
it is taker is not taken as it is not
taken properly so we thought we should
call him as communication officers so
these are though they are not that high
paid the software professional jobs but
they add a lot of value in changing
lives so we title them accordingly on
the top of it the process what we
thought is 108 many people ask me why we
are chosen this number why not mine 11
so we thought why to copy after 20 fires
of experience in India particularly when
we did a research we found that in an
emergency you don't go to the bottom of
the instrumental you only got to the top
of the instrument so we thought number
starting with the one is better and then
10 takes priority or any other number
and then 108 we thought this is the
universal reserved across the country
for emergencies and particularly we made
sure that when we did a research when we
got this number we asked people they
said is it free I don't mind dying but I
won't spend one rupee for dialing this
so we were to make it free first on then
we did one more reception they said is
it possible to dial on both of them
landline and mobile then only I'll use
it on so this mobile phenomena had
caught up so much that even in emergency
he wants to use his mobile and get the
satisfaction we said okay we will give
you that also it can happen on both of
them and then we said you know it's then
they said why these are what is
significance of this number so so many
theories we have been telling people off
to getting this number you know if you
want to treat this number as spiritual
you treated one plus eight comes nine
you think like that and the 108 many
religions treat it as a spiritual number
whatever you want to do but please dial
in case of emergency and then we thought
the process we defined is it has to
learn at the PSTN and to the nodal
switch and
it takes inputs from various hours and
from the sour the CEO takes the input
what telephone database it has all the
landlines it takes the input from there
the address pops up on the system and
then transfers this data what he got
from the emergency victim to the
dispatch officer then he takes inputs
again from the emergency database which
hospital what kind of things and then
the GIS database he picks up and
identifies hooch ambulance is the
nearest and closest which he can assign
this is the entire process in the
process there is a doctor sitting in the
call center who conferences with the
patient and tells him whether he needs
medical help even before ambulance comes
if he's hyperglycemic he tells him you
need a glass you need a spoon of sugar
you take before the ambulance comes that
kind of advice for a common man who
could not even effort the fire rupees to
go in a cycle rickshaw he is able to
effort to Ringo free get into the
ambulance free and get also medical
advice free so the various applications
in terms of what a communication Officer
requires our dispatch office requires
what vehicle management systems are
pre-hospital care systems and vehicle
we're on the top of it we we know
precisely these 40,000 emergencies what
the geographic demographic medical
information what applications are
required to handle these and the GS maps
of all these towns are there with the 40
landmarks per square kilometre kind of
thing helped us really to assign the
vehicle and the guy is able to go pilot
and the EMT faster on the top of it or
the deployment of ambulance also you are
able to do with this so more importantly
now we are able to even predict what
kind of emergencies will come in this
area the fourth differentiator is
ambulances so having people and the
process and technology we thought we
should take him finally having the most
latest process and technology of no use
but the guide should be transported in
the latest ambulance that's where we
used extensively Google more than
anybody else we must have jumped the
whole system if you had seen in april
two thousand five to june two thousand
five ways or four hundred photographs of
em below
across the world then we thought let us
not believe all of them let us go
physically and saw them again in us in
Singapore all that and finally we
designed something unique where we
thought we should have an Indian vehicle
we bought the tempo traveller only for
twelve thousand dollars then we spent
under thirty thousand dollars we thought
patient comfort is important but more
important is relatives comfort patients
relatives comfort is important so let
him have air conditioner balance and
patient relative safety is important so
we thought he should have the welds and
that kind of thing and more importantly
we thought the public safety is
important outside what is that we are
giving outside and how the pilot drives
now then we thought patient comfort not
once treachery must have five stretchers
not the normal stretcher for scoop
stretcher is for spinal injuries
wheelchair for somebody who cannot walk
children stretcher is different foldable
stretcher is different and there are
many other things like splints are there
to mediate recast the fair when there is
a fracture to mobilize the fractured
portion or we have particularly to meet
indian medical conditions we have a
small rope which costs less than a
dollar to save a guy when he drowns in a
well are we have extrication tools
inside this box or where the relative
seta to remove the patients from the
accident so when the collision takes
place so that's well last week somebody
was telling we don't use this word
accident or they said accident what is
this in your country to the accident is
something which happens suddenly
unexpectedly but all your accidents you
know you are going on a wrong way you
know there is no helmet you know you do
not have a seat belt and you are going
anyway opposite side whenever there is a
put their door to enter you enter there
so these accidents are all known but
still though they are known we thought
we should do something for him where we
have this kind of extrication tools last
but not least two we have two equipments
the most costliest one which costs more
than now another difficult of this
ambulance cost is a ventilator and a
automatic external defibrillator these
are the two take over the heart and
lungs function and the fela the next
differentiator is campus which we
well built in seven months time but of
course my chairman says you are delayed
by one month seven months we were able
to build this 40,000 square feet in a 40
acre campus this is what was you know
something please call center these
response center is you go to Brooklyn
you go yesterday we went to marin county
in san francisco this is something 100
times better than that in terms of the
aesthetics in terms of what you see
because he's get out to see the greenery
they have to breathe though next is
collaboration differentiate race other
than government we also wanted to
collaborate with various hospitals 594
Hospital have signed to agree to accept
the patient for first 24 hours to
stabilize then the ng was the volunteers
various corporations US agencies of this
911 Association called Nina and
physicians of Indian origin here
emergency doctors victims themselves
partnering and then such am computers
developing technology for us seven
differentiate is research as I showed
why these area 16 we selected why are
they happening can we prevent them can
we also treat them better the last but
not least is adding training for better
patient care in terms of what do we do
before the hospital and at the hospital
so these are the first responders and
the year EMT technicians and the doctors
in the call center whereas the doctors
in the clinic and ICU room and the
emergency room doctors we identified
syllabus and the programs to conduct for
them so haven't done these eight
differentiators explain our future plan
from 38 towns we are going to 50 towns
in our the position to cover 20 billion
population by end of this month and the
balance 60 million population are for
the position dominant two villages of
numbering around 20,000 we thought we
should be able to cover them with
volunteered resources as per the
protocols processes technology of 108
but volunteered time volunteered the
money or volunteered vehicle so that we
connect those two emri and provide
exactly the same service to these
villages in the by end of sep tember
nationally we want to achieve our vision
of 2 million calls and 2 million
by 2010 by involving many franchises so
there could be NGOs or volunteers are
corporations who want to take up this
and go to Maharashtra go to next state
and next state the rest of the states
they can go and run this as per this
technology and these standards and these
kind of protocols with the state and
central and the county government
officials cooperating so what does it
offer to to us between Google and us
what kind of partnership opportunities
are there one is can we have a kind of
knowledge management initiative for
emergencies so is there a scope for
virtual labs for schools to educate
people there is a possibility of these
maps being utilized at higher level
where it could be used not only for
emergency management also for improving
agriculture can we also think of a
virtual leadership with your
volunteerism like what chairman has told
about magnificent seven teams saw
participating in your volunteer time on
a specific projects like hundred
projects what we are working some of
those projects where you can give your
time under your idea so so to put it all
together India will be one of the five
countries by 2020 is our vision to make
it happen the GD pace and agriculture
and manufacturing all that is going on
one side the services to make it happen
we should respect the value on care life
to do that we should develop little more
of humaneness little more of humbleness
and lastly every one of us should get
committed to serve the society they are
leaving it only to the bureaucrats and
politicians thank you so much
we only have a couple minutes add some
question
John
yeah the question is how does this 35
minutes response time compared to the
other countries summon us particular 911
we don't have the published data but
what we heard is it is less than 1 over
now it is close to 40 minutes 50 minutes
1 hour it may be sometimes 30 40 minutes
also but this kind of metrics oh and
publish data is not available yeah
basically 911 is only for handling the
call and dispatching a vehicle that we
are doing three minutes and whereas the
certifier minutes include vehicle going
to home and from home to hospital that
32 minutes whereas here it is handled by
EMS separately where there times vary
because there are multiple organizations
or voluntary profit nonprofit kind of
Institute's yeah
ah
nationally how do we go with a single
system yeah
river card
no actually if you the question is that
how do we expand from Andhra Pradesh to
other states do we need to modify it if
you need to adopt anything of frankly
there is not much of adaptation in terms
of the processes and the technology it's
only the people locally you have to
employ them who could identify the place
and take and the emergencies are exactly
same same kinds of emergence happen it's
a it's only the local governments how to
support them as much as this government
is supporting us in our position that's
the only variation may be reached it we
will have an entrepreneur or a
franchisee who will run this with the
same passion as we are doing in our
position that will be a big challenge
for us to get those and the Institute
this kind of discipline and also train
them to handle this kind of thing so
when we say as a role for us nationally
that you know we emra will lay these
standards and processes we are also
talking to the government to form an
authority which will lay down certain
standards so who should run an ambulance
who will accept this kind of running the
center and who will fund it that kind of
negotiation we are doing and preparing a
document so that it goes across the same
standards yes we will employ local
people who could dot that's where the
ability to identify the place and speak
the language is important
various step and not as aggressive maybe
an operation and they might be not
political you know at least out of our
it's a question what you are saying is
what is the how the politics will come
into the picture of making it happen
nationally our experience of last eight
months the other pradesh government is
progressive and they have been
supportive but more importantly this
kind of passion as not-for-profit
institute to change to save the lives I
don't think any politician any politics
can really stop her from our dialogues
with various politicians of various
parties everybody loves to handle this
off late actually as I was saying last
10 to 15 launches the politician respect
to towns who are there even before even
we invited them they said i would like
to be party to it and i will come to the
dais and you know launch this song
because they also get a credit turned
out some of these guys even announced
that I actually convinced the MRI to
come to this town they didn't have any
plans actually I convinced but we are
happy with it because we don't want to
take funga with it we as long as we saw
the people and he takes the creditor you
be prepared to give it down
thank you yeah sorry yeah we used a lot
of things outside google maps of Google
search engines but google maps we
haven't used because we require the kind
of landmark saw what we require 40 per
square kilometer what you are done is a
little bit at higher level that level of
maps which are required in our towns
what we are talking population of 90,000
and eighty thousand population and the
llalande marks the hospital's the
reference points were not done but maybe
as I was saying that is the partnership
opportunity available between Google and
Satyam a hell of a lot of scope is there
for us to do that but we have spent
money for these towns all ready to go to
that kind of level but I wish we are
able to do something together yeah I
nominate the emergency hot item
yeah that's a good question actually
because we receives a comprehensive
number first of all 108 meant for
medical police and fire and our
emergency handling fifty-seven percent
of the emergencies are police
emergencies forty-three percent are
police medical so so far we handed
23,000 the police emergencies where the
police dispatch officer shifts in our
center and he takes the communication
office at the moment it is a police
emergency he transfers to that guy it
could be crime it could be sexual
assault rape under sometimes ragging
from suppress ragging also people ring
up and say I'm my life is being
threatened and the we send the police
there yep
cuz i think that welcome here with
people back
train your people about it and he see
these special challengers degrees is
going to pick out of the girl
yeah thank you want to know what kind of
present we are doing to ensure that he
goes to a right doctor for the care
basically transport time we want to
minimize where we are putting an
ambulance for you know 100,000
population is one ambulance kind of
thing is what we are planning so country
as a whole we require 10,000 ambulances
to see that the distance traveled is
only both the ways is less than one over
so that the golden hour could be
maintained off secondly the emergency
technicians is a profession which
doesn't exist in the country this is the
first time any concept called
pre-hospital care is first time what we
did was we took the train nurses we took
them physiotherapists we took the other
people first what we could get the
numbers are so we took licensed
graduates fresh ones and train them for
three months and first month in the
classroom one month in the ambulance one
month in the hospitals then every two
months we call them back for refresher
courses so they're able to see the
patient particularly what they need to
do is the 16 emergencies we identified
right from cardiac to poisoning to this
what they need to do in terms of Airways
in terms of breathing in terms of
circulation what they need to do minimum
protocols we have given and kept in the
ambulance for him to do whereas normally
triage is done in the in us in the
emergency departments unfortunately
those numbers do not exist so we are
also working in the direction of
upgrading those emergency rooms and
casualty rooms so that emergency
medicine as a profession has to be
brought to the country it does not exist
today unfortunately thank you
