Daniel home we're both from companies
six starts and we we make alternate
reality games so these are it's kind of
a loose definition that basically leads
a games that take place online and often
use multiple media or take this in the
real world now this project we're
talking about here we tell stories is
not really a classical alternate reality
game it's basically an experiment in
digital fiction so so this project was
obviously for penguin books in the UK
and Penguin have always been very
interested in digital fiction in
experimenting with telling stories
online and last year in 2007 they did a
project called the wiki novel where they
opened up a wiki standard wiki to the
public and they had thousands of people
write a book together and you know it's
very popular I the quality of the story
I think even the people at penguin would
agree that it wasn't you know bestseller
material and and I believe I've heard
someone comment you know it might not
been the most read book but it was sunny
the most written so but you know that
was an interesting spam and this year
they wanted to try something using war
traditionally authored fiction so you
know they got they wanted to see if they
can get their you know their top authors
to create stories online in a way they
could only be done on the web and not in
any other medium so traditionally
stories that are online particularly
those from publishers traditional
publishers like penguin and scholastic
and Harper Collins what they normally do
is they take a text that already exists
you know story or a novel and they go
and put online and they might add some
pictures and had some animations but
really it's just the same book
transplanted onto the web and because
you know current displays aren't very
comfortable to read on I'm arguably the
expense of reading
longform fiction on the web is worse a
lot worse than beating it on normal
paper so what we wanted to do this
project was to explore very new ways of
doing things so we had six authors six
of penguins authors write six different
stories specifically for the web so
these are all six news stories and right
from the very beginning when when they
wrote them we we work for them to sort
of sculpt the story so they were fit the
designs that we're creating for the web
and these six stories were told over six
weeks in six different ways so as far as
our design process goes we started out
by coming out of six story designs you
know you don't think of having to design
a story normally because the design is
always the same it's a book it's about
you know sixty two hundred thousand
words long its linear that's it well we
want to do something different so our
six designs were stories told in google
maps / blogs and Twitter we had a fairy
tale make your own fairytale story we
had a story told live in real time over
five days story told using infographics
and finally a sort of next-generation
cheesier and adventure and like any good
album we wanted to start stronger then
strong so the first story we did was a
one on google maps I mean we knew that
this would get a lot of attention
because it involved maps and look nice
and this story was called the 21 steps
each of the stories each of the six
stories was based off a penguin classic
and this was based off the thriller the
39 steps so this tells a story of a man
who in a case of mistaken identity also
it seems is chased across the United
Kingdom cross you know across the
continent and you follow what he does
over well from above and we didn't know
that from the start I mean we knew that
we wanted to tell us
been using google maps we knew that this
would be an interesting way of doing it
because you really giving a story a
sense of place and we thought okay there
are few different ways we could tell
story we could do it as a as an
adventure as a travelogue you know
around the world in 80 days but seemed
to us like a thriller something that
would involve the character constantly
moving all the time would be the way to
go because if you have the character
sitting still in a building you know
having a meeting or whatever for a few
chapters it gets pretty boring and it's
not a lot of point just looking at one
building all the time not moving so this
obviously uses a google maps engine and
it's a pretty simple design you
basically you know you have these text
bubbles and you can follow the UM the
character move around doesn't seem to be
loading move around the map and it's a
very linear story you just sort of click
through but the advantage of this is
that basic needs it's foolproof you know
we you probably saw there basically no
instructions this all you have to do is
click click next and so this story was
one of the most popular that we did
about quarter of a million people have
edit which is more times and the author
Charles Cummings books have been read
put together so he was pretty happy with
this experiment so here's so Charles
books typically selling the kind of
30,000 copy range so from penguins point
of view for the publishers point of view
this has been a massive success to the
extent that he's now more well known for
having written this piece of short
fiction than he is for writing in spy
novels and the really interesting thing
is that penguin are very happy that you
know they're really quite proud of that
so that the URL to that story is going
to be on dust jackets of his books going
forward because it's going to be like
from the guy who also wrote this I mean
I think it's in been interesting because
you know we work for the Penguins you
know internet team I suppose to do this
and I think you know understandably a
lot of the people on the editorial side
the publishing side were thinking well
is this just going to be another another
gimmick you know is a story going to be
any good
and is it are people actually going to
be able to read this or is it going to
be too difficult to to be too difficult
to play and this story in particular you
know has been really accessible for
people and it you know it just it kind
of just makes sense so you know you can
obviously look different views and we
played around a lot with the well as
these things normally are as soon as we
finished it we came up with a whole
bunch of really cool ideas what what we
could do with telling stories in Google
Maps one of the nice moments we had let
me see what you really have to like what
he's done yeah there's some that's one
moment in the story where the hero gets
captured and he gets locked up in a
shipping container and of course he
doesn't know where he could be he could
be anywhere in the world and this is
where it takes a bit of a nonlinear step
you know he's basically saying well I
could be anywhere within you know
500-mile radius of where I started
because you know he's been knocked out
and he's not sure where he is so you can
imagine doing what we've been kind of a
you know venturing natives and games
here but this is that this is a fairly
short story it was about seven or eight
thousand words you know you can beat it
fairly quickly takes place over London
Scotland and um you know worked well and
the the author the way he described it
is like lighting a film in a film you
have your writer doing the screenplay
and then he passes it over to the
directors who actually you know produce
what you see on screen in this case it
was a sort of collaborative process as
well where he wrote essentially the
screen plane we directed the action and
we worked out how best to show on the
screen so there's some that there's some
interesting stuff that we figured out
when we were designing this we kind of
got to our very last sprint and then we
realized that we wanted to try something
different with the way that we're
displaying the text on the screen we
weren't entirely sure that that the
standard API call outs were the best way
to do that with the pop-ups so one of
the things that we try doing is we tried
just basically sticking a div down at
the bottom semi-transparent so that we
could overlay text in it and kind
subtitle way and we instantly figured
out that that really wasn't going to be
the way to go because people already are
familiar with the Google Maps interface
that you already know how it works and
there's something really nice about just
realizing the simplicity of okay I've
seen google maps before this normally
tells me where my nearest pizza hut or
wherever is but all you've done is
you've just changed the text in there
and then I've realized that we can
actually tell a story using this kind of
thing and I can find out what's
happening next the other thing that we
noticed was that people really started
to invest in the way point marker and in
the blue line that animates you know
this this guy going around they're
getting really really kind of like oh my
god where is he going to go next and we
think that's partly a combination of the
first person narrative so you know you
actually do have that way point market
talking to you it's not like I'm feeling
quite nervous you know I got bundled
into a car and then suddenly it zips off
down and people are familiar with that
kind of movement because they've seen on
stuff like Indiana Jones before and what
was really interesting was that you know
people were really really getting into
we had quite a lot of elements of
sightseeing that you normally get with
something like Google Maps so people
were going okay this is really fun
because you know I can see I went to
that cafe and he's going down the street
that I used to go to to get to work yeah
we had some people say that they quite
liked it because they're going to visit
London and there was a nice way to see
what they should see around London and
um I mean obviously you know the
technology behind this has nothing sat
only in advanced what we really
concentrated on in this and all the
other stories is really the user
experience if you're telling a story in
a new way then you really have to make
that you know the process of
experiencing it reading it as smooth as
possible otherwise you know the worst
possible thing is that they start
reading it and they don't understand
what they're supposed to do and so we we
tried made you know the obviously it has
the auto scrolling so you can follow
where the um well the protagonist is
going that that took a while to make it
work in you know in internet explorer
and all the other browsers and yeah so
it's quite interesting because I'm like
really technically this isn't anything
that anyone could have any way
couldn't have done about you know 10 20
years ago on a multimedia cd-rom it's
it's fantastic because so many people
could see it and really I mean we just
used a standard Django backend for this
the way that we got the text from our
author was that he just delivered it as
Word documents or his email and we had a
junior game designer in putting all the
coordinates and all the animation data
into the Django admin interface so they
could go in there so there's you know
there's obviously a bit of tweaking in
its kind of really early dog foodie and
that there's not anything we
particularly want to expose to normal
people to have to use because it gets a
bit headache after a while but it was I
mean it only took about you know it took
it like a weeks it could look me in a
less than less than two weeks you know
to make the whole thing and I I'd
learned how to use the admin interface
in about ten minutes even though it was
pretty didn't have any instructions so
we did get a few emails from the Google
Maps team asking you know are you going
to open it up to the public were you
there people write their own stories and
so on I think it's some like Dan said I
mean it's we would want something that
was a bit more straightforward but i
think it's it's not a difficult thing to
do and actually you know the genesis of
this design came quite a while before we
had the project I had an idea to make a
story in Google Maps a while ago and I
tried doing it using the my maps feature
you know just a standard stuff you can
do to make your own map but um you know
that's that that's not to be there to
tell the story it's a the my maps
feature is to sort of give you a static
picture and you know work out directions
and work out where things are there was
no good way of telling a linear sort of
narrative and jumping from one point to
the next so I'm you know I think doing
this is really necessary to sort of tell
a good story google maps and some of the
some of the feedback that we got was
quite well not necessarily surprising it
was just rather unanticipated we heard a
lot from teachers who said that they
were using the tool a lot that though
using the story a lot to work with kids
in English classes mainly because you
know it was a really fantastic way of
introducing them to a classic text but
also because it
something that we had explicitly
designed to be as engaging and immersive
as possible you know so it needed to be
something that worked and the other
thing was the slightly more predictable
thing of as soon as people saw it they
really kind of got the concept and then
we're like okay right I give it five
minutes until someone scanning the
entire map of middle-earth and then
they've spent the next three months
working out you know all the different
way points for Lord of the Rings which
is surprising because no one's done that
yet people are people people on to teach
history are using this people want to UM
also you know it's also very good as for
teaching English as a foreign language
actually because you know I'm told it's
very difficult to get you know to sort
of engage people i'm just reading more
staff and you know often teachers
teaching english as a foreign language
will get people to watch movies with
subtitles on and that sort of stuff so
this this is another good way of
engaging people to actually meet leed
stuff so so that was the first we
obviously one of the most popular ones
could want to start on the second story
was by Toby lit it was called slice and
this was a horror story told it's a
inspired by mr James's classic the
haunted dolls house and this one was
told over five days over to two blocks
over a girl called slice slightly
mentally disturbed girl and her parents
who moved from America to the UK and
also these these updates on the blogs
were reflected on Twitter so you know we
just wanted a way of you know allowing
people who are following the story to
get these updates in real time and this
this story was it was a really good
story actually is quite suspenseful and
people we have a lot of people following
on Twitter we the decision to put on
Twitter was actually a fairly
last-minute um you know we hadn't really
decided whether this is going to be a
good idea where they made a lot of sense
and actually the nice thing that we did
that the author did as well was um to
sort of rewrite the story specifically
for Twitter so it's not just a question
obviously of cutting and pasting and
you know because that wouldn't make a
lot of sense within the character limit
and within the actual use of mobile
phones so the nice thing was a the
author got into it and started you know
having a conversation with the leaders
not just over Twitter which is you know
obviously that's one of them runs there
but also I'm over email and so on so
this was quite a you know quite a nice
use basically over of you know different
media is quite popular for for younger
people and the twitter thing was quite
interesting because this was so this was
back in March before we had kind of
spline type objects or objects blogging
or being anthropomorphised so we very
very quickly something that we hadn't
anticipated them we need to make a
rather quick decision on was what do we
do when people started following our
fictional characters on Twitter because
we didn't need to follow them back it
was kind of like well okay duh we can
just follow them back and and then we
had the wonderful kind of ripple effect
of all these people who decided to
follow our characters then twittering to
all their friends saying oh my god I'm
being followed by a fictional character
in the story and so it wasn't anything
different than say telling a story in a
blog and then people posting comments to
the blog and then the author or the
fictional character writing back but
there was something that was slightly
different about that exchange when there
was an explicit following back and then
so the communication wasn't necessarily
different but it was the fact that you
know someone had made this kind of
friend requests and then the other
person the fictional but it's
reciprocated it back and clearly you
know is a good way of spreading word of
mouth you know see Twitter obviously you
know we we were here to sort of promote
about the awesome promote the book so
the third story was basically write your
own fairytale not not literally but
you're in fairy tale but help write your
own fairytale so this is for for kids
written by kevin Brooks a young adult
fighter and this is again you know
nothing technically amazing here we
basically had you know you can sort of
name the characters
in in the story and then you know you
can you can share these with your
friends as well and you know it gives
you it's a bit like a choose your own
adventure but instead of being a
branching narrative where you know the
decision points of tree of choices keeps
on going out it keeps on going back in
for the same sort of structure st.
classic structure with a fairy tale
where you start you know with a
misfortune then you've got in your quest
and then you've got your that's actually
a very sad fairy tale I should tell you
that in London there's an asset kind of
um Brothers Grimm chrono tradition you
can choose between a bad ending a very
bad ending in the terrible ending and
and that not not quite so sad but still
sad and think so if you scroll up a bit
the one of the one of the nice things
about this is that the kind of what
people normally expect when you have a
text boxes that is going to influence
the text that comes next so you're being
asked a question and then it will then
reap and then all right the next part
the story so one of the small things
that we did was make sure that it just
updates everything that happened
beforehand so then it starts off
properly with your name and this is
another this is another long destroy
square you know one of the design goals
we have this is no instructions
basically we didn't want to anyone we
don't people to have to read any
instructions so it's just questions what
what animal be most helpful you know so
this is sort of stuff you could do
decades ago really on computers but it's
a question of you know making it really
responsive and making the experience
really really good the process of
writing this was quite trouble the first
author be contacted about this I don't
you know had problems sort of
understanding the structure because it
was basically there about their six
sections and you have to like four
modules for each section and they can be
sort of slotted in and started out and
so so that didn't work out very well and
our second author Kevin you know we had
to spend a lot of time you know sitting
down and explaining exactly of structure
the story of him and really that was
actually probably the most challenging
part of the whole project is the first
first meeting with each of the six
authors the technology is something that
we can be able to use experience is
something that we can do but talking to
the authors and getting an understanding
from from both sides about how best to
tell the story how best to write it to
fit you know the medium was a real was
really interesting I think you know
we've always worked with a lot of
authors and we've always worked and with
stories and what we do and in a nice
thing about this as a lot of the authors
came out of it not just happy about the
end product but also happy about process
because you know obviously would be
pretty bad if the the authors came and
didn't join how they did it so the
fourth story was really fun this was a
street told are written and told in real
time over five days so in the same way
that you know we you have these classic
video drama serials well so you know
tune in tomorrow 630 to find you know
the thrilling conclusion we wanted to do
the same thing but allow the writers to
write it in real time and so we so
basically this was written by Nikki
French and Nikki French is actually two
people these people like are through
psychological thrillers psychological
horror novels and you know it's always
been a sort of thing about how these
people these Nikki freighter actually
two people and you know how do they
write together you know today there's
one person like one bit and one person
write another bit and so for this we
basically split them apart and each
person wrote one half of a story a
horror story about a relationship
between two people when they meet and
when they break up and obviously the
inevitable grisly conclusion and so
people people you know you would come to
this web web page basically and you
would see the text being written letter
by letter as the guys as the authors of
writing at home and they aren't they
obviously know
the story they obviously you know have
an understanding what the plot of the
story is in advance they're not just
making it up completely off the top of
their heads but they they're not also
you know they don't know what it is word
for word and so for them it was a quite
a exciting what a frightening experience
I think for them because you know
obviously the normal process of writing
is you know particular of writing
stories of writing novels as a you know
you draft at redraft anyway you have
edited and there's enough time to really
get a polished and in this case you know
as they wrote it appeared on people's
Queens thousands of people screens
around the world and this was this you
know this I'll give the example this
this project was really interesting to
the BBC they wanted to send up a camera
crew to the author's houses and you know
film out you know show on TV and and the
authors were not happy about that they
said they'd rather not because they're
already nervous and having a camera crew
would make them even more nervous and if
you've got writer's block that would be
pretty fatal for this particular project
you know it just stops they stopped
writing though are they both dead so so
the nice thing about this was you know
obviously we had to them people and and
when they soft it out on day one
actually you can see they played around
the medium as well and this is because
we didn't know what the story was going
to be at the start you have these two
people and you know this Lawrence like
to come up here and then let's check you
know there's some Terry writing one line
and it's we're kind of what on the first
day we're thinking this is kind of a bit
bit of a shame there isn't more back and
forth here you know there's it's just
one big block and another big block you
know what's the point of doing this
worryingly it looks like they were just
copy and pasting well yeah but but you
know as as a days went on you know you
find them basically they're literally
literally talking over each other and
this is kind of interesting wave for
them writing and I'm reading reading the
story and of course we have opened up a
chat room for everyone reading the
stories
so you know they were all talking about
oh my god what's going to happen next I
hate Lauren so you know why won't he and
why is he treating Terry so badly and
the authors you know what I think we're
in the chat room and just sitting what
the audience reaction was and for them
it was a every time we've done stories
where authors of writing in real time
the authors love it it's like I don't
know it's like crank basically they keep
on what I doing because authors you know
the very few I think they're very few um
situations where people have have to be
creative in real time you have improv
artists you know comedians stand up
comedians you know actors that musicians
you know that sort of thing and I think
writers you know particular types of
writers really enjoy becoming
performance and becoming their
characters um on a physical sense but
but you know through the miracle of
Technology um so this was so this was
fairly interesting because our original
spec for this original functional
requirements well we wanted to see every
single keystroke in particular we want
to see back spaces as well and we didn't
I don't know if we'd actually told the
authors that we wanted to see back
spaces as well but given how nervous
they were about the entire thing it is
probably for the best that we weren't
able to do that and it turned out that
you know so we talked to our developers
about this right right we want to see
every single thing as it happens you
know best case we have tens hundreds of
thousands of clients and then we know
that it's going to be really bursty and
everything is just going to happen
between you know six and 650 every
evening and they went you're on crack
there's only two of us and we have to
have this done in about two weeks so no
they said because you know what turns
out HTTP is a really really silly way of
doing that so what we realized was okay
the trade-off that we did was we
captured the text on the author's
computers and that was sent over but in
fact what we ended up doing was we ended
up faking all of the keystrokes so what
we did was we just captured the
paragraph and then we display it locally
and then we introduce some jitter and we
introduce some random
error in terms of the timings so that it
just looks like it's being typed and
because we didn't need to show you know
all you need to know was that they were
typing in real time and it was it would
have been nice if we could see stuff
like the back spaces and we could see
them changing words but really it was
enough to see that it was being typed
and you didn't need to know that that
was a thing when we suddenly roused you
didn't need to know the exact timing of
the keystrokes and really you know the
the lag was about five or ten seconds so
if it was any bigger than that we would
have problems in the chat room you know
people saying oh my God he's dead and
something what's I haven't seen that yet
so um you know we we had a lot of
constraints on this one I think you know
there were better ways of doing this
yeah okay I'm it got quite silly because
we're kind of thinking right well really
the best way of doing this is making
sure that everyone's got a multi-course
connection and we just stream them
typing onto a screen and putting a video
camera at it then you can see every
single keystroke that you have questions
right now I think anything and effect
yeah it seems like do kind of like stop
at the sentence and wait for the other
one yeah so the question was you know
how the authors you know synchronize and
what you know were they were they
writing over each other they want two
different computers and basically I'm
pretty sure they were actually just
sitting next to each other um so no
doubt they're helping you know there are
sort of coordinating that way and you
know it's when when they submit the bit
of texture gets posted we have not not
in this project but we have actually
done live storytelling using multiple
authors like three or four authors in
real time across different continents
and that's you know that does get a bit
more complicated and what we had to do
we opened up a sub ether edit document
so this is a mac text editor where you
can do collaborative writing and you can
see who's writing each bit and you can
do that in real time and they we also
have another second week
room where the authors could talk about
what they were going to do next and it
was a really interesting experience that
particular project because you could see
people you can see one person writing
one line another person fighting the
next line because they knew they
literally talked about what they're
going to do the third person editing
both people's texts and you know this
that type of collaboration inviting I
think doesn't happen very often and I
think we look to IRC for this yeah what
yeah you know the clients the web
clients suck yeah and they're just would
we didn't want anyone to have to login
or you know we'll use any kind of java
thing that would have really really
crippled these or at least the websites
did suck I think that's a really great
where I also client has come out over
the last month or so sweetly the story
writing since you essentially captured
the paragraphs and then emulated the
typing I'm pretty sure that's actually
possible I mean we talked about it but
we didn't really know whether people
would enjoy that yeah I think I think
the only the only problem with that is
that you know there is even though you
know the stories are saying you know you
have this knowledge that's more live
experience anymore and the fact is they
weren't the fastest type is in the world
because I want to get it right so you
said you would I mean that I don't know
how many words over here it's probably
only you know maybe maximum you know a
thousand probably less than that and
that takes place over over them in an
hour so you know I'm not sure how
entertaining it would be if you know you
didn't know it was live and if you
weren't able to sort of gossip of the
other readers in the chat room and in a
spec today on what's going to happen
next so I you know I didn't think this
is going to send me have become a new
wave of entertainment like that sand but
um but I think it is you know very
interesting for a lot of people to sort
of get get a glimpse of AB writing
process actually of these guys yeah
otherwise it might be a bit like you
know reading your project gutenberg text
over 300 baud modem it kind of like
waiting for the next bits would be so
that the first
I was by a guy called map Mason who
wrote a book called a pirate style Emma
about you know copyright and so on and
also its collaborative Nicholas Felton
and this is this is a story basically
told in infographics and we you know not
a lot of technology behind this really
um it was it's basically an essay about
the how the internet is changing markets
and changing people's behaviors and this
is you know just speaking from a kind of
writing and graphic design perspective
this is a very challenging one to do um
we I i think you know we might do things
differently if we did it again because
you know is the the manuscript got
delivered as a fairly text heavy
document and then the designer Nicholas
had to go and convert it into what you
see now and you know just sort of
provide something that's visually
interesting web you know the graphs and
so on and the charts and also you know
tell you know fit the text in you know
it was it was a difficult difficult
challenge but I think you know they did
they did a good job the best job they
could but it was and a Nicholas felt
Nicholas is a absolutely fantastic
graphic designer he he produces these
annual reports in the style of a
corporate report where he just kind of
covers all of his personal achievements
and statistics throughout the year I
think one of the forms of this one is
that we just didn't have enough
statistics actually we needed more staff
and you know that was a problem and what
we actually wanted to do was we did want
to do a comic book and we want to do a
really really cool comic book online in
the way that you don't commonly see
comic books online so we just didn't
want to do the kind of straight PDF or
you know here's a big scans jpg of a
comic book and it was actually a
question of kind of like production
logistics and lead times in terms of
getting someone who was Gooden who
someone who'd be able to illustrate to
the standard that we wanted we could get
the script ready but actually getting
all the artwork prepared and inked and
colored and everything was
going to take too long in a kind of
reinsert vector flash ready for Matt and
you know we're not big fans of flash in
terms of you know delivering these sorts
of experiences in terms of accessibility
and speed and you know in just
development so obviously all the stuff
is just done you know using HTML and
JavaScript and actually thinking about
it using using something like like the
Google Maps display Android where you
replace the tiles with comic book images
and then you can kind of scroll from one
place to the other and you can zoom in
we'd actually be a pretty interesting
way as opposed to because like the
experience of reading PDF comics is just
really bad and especially the flash ones
as well because you can it's just slow
you have to zoom in you can't see the
image and the text at the same time and
you can't see the entire thing so yeah I
think a lot of a lot of well I'm not
going to get into that um you know I
don't know sort of comment too much
about about you know comics online but I
think you know it is the way in which
you know graphic novels are told online
i think is very conservative and i think
a lot of these guys you know would
prefer to be honest to be to be doing on
paper and that's often what they
graduate to actually so I'm so this last
row yes I mentioned that you know we
kind of wanted to start strong and end
strong this one does not look as pretty
as the other stories but it's it's a
choose your own adventure and I I don't
know whether you guys know what
achievement Adventure is it's basically
traditionally it's a book we're on the
first page yet it's a book that you play
so its first page don't say you know
you're running from a dinosaur do you
you know try and attack it if so turn to
page 20 do you try and run away more if
so turn to page 22 so it's these sort of
branching narratives and at the start of
the project our penguin work they said
you know you can do whatever you want
but we think would be really cool idea
she did the chooser an adventure because
surely that makes a lot of sense on the
web you know children adventures have
links and pages the web has hypertext
you know why not put that together and
initially I I was a bit resistant to
this idea because I've not seen cheese
red adventures done on the web
very well at all if you've ever better
choose an adventure certainly certainly
the way I read these books is when i get
them about one minute in I've got five
fingers stuck into the book because you
know I go and put I go and like bookmark
the page at all the different choice
points so if I die I think oh well this
one doesn't work I'll go back try try
try the other choice oh no they both end
up and dying or can I going to go back
to their previous decision point you
will win and the problem which is your
own adventures is that you die really
often and you can't like fine I'm dead
I'm dead again I'm dead and and you know
and that's you know that's kind of a fun
or the experience to do when you're a
kid and wow it's a book that's a game
but when you're doing on the web the
traditional you know that metaphor of
you know sticking your show your fingers
in the book it just doesn't work on the
web because you've got this metal of
forward and backwards you know that's
that's how it works you know if you're
just using you know HTML pages and
hyperlinks and you know bookmarks it
doesn't work because you know you don't
you know the page numbers you can't see
spatially where it is in the book and
quickly flip back and forward to you
know work out where you are browser
history just kind of works against us
because it's really not a linear you
know and which is interesting because
browser is browsing isn't a linear
experience and you do have kind of
branching so that was a problem for us
and so you know I'll give me I think a
lot of you know choosing adventures on
the web are actually worse than the ones
in book form another problem with choose
your own adventures is just a nature of
the story structure itself I think your
first these dancers ends up in a lot of
deaths which is you know good if your
kid and you know like things blowing up
and that sort of thing but you know for
other type of story it's difficult but
more fundamentally traditional choose
your own adventures have a branching
narrative you know that's the entire
point so you start off with a single you
know start point and then it branches
out then it branches out and branches
out you've got a lot of mutually
exclusive endings and you know very you
know what becomes very apparent early on
is that really most people if they're
going to do one or two redos I'm never
going to read the majority of what's
written we
is a terrible waste the second thing is
if you do want to read the majority of
what's written then you have to do an
awful lot you're reading the same stuff
again and again and again and there's a
lot of repetition lot of backtracking
that's good to do in the book it's
pretty tedious to do on online and you
know certainly when I when I read these
books as a kid I would lead them about
four or five times and then I get sick
of it and I go and stop meeting from the
back and stop meeting the endings first
and then trying to track back and work
out how did I get to this ending then
how do you go get killed by you know the
flying dinosaur and then it just then
just gets a bit silly so I was I didn't
feel like this was necessarily the best
way of telling good a proper literally
story because that's what they wanted to
do they didn't want to do you know joke
or a gimmick they wanted to tell a
really good story so we came up with a
system where we had a sort of hybrid
children adventure dungeon map and text
adventure and so basically the links
between the different choices in this
were represented spatially so here this
is you've got the title card in here you
know you press down just down arrow key
to to get to the first think and we
failed and are no instruction thing here
they're probably 20 words of
instructions a lot of people skip them
but anyway and you can see this as mini
map down here so it shows you that there
sir it'll sell down here that we haven't
been to just can be down so begin
beating slowly and it starts out you set
up your desk the president of a country
with nuclear weapons simmering
insurgencies and rapidly proliferating
pop starlets on music television and you
have three choices to move around and
sort of it being a link as you move
around if you say you go and say okay
leave your office you can see okay
that's where I was this is where i am
now i can easily figure out how to get
back to where I started and you know the
green the green box here shows you it
shows you where you come and they are
now interesting i don't know whether you
noticed but as you move around the text
in the cells actually changes so that
you know that did say you were the
president of a country now it says
something else so this is story that you
know changes in some simple ways based
on the way in which you read it so I'm
going to rewind a bit too to the process
of actually writing this story because
you can see that you know we have this
we have this interface which allows
people to navigate around the story
spatially allows you to alter the shape
and the content of the story based on
your actions and you know this although
it's quite simple it's very flexible you
can tell a lot of different types of
stories using this and we work the
author for this story those are most in
hamid and mohsin hamid was probably the
biggest name of the six he was nominated
for the Booker Prize a couple of years
ago top Prize in fiction he would a
story called The Reluctant
Fundamentalist and he we spent a long
time talking about what would be the
best way of telling a story in this
structure so the first and simplest way
of doing it would be to do a traditional
branching narrative choose an adventure
where you start at one point and you
just cascade down and you know for the
reasons that I mentioned before I didn't
think this is good idea and I think he
agreed with that he didn't want it he
didn't have a lot of time did like this
he only had a week to write it and he
didn't want to do right over content
that no one ever see now the other
extreme for this story was to do
something very advanced something almost
like a text adventure but you could
imagine if you put enough contingencies
input of rules in you could have a
system where I could go and press right
and it would say pick up the sword and
then we press theft you've got the sword
now go and kill this person you know
it's basically a fairly simple text
adventure where you need multiple choice
sex adventure and you know after doing a
bit of paper prototyping on this this
concept we quickly realized that this
would take too long to do and it would
require mohsin the author to become
essentially a programmer and that just
wasn't going to happen I mean he was a
smart guy
but he didn't want to do that so he went
away and you know we didn't really know
what what we're going to do but he came
back with um well I can show you this is
this is his manuscript was delivered as
a PowerPoint presentation actually um
probably the first time that's been done
and he this is a shape of his story the
map of his story and so you can see
obviously it's not a drenching narrative
arm and you know obviously it's not it's
not too small to be a text adventure
what it is is basically it's three ways
of telling nonlinear stories in one
story so let me let me show you what
this means um you know I'm going to do
this I'm going to use a pointer because
otherwise it's not going to make any
sense if it here you start out here and
there are three options you can go to
left you go down or you can go to the
right now and all these things add up to
the same story you know they sorry
they're all parts of the same story and
there is no ending to this you know
there is no there's no end point it's
just you know it's a piece you know and
you have to read all of it to understand
it and you have to read some parts of it
twice but when you do when you are in
that situation to have the backtrack
it's not that you're reading Lee exactly
the same thing it's changed and so you
know we wanted to sort of make that made
by quite a unique experience so anyway
if you if you start out well the final
thing I'll say is the story is about
it's about former general he's become
president it's basically about President
Musharraf in Pakistan Mohsin Hamid so in
Pakistan he wanted to write about the
political situation there so if you go
left at the start then you go into this
traditional kind of granting narrative
like in normal user an adventure so
there's kind of a first the first stage
and each of these branches involves a
present reminiscing about his childhood
and if you go up here that you can
reminisce about your first fight you can
reminisce about your homework you can
reminisce about poem and each of these
branches arm tells a sort of unique
story but after you've read all three
you wear those are actually talking
about the same event they're just three
different depiction of the same event
and what's more and buggy and depending
on which order you read them in you get
a different different understanding how
things happen so let's go over there and
it is up here we are so your first fight
with top your schoolwork so if you go up
here then begin think about your first
fight and just just notice at it you
know a boy's first fighter a tree test
of character does not matter whether he
emerges a victorious what matters is
whether he holds his head high you of
course did both on that morning the only
go so to lines of text if you go up here
then you can go and find out what
happened in the fight I won't spoil it
but anyway when you come back down again
of course it's changed you know because
we know people are gonna have to come
back down again and it's sort of twisted
the meaning of of what happened in that
sand that's that's what happens in each
of those three branches so that's kind
of it's not rocket science but it's just
an interesting way of telling a story
but you don't magically prevent you from
reading this no you can you can go back
and forth yeah it will be the same I
mean it could you know that it wouldn't
be difficult to make it you know keep on
changing but you know so the question is
about whether we have a kind of bread
crumb trail or whether we showed the
history of your journey through the
neurons well well I think I think that
you know what I think you know on that
dimension it's becoming more of you know
a game than than the story and there's
nothing wrong with that but I think and
I think it's an interesting thing to try
basically saying you know you color the
cells and once you sort of finish that
part of strong once you've done all the
interactions and you know the only thing
I can say is this is basically version 1
and and you know mohsen had a lot of
other ideas of how he could tell stories
and he was kind of interested in saving
those for version two if you want we can
call this the beater helps that there
sure so so I'm so the back to the bottom
this is a circular story no no special
technology here but it's just an
interesting way of telling a story it's
a poem and depending on whether you read
it clockwise or anti-clockwise and
obviously it's very easy and simple to
do using the way we've set it up you get
a very different understanding of his
life ah and you know if you were doing
this in a chooser an adventure but could
be pretty annoying because it's a go to
94 go to semi to go to a lot of going
around here you can you can just press
left and right and it works just just
normally and to the light this is the
labyrinth this is the former general in
his labyrinth and you can you sort of
this is a figure of eight here and you
can travel around it and obviously a lot
of different ways you can go around the
outside you can go clockwise or
anti-clockwise you can arm
you know a lot of different different
ways to go around this and the challenge
here was more of a you know not only a
technical challenges more of a voting
challenge because to write the story of
like a poem that can be written so it
can be read in multiple different
directions and multiple different
combinations and still make sense and
not just make sense but actually you
know have some sort of meaning is really
incredibly difficult I've tried writing
a circular story myself it's very
difficult to do to do something like
this where it's going around you have to
employ of all the tricks you have to
think about it very carefully and have
lots of bits of paper I'm told and the
interesting thing about this is not just
that you know you can tell you know it's
it's a kind of fun gimmick but the the
structure thus through itself reflects
the content of the stroy you know it is
a labyrinth you know his Pleasant
musharraf is basically you know he's
saying that doesn't match after that is
in this sort of endless existence in
which he has fewer and fewer options and
the things he does every day the same
things he does every day that's why you
know you can go around this you know
several times and okayed it you know it
may seem like it's the same text but it
has a different meaning and certainly
the way in which you navigate informs
the way the destroy the meaning of the
actual story and so this for me this
last story was probably the most novel
form of storytelling we came up of the
six stories um this is you know it is
kind of like a Chunin adventure but it's
a different sort of thing and we were we
weren't sure you know how how it'd be
accepted but what we're really pleased
by is that critically people really like
this to me it wasn't you know but the
google map stones is a fun story was a
great story but a lot of people are
talking about its australian google maps
how cool is that you know buddy let's
talk about the technology whereas this
is that one of the funny criticisms of
that one and because people and many
impart that that was one that most
people looked at was that people were
upset that it was a linear story and
we're
so well yeah it was based on the linear
you know it isn't linear story is based
on it's very much about how its
presented to you and how you experience
it as opposed to the choices so you can
make and and with this you know this is
kind of the tutor and event to the
former general was really a perfect
storm because mohsin really understood
the form of the stream what what we
needed and when he when he submitted you
know this the story map i I didn't know
what it was actually I had to get him to
explain it to me and I was really
impressed by what he came up with
because now you know he obviously
understands nonlinear storytelling in
this in this fashion more than I do and
for him he said that he he genuinely
learned a lot about the process of
writing actually from doing this about
the process of storytelling and you know
narrative and I think you know that's
one and there's a third thing we
obviously you know we entertain you know
thousands of readers with this and I
think that's a pretty good result for
this for this particular story it was
quite interesting because for for all of
our authors really because we had gone
to them and we'd worked with penguin in
terms of selecting right what text what
classic text do we want to come from
what is the interaction method that we
preferred you know how do we want to
tell this story and then we work to the
penguin also to select an author and
because this was partly although this
wasn't entirely and marketing exercise
there was obviously marketing involved
and we wanted to target authors who had
titles coming out in the next few months
um it was it wasn't necessarily case of
asking and also if they wanted to do it
more a kind of case of write your books
coming out in the next few months it
would be really good if you participated
in this marketing event and you know
that the worst thing to happen with this
is not so much no one reads it because
people are used to that on the web it's
that the authors would take the
experience because if that happened you
know word would get around and people
would not waters would not want to take
part in this sort of thing and the great
thing is that a lot of the authors have
said you know if you do this again I
want to be there and a lot of new
authors have come to us and said
you know if you're playing this you know
count me in so you know as a marketing
exercise you know it did succeed we had
hundreds of thousands of readers it was
you know penguin I'm very pleased I
think you know what it what's shown to
us is that people are willing you know
it's possible to tell accessible and
good stories on the web in ways that you
really cannot do on paper on an
immediate and so you know this is an
area that that we are you know you know
we're happy that we can continue doing
this sort of stuff for people like
penguin and other publishers and I think
you know it was a good good first
project for us yes and and it was it was
really interesting in terms that you
know but for a lot of the authors the
way that they worked was and especially
would say Charlie in the very first
story was that he essentially did it
delivered something like a screenplay
and we were the directors and we were
kind of like right we know how this is
going to work you know we know how this
is going to be displayed and we can deal
with all of that and it was really I
think what was helpful on the other side
on the right side was that we're coming
to them when we weren't saying right
we're going to do something that's going
to be really cool and online because
your history and no one's going to buy
books anymore which is entirely what we
didn't want to do and was interesting in
some of the terms of reaction that we
got to the project because were like
this isn't all we're trying to do is say
short fiction short stories are
fantastic can we tell them in a
different way not a better way but can
we just tell them in a different way and
what was really nice was that Charlie
was saying stuff like you know having
having the constraints and that this
particular medium so say just Google
Maps brought upon it meant that he had
to find writing in a different style and
that was create creatively that was very
interesting to him because it was
pushing him in ways that he wouldn't
necessarily have gone on with
traditional novel writing and it's not
like we were saying to any of our
joining of our writers you know we're
going to make you do something that you
really really don't want to do it was
more a kind of here are some interesting
stuff that we're doing online we would
like you to try it and you don't have to
like it you know it's perfectly fine if
what you want to do is just kind of do
the solitary novel writing experience
and there is no kind of judgment call
that but there is this genuinely
interesting
thing happening over here that we would
like you to try and there's been a
fantastic reception inside penguin at
least on not so much on the kind of
traditional editing side because the
editors are still very much kind of like
right we've got our authors and they
must write books please do not distract
them with this new internet stuff but
what's really nice is that there is this
kind of groundswell of going right but
we could also have them doing other
things they don't just have to be
writers who produce novels they can be
people who curate an experience there's
that I kind of one end on two things one
The Daily Telegraph in the UK said it's
really telling that this project has
called we tell stories it's not we
enforce our copyrights or you know we
you know we you know you know we publish
paper books it's a we tell stories it is
about storytelling and we're just
telling stories in a different way and
you know the discussion that broader
discussion about books and the internet
circulates around eBook readers and
ebooks which is a really I think well
it's an important discussion but it's
quite a it's a big noise what you can
actually do the new technology it's like
when people started making us plays on
TV there we just film the play from some
of thumb and now of course we have
different things so this is just really
one of the first explorations of how we
can tell stories and novel ways on the
Internet so thanks yeah
