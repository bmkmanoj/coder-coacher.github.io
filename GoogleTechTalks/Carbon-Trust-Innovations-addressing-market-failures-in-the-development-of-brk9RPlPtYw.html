seminar today we have mark williamson
and robert rizona from the uk's carbon
trust the Carbon Trust is a private
company set up by the UK government to
combat the threat of climate change
Robert is the head of research and
development and responsible for the
carbon trust investment in low-carbon rd
mark is the director of innovations and
so both Robert and Mark have PhDs Robert
as a PhD in material science and Mark
has a PhD in wireless communications so
they're here today to talk about
assessment frameworks methods of
intervention and future plans for carbon
trust innovations first of all thank you
very much chef introduction house and
it's a real pleasure to be here I think
when we decided to come and visit
California at this time we'd already
made some contacts with google in London
and thought this would be a great place
to be to talk about innovation
low-carbon technologies and indeed the
work you are doing in re less than C as
i said i'm at of research and
development i'm joined by mike
williamson who is the director of
innovations who looks after all of our
technology work rd demonstration and
business incubation so let me tell you a
bit about the carbon trust what we do
Carbon Trust is a private company that
is funded at the moment by the UK
government so almost all of the money
that we have and the investments that we
make grants wicked and so on comes from
the UK taxpayer we have a turnover of
about 100 million pounds and a staff of
150 however we can make profit we're
allowed to make earnings from some of
the activities that we do but they're
reinvested in into our activities are
not distributed to shareholders and y
are independent well we're actually
accountable to the UK government is tons
of carbon saved per pound invested so an
independent entity were essentially a
company that tries to maximize that
number unlike a normal company which
tries to max
mais profitability and that's all pulled
together by this mission so the Carbon
Trust is a company that really has a
mission that drives everything we do
it's pretty simple to accelerate the
move to a low-carbon economy but it's
pretty profound and the words in there
that really means something to us are
accelerate we're all about making things
happen faster than they would do if the
private sector alone we're operating
low-carbon is fairly you know obvious
and that means various things we'll talk
about that more in a minute but economy
is actually pretty important right and
what we're talking about is is using
public funds taxpayers money to generate
a sustainable low-carbon economy so for
us a low-carbon economy is a sustainable
commercially viable version of the UK or
any other economy that does not rely on
subsidy so then the type of the tour
we're talking about market failures and
interventions what we're trying to do
with with with this public money that
wear it with which were entrusted is to
use the minimum possible intervention to
try and make that low carbon economy
happen more quickly we've got a even
operating that for about seven years and
we have this pretty strong mandate from
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair gave us
this sort of you know instruction if you
like to take the lead not just in
helping businesses with saving carbon
today but also in developing new
low-carbon technologies and there are
four areas of the carbon trust that act
on that mission the first of the area
that mark and I working in Mark heads-up
that division that's innovations and has
specifically focused on new low-carbon
technologies but that's augmented by
three other areas so investments is a
VCR Misek it's a commercial venture
capital company that makes investments
in low-carbon companies on commercial
terms Enterprises is a corporate
venturing arm again its commercial arm
of the carbon trust it uses seed capital
from our public funds but it tries to
create self-sustaining fully commercial
businesses loans and salix are two are
two interventions where we provide
interest-free loans to
in the case of loans SME small bit and
medium-sized enterprises and salix to
the public sector to try and deploy
carbon saving capital equipment that
wouldn't otherwise wouldn't otherwise
happen so they actually quite a range of
different things we do that all act on
low-carbon technologies they're all
driven by that mission about the
low-carbon economy so when we think
about what needs to happen and what sort
of transition technologies products
low-carbon services need to go through
to make that make that a reality there
are sort of for journeys we use this
pretty simple framework to think about
everything we do in the carbon
technology you're probably familiar with
this concept of take going from basic
research through demonstration through
early adopters and finally to having a
fully warranted product that generates
that's that was regarded by customers as
having high quality the other three
journeys are less commonly talked about
but in our experience they're essential
as something to think through quite
carefully if you're trying to get new
low carbon technology to market so all
for us any low carbon technology is is
sold or marketed by private company
we're all about trying to get private
companies to do that and the company
itself as well as the technology has to
go through transition to make that
happen we've worked with a lot of small
start-up spin-out companies but also
even within a large company quite
frequently it's a new business unit or a
new venture within a large company that
drives through a destructive new
technology so that's important it's also
important to think about the market and
again the sounds obvious but we work
we've worked with thousands of people
who have great concepts for technology
but their understanding of really where
the markets are going to be is not as
sophisticated as it needs to be and
quite often they don't have the
resources to necessarily get that data
and that's a key area where we help it
will be run field trials to help an
entire sector understand their market
better and thereby overcome key barriers
in that and finally the regulation
journey is very relevant for low-carbon
because most of the technologies or
products that we are looking at operate
and regulated markets and what we've
seen is generally the ray
ulation that exists has been formulated
in total ignorance of this new concept
this new product that might be coming
through and quite often it's
unintentionally negative and it's
impeding that product so we do a lot of
work where we look at how we can
influence regulation and we have a track
record of making that happen so this is
another way of looking at the structure
of the carbon trust and as you can see
we've got a pretty good coverage across
those for journeys so mark and eyes are
said work in innovations this are indeed
that's my area we help businesses as an
incubation services which helps
businesses with good low carbon
technology think about how they could
commercialize that technology
acceleration is all about market
barriers so these are typically field
trials but they're normally designed
with a specific market problem or market
issue in mind and they're normally done
with a range of different companies that
have that technology so it's about
convening groups of groups of entities
together to face a common problem as I
said we have this VC arm and these
overlap so we help the venture capital
team understand the technical issues
they frequently work with the people
that we're incubating and quite often
there's that there's an overlap
particularly say marine energy between
some of the investments we've made and
companies across a whole sector that
we've helped enterprises is normally
further down the chain and a way I
describe this is we do it where we see
there's a technology that exists it's
it's viable but no one has in the UK
this at this time traded a business so
it's a market failure of
entrepreneurship and the best way to
demonstrate that there that you can make
money in that is to actually create a
business and do it so we're doing that
for instance at the moment with
anaerobic digestion there's been an
almost sort of disappointing take-up of
that technology in the UK can save
carbon the technology is proven it
hasn't really happened so we've just
created a company that does that and
it's now raising significant private
finance and you know when that
successful we will step out and let
other companies come into that market as
I said loans and salix are all about
taking you know warranted products and
helping small businesses or the public
sector in the UK adopt them by providing
for
all of its underpinned by the policy in
science department who are we develop
policy papers both for government and
for business leaders to think about
different aspects of the low-carbon
economy and how technology might impact
on that so what does it actually looked
like bit more detail around the research
and development area Alec after we had
this thing called the open core which is
a reactive competition that we run three
times a year for the best low carbon
sort of concepts technology concepts and
people who win sort of grantham us on
that they get up to half a million
pounds worth of funding for a specific
low carb and technology project and one
of the reason that we do this because
it's quite similar to some of the other
bodies in the UK fun who active in this
area they provide grants as well for us
it helps us really understand what the
cutting edges in low-carbon technology
we've seen some really disruptive
concepts that we hadn't seen coming from
a top-down perspective coming to us
through this through this mechanism and
currently we sort of we've seen well
over 2,000 applications here we've
backed about 166 so well under ten
percent actually get through and what
we've made it very clear that we're
looking for the leading innovators in
the UK for that scheme that then helps
us design some of these other things
there are a couple of big projects in
R&amp;amp;D at the moment where we've directed
research we've we've taken a look at a
low-carbon technology landscape and look
for sort of key opportunities where you
sort of say if you had the following IP
or capabilities in 10 years time that
could be a really interesting business
and it could save a lot of carbon
generally when we do directed research
these two areas here the IP doesn't yet
exist so we get me run a competition to
say here are the parameters around what
could be a really successful low-carbon
business if you can do the following
things come to us with a proposal for
that and we will provide funding to
start you on that journey and then help
you raise further further finance or
actually constructing new low-carbon
technologies and companies that will
deliver those technologies from scratch
using the knowledge that we've got from
from this
in other areas of our activities so
there are a couple of big projects
underway at the moment one is in
advanced photovoltaics we've been
working with the winner of that project
was the University of Cambridge and a
company called the technology
partnership and they're looking at
ultra-low cost organic photovoltaics
advanced bio energy is more recent
innovation and we've started looking at
concepts that would be genuinely in
terms of biofuels save carbon generally
sustainable not competing with food not
competing with water resources and also
do things like use existing
infrastructure and use existing supply
chains as much as possible when we think
about carbon as a picture the embodied
carbon in today's vehicles into those
fuel distribution structures and
refineries is enormous and that the more
you can do that will actually allow
renewable transport fuels to use that
infrastructure the better so that
actually gave us a couple of ideas one
which is around bio crude or pyrolysis
oil upgrading we were taking distributed
biomass using pyrolysis and existing
technology to make a liquid out of that
and the innovation the challenge is to
take that which is not currently
suitable for putting two refinery
putting into a vehicle and upgrading it
to we have to reduce acidity take oxygen
now so it's significantly challenging
very interesting from both a carbon
perspective and an economic perspective
if it could happen the other thing which
we launched last week is a project in
algae so actually growing here some
algae here growing algae is the original
source of biomass and why is that
exciting because they have demonstrated
that you can grow many more tons of
biomass per hectare using our gear than
you can with terrestrial crops and it
also allows you not to have to use fresh
water which we think is deeply important
but there's a massive issue with the
cost of doing that so we think it's
worth looking at and we're funding some
early stage are indeed to start with try
and address that problem and finally we
also support research at research
institutions that's almost basic
research and so on the fundamental
problems around low carbon technology we
do that number a way to do it with
grants for you're so bad
and a competition for carbon leaders so
we support a couple of key academics in
the UK who won this competition and are
doing sort of fundamental research in
low-carbon technologies this is a kind
of the first half of technology
acceleration which is the further down
those for journeys looking at issues
around whole markets and problems that
technology divided into there the first
of those is around industrial energy
efficiency so we did about six months
study looking at how efficiently
particular to the medium sized
industrial operations were actually
being run and whether there were
opportunities to help companies save for
that from their perspective money and
energy from our perspective carbon and
the conclusion was that absolutely is
the case but there's no silver bullet
there's no one key technology actually
to work with them quite an intimate way
so we're actually piloting this concept
with a number of sort of areas at the
moment animal food plastic bottle and
asphalt manufacturing not particularly
sexy areas but all areas are identified
a real carbon saving micro CHP so micro
combined heat and power is as concept of
having small power generating units in
your home or business that can make both
electrical power and heat and one of the
issues with this technology which is
relatively well proven people didn't
really know which would be the market
sweat with save money in carbon and some
of the we've been running this now for
three years some of the conclusions that
come out of it are relatively
counterintuitive so because of the way
people heat their homes in the UK this
doesn't have particularly good
application to a lot of domestic
situations it's a very different story
to the commercial so small commercial
premises in our trial have save
significant amount of money and carbon
on this and that's some sort of market
insight that the companies that we're
working with here couldn't have access
they couldn't have been smarter the
issue was they they weren't able to fund
a field trial like this so in doing this
and that we published results of that
will actually really help the industry
understand where they need target their
product development and marketing the
low carbon buildings accelerates were
working with understanding the
challenges of refurbishment so
there's a lot of work going on
internationally around how to make new
buildings that are lower carb and that's
that's great but certainly in the UK
some like seventy percent of the
buildings that will be in place in 2050
already exist there's a massive
challenge about how do you make build
how do you refurbish buildings to reduce
their carbon footprint we've just
started a project and ultra efficient
Lighting's again this is why this is a
technology that sort of exists but it's
not being deployed very widely certainly
not in the UK and we're trying to use
this concept of forward equipment
procurement is to stimulate a market so
we'll use public sector institutions who
have enormous budgets and enormous
volumes of procurement to help stimulate
that market in energy supply in
technology acceleration we've got three
large projects and one slightly smaller
one the first of those is in offshore
wind now the UK is now committed by law
as part of the European Union sort of
mandates to supply fifteen percent of
its electricity from renewables by 2020
now we're actually currently at two
percent to the UK has a reasonably low
carbon footprint because we use natural
gas for lover and we have some nuclear a
lot of electrical power but there's
hardly any renewable generation in the
UK some of the analysis that we've done
is in order to meet that 2020 target
really the only way the UK is going to
do that is fire offshore wind we have
some onshore wind deployment of that's
going to continue but fairly obvious
land constraint reasons it's not going
to be sufficient so we think this is
very important and we've kind of a tract
attack this in two ways we are doing a
big project with five European energy
companies to look at Cost Reduction and
trying to improve the project returns
for these offshore wind farms and we've
also done a big policy piece to look at
the key policy levers that would need to
change for the cost of these files to
come down significantly in marine energy
we've actually working that for about
five years and the UK has a great as
well as offshore wind resort has a great
marine energy resource so tidal stream
and wave in particular and we've done a
number of things that we've actually
worked with marine developers to
develop a proper cost of energy model
one of the real issues in this sector
was people didn't really know what the
costs were people knew they were going
to be high but it wasn't a lot of detail
behind that I'll talk more about it in a
minute but we've worked with that and
this second this is now second project
we're doing with marine sector is really
looking at how we then attack those
those cost barriers biomass heating
again not a particularly sexy technology
but in terms of renewable heat so we
talk a lot about renewable electricity
if you want renewable heat then there
aren't that many alternative options and
we need to see a lot more deployment of
sort of forested residue in other forms
of renewable biomass into heating in the
UK and finally this is a slightly
different project with small scale wind
energy and I don't know how much you've
seen this in the US but there's been a
lot of people buying these sort of small
wind turbines slamming them onto the
side of the house and thinking that's
actually saving carbon we went in at a
very fact-based study on what these
actually do with the UK Meteorological
Office and they literally did a whole
lot of pretty complicated modelling for
these sort of scenarios and I've also
developed a tool which we're going to
put online people to calculate know if
that's my home and I live in a certain
part of the UK and this this poll is a
certain height how much energy mr going
to generate and it shows you that almost
in ninety percent of urban locations
that wind turbine will not repay its
carbon so there's more be more carbon
gone into making it they will ever sort
of get back in generating electricity
and that's well that's a slightly
negative results pretty important
because what we did find is in in rural
locations they can be really significant
and we've been working with the
manufacturers of those turbines to help
them or reposition maybe some of their
some of their products some of the new
things were looking at sorry to mention
business incubation it slightly
different type of intervention it's much
lower cost I mean work with companies to
help them understand how to turn a
low-carbon technology into an investable
proposition so it's business plan
development it's thinking about revenue
cost modeling and investor readiness and
finally the couple of things in the
pipeline we're looking at some
interesting idea
novel materials for low-cost fuel cells
and thinking about taking some of the
knowledge from the previous building
work and the work we do directly with
about 50,000 UK companies at the moment
and packaging that up into it commercial
buildings offering but I'll spin through
the investment enterprise and loans in a
bit more quickly because that's that's
not mark in my area but the investments
as I said it's a VC play constraint a
clean tech that can use our brand into
some extent use the expertise and the
rest of the carbon trust to help them
understand so where their distinctive is
they're able to leverage that expertise
and invest earlier than a lot of the
other certainly in the in the UK the
other VCS are prepared to do so made a
number of I think it's eight nine or ten
investments to date it's not a
particularly large fun but what it's
really there to do is to show others
that it is profitable to get involved in
cleantech early on and they've had a
really great track record with doing
that the recent investments includes
full energy which is an energy
efficiency company again not not a
trillion dollar market but a perfectly
perfectly healthy company and they're
showing that they mean this this thing
works in mobile telecoms base stations
ninety percent reduction in energy
usages and I remember they got people
pretty excited I pick out green
biologics there another there a biofuel
company that have developed a novel way
to make butanol a better fuel than
vanitha naw so these guys have been
doing that for about six years and
they're certainly that probably the
first clean tech VC investor in the UK
Enterprises is this corporate venturing
armed with a carbon trust and a couple
of examples here relevant to sort of
technology partnerships for enables is a
business which opens up public sector
lands a land owned by schools hospitals
other public sector for development of
renewables that's about ten percent the
land in the UK and we've noticed that
almost none of the deployments of
renewables at the moments mainly wind
was happening there so we set up a
company that leverages our connections
with the public sector to open up that
land
for development and that's raised its
aiming to deliver 500 megawatts on
public land it's raised 100 million
pounds in finance already so that's
it'sit's tracting pretty significant
interest from from the private sector
connective energy again it's another to
a company which uses existing technology
to solve a low-carbon problem in this
case it's about project development that
allows sort of operations that are sort
of near each other to where there's
excess heat in one location and a heat
demand in another location to actually
do a transaction and share heat around
in source of energies and energy to
waste business currently focus mainly as
I said on the previous slide on
anaerobic digestion but the concept is a
project development company so they come
with an offer as kind of turnkey project
currently working with waste food in the
UK and that there are several megatons
of that every year to make power and
heat finally loans and salix I said it's
this concept of taking some public
sector capital and offering
interest-free loans and what we found
through working with well I said fifty
thousand companies in the UK and larger
public sector organizations is even
where there's a rational economic sort
of decision you know a piece of
low-carbon technologies going to save
the company or the public institution
money quite often the people who want to
develop that project cannot raise the
capital internally there are you know
various constraints both political and
procedural for providing an
interest-free loan which is a relatively
low caste intervention for us can make
all the difference oh yeah we've made
722 loans you know it significant amount
of capital has been deployed but it's
also leveraging a lot of private funds I
mentioned earlier the the policy arm
caught in sight to the Carbon Trust and
this is published thing like forty
different pretty well research
publications in the in various areas of
technologies a couple of recent ones are
the low carbon technology
commercialization of you which is trying
to ask the question you know their
various things in UK are trying to
support our moves to go to a low-carbon
economy and the question was how well
suited is that structure what changes
might need to be happened and that has
been a nine-month study so it's pretty
deep and it's looking at innovation
models all over the world it's looking
at you know generic and specific market
failures and low-carbon technologies and
finally I should mention the offshore
wind so I talked earlier about the
offshore wind technology work well we
accompanied that with this strategic
plan around policy development and one
of the key conclusions from the study
was that there's some specific bits of
regulation that have massive in have a
massive influence on how likely the UK
is actually going to be abie to the
deploy maybe 35 gigawatts of wind that
we need to in the next sort of 12 years
I'll just sort of spin through a couple
of case studies I mentioned marine
energy this is something that with UK
has quite a strong heritage in and there
was a lot of work done in the 70s and
80s about marine but when a lot of the
energy utilities were privatized in the
80s a lot of our deal was cut and the
kind of thing kind of SAT there in
stasis with no real progress being made
and one of the issues were that a lotta
love investment going in there wasn't a
particular policy incentive cost of
energies was both regarded as being
uncompetitive lehigh but also not very
well understood so we SAT there we
designed a bespoke intervention to try
and you know demonstrate a potential for
cost reductions and not just say we
think the costs are actually this moment
trying to actually design a trajectory
for how the cost might change over time
we also wanted to try and change the
policy framework to try and get
investment into the sector so we ran
something called the read energy
challenge in 2004 and this was something
that had never been done in the UK
before rather than say here are some
grants or working maybe with RBC team to
look at investments they can making
companies we said
we're going to run a public competition
to anyone who has a compelling concept
for a marine energy device and the prize
at the end of that competition is not
just some funding the prizes a pretty
large amount of detailed engineering
consultancy to work on your device so we
warded they those contracts 28 sort of
people with concepts most of which most
women coming from the UK academic sector
and we've got the consultants that we
procure to work directly with them on
their on their on their sort of device
concept that was a benefit to the
individual teams involved but what it
led us to do is understand very sort of
fundamentally what the issues were
around various different device
morphologies we then published that and
said well this is what we've got in the
UK these these are we think the best of
ice concepts here's what the energy cost
of energy might be for them and here's
what we might want to do next and that
led to suddenly the whole marine
industry or the marine sector became a
lot more sort of energized so we had the
nun people applying for those applied
research grants we had people working
with us in business incubation and there
was concept of the European marine
energy centre which has been set up in
Scotland which is provided for the first
time a sort of testing Bay because a big
issue with some of these small companies
is is they develop their concept they
model it they put into wave tank they
build one and then the actual
infrastructure even to test it to show
it actually can produce power
competitively costs millions so that the
European real energy center is a sort of
industry-wide facility that allows these
companies to do that so I mean what are
the sort of conclusions from that study
well one thing is this was pretty
surprising that's fifteen to twenty
percent of UK annual electricity demand
could be met by these resources that was
simply unknown before we did the study
and that again it changed both the way
the industry and the government thought
about this sector we've estimated the
worldwide resource as well for us we've
got a significant carbon saving that we
know much more precisely than we did
before and we looked at the worldwide
resource there's this big economic value
story and we
so pinpoint some specific things about
the UK that made it sort of worth us
going going further forward with it so
the UK has got these large and digis
energy resources we've got some of those
people who are working in 70s and 80s in
marine are still around they're
incredibly experienced and are generally
involved in a lot of these projects and
finally we've gotta well we're an island
we understand a fair amount about
offshore engineering some of the
specific challenges you have a maritime
environments so there are couple
recommendations that came out some of
those adopted by the UK government
Scottish Government's and we actually
then launched another initiative so the
whole concept is having done something
seen the results were able to deploy
further resources where we think that's
where we think that's appropriate an
objective of the second initiative the
marine energy accelerator is really to
take this curve which is the one that we
developed from that first project and
look at sort of interventions that can
make a discontinued discontinuity in
that trajectory down towards what a
target cost might be from marine energy
so we're focusing especially on cost
reduction we're building on that
knowledge base I mentioned earlier and
we're using about three and a half
million pounds of funding to try and
stimulate those activities there are
three kind of parts of that first is new
lower lower energy device concepts or
Latin story lower-cost device concepts
but these are sort of new this concept
of there's actually a hold of components
in any three energy devices like
hydraulics like electronics and so on
that need to be much lower costs for
these sort of deployments and this
second strand of this energy accelerator
focuses on that and finally a big a big
component of it when you deploy a farm
of these things as opposed to just one
device you have to have to think quite
quite carefully about natural operation
and maintenance costs so we can be more
much more precise now about about what
this costs iron curve looks like and
this is this is the one for wave current
current cost of deployment if you took
the best wave technology in the UK
moment you'd be at about 25 UK pence per
kilowatt hour
the cost of energy that's uncompetitive
lehigh grid is about five learning
effects and scale get you to sort of
there where you've deployed 100
gigawatts which isn't going to happen
there's not enough resource so we needed
to change this curve and these three
strands that I mentioned the left here
are all projected to have sort of parts
of that that story and be part of that
change so I'll just do as let's do one
more think this sort of slide is
slightly short on time and show you you
might have some questions for us I'm
talking about sort of photovoltaics
which I think something that is very
important in California and and we've
looked at the deployment of this we
spend a few quite a few months looking
at some of the issues around why they
hadn't been in wider pick up in pv it
comes quite as fundamentally down to
cost there was a surjective from from
satellites to roll a rural
electrification but we've also seen is a
lot of certain countries like Germany in
particular deciding to subsidize
technology to try and deploy it and
we're not sure that's necessarily the
right approach because there's a risk of
Technology lock in we've got something
like silicon pv that may be inherently
too expensive so we're more interested
particularly in innovations and new
technologies and looking at approaches
that can can change that game and again
as I said make a step change that
trajectory and so you either looking at
very high efficiency cells or very
low-cost solutions there's a fundamental
issue around you know getting cost out
of silicon people looking at thin films
and other ways of doing that but it
remains a big a big challenge and so
people are starting to look at sort of
some of the other ways of doing that so
you can either look at solar
concentrators and there's a lot of work
going on California in that area or some
of the areas we're looking at in the UK
with the Carbon Trust are looking at
organic photovoltaics actually using
plastics as an ultra-low-cost own way of
creating photovoltaic energy we're doing
some work on pd concentrate its
whitfield solar is a company that
applied to our venture capital arms this
one reactive
think these guys came to us we have some
expertise in inserted to help understand
how competitive that technology is and
we we made a part of a 1 million pounds
sort of you know series a investment in
February so that's quite interesting the
area that I'm looking after in R&amp;amp;D is
around this may be slightly longer term
concept around polymer photovoltaics
through round one of those research
acceleration or directed research
interventions to try and find a team who
could deliver something like that and
develop a distinctive IP in the field of
organic PV and the winners of that with
the University of Cambridge and a
company called the technology
partnership and Cambridge in particular
have the incredibly strong history in
polymer electronics they've created a
number of quite successful companies
that use polymeric trikes for display
technology for instance and they're
leveraging that understanding to work
with us on developing on organic PV
solution so we taken a leading academic
group we're working with a major
industrial manufacturer of TTP and we're
trying actually going to try and create
a startup company so we've invested kind
of in its of 5 million pounds of this in
the first stage of that is it's a
research grant with the University of
Cambridge if that is successful will
then incorporate a company that will try
and drive that technology forward as
well as looking at a new material
concept well that company is going to be
doing is looking at real thrill printing
as well to drive down the cost further
and the ultimate goal of that is to try
and get power generation below ten cents
per kilowatt hour or even better than
that but that's certainly this sort of
the threshold they're looking at as a
starting point either a couple more am
case studies here but I'd like to sort
of i think we probably got through the
first 40 minutes so there any questions
or any particular areas that people
would like me to focus on
the solar solar area we haven't had any
sort of compelling either research grant
applications or company companies apply
to us and that so we're not currently
looking at a hot water you mentioned
your bio bio fuels are you thinking a
large scale about your process heat
needs for industry that's interesting
question I mean one thing we're trying
to do let me just sort of go through
this we're looking at one of the arrows
looking eyes pyrolysis and upgrading
that oil into something that can go into
a refinery and part of the reason that's
quite interesting is is this concept of
integrating it with refinery operations
and if you do that properly then you
have the ability to to sort of use heat
in a pretty sophisticated way and this
again we ran a public competition to
select teams to work with us on this
we've had significant oil and gas major
interests and they're involved in some
of the projects were likely to take
forward so we're hoping to get access to
that that sort of refining engineering
expertise and process engineering
expertise to sort of take advantage of
heat sort of opportunities
so I don't I don't lose methane up there
as as a biofuel is there a reason for
that methane mmm is a liquid a three-way
with yeah that we do like methane this
is that liquid liquid biofuels as also
curious how your organic PVS yeah what
do you look at is the difference in
embodied carbon between those and and
some of the silicon technologies are
they they look like they'd be hugely
better yeah I don't have any idea for
what value to put on huge they're
significantly better we haven't run the
numbers yet because we haven't we
haven't we haven't got the material set
that we're going to use yet so that's
one of the reasons why it's starting out
as a research project if they're
actually running through a number of
different material sets but yeah within
that they're quite a lot better than
than silicon in terms of embodied carbon
trade-off is that lifetime for organics
is going to be an issue so you're
looking at that trade-off as well could
you describe your investment in algae
yeah sure um I still have it on here let
me just come out and go to
so these these are the two biofuels
areas i've mentioned pyrolysis algae is
let's not look in this at about a year
ago and it seemed quite exciting as I
said early you've got this potential to
grow many more sort of tons of biomass
per hectare and you can with terrestrial
crops and and we think the kind of the
elephants in the room unstated itional
potential is this ability not to have to
use weight a fresh water and that that's
pretty important to that got us quite
excited about it then we started talking
to people we've spoken to us European
Israeli Japanese experts and attend a
lot a lot of conferences and you run
into a number of fairly fundamental
issues with doing that which is it's
actually a Photoshop an image of what it
would look like to deploy our get scale
and that is the cost compared to having
a bit of Earth and planting terrestrial
crops on it that's a significant capital
investment so you're the productivity of
the algae you get from that really has
to be a lot higher than what you get
from terrestrial crops and you also need
to be able to take this biomass which is
full of water dewatering get and get the
oil or the car behind it out in a very
low cost way none of those things are
ready yet so what we've said is we think
there's a potential here but what's been
quite frustrating is there are very few
hard facts available and we certainly
need to understand it better and we
think there are some fundamental issues
that need looking at so this this isn't
this sort of investments going to be in
two phases the first phase will sponsor
relatively small projects looking at
some sort of sort of fundamental issues
around this challenge of mass
cultivation so one of the issues is
further synthetic efficiency how high
can you go in in an open pond people
have done say five percent in the lab
what is actually going to happen in an
open pond and how do you make that in a
sustained way there's another thing
around our key which is that you can
make algae that have a very high oil
content but they tend not to be growing
very quickly when they have a high oil
content can you get both why not what
are the fundamental scientific
limitations there it's also real issue
with
keeping these cultures at scale stable
stable in terms of nutrient balances pH
but also stable in terms of resistance
to biological stress or things that will
eat them funghi viruses and so on and so
forth and that again it's on a
particularly sexy area but it hasn't had
enough understanding for someone's be
able to say are we going to deploy a
hundred hectares of these ponds which
they would have a significant risk that
you couldn't keep that stable and the
culture would die so that's what what we
think needs to happen in terms of algae
pond cultivation and we think a lot of
the sort of investment that's gone in
recently has been maybe somewhat
inappropriate because people they've
generally been predicated on someone
with a value grown in the lab making
huge productivity undoubtedly in a lab
condition of something that might be
genetically modified or a very specific
strain that doesn't really have
relevance to the sort of deployment that
you'd need for it to be any sort of
serious biofuel option so you've been
looking only at openreach track ponds or
have you been looking at
photobioreactors at all well so we've
not said you couldn't have a
photobioreactor solution we have said
it's got to be less than you know two
dollars a gallon and no one has shown us
a cost model which says with my
photobioreactor that sort of scale I'm
going to get there and you've got these
mundane issues like cleaning them what
happens if you need to restart the
culture what happens if you have an
infection you've got kilometers I mean
the midst of big photobioreactor
demonstrations is one in Spain in the
90s there's something like 500
kilometers of tubes and pipes in it and
the issue is when you try and scale up
because in this in this version of alka
anyway you're actually using sunlight
coming in the institute in a plane yeah
when you scale up you don't get that
normal benefit of going in three
dimensions and having larger volumes
you're still going to have all the
action is happening in a sort of you
know coupler centimeter layer beneath
the surface there so we just don't think
that the photobioreactor concept can
work because as soon as you deploy even
more capital to enclose it and pump
things around then you have you have
sort of punishing costs great if you
want to grow really high value
co-products and nutraceuticals and be to
clarity and most of the things that can
work but for the ultra low-cost
commodity product that is
in a fuel we've not seen it we've not
been convinced by anyone yet that you
could do it that way so we actually sort
of said we think the road is open ponds
we're open to suggestions and people you
know and there are people growing
alguien in plastic bags and that's very
low cost and there are some sort of
raceway ponds with a with a sort of
little over the top and look find it
that might be the way but i guess the
fundamental thing that ties all that
together is is cost and stability you
know really all year round here and year
out to be able to produce high
productivity algae and you're looking is
only as liquid fuels biofuels well it's
interesting I mean this came from us
looking at a challenge around how you
could decarbonize transport in the UK
and particularly aviation where there
are other options and transport like
fuel cells and batteries on and road
transport there's a real problem with
aviation so that has been the focus
where there are sort of energy-related
co-products there nothing that's
perfectly acceptable so you know you've
got this also produces protein and
carbohydrate if you use that
carbohydrate to fuel a biomass CHP then
that's perfectly acceptable we also want
to look at ways of making liquid
transport fuels as well be suitable as a
labor-intensive process in let's say
developing country it's an interesting
question it may be and there's a lot of
deployment of algae not for fuels but
for other products in China some
microalgae so these sort of things but
also a lot of seaweed macro algae and in
no situations they absolutely do take
advantage of low-cost labor and I think
some of the farms in China you know
they've got these pretty unsophisticated
management but literally they have some
we're going out every morning seven days
a week check on the strain what is to
happen and keep it stable so it does
have some sort of low-cost labor market
attractiveness but we think the
technology to make this happen for
biofuels just isn't there yet so we're
away with some distance from doing that
having said that one thing we've also
realized though that you know we are
currently funded by the UK government
and we
sort of leverage a reasonably strong UK
academic expertise we think that to make
something like this sort of commercially
viable you couldn't actually deploy in
the UK for sort of fairly obvious
climatic reasons so one of the things
what we doing net will see one of the
things when we do next year is is its
scouting for locations that have better
climate for algae and people have talked
about North Africa and there's places in
the Middle East South America and so on
so that again the climate might be a
part of that as well certain
technologies not others it's like a free
state yeah just let me
so this is kind of a prioritization
framework for those large interventions
so algie's an example of that marine and
so on and it's about saying because we
now have a reasonable knowledge base
around low-carbon technology and low
carbon markets we can actually sort of
design top-down what interventions would
be and that starts with a technology
area prioritization so we've looked in a
pretty quantitative way at what carbon
savings might be realized from deploying
some potential low-carbon technologies
there is points in the future normally
2020 2030 and 2050 if you get a number
out of that and then because we're
talking about low carbon economy and
we're talking about trying to get
economic value for the investment that's
put into us by the UK government will
also do an assessment on which of those
technologies that are high-carbon saving
closer deliver value to the UK quite
often that surround the knowledge assets
that we have at the moment sometimes
it's related to the fundamental
resources so wave and offshore wind is
an economic value story for the UK
because we have very good natural
resources for those that's the first
stage and we have 2 12 technologies that
fit in that top right hand box there for
the UK version of this chart that we're
focusing on we then sir to say well if
you believe take a technology advanced
biofuels are important what are the sort
of areas that are really holding that
back what's the best place for the
carbon trust or some other publicly
funded body to intervene and we'll do an
assessment that might come out with a
conclusion that is let's say in an
offshore wind what you actually have a
big issue with is sort of it there are
sector-wide issues around things like
foundation energy carnation costs access
to the actual offshore wind turbines and
there is also a big issue she run policy
the policy framework doesn't really
support deployment of it so we'll pick a
cup two three four five key barriers
that look like things we could do and we
finally prioritize those because as I
said we're a relatively small
it's 150 people and we have to focus on
the things where we're going to have the
most impact and the key part of that of
that prioritization is the fit with the
carbon trust capabilities and also with
thee and that means more broadly if we
were to assemble a team from people in
the UK you know how competitive with
that team be with you know activities
internationally and actually one of the
reasons that mark and I are here in
California this week is to help us
improve our understanding of what's
happening in California in the u.s. to
make sure that we are you know
benchmarking what we're trying to do
appropriately a regarding option as you
let me ask a specific technology
question sure are there any IDs of
leveraging well rather co-locating wind
and wave in the same structure he were
near those it's being talked about yeah
i guess the major department of
challenges and operated the basement
challenge about both of those
technologies i get to be committed any
I've seen with the actual the
integration of those two together is
actually going to simplify when they
take pops out of e so
you might you might get certainly some
cost benefit from shared installation
costs because both of them suffer from
having quite a significant impact in
terms of getting letters in the moment
you're getting access to the right types
of vessels that sort of jacket barges
and things you need to install so the
optional winter ones are quite a few and
far between and expensive so I can see
some synergy around installation
operation and maintenance about think
that the major challenge here is the
types of foundations you need for
offshore wind turbines are not really
similar in style or structure to the
types of situations you want in a time
stream or indeed wave Rises so again in
terms of the structural synergy down I
hope they don't leave it up to it
doesn't doesn't mean it can't happen but
I think yeah it's either the above of
hard enough in terms of maintenance
affected by then favored by now I've
been to begin to the pretentious save
give you seen anything over here there's
no exist just yeah it's an interesting
ones that but certainly there's
potential synergy around going out to
maintain the soil but I think I mean
yeah I actually what's interesting is
lots of lots of those types of life is
also my problem which is to be an
attractive one wave all the toilet
climate in particular that you are in
actually pretty part of moving in
difficult
offshore scenarios to operate in the
Kratt yeah but the weather windows you
have available to actually get out there
install devices is quite quite limited
remedy efficient and some extent yet
with the weather dictator and there's
been a development we've tried to deploy
devices and you get some time the keys
are in forms of ID access to vessels for
the only guessing that you can accessing
them or whether it is really difficult
ocean well we have seen a couple of
people looking at utilizing existing
offshore structures off an oil and gas
rigs to tether to do some initial
deployment of their concepts and that's
both wave there's also a team of working
with we've got this really interesting
novel concept for a floating spy-boy
concept offshore wind device and that's
a smaller thing it's sort of you know 10
kilowatts and that it's actually quite
nicely engineered and and his early
market will be in need of providing
additional power to offshore oil and gas
plant platforms what was talking about
to looking for new device concepts we
we've developed a methodology for
screening anyway what time street
divides we see against a common set of
quite service that we can benchmark for
the trial the cost of energy so we can
live this amit assumptions of the
materials used the moorings the sort of
the sizing how many of you would need to
generate this attend mega farm the
operational costs so we come from use
all that data to produce the cost of
energy estimates only any device we see
of course anyone is looked at wave and
type of energy knows that such a amazing
range of different concept of it so
difficult for investors of ever to
affect the best ones are which one seems
to be willing is it the one is the
gravitational potential which moes up on
Donna are using the momentum of the wave
to drive something I think
I don't think the winner will
necessarily be a whole category or or
energy capture like that actually
because we even has been too much focus
on the energy capture approach a lot of
these ways work they all they all do
capture energy but not on the focus on
taking the cost out of that so for us
it's more about how can you leverage out
and even impacts be slightly less
efficient in terms of energy capture but
do it and fundamentally lacrosse way so
other have you seen the pelamis sea
snake wave devices be the problem
fortune or it's a very different than
the boys I'm about to mention is
different in its power take-off approach
to that but it's actually simulator
under it being as soon as sort of length
device but we've actually seen this new
concept frontwards of making out of
rubber the way that works it's it's
perpendicular to the incoming waste
stream and actually is a wave hits a
device it causes the voltage of bonds
achievements in this roller device that
goes throughout to account a consistent
editor and because it's rowboats
potentially much lower manufacturing
costs because it's a single or a couple
of joint features material relatively
relatively very much material depending
on the type of ebony reward for me the
kind of reliability maintainability of
that device inherently better than
something that's got in lots of
mechanical moving parts and so therefore
when we put it through our model and
they get its pillow stage high risk with
actual many of other numbers you see
actually that could genuinely be about
half the class or other devices we can
make that work to excite and so now
we've had sort of sits the original
assessment that i've talked about
loosing 30 there was new to us projects
recently and we've act two of them
could be radical agenda and make process
so it's more about I could see some of
the devices that are stating what to
call them some of them were that sort of
plant absorbs I think they're that they
all work because ready to capture is
about can you do it cost effective and
so follow up on the previous question to
sort of delimit it have you looked at
any other methods of companion
harvesting renewables hmm what I'm
thinking you know I'm just kind of moved
forward to like 20 50 and and looking at
the the previous history and where we
are with you know coal plants that are
working well are working well because
they're doing coach in and and they're
employing ways to extract more energy
than they can't really I think they're
very extracting above Carnot so there
and that happens because of putting apt
things together in other ways yeah in
terms of that an open call area that I
talked about we said a couple of quite
interesting heat to electrical power
concepts come through recently and some
of those are using novel refrigerants to
do very low temperature ranking cycles
and there's one really wacky one around
very magnetic fluids they can exploit
very low temperature differences then I
think that's a key component to be able
to do that and break through either
Carnot or electrochemical cycle
efficiencies so we're doing that we're
also doing all combined heat and power
in a more conventional way probably it's
worth mentioning it in pyrolysis one of
the teams that were working with I use
using microwaves to do the initial
paralysis and they get they get a
reasonable liquid yield but they also
get a very high quality carbon char and
that turns out to be an incredibly good
fuel for coal-fired power stations and
it you know you're not changing this of
energy content you're putting through
but in terms of getting that into into
the power station and that teams
actually working with the UK's largest
power station they're saying this is
this the perfect biomass fuels
what coming from renewable source it's
ready to go directly and so I think
we've said to the teams in paralysis you
know you need to think about each ton of
biomass that comes in and how do you use
every single carbon atom in there and
that'll be that will distinguish the
people who are successful in this from
those who never get to market so I think
that's it and if you want to ask any
follow-up questions I'm sure they'll
stick around yeah thank you so much
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
