Jack stick my UX designer on the android
project and for Android we needed to do
a open source font and there wasn't very
many nice ones that had like a complete
international set character set so we we
hired a company called a center
corporation and I had the pro is to work
with Steve Madison on the font and he's
the principal designer and he's other
notable thoughts he's worked on include
Segoe for microsoft windows and
confection for xbox 360 and he did droid
for Android anyway I'll let him tell you
the rest his name Steve Madison hello
thanks for coming out and thanks for the
opportunity Jeff to give this
presentation it's um I first gave this
talk as a case study specifically on the
convection fonts we did were for the
Xbox but it's since sort of grown a life
of its own as I've talked to aiga and
some other corporations talking to
professionals and students and sort of
helping them understand why type is
relevant and how it can be a tool and it
kind of dispel some of the you know
misnomer misinformation about fonts and
and most people take fonts were granted
so it's kind of a good practical kind of
a practical discussion about type design
so I try to cover three fundamental
error areas in no real particular order
why fonts are important and why we spend
so much time trying to get them right a
little bit about type design and the
kind of the process that goes goes on
behind type design and then I I talk a
little bit about Android at the very end
and along the way there's some common
issues that we face designing font
specifically for devices so it's it's no
secret that type is in fonts are often
taken for granted
and don't really become a topic of
interest until something goes wrong and
so here's an example but here's an
example that might really have happened
I think that was probably just something
so many Photoshop but this is an actual
problem that's at a mall near my home in
Boulder Colorado and there's about eight
of these signs and everyone is wrong
just a little bit differently from the
other and if anybody can shout out what
they think is wrong with this sign
beautiful beautiful a very educated
crowd here I can see if we zoom in a
little closer we can see the 0 is pretty
sloppy looking and every one of these
signs is rotated just a little bit
differently and I wondered if it would
kill them to look at the artwork to see
you know exactly how to rotate it and so
thanks to photoshop i can i can rest at
ease and fix fix it myself it's rotated
in that way because of the typeface
Lydian which it's based on was drawn
with a broad nib pen and of course the
pen is held at about a 30 degree angle
and that kind of gives you that sort of
egg-shaped inside of the oh so now you
know what it is it keeps type designers
awake at night I was at the Consumer
Electronic Show and I saw this booth
this logo looked pretty ugly to begin
with but there's some specific type
things that are wrong and if anyone
could shout out what they see wrong the
v's are flipped exactly and how about
the S actually looks upside down so
someone's just getting a little bit too
clever there or it was a mistake from
whoever laid out the laid out the heart
you know that the piece that makes that
podium they're so young she called said
that everything that counts and
typography is a subtlety and so this
talk is why type experts are called on
to refine and build type systems for
brand identities user interface user
interfaces publications and whatnot and
typically type folks like myself don't
get out too much so I'm going to do a
quick introduction of myself and my
company here
I got sucked into this esoteric world of
type design at Rochester Institute of
Technology in the mid-80s at the school
of printing there and I was surrounded
by the most advanced web presses and
typesetting systems of the era but I was
much more enamored with the old
letterpress and you know dusty drawers
of type and very tactile experience and
I also experienced quite a bit of their
their personal collection of rare books
and manuscripts and there were two
professors there that sort of held out
against all the technology that was
coming in and they tried to preserve the
tradition and like this this 15th
century book of hours all hand-lettered
of course and hand eliminated with gold
leaf you really can't get that kind of
color on a on a plotter or inkjet
printer and here's horse horses works
printed by all the SH minus she's the
type is all handset and the illumination
is a padded afterwards sort of in
tradition with the way the manuscripts
were made and then in the 1700s Fournier
printed this manual typography using
actual pieces of type to make these
ornaments so it was all printed at the
same time it was sort of like the big
revolution and being able to print the
graphics and the text together at the
same time so being able to experience
these works of art really humbled me and
they left a indelible impression on me
as I tried to reproduce books in the
same manner with handset type and hand
elimination the other thing that RIT had
was one of the country's first Mac labs
and so I divided half my time between
pushing Bezier curves around Adobe
Illustrator and then the other
of my time had in hand setting LED type
and that experience with type and the
Macintosh landed me my first job editing
bitmaps bitmaps are sort of the digital
equivalent of individual pieces of metal
type and they work at one size they're
designed and tuned for one size only but
it was it was a good way to begin my
next job I was introduced to outline
types and this was a technology that
predated truetype these fonts will scale
to any size but below eighteen point on
a screen for instance they start to fall
apart and they need a little engineering
help to to look good so what we did was
write what we call hints to preserve the
typographic features when the fonts are
scaled for screen sizes and real quick
what hinting does is if you have a
unhindered font and you lay it on to the
pixel grid of any device you get this
random pattern like at the blue next to
the blue triangle you have uneven stem
weights very jagged curves and hinting
actually helps you see next to the green
triangle hinting helps preserve the
weight proportions and some of the
curves and then truetype came along next
to the pink triangle there and gave you
the ability to get bitmap quality with
this scalable type so you could actually
it was just like bitmap editing you
could turn pixels on and off for
individual sizes and so after a couple
years doing this I got called on to work
with monotype typography on their first
true type fonts that shipped with
Microsoft Windows 3.1 and Windows didn't
look too pretty and it crashed lock but
at least it had scalable fonts that this
is the first time hundreds and millions
of people are now able to set type on
the screen and see what it looks like
before it actually comes out of the
printer is a pretty revolutionary thing
at the time so I went on to hint dozens
of fonts for monotype and hinting
requires a great deal of analysis of
letter forms you really have to go in
and break down features and design
elements and then write code so that
these elements hold up at small sizes it
true it proved to be a really good
training ground for type design itself
so I started experimenting the type
design and I got this letter from a
friend of mine from way from like third
grade fourth grade and I'd always add
man admired his handwriting and I got
this letter from him and I was learning
how to do type design so I did what any
self-respecting type designer would do i
digitized it and I wrote him letter a
letter back about two weeks later in his
own handwriting and we get a kick out of
this now because when we both became
parents we noticed that pampers uses
this as one of their corporate typefaces
so every time we change a diaper well
there it is you know so at monotype I
designed several typefaces and revived a
lot of old hot metal typefaces that
hadn't been made into digital typefaces
yet truesdell is an example of a face
that was designed by Fred Gowdy in the
30s and he cast two sets of metal type
and then a studio burned down and his
the matrices that they used to make the
type all melted so he did essentially he
didn't have a backup so there were two
pieces of or two fonts casts a 14-point
type and one of them was at RIT so I
went back there pulled a proof and
digitized it released at 1992 the other
typefaces gaudy ornate and facade were
digitized from specimen books just
making really good scans of them and
digitizing I also did several typefaces
which were custom for specific customers
on delay mono was in fact a design for
the user interface font for a Apple IBM
joint venture that many of you might be
old enough to remember call taligent and
the company flopped of course that will
idea I guess didn't make it so but since
then I believe mano has found its way
into tax software programs terminal
emulation programs and it even ships of
OS 10 now and curls I like to refer to
as my probably my worst youthful
indiscretion microsoft publisher as you
know it's not really a high-end
publisher a publishers in a very
high-end publishing application but they
wanted something curly for their
announcement so yeah so we made curls
curly that for you I also learned a lot
about non-latin type design this
specifically shows the Arabic Hebrew and
tie that I did for arial unicode so
there was a lot of learning going on the
last 20 years about type design and how
these type forms work and how they
relate to the latin in 2004 i left
monotype with a few of my closest
colleagues to start a new font company
called a sender and this is us in our
San Francisco attire in 2004 and
ascenders business is basically divided
in a few categories the first of which
is a website that we developed for
consumer users of type these are people
who don't know font names they don't
know font designers they just know
they've got an invitation to make or
they've got a flyer to make and they
have no idea where to begin but they
know that the type things is on their
computer probably don't aren't you
aren't quite right they want something
different so they they come here with a
project or a problem that they want to
solve the other thing we do is om and is
V font licensing and finally the other
biggest part of our businesses custom
design and this is sigo which I designed
for windows vista while i was at
monotype and now since ascender is
keeping the fonts and extending them to
include greek Cyrillic thai Hebrew and
Arabic so very large project a much
smaller project here is if you wear
contacts you probably use their eye
drops alcon labs
they have a they came to us for a custom
type family of eight typefaces so much
smaller in scope than C go but and then
an even smaller example was this
alphabet and figures i did for
Motorola's current just i think they're
shipping now the newest handsets are
using this typeface that i designed so
that's sort of me an ascender in a
nutshell this is part 2 where we start
talking about the most frequently asked
question of people that have anything to
do with the type business why is it we
need more fonts now a lot of people will
answer the question by saying it's just
like music or writing it's a creative
process that you know needs to be
ongoing for me I'm a very practical
person by nature and so I kind of need a
little more substance than that so I
break it into three categories the first
being we need more fonts because we need
to fix the sins of the past most of the
big companies had digital libraries
digital font libraries prior to
postscript and true type when poster
became the norm all the companies agfa
copy graph or agfa compy graphic
monotype bertold urw all the major
foundries wanted to rush their entire
libraries as quickly as they could to be
the biggest and best postscript
libraries and in so doing they did these
automatic conversions which for one
thing curves got contend to get kind of
lumpy and details can get distorted
another thing is a lot of people left
turning out they just didn't bother
putting kerning in the fonts character
sets were often incomplete and so now
that we're moving on to the age of open
type we have a chance to revisit a lot
of these fonts and put them right and
one example of this would be a Linotype
for instance has a series of fonts they
call next like fruit ogre next and a
venir next it's kind of a fancy
marketing way of saying we didn't get it
right the first time so here's your
here's our opportunity to fix that
another reason for more fonts as the
globalization of the economy the
European Economic Commission passed a
ruling that said that if you're going to
ship products inside of Europe you need
to support Greek and Cyrillic
Czechoslovakia and some other character
sets that were not in the basic latin
one character set semantics is an
example of a font that a family of fonts
that was given to me to add these
languages to to support and I believe
there was 12 fonts total in the
semantics project now the third answer
to the question of why more fonts is
sort of the probably the most important
it has to do with the simple fact that
type is a communication tool and just
like the wrong size hammer can
accomplish or completely ruin a job
typefaces if that's the wrong choice can
hinder a hinder the message now if you
type set a wedding invitation and you do
some basic formatting you think you're
through right I mean there's really get
the message is all there but suppose the
user decides maybe this is a little bit
a little bit too bland for the big day
let me see what I have in my fonts menu
for something a little oh no no that's
not right there we go there we go that's
that's more like it it's not many people
had to stop and think why that last one
was inappropriate but it's it's sort of
a knee-jerk response you didn't have to
sit there and analyze it and say now
that's too drippy that's not great so
so it's it's because there's an
underlying graphic message in type that
goes along with the words just like this
looks like an invitation or maybe a
suggestion to stop this looks
authoritative and carries some warning
about it so the reason we need to do
fonts right is either by creating new
ones or by fixing the old ones is to
accurately convey the written word the
renowned graphic educator email Reuter
said it best type gives form to language
the whisper scream inform entertain or
in my case I gag know or we inspire with
our work
when a type designer gets handed the
task of designing a typeface which
speaks for a product or a corporation we
have to find the right voice or
intonation which accurately represents
the client the type can form a glue
which holds all the brand elements
together whether it's hardware design
taglines colors product names what have
you this is something that Nokia really
understood when they embarked on their
corporate type program they knew that
the fonts on the phone are now going to
be carried around with you wherever you
go the brand is in your pocket they look
up and it's on the it's on the billboard
they look on the website it's there it's
in the it's in the user manual it's
everywhere it's something that I don't
really understand about Apple they have
sort of a font war going on through
their whole program the iphone is
exclusively Helvetica here on their
website they have myriad in the
marketing pieces but lucida grande for
all the the menu bars the ipod has
myriad and the website has loosed the
grande in the user interface in itunes
they have Helvetica and lucida grande
it's it's really doesn't seem like
there's much of an excuse for a company
to have such a strong sense of brand and
designed to to have this miss miss mosh
pit of typefaces
so in two thousand I was asked to
develop typefaces for the original Xbox
product and they understood that they
wanted the brand to tie in with the user
interface I was told in no uncertain
terms that the Xbox should be completely
disassociated from corporate Microsoft
it had to be angular and edgy and
futuristic so categorically different
from a typical office software company
and I thought I knew what they were
getting at because I played I played
video games when I was little and some
of this too um and things that come a
long way in gaming obviously but the
essentials really really haven't changed
much particularly the demographic was
still well over eighty-five percent mail
at the time so I went back to my studio
and I started drawing some some grids
and one of them was like this I had
rounded corners and kind of this sort of
very Blackie Blackie presence it was
really the easiest project I ever did I
just sort of connected the dots and
rounded the corners that the rounded
corners actually helped give it sort of
this glowing look rather than these
harshly defined edges and the creative
group liked it so I filled out the
character set and it became pretty clear
to me that as a type designer this
presented some unique legibility
challenges you you certainly don't want
the user to have to look twice at their
score and then miss their shield button
and then get terminated by their
opponent so you have to make sure that
the be in the eighth are distinguishable
in the five and the s and that sort of a
thing so I had to be a little clever on
some of the some of the characters
and they liked it so much but they also
wanted another typeface that was sort of
more readable and text but they still
wanted this real angular edgy look to it
so I went back to one of the grids I was
working with one of the previous ones
and i made this sort of a text face
which i think it's hard to call it a
text face really but it's certainly
easier to read than the all-caps version
and so they were used they wanted it to
use in marketing and then they ended up
using it in the user interface as well
to help set the hierarchy within the UI
and I was unable to see any of this
until the product ship so I had to take
their word for it that all this stuff
was looking ok a letter spacing
proportions x height and all these
little details the type designers have
to think about it was just sort of
flying blind and and guessing using my
basically my intuition to guide me and I
think it worked it worked out pretty
well and looking at it this way you can
sort of see that they're equally
aggressive there's a very literal sort
of marriage of the industrial design and
the type design so the project ships and
they they ship something like 2 million
in Japan alone and they they considered
that was a little disappointing and they
figured that in order to really be
successful they had to appeal to the
Japanese market in fact one of the VPS
that microsoft said that the product was
so aggressive and large that they
couldn't get it through the door of some
apartments in japan so that was one of
their reasonings now from from my own
standpoint i thought this really overtly
aggressive looking box probably didn't
belong and everyone's living room not
everyone wants this kind of this kind of
stuff in their home and microsoft's
consultants told them that you know they
needed to cross over into other other
markets can especially the female
demographic to me it was sort of like
you know in musical terms this sort of
crossover there's really not a whole lot
of middle ground
so the new xbox console was intended the
360 tipped you off that is supposed to
be around for everybody sort of the
well-rounded sort of thing plug in your
home theater and any other accessories
and you have the home entertainment
center for the family home it appeals to
the father son mother and daughter and
the device really needed more than just
a facelift to appeal to such a wide wide
audience and so I went to Microsoft and
met with their designers and kind of got
an understanding of what they were what
they were thinking of this is in 2004
they had consulted about a dozen design
firms and consultants around around the
world to get a pulse on what people
really wanted and the consultants put
together this sort of axes pair of axes
which was supposed to help them pinpoint
where they were and where they needed to
be and where they were was up in the
upper left by the Hummer it was very
wild industrial piece of hardware
everything about it the user interface
everything was very up in the upper left
were they were they needed to be was the
porsche 911 carrera so to help visualize
this further for the talk that i
originally put this together for i put
together some pictures and and when i
put this together got to thinking and I
the importance of the female demographic
I was thinking why don't they try to why
didn't they try to use something that
maybe they could he mails could relate
to a little better so I tried this I
don't mean to be biased here my wife I
know says this is easier for her to
figure but she says those shoes in the
lower right should have about a half
inch more heel and I yeah I saw I just
said that's why I do type in that shoes
so they had the Hummer they needed to be
more like the Porsche 911 Carrera and
which was came out in 1963 and has
retained this unmistakable styling since
then and it seemed to me a pretty
aggressive to have all this wrapped up
in one consumer electronics device but
there you have it so here's a here's an
example of some controllers that they
were trying out it's a terrible slide
but I apologize but they essentially
they're taking these industrial designs
and placing him on the on the axes to
figure out which which fits their need
that's the development of the actual
hardware device was all behind the
scenes and I couldn't see anything about
what she was talking about the art
director Shelley so she gave me a couple
slides of some things that were
something to help inspire me and this
one was this projector and one is this
speaker system and then she gave me
three typefaces that they'd been using
in mock-ups and each one of these heads
some of the characteristics but not all
of them for what they were looking for I
was pretty glad of that because I didn't
think any of these really stood the
timeless test very well and they look
kind of awkward to me kind of like to go
back to the car analogy saw one of these
in the Google parking lot actually so to
go back to the typefaces again to
evaluate these specifically the top is a
type is called mr. Giacomo very
condensed although the W is really
really wide the r is really really wide
the e looks like it's from a completely
different typeface the fit is kind of
weird the right side of the k is really
loose ready to the left all these all
these things about it where we're
troubling distill a the typeface in the
middle no space between letters the AE
look like they could be different
alphabets and the W again is really
really wide and cholla the bottom one is
the most refined well-made typeface but
to me it looks more like the previous
Xbox than what they were trying to
achieve
so I went back to my studio and started
thinking about typefaces and this whole
idea of curvature and organic and I
started sketching some designs this in
particular was a typeface where I was
trying to incorporate curvature at every
opportunity without and still have it be
a text face and very rough sketches that
I digitized and got the system working
in this slide here took some test
letters made bold weights and put
together a proposal to send back to them
just to show that I was interested in
the project and they said yeah this is
really nice but what else have you got
so they gave me another week to work out
some other ideas and the first idea was
looking at Half Dome since the first
time I saw it I knew there had to be a
typeface in there somewhere had this
really cool smooth glaciated surface and
then raised these rocky crags looked at
a lot of different pictures of Half Dome
and I finally figured out where or how I
could sort of show a type base in this
feature so I looking at the insides of
these characters you'll see there's this
sort of a facet where the gentle curve
all of a sudden drops off and some
larger sketches here and some digitized
characters the first ones I did to sort
of get this notion and made a bold
weight so that they could you know see
the contrast and sort of the
possibilities that this design system
would happen in my proposal and now
thinking about this shoe analogy I look
at this and I kind of think maybe it's a
little too hiking boot so but I had
moved on to another idea which was sort
of looking at a more contemporary style
i reduced the round corners to something
more a tighter radius so that making
more rectangular but not completely
rectangular I wanted to retain this an
organic bit to it so if you look at the
letter C the the entry stroke has a
different shape than the exit stroke a
lot of typefaces of this genre or
sort of bits and pieces of typefaces
rotated or letters rotated into position
and and that's that so it's very
mechanical looking and I was trying to
get away from that with with this
typeface which became convection and
they liked it enough that we won the
account and again they're looking at it
on a piece of hardware on a HDTV
somewhere in redmond and i had no idea
what it really looked like to them so
they said it's a little too light can
you make a little darker for me so i
made a couple iterations of a little bit
darker typeface so to give it a little
more presence in the UI and they finally
chose the one by the green their of the
green triangle and this is how the
family was shaping up the original
proposal on top the user interface
version and then to boulder waits for
their branding group and of course as I
said earlier a global product needs a
global language support a Greek is
always a really interesting problem you
have a very scribal rooted lower case
the caps of course are very Latin but
the lower case is very scribal very
fluid and compared to the Latin it's
it's extremely different too compared to
the very constructed Latin lower case
and times of course is a very
traditional Greek however Ariel is sort
of an overly latinized all the fluidity
is gone it's trying too hard to be like
the Latin Ariel so with the approach the
convection was to preserve some of the
fluidity of the historical Greek model
yet simplify it so that it went well
with the Latin design concept and here's
sort of a larger showing the larger
character set of what was finally
approved by the linguistic type experts
at Microsoft
cyrillic has the complete opposite
problem of of Greek it's very
rectangular very boxy so incorporating
curve where ever you can helps
legibility but if you add too much it
doesn't look like Cyrillic anymore or it
looks for stand and in this case I had a
lot of compromise to make because
convection is is is very rectangular and
in order to read this well on the screen
I had to make sure there was enough
curvature in it of Russian words are
very long so that it sort of enhances
that whole notion of box eNOS so if you
look at text this is Latin Greek and
Cyrillic all in one block you probably
never see this but if you blur your eyes
you can see where the Greek jumps out as
being very round the Cyrillic is very
rectangular and horizontal in the Latin
is somewhere in between so it's kind of
an interesting exercise to see how the
various scripts go together now finally
after four months of intensive type
development and about 16 months later we
got to see what it looked like together
with the product and I understand that
they feel very very good about this
because there were people speculating
that either apple or sony help them out
with their product design so they were
pleased with the results now the user
interface is interesting they keep this
kind of notion of subtle curvature
and then I read that in the original
Xbox there was something like 45 user
interface screens for the entire product
with the xbox 360 there's about 450 user
interface screens and to me that says
that type on the screen type on the
device is is becoming a lot more
important not less some people are
arguing that IQ no it's all about icons
and all this but the type itself there's
ten times more reading to do on the new
xbox and there wasn't the old and so we
somehow acquired a point of purchase
display of the xbox product and it
actually was it was fun to be able to
look at the actual screen and see how
the typeface was performing in the
environment if you the the X the
convection design has some very subtle
curvatures in it and looking at it in
this resolution on an HD monitor to see
if those subtle curvatures are really
holding up he zoom in really close you
can see that every letter looks a little
bit different depending on where it is
on the screen if you look at this
particularly the four DS in the lower
right every one of them is slightly
different and none of them really look
all that good eat it it's this is all
about the render or how the fonts are
rendered on the Xbox device it's it's a
it's a process that's of course
proprietary but they super sample the
type but it son hinted and what I talked
about earlier about hinting about the
rant sort of randomization of how the
letters end up looking is is what you're
seeing here
I looked at the keypad and I noticed
that the number five had grown as Sara
found the bar from my original design
lots of little artifacts come up here on
the cap e and enter you can see these
little bulbs at the end of the of the
strokes now that's not something that
occurs in every uppercase e so it's not
like I could design it with a little
taper you know so that that you know
those pixels would be less intense at
the end so it's it's a really hard thing
to nail down in general if you look at
it and I'm circling the A's there you
can see that my design if kind of a
rounded bottom of the a is is still
holding ups and sort of the essence of
the type is still preserved even though
there's some of these weird artifacts
that show up this is a mock-up of the
typeface are the the game call of duty
and it's using the typeface Georgia so I
kind of laid it out the way it looks in
in the game call of duty because this
beautifully constructed typeface when
you put it into a user interface becomes
a glowing shadow of its former self it
just shows you that you can't just drop
any old type face into a user interface
and expect it to work out look at the
lower case a I'll toggle back the
lowercase a and layout becomes very very
skinny and the seraphs on the cap s
particularly if you look down at the
word southpaw they just get these
enormous patna glowing pixel patterns
and this is one of the things that the
Android team understood very well in one
of the reasons why they wanted to have
ownership of the font data so that they
could tool it specifically for devices
if you know to this level the very same
font data can look very different
depending on the rendering environment
here's Times New Roman the top screen
high resolution then you have black and
white rendering monochrome but then
those two examples at the bottom are
different forms of anti-aliasing ones XP
in the bottom one is free type which is
what Andrew
users and you can see that the results
with the same exact font data are very
very different and if any of you play
around with photoshop you you're
probably very familiar with these five
settings of text rendering that are
possible each gives you a very different
look well each gives you a very subtle
difference but if you look from between
the top and the bottom it's a pretty
extreme difference and how the type is
rendering and in fact with the the zune
media player that we worked on for
Microsoft there were instances if you
look at the middle blind the crisp
setting there's instances where there's
little widow pixels sticking above and
below the baseline you can barely see it
probably in the projection but on the
zune device with white text reversed out
of a dark background those little pixels
really pop out and they can really be
distracting I'm not sure why they call
it crisp because it looks on crisp to me
it actually looks like it's got more
spread but so this is another thing that
that Android recognized was the fact
that the renderer and the type is very
important to have ownership of so a
couple slides here about Android when we
developed the fonts Jeff and I discussed
very much about sort of the scope of
typefaces we want to be there's this
range of cute to techno I mean in
neutral right in the middle we know we
couldn't be too far left or right and
neutral was a little bit too boring so
we had to find a sweet spot in there
somewhere in the first typeface I did
was a kind of a bouncy design lots of
angled stress kind of referring to cat
told the typeface that the google logo
is in the idea was to be sort of sort of
cute but not cuddly you know let's be
you know friendly and we tried a couple
tests here's here's that typeface in
fact if you look at this you can see
there's a lot going on and probably way
too much going on for a user interface
design there's a lot of angle angled
shapes in there the cat pee has an open
bowl so kind of kind of steered this
helped us steer clear of this direction
we tried a few other ideas and here's
one we tried which was sort of a techno
look if you look at the lower case a the
detail of the tail is removed very
upright stress sort of modern looking
and it sort of it became pretty clear
that we wanted to be much closer to the
center of that scale with these fonts
and so we moved sort of to the middle
left of the of the axis and started with
this design which is very upright very
open forms but not as neutrally designed
to say Helvetica and from the sketches I
made fonts and we tried him out in the
same screens and this gave a much more
neutral presence but didn't have didn't
have the bounciness but it was still
friendly we pretty much thought that was
the direction to go and so we tried a
whole bunch of different weights to sort
of get the idea of whether the the
boldness the contrast of the light and
the bold were right and we narrowed it
down to these two weights for the
regular and the bold of droid now we
only made two weights because the italic
would be synthesized by Android that is
oblique the horrors of oblique type are
much less noticeable on a device screen
and with a San Sara so we decided to
save space and put you know footprint
size to let the engine render the
italics for the serif fonts we agreed
that it had to be very compatible with
the sands obviously which means that it
had to be pretty far away from Times
Roman the most public adequate asst
typeface times is very delicate very
formal looking at the middle example
century centuries from a line of types
often called the legibility series and
they're sort of your newspaper types are
based on these the very thing that makes
newspaper types legible make them work
well on devices and so they're a very
good sort of model to start from upright
stress sort of monotone not a lot of
hype not high
dress the seraphs are very sturdy the
big x height all that stuff went into
the idea of the droid serif design and
we agreed that a oblique Roman wouldn't
be the best type of graphic solution so
for a seraph design so I designed a so
that's the middle would be an oblique
the bottom is what I designed is a
cursive italic cursive forms of the a
and the e and the kind of a long F all
of these things lend contrast to the
upright serif design and that's how the
family unfolded and currently all the
fonts support wgl for which is about 35
languages and just to go to greek real
quick if kind of a larger enlargement to
think about the slides i showed earlier
about the convection Greek for the serif
you'll note the eight of the last letter
on the first the last Greek letter up
there you'll see a mistake often made
with Greek serif types as people who put
seraphs on the on the bit that hangs
below the baseline and up at the x
height and for the scribal greeks the
scribal forms of greek don't have these
seraphs and they're actually considered
very incorrect the beta as well often
people will put a seraph at the bottom
of that that d center and it's it's just
not very well accepted and for the
sans-serif you can see it's still it's
quite fluid somewhat simplified to go
with the sans-serif form and Cyrillic
again we have the problem of very square
forms adding a lot of curvature to help
add to the texture and keep it from
looking too upright and this is sort of
how the family looks together and the
goal of course was to create fonts that
were comfortable for reading but didn't
draw too much attention to themselves
and we may have actually achieved that
as there was a writer for Wired Wired's
online edition he called the fonts
googly so thank you very much got time
for questions I imagine yeah
for the avatars the question was that I
see the newest xbox UI and no i haven't
i heard that it was done and since i'm
not a gamer and kind of out of the out
of the loop on that but i am I I saw it
as i was i gave a talk last week in New
York and the same question came up and
they were you know asking about that so
I definitely have to look at it see as
far as the the blades and such is that
all different or it's all very okay okay
right right yeah I mean reading through
the screens they're pretty verbose I
mean I the the version with we that we
had in our office there the you go
through those blades there was a lot of
information on them and yes it's sort of
a iconic iconographic a great thing but
when you start having to remember what
the icon was what words that were
associated with it becomes a whole
nother issue so yeah oh sorry go ahead
one word can convey how to make first
right certain cases a believe I think to
zante by the word I've tried to call
right one one word is worth a thousand
pictures yes indeed yep new iPhones
always tend to be sans-serif most of
time whereas for immersive reading books
text and stuff like that on paper
the serif fonts or almost always do you
think that's a artifact the effects of
noise our sensors are in fact a very low
resolution in America you don't get the
reproduction of the seraphs and as
resolute
right so they asked me to repeat the
question so I'll sort of say it again
for the sake of the video so is there a
that's a reasoning for text being set in
serif styles and UI is being set in
sans-serif styles I think a lot of it
has to do with legacy people are used to
seeing low resolution type being rented
was with sans-serif certainly they do
look better because there's less detail
that's probably just going to go away
anyway screens are getting much better
and you'll see a lot now Georgia in
particular is used quite often now for
websites because it's just hinted really
well and looks really good certainly I
think there's a theory back going back
to publishing days because the seraphs
help you give an x height and baseline
for your eye to follow and sans serifs
don't have that and so they require more
letting more space between the lines to
help guide your I left to right so those
reasons for using seraphs and sans
serifs you know reasons for using one or
the other are starting to go away simply
because the resolutions are getting so
much better and i think the user
interfaces are exactly what you said
it's as people are used to seeing in
that way and again is to sort of take
advantage of the fact that there's it's
low resolution so the sans-serif is
going to hold up better it's more sturdy
but those reasons are getting much more
less and less so yes
insta for small screens yes once it
comes out people start using it like
when I kill your eyes to see it on a web
page
no okay so the question is can the droid
fonts be used at large sizes I I
certainly don't think so the what what
ends up happening with any type face
when you're when you're designing a type
specifically for text and you use it big
it's going to look too loosely spaced it
might look a little too cumbersome these
are all very design sensitive things
that you know most people won't won't
gather but that's why in the old days
when they cut metal types they cut a
size for text that was a little sturdier
but when they got to the big sizes they
made the hairline more delicate and the
details more more crisp so hey if we do
a droid for newspaper design and then a
droid for you know display you know
we'll be happy to do it it's not going
to kill your eyes to look at though I
especially the serif I'm there's there's
a lot of in the seraphs the the sort of
ball terminals have instead of a full
ball there's sort of a crescent shape
and that's because a ball will tend to
get very heavy on screen but it's
actually kind of a pretty little finish
to the letters so that the letters have
a detail that's not going to be very
bland and boring if you set it a large
size yeah it's sturdy because the it's
it's not high contrast but those little
details and refinements are in there I
didn't you know just lob them off and
make them you know squared edges and
stuff because there was only a few
pixels if the size is where we're
working with because in the future the
resolutions get better and it's got to
work at those resolutions as well so
yep so the rhetoric and gentle response
are very different
Microsoft's spare time
the play hockey with the way the only
source for represent survive
okay so the question is whether I'm
happy with the results of the
open-source renderer versus the Android
renderer yeah well well it's that it is
the open source but you guys have your
own thing you're doing now I mean yeah
it'sit's not just retype it's sort of a
google free type now so it's being
enhanced and worked on specifically so
looking at proofing when I was proofing
the fonts looking at them in truetype
they do look a little bit lighter and so
knowing that I I did scale back on the
the hair lines and stuff because they're
going to be a little darker in the
freetype engine so I on a Windows device
or whatnot they it might be a little bit
lighter and might not be as good as what
you're going to see on a android phone
okay yeah next to you
two red shirts I couldn't say the guy in
the red shirt because there's two red
shirts one of the things that we're
dealing with is in web doing is as we
get to if you start doing sort of
floating scaling than the font size can
start being is very interesting
non-fixed sizes like six point three
five pixels and 8.25 pixels what you
know how do you think the font you know
should be building up or you know in
situations if that was to arise
okay the question is what sort of
in-between point sizes how should it
look zillion you know they're just
scaling everything and crazy font sizes
okay so there's a two-part answer one is
the current the way the current the SDK
is now and that is the renderer does not
have the bytecode interpreter on to look
at the hinting that we did because the
patent issues and stuff so the way they
behave now is all automatically
generated by Mike reads renderer and
what's what's the freetype engineer yeah
Warner
yeah he's forgetting names too anyway so
essentially the way it's being
customized as the render is being
customized is to basically do exactly
what you're talking about there take
care of those sorts of in-between point
size issues and make sure that the sizes
that are your primary sizes look good
and that sort of a thing the hinting
that we've done is for every point size
every pixel size you're going to get
when the bytecode interpreter is on to
look at hinting is going to be tuned
there has been tuned by our engineers so
it's sort of a depending on when we're
talking about here and whether the
bytecode interpreter will be turned on
and when that sort of a thing so no
other question yes
I couldn't hear i'm so sorry first gap
droid what's what's what I be useful
okay the Sarah version of droid what are
we using it for for serif content on the
web if someone is looking at a web page
that was originally set for Times New
Roman and the style sheet says use serif
they will use the droid serif to render
it theoretically could be used anywhere
could be used in the UI there's no
reason it shouldn't be yes yes
ra ra t oh I radiant red that's us for
grad yes yeah it's a figure ground mess
with your mind kind of a thing no intent
other than to be a terribly unclever in
the few days that we had to launch our
company so hey that's right yeah you
close your eyes and it's still there
well the question I usually get about it
is doesn't look too much like Adobe's
logo and so yes
yes the cjk the droid fallback font is
it called fallback I'm not even sure
what's it called in the SDK droid droid
sans fallback okay so we worked with a
partner in China to build specific fonts
that pair well with the droid sans' so
this was a huge undertaking there are
very very few new Chinese Japanese and
Korean typefaces being designed out
there but we had this developed and so
essentially the for the idea graph range
of cjk there is a so there's four
traditional simplified traditional
chinese simplified Chinese Korean and
Japanese some of those idea graphs well
they share one code point but all those
four languages have a preference for a
different design and what we did was
specifically designed it for simplified
Chinese that was sort of the spec the
brief but even so I think it has 46,000
characters and the font so it's fairly
large now you know Google or anybody
wants to extend so that there's
traditional Chinese idea graphs in there
we can do that but it's you know for the
base SDK that's all we did
wgl four yep how many are 600 there
abouts there's there's two different
ways of defining the WGAL for standard
and one of them includes line draw
characters and the line draw characters
are what you know people use to make ATM
screens with these you know making these
boxes out of letter about of letter
forms and not many people do that
anymore those those those bars that make
the line draw are in the fallback font
so they're accessible but we didn't see
the need to put them in every single
font because they're so seldom leave
used and they take up space
right so if you're working okay I'll
answer the question and in the same
earth I repeat the question in the
answer so if you're typing along in
droid serif and you come along and
desire and decide you want the Unicode
point that represents the integral
symbol for you're doing some math
formula it's not in droid sans but it is
in the fall back font so it will call up
from the fallback font rather than give
you an empty box so you can access it
automatically accesses this fall back
font is four characters that are unusual
or not typical text stream characters
very good question glad I brought him
he's my colleague Josh Hadley he's he's
in san jose so though I dragged him
along anything else
alright well thank you so much I
appreciate it great questions and great
job on Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
