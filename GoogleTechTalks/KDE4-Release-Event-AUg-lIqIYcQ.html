AK office developer and caching I really
don't even know what you're going to
show us in terms of extreme coolness
please you'll find get set up
okay as a public service announcement
while we're while we're switching
laptops please if you're if you're
sitting at the recharging stations
please don't please leave your laptop
there leave Leave the legroom for the
people who are passing by if there's
legroom enough you're okay
k office to the KDE office suite
thanking it yes okay erin was describing
the new technologies in the desktop in
the general improvements of the desktop
I'm the first in line of a number of
speakers who are going to talk about
certain modules my modules is the K
office suite and just as kad has been
experiencing a complete rewrite in the
Katie for line k office is experienced
aim and we were going from version 1.6
to version two and I will talk to you
about what's happening in katy office
too and what you can expect now just a
few words about myself I'm a careful
developer I have been a free software
developer since 1986 so I'm quite much
older than most of the people in the
project my title if you wish is the K of
his marketing coordinator we don't have
much of a marketing department because
it's basically me i right release notes
i write text and so on but it has proved
to be enough because we have very active
people running taking our relation outs
and put pushing them to slashdot and os
news and so on and I hope now that all
the collected journalists here will help
me also in the is a message to bring the
message out to people I'm not going to
talk about myself I'm going to introduce
k office to you because I think that
most of you haven't seen it basically
we're the most comprehensive office
suite in the existence we have a large
number of productivity applications k
word k squared + k presenter is the
three large applications in k office
what they do should be obvious a cake
see is something of an excess copy
Microsoft Access a personal database
which you can use on your desktop
and you can also use it with a database
server we have which Microsoft Office
does not have also a creativity street
consisting of a program called critter
kreta is layered pixel-based image
editor much like photoshop carbon is the
same but for vectors and ki bo is a
flowchart application like VCO also a
microsoft we have a management
application called Cape later which
means the K planning tool tool for for
managing projects it's a project
management application we also have some
help applications charting two formulas
mathematical formulas and teeth hours
and so on and I'm going to start with
giving you a slight overview of how the
applications look this here is K word in
its present state we have the document
area here and almost all of the decay of
these applications look the same in
general but the data in it of course
very very much to the left we have a
toolbox with some tools that can handle
the contents of the documents and
depending on what type of documents and
what types of data we handle the tools
will vary on the right we have option
windows for the tools and also for other
Dockers and all of these are dockable
and it can remove them from the
application like that
you can move them to other parts of the
window
like that so it's very flexible you can
work as ever you like some applications
in Linux will have a separate dialogue
for everything some applications have
the main window where everything besides
KFS tries to be the best of both worlds
I will come to that now inside the
document we have a normal data like text
in the word processor we have numbers in
the spreadsheet application and so on
but we also have something called shapes
a shape can be a very simple thing it
can be aligned it can be rectangle etc
etc it can also be slightly more complex
thing like a chart and the shapes when I
move them around the shape the text will
of course we've run it and you can
configure how the text will will appear
around the shape you can do a number of
manipulations of these shapes you can
rescale them of course you can rotate
them
and the text will once again move around
it just to give you an example of
another application this is carbon the
vector based editor is the same here but
the standard tools are not the same so
basically a k of this application is a
collection of tools and a collection of
default data types that you can use bit
but nevertheless you can use any shape
in any caves application so you can
embed for instance chart into a
pixel-based image you can embed the
vector data into your your databases and
so on and so on okay so what are the
properties of cafes it's pretty powerful
as you can see it's all so fast it
starts up just as fast as all the other
KD applications it has a low recent
consumption in at least in comparison to
some other application suites we share a
lot of development with the KD project
we have common technologies KD lips is
the base for K office which makes it
portable to other platforms as well as
give a slipway to use a lot of the
advanced technologies like phone on and
so on we also share developers so many
developers who work on K office have
also started out in katy or the other
way around and also some technologies
that started out in k office like cross
have now switched into KD lips one of
the key points of openoffice s aura of k
office is that it supports open document
and you may wonder what this image does
here actually if you go to google image
and search for open document this is one
of the features that you will find on
the front page open document is the
standard format for office document
interchange and it's supported by very
many applications today and it's always
growing it's an iso standard which makes
it eligible
many states and government functions so
you can in some countries not choose an
application that doesn't support the ISO
standard if there is one so in this case
k office is compliant with the standard
and we will use it and we were actually
the first first application suite that
supported open document open office was
the first one to make it the standard
file format but we were the first want
to actually support it we're also a
member of the technical committee so
some people who don't like open document
say that this is a scheme by some to
control the computing world we want to
deny that vm tlie because we have been
part of defining the standard and we
will continue to be part of defining
standard as far as we can see for the
long very long future another key point
of k office is that it's portable you
seen before all the KD applications are
either running or will be running at the
time of 4.1 on windows on mac OS x and
of course all the unix derivatives like
linux and solaris and so on and what you
can see here is a picture of a
screenshot actually of K word running on
windows so it is working not all the
components are working yet on windows
and not all the components are all the
features are working but we have proved
a concept for for most of the
application and it will be done
one reason for running k office except
for the the low resource consumption is
on is that it's well integrated into
everything that we can find for me the
killer application of KDE is integration
I can integrate any application into any
other that supports integration door and
this is example if you surf to a website
that produces or publishes documents in
any format that's supported by a office
you will be able to view this document
inside your browser of course if the
browser supports embed ability conquer
does so a proof of concept here you can
view a text file inside conqueror this
is actually a screenshot from KF is 1.6
so it doesn't show an OTF file but that
doesn't matter in principle because it
will work the same on open document as
it will in KL foreman the interesting
thing is that s Aaron also mentioned k
office has great support for open
document and this open document support
will move into katie ellipse it's not
certain if it will happen for 4.1 or 4.2
but when that happens most of the KDE
desktop will also be able to support
open document applications will be able
to write reports and whatever in a
document and you will be able to read
these files into open office k office or
any other open documents conforming
application we also try to be well
integrated into other desktops following
the free desktop torg specifications so
we can cut and paste between k office
and other desktop applications we will
use the same type information for
instance open document text to open
documents spreadsheets or so on and we
also will have a native look and feel
through the power of KD labs as you have
seen already
k f is very flexible it's all built up
of a pretty small core and around this
core there is a plug-in architecture
that makes you able to write plugins
that will immediately integrate with the
rest of K office applications open
office has something similar they call
it extensions and it has proven once and
again that once you make this open for
users and and other developers to grab
people will write applications people
will write extensions and not that's
what we're happening to every K of this
application is also scriptable through
cross with Java with openoffice
JavaScript with Python and Ruby and once
cross integrates more languages those
will also come two Kay office of course
it's also very simple code base measured
in a number of ways it's 850,000 lines
of code approximately at this time and
calling that simple okay it may be
stretch but still the architecture
proved offers people to quickly come
into it and write actual usable things
we have had a number of summer code
students if you know the google Summer
of Code project they given I think it's
five hundred dollars for for how much
forty-five hundred dollars for a student
to work during a summer and for this
they will produce some result and Google
always selects the projects you have to
apply and then they select the projects
that they allow and K office has had a
number of these and we have had some
pretty interesting results you will see
some of them later this is one of them
okay I talked a bit about flake shapes
before they're embeddable shapes they're
very simple or they can be very simple
and they can also be pretty complex if
you want that the thing is that they're
pretty simple to create and i think this
is aaron's pointing devices in yes
this what you can see here is K word
with an embeddable music score flag
shape there was a student who wanted to
create a proof of concept for for a
chart editor s or a score editor and we
thought that okay this might be a good
proof of concept for flake as well so he
worked during summer and now suddenly
k-chart k word and caves bread and all
the other ones are a can embed musical
scores like this okay he didn't get the
full results during just a summer he
continued afterwards but he had
something that were pretty workable
already after just two months or
something and we think that this will
happen a lot people will see okay we
need to embed a certain data type that's
not really supported in other office
suites quickly for some measure quickly
create a flake shape and suddenly it's
available for all K of his users and of
course if the people who do this make it
available to the get hot new stuff
system you will also be able to download
it to your computer as you saw before
it's also pretty versatile you can
manipulate the shapes you can rotate
scale and drag and drop two and so on
yep
at this point now it saves in something
called music XML which you can extract
and use in other editors but right now
it's not it's a standalone thing it's
not connected very but I see no reason
why we wouldn't be able to do that in
the future hmm yes another technology
that's used in K office is something we
call pigment which is a color management
library now office suites are often
distinguished from publishing sweets
mostly because office which can handle
color models if you use the standard
cuddle color model of RGB possibly rgba
a standing for alpha channel which is
which is transparency exactly that's the
bad thing or not being a native English
speaker you you have to serve to work
you will be able to edit your documents
just fine but the printing industry will
say are we won't take your documents
because we can't guarantee the quality
on paper for doing that you need to have
another caller module this so-called
CMYK which stands for CR magenta yellow
and I don't know it's black but probably
the K has some some meaning to see I'm
magenta yellow and KD right and since we
use pigment all of the applications
within k office will you have the
ability to use CMYK this is not certain
to be done for 2.0 but it will happen
eventually and pigment is much more
versatile than this you can have any
color model you don't have to have a
certain number of numbers for it like
for instance RGB 33 color components
CMYK for RGB a force with and so on we
have also been able to model some pretty
different and some pretty advanced color
models like oil paint watercolors and so
on and the interesting thing with color
with pigment is that you will be able to
mix colors from these color modules
through automatic conversion of one
color model to another okay the result
of mixing a watercolor and oil paint
with with RGB something is perhaps not
going to come out really well but it
will be possible in fact it's already
possible and especially in Krita which
is a painting application you can
already do things like defining colors
on a on a pallet and then just by using
a mouse or a tablet mix the colors as if
you were using a physical pallet and
this is research stuff this can't be
found anywhere else in the world at
least not with arguments that we're
using
okay as I said before we have a very
flexible architecture using plugins
extensions these can be both k off is
wide for instance if you create a new
flag shaped you will be able to use that
in every K of this application it can
also be application dependent every
application or at least some of the
applications right now provide plug in
at the possibilities for some types of
operations for critter for instance you
have some pretty advanced image
manipulation plugins which are not part
of KF is in Quetta itself one of the
quitter developers who by the name of
surreal burger publishes a set of of
plugins which you can use and we think
that will there will be more more of
these and as I said scripting scripting
using cross provides a pretty flexible
way of extending things it's language
independent modules in written in
different languages can call each other
as subroutines oresko routines but there
is also a GUI less mode so if you have a
problem with office automation you need
to for instance take a template of a an
invoice or something fill in the rows or
columns of it with with items and prices
you can do that automatically by just
using K office a short or a long cross
script and then produce the output which
is a document with complete filled in a
dress items and so on so on this also
makes it very easy to integrate k office
with external software from other
vendors and other document handling
systems and so on
okay that's about the technology behind
k office what do we think will happen
now when we release 2.0 k office as we
think will be advanced enough to be used
by some users some other users will
still find it lacking features and so on
we think that the early adopters here
will be schools as I said earlier it's
very flexible we have a vision where
people developers or users will take K
office as components or k offices as
collection of shapes remodel it into
specific target users needs and then
publish it for their own users for
instance we've we have a vision about a
very simple word processor which can be
used in schools for small children they
don't need things like like footers or
or table of contents or whatever just
very simple enter text make it bold or
italic make it centered or left or right
aligned that's it but still even though
the you is very simple the full power of
the open document supply compliant k is
behind it so it will be able to save
files in the open document files a
document format and open office and K
word and all the other open document
compliance software will be able to read
it and publish it we also think that
since the resources that we consume are
much smaller than several other
application suits it will be used in
small devices like the triple-e PC and
so on as well as KD users because most
KD user wants a well-integrated office
suite okay many people will think that
it's too simple in the 2.0 release and
we'll wait for it to be 2.0 12.2 or so
on but we think that even 2.0 will
and its home in several in many KD users
computers and of course with the time
with the speed that development is
happening right now in future anybody we
think there are no specific target
groups everybody will be interested in k
office in one way or another they may
not choose it but they will look at it
so about the future we have so far not
been able to integrate everything that
Katie for offers one of the things is
sonnet that Aaron was mentioning spell
checking which is language dependent
language detecting you can actually
spell check in the same document Hebrew
this is German and this is English in
the same document without any
configuration at all this is not
possible to do with 2.0 it will likely
happen for 2.1 or 2.2 of course we want
to integrate more with the rest of the
KD applications KD personal information
management with mail calendar song is
not available for 4.0 so we'll have to
wait to 4.1 if this will happen with K
office 2.1 or we'll have to wait to 2.2
we don't know we'll see but we will
integrate with everything that makes
sense to integrate with we will also see
some new components we have 11 already
we will likely see more we can't package
everything many of the people will have
to come up with components but we will
integrate some that we think are good
for the users like for instance mind map
application with the mind map you can
sketch out your thoughts about certain
subject and then from this mind map
create a word document complete with
table of contents and everything yes
that's k dessert I took that as an
example of a mind map
and of course just as Katie 4.0 4.1
Azure allows users to be part of
development so we'll k office we will
see some things coming from users that
we can't imagine today and I'm not going
to to try to foresee what's happening I
do think that one of the things that
will happen is that people will adapt it
to their special needs or their user
special needs and we will also see
increased business involvement in this
integration into work flow and company's
office automation and so and so on and
there is actually a newly formed company
that can help other people do this the
support companies special 4k office we
will see what happens when KF is to
comes along ok questions just a second
wisdom microphone Josh can you back when
you were showing off Krita you mentioned
cym cane and in printing industry as far
as color calibration goes would that be
in would that be specific to quita or
will be more system-wide many of the
these technologies start out in one of
the applications of Caiaphas and then if
it makes sense it's moved up to either k
office libraries making it available to
all k office applications or even KD
libs making it available for for all KD
applications in this case CMYK and color
space model modeling is used in Krita
and will be used in most okay office
okay you're next your first yes okay the
question is I have two questions the
first question regards about when you
plan to release the program about maps
maps
the my maps are ok and if will be
support to garmin maps format when I say
maps mind maps that's a abstract thing
where you jot down things on a paper
maps as in garmin maps or or street
matters and that's something else maybe
somebody will add a shape for maps I
don't know but and the other question is
more simple the regards of the world the
keyword if it supports forms our table
similar forms like I'm voices in boy
invoices well the general answer is
right now no we my may have time to
actually get that working for 2.0 but a
better guess is probably 2.1 I see that
is the new edition is more more
beautiful than the previous one yes and
i see that with all respect with the
order that will be more challenging to
start office so I and your sister office
for about seven years or more and and
this look very beautiful mmm thank you
okay
is that microphone armed
oh well we'll k office work in KDE 355
yes but it will perhaps not be perfectly
integrated okay yeah I have a question
about que presenta yes I always
considered the feature of supporting
dual head systems as a key feature of
present of presentation software is this
considered wise it's already implemented
to view the presentation on the outside
display and the flow of the slides and
notes and all this only interplay it's
definitely considered I don't know if
it's yet implemented I can't follow
every aspect of I travel fifty thousand
lines of code but it will be there
eventually I'm sure okay can we send the
microphone I was interested in what k
office development is like how many of
you guys are working on it what the
structure is to that yeah okay we are
about more or less 20 people developing
in our spare time and we have a growing
community but it's growing very slowly
mostly I think because we have been
through a very heavy period we switched
from our own file formats to open
document we switched from kd3 technology
to KD for technology and basically we're
halfway or three-quarters through that
heavy period but it is a difficult time
right now and we do need help but once
we're actually released 2.0 things will
take off pretty quickly and we will see
amazing development but still we're only
20 people and we have 11 components to
to take care of and we have no budget
whatsoever
and anybody else last question okay
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
