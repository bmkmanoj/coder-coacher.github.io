my extraordinary pleasure to introduce
to you been beaten from the University
of Maryland I don't actually remember
when I first met Ben but it was the dim
dark internet past many years ago he's
been here for the past two weeks as a
visiting scholar which is a rare and
distinguished thing in and of itself and
so we've been sort of hanging out in
building twelve hundred doing marvelous
things and he's been visiting around
with some of the people here at Google
so a Wednesday he gave a fantastic talk
about zoomable user interfaces that
presentation will be available if
anybody wants a copy or a link to it
just let me know and I'll send that to
you this talk will be recorded and be
available I guess depending on the
outcome either internally only or
externally as well but it will be
available for people so if you're
interested you have friends who want to
see this let let me know and we'll put
it up okay so this is a talk that has
been interesting being in the same
office with Ben because it's been sort
of evolving as we talk over the past
couple weeks so I was excited to see it
as you are so please join me in
welcoming been beaters in like that okay
so this is a talk about education and
how all of the excitement around online
education is changing what we know about
things and especially from my
perspective as a university professor at
a traditional University with lots of
buildings and all that kind of stuff
what that means right and how does this
new online education impact the new
stuff or impact the old stuff so the
reason for the kind of swarming title
smooches I'm trying to figure out and
I'm hoping you're going to help me in
this next hour figure out what is the
value of getting together why are we
occasionally face-to-face why is the you
know there's all this excitement and all
this good stuff about learning online
are we done should we shut down our
universities or is there some additional
value in getting together and if so what
and why and how do we make it better as
I'm sorry as a key part so just a very
brief bit about history we have
all technology has a history but there's
a particularly long history in trying to
take advantage of new technologies to
enhance education notably correspondence
courses in the early 1900's were very
very popular in this country I
personally have some experience with
television not only is there PBS and
sesame street but in the 1970s there was
a program called sunrise semester anyone
ever heard of that so CBS had a national
broadcast of you know excellent
university courses and I know because my
father taught one he was a physics
professor at NYU 1972 at 6am he taught a
society of course called physics and
society and I was you know I was a kid I
was really dramatic for me that my kid
was on TV and I got up to watch it one
time which is an important point because
we're going to talk about motivation I
think that's a fundamental issue that we
can't ignore there's of course also all
a distance education has also been
around forever this our last fall or
this past fall I visited South Africa
and visited the Unisa the University of
South Africa which is interesting
because they have 300,000 undergraduate
students none of which come to campus so
I was like wow we're gonna have great
conversations about MOOCs and you know
all this new stuff and see how they're
taking advantage of in what there are
different context were and I you know
like all like bubbling and I brought
this up and they're like its told why
would we care about that that's totally
irrelevant we don't do that we do
correspondence our university has the
biggest post office in Johannesburg and
their own printing presses like what
they don't have the bandwidth right so
they are still supporting their whole
country through pre via online video and
it works right I mean it works to us to
to a certain level all right so last
year was the year of the MOOC if you
didn't see this article you probably saw
one of these other ones I counted six
are good main article mainstream
articles on New York Times on MOOCs plus
dozens of other ones
so right it sort of hit the mainstream
consciousness but MOOCs aren't new
Carnegie Mellon has had online education
that are very similar in many ways for
over 10 years including bite-sized
nuggets have content some freely
available stuff built in question and
answering forms all the stuff that we
like to think is good but it didn't hit
the big time so what was different so
you probably know few key things one is
that it was all the new ones are all
free name-brand suppliers Carnegie
Mellon's nice but Google and Stanford is
apparently better and and there are some
fundamental characteristics about the
user experience that I'm that were
different as well the big one being that
this was all tech space and the newer
ones are all video based and so it sort
of begs the question is you know what is
it about video that makes it so exciting
and so engaging the other thing is that
a combination of free and these other
elements broadened the set of
stakeholders that are interested so of
course students are interested in cheap
but so are administrators right
university administrators are very
interested in figuring out how this
stuff is going to lower our costs
instructors are interested in how the
stuff is going to improve the quality of
education and everybody sort of more or
less wants to see better broader access
okay of course there's lots of content
and open systems as well which means you
don't have to rely on any of the
commercial providers and I put all this
out there just to sort of set the
context is that there is now a full and
rich ecosystem right so it's more than
just any one solution there's all this
stuff and so if all of this stuff exists
all the stuff is freely out there
they've Coursera i think is now saying
them two and a half million users or
maybe this course era+ Udacity I'm not
sure anyway there's a lot of people that
are taking these classes people like
them and yet at least some of you came
here in person when you had pretty good
technology support for attending this
talk virtually so I
would like you to all take out your
computers and even though there's not
that many of you which is going to be
kind of an interactive day we're gonna
I'd like you to click we could go to one
link or the other if you're here go to
bit ly / BB b dash here this is just a
moderator thing and I wanted to try and
get a sense of if you came in person and
you knew you didn't have to why did you
come in person and if you didn't come in
person why didn't you so yeah it
occurred to me after the fact that i'm
talking down submission to ask people to
bring laptops because we're going to do
a few a few phones will work
can we submit more than one yeah
oh that's interesting that's better
c5
okay so as that I started to come up Oh
was that you need the URL it's a bit ly
and then either be BB dash here or b BB
dash not here dash not dash here let's
just see if we can get a quick flavor
even though sure these things are
changing does this get updated
dynamically okay all right so right it
was convenient atmosphere energy
acoustics didn't have anything else to
do moderator had no choice I didn't
trust the technology right nuances
convenience technology all right so
that's kind of a few themes there and
doesn't didn't impossible more efficient
so uh health so basically all versions
oh yeah right all versions of impossible
or health or efficiency sorry impossible
or efficiency right I think that's kind
of the essence all right I appreciate
this because I'm sure you have more
ideas I'm happy to keep on hearing about
them so kind of one of the reasons i did
that is much i think i'm kind of curious
i think it's but the key thing i wanted
to get out of this is that there are
clearly trade-offs right in different
forms of Education and we all saw
different trade-offs even in this kind
of narrow variation in this and if there
are trade-offs even among these two very
similar but different things because
they're both live and synchronous right
there clearly will be even bigger
trade-offs between MOOCs massive open
online courses and traditional
universities and so I want to try and
understand those so one of the ways I
try and unjust to do this is to
informally make a plot
of different educational approaches
based on the physicality of virtuality
and the cost and when we look at sort of
the difference between these modern
systems we can often think about MOOCs
as being free and virtual versus
completely face-to-face and expensive
we're liberal arts colleges are probably
the No prototypical examples but there
are lots of other examples bigger
universities community colleges which
often have some verge more likely to
have some virtual component and are less
expensive and then there's also the
commercial online universities and
there's a very different versions of
those so that would kind of know about
but what's interesting is there also are
things in the middle so University of
Maryland has its what's called a Shady
Grove campus but it's not really a
different institution it's not like one
of our 20 different University of
Maryland universities it's actually part
of my campus it's the same degrees but
we basically least some office space
over in Rockville about 40 minutes away
where there's some other population
centers and get the right the same
professors to go and teach over there
and students that live over there can
take some of their courses in that
facility because it's more convenient
but by doing so they essentially give up
all of the social aspects right they
don't get our gym they don't get to run
into people the student union you know
they're not really office hours and they
give up all that stuff that's sort of an
interesting cuz it's in the middle this
was a more of a surprise to me
university of minnesota and Rochester
has online courses but face-to-face
social so they have a nursing program
and a few other programs where they
leased space it's like the second floor
of a mall I haven't been there and
students get together there for office
hours and for study groups and to be
able to you know work together on
projects but all the courses are online
so the point of this up sorry and of
course the other thing is that all of
the physical ones are strongly and
actively considering ways to move have
more virtual movement and so if they're
of all of these different ways of doing
things that means our society clearly
recognizes there's lots of different
points
this trade-off space and we might be
able to pull values from one and apply
them to the other okay so I want to look
a little bit more as to why what the
nuances are that damn thought that he
might appreciate by coming here face to
face right what do we get by coming face
to face and by being aware of that my
goal is to try and then say what can we
do to improve our face to face right
based one based on all this stuff so um
I started off by selling a lil bit about
seeing a little bit about motivation I
want to go back to this white books have
been around for a long time they're
wildly successful right and now you can
buy them use for a dollar or two and
more or less take any class and learn
anything you want and lots of people do
that of course a lot more people don't
do that right and so it's not that they
don't work it's that there's a they only
work for some people there's a
motivation problem and what the new
version of MOOCs the new video does is
not so much that they do something
better it's that they do it differently
for a different set of people they offer
a different set of trade-offs so they
increase the number of people that can
do it or statues to do it but there's
still many that don't and red I think
probably all heard that sort of a
standard that around typically around
ninety percent of people that sign up
for a MOOC don't end up finishing it
right there's lots of other numbers that
are interesting but the point here is
that it's not working for everybody at
least not all the time and so why not
there's this quote I this attributed to
Marvin Minsky I don't know if it's true
or not but he says every educational
reform is doomed to succeed by which he
means is doomed to succeed for some
students right no matter what you do
it's going to work great for some right
it's really nice of the new MOOCs work
for two and a half million people but
what about the other seven billion minus
two and a half million right is it I
mean maybe it'll maybe it will end up
working well for them but on the other
hand no the small amount of public data
on who finished these these courses is
makes me a little skeptical least for
this course almost three-quarters of the
students that finished already had
a bachelor's degree no sir is a pretty
technical course and write lots of
caveats maybe it will get better but the
point is this is three-quarters of ten
percent right most of the people that
were successful already had significant
training so do we really want to push
our students to be doing online as their
primary education and not legs hip not
it's not clue that anybody well I can be
friendly and say it's not clear that
anybody is trying to push that but
that's completely false right these
companies are very actively trying to
push that they're working really hard at
offering credentials and once they offer
credentials then there's gonna be people
offering degrees and last week there's a
university that is going to be willing
to offer you a degree based on your you
know assessment only right take your
take your online or your assessment and
skip all of the regular stuff and you
can get a degree so this is something
we're moving towards so this is why I
kind of want to step back and say why do
we care so last week there was another
article in The New York Times by Thomas
Friedman that was really a cheerleading
article saying how great all the stuff
is and the comments were really
interesting because a lot of them were
supportive and a lot of them were you
know cautious right this is from a
teacher and doesn't even really matter
exactly what he says but the point was
what the teacher does goes way beyond
lecture there's lots and lots of stuff
and especially in a smaller institution
where you get to have a relationship
with a student over a period of years
right you have a very very meaningful
experience and I'm sure you all have had
experiences like this as well I remember
as a student I had a couple of you know
favorite instructors that were really
really meaningful to me I remember my
math one of my math teachers early on
asked me to stay after class which bride
is never a good sign and I remember 20
years ago but I remember exactly what he
said he said Ben you need to buckle down
those were his words that's like what
does that mean why he's like I know
you're an A student if you want to be
but you're not right now and it's cuz
you're not you know it's a traditional
like you know father son you're not
applying yourself you need to be more
serious you're fooling around and it was
you know I'd already had a good
relationship with him
and that was enough to change to change
my attitude and I did buckle down and I
ended up doing well it's not clear how
we're going to have those kinds of
relationships and those things are super
super important you just disagree well I
think we ready just me with everything I
say today but go ahead most certainly
agree that motivation motivation that
information that's key that in terms of
the one-on-one guidance you know I
taught a class simultaneously online and
at Stanford and I felt like I knew
really well about a dozen people in the
classroom at Stanford the ones who came
and sat near the front office hours and
interacted with me and I also do really
well about a dozen people online the
ones who are in the discussion forums
all the time and we had conversations
back and forth now so in that sense to
people in terms of percentages lower
percentage for online but you know I
felt like I had the same type of
one-on-one presence with these people
even though they weren't physically in
the office I could write them a letter
of recommendation just as well as I
could for a student in the classroom
okay thanks I will definitely accept the
argument if I if I delete as well as so
I certainly agree that you can have a
you know a non-trivial relationship and
I think it is a question as to really
really the same kind of relationship in
whether it's as good as right some
people really have a girlfriend that
they've never met right so we know that
you
I guess I'm a I just a little I mean I
hear you i'm a little skeptical but but
maybe you're right maybe you're right
all right um i think i've said most of
this let's go on okay i'm mark pues dile
who many of you may know is a well-known
Georgia Tech professor focusing on CS
education for many years and his
perspective is that teaching is not
about lecturing it's about figuring out
how to teach right there's lots of
different modalities of teaching there's
lots of different ways of teaching and
engaging and one was concerns is that
online video is fine as one modality but
there's lots of different modalities and
even if you did different things on
video it's still a little bit too
constrained and it just not has
enriching and as an example it's
something that might be a little bit
harder to do in video and tell you a
different undergraduate experience I had
by my other favorite professor in that
collab knee was a woman studies
professor at rpi which was an
interesting place for her and one day we
came in and all the chairs were arranged
in a circle so we sat down in the middle
and this we're told that you know some
students are going to sit in the middle
they get to talk and there's a bunch of
other students that are going to be on
the outside and they can only observe
and if the observers want to talk they
have to tap the shoulder of what someone
on the inside they swap and then only
the person on the inside can talk and
the reason for this we were told is so
that we can really focus the discussion
and make sure that if you're going to
say something you're not just randomly
blabbering but you actually really were
deliberate about choosing to say
something okay of course that's not why
she did it this was all a subterfuge um
she had in a one student who was
observing encoding the interactions for
the class and Counting something the
thing that she was counting was the sex
of the people doing the tapping because
there is this long literature that says
that men are much more likely to be
assertive in their learning and raise
their hand and talk in in that in these
kinds of settings and she wanted to see
and show us if it was gonna happen in
real life and even though there were
three times as men women three times as
many women as men in the class of course
it worked out that more men than women
actually asked questions I of course was
one of those men apparently raising my
hand and I don't remember what book we
were discussing or what the topic was
but I remember this very very well right
it was you know one of those experiences
where the whole experience I think would
be hard to duplicate online again maybe
I'm wrong but it was part of the social
relationships and knowing the people and
thinking about how to do so maybe our
part of our challenge is to figure out
what are how do we get the richness of
physical to take it online and the other
part of our challenge is to take part of
the richness of online and add that to
where it's missing in physical okay um
so yeah you touched on something i'm not
sure if you coming back to the issue of
gender and how different genders react
online learning is that something that
people looked at um hi well so Markos
dial is probably looking at this more
than anyone and I don't think he's he's
written a little bit about different
communities including you know more
advantage versus you know less
advantaged communities in general I
don't know if his focus on this has been
on women but there is certainly a
general concern that even though this
democratizes education it democratizes
it in a way that may make it more
accessible to people that already have
the skills for knowing how to do this
and they're going to be the ones that
are most socio socio-economically
advantaged I don't know if this
disadvantages women in the same way I'm
not sure I'm not sure of any research
around that all right so one of the
things that's very clearly happening is
that there is this huge market pressure
to push to reconsider on our traditional
universities what we're doing in the
classroom and how we can take advantage
well administrators want to be cheaper
by taking advantage and the students
wanted to be better right we haven't
traditionally we the professor's haven't
traditionally had much market pressure
we
teaches badly as we want and it's almost
you know really there's pretty much no
impact whatsoever or very little now of
course that's changing in the near
future any of these courses that are
online students are going to be knowing
and not showing up to class and the next
year right we're going to start to be
noticing so it begs the question of
what's going to happen and very clearly
it's already happening in my university
and we're kind of slow many faculty are
thinking about moving more of their
lectures online and using our
face-to-face time for what we should be
which is more active learning and take
better advantage of being face-to-face
but that begs the question of how what
do we do to take better advantage of
being face-to-face so if we are in the
same room we can have a lecture but if
you've got computers and you're doing
something as students are doing
something on a computer surely there
must be a way to take advantage of the
fact that everybody is in the same room
simultaneously using a computer to do
something and at least conceptually the
way I'm thinking the way I think about
it is too likely areas are peer learning
if we're all doing something together
then maybe we can observe what we all
are doing and learn something by it and
classroom management right teachers can
have the potential for being more aware
of what the students are doing when
they're working in their groups so I'm
going to we're going to try first one
and then later a second piece of
experiment very experimental software
and to see if we can just get a sense of
whether we can gain anything by doing
something together so let's see sorry
this one so if you have a computer this
is gonna actually work less well on a
phone but maybe it'll work visit this
URL ex parte dash UMD appspot.com and
this is a tool we've been building i'll
show you how to log in in just a second
actually supported by google and
motivated by dan's power searching
course just say if people are in a
classroom are learning to search
together
then how can we figure out what's going
on when they're doing that all right so
what you're going to do is you're going
to login as there's a student link on
the top right again this side
unfortunate was well actually it's okay
and what you want to do is just put in
the pseudonym and the activity code 0718
6x party um d dot dot com okay good I
see a bunch of students logging in right
so I can see in real time what's who's
logged in and then you're going to their
two tasks these are actually taken from
a Google a day from this morning the
first task is the golf club task the
earliest golf club to form outside of
Scotland came into existence in 1766 in
what country and so I will actually i'll
log in as a student to just so we can
for those of you without computers just
a demo what's going on here OC 86 all
right so you'll just do your search over
here or if you're in mobile it'll be
down lower you'll see links you can
click on a link let's take golf history
right click on a link and then you can
rate those links as helpful or not
helpful so as you're doing that I can go
over here and see what kind of queries
people are doing so for this query I'm
interestingly nobody has typed in
exactly the same query yet a few of you
have those quarries have resulted in
links that you followed and then rated
those pages as being helpful some as
being unhelpful okay and especially for
those that are not doing it we can see
something about how are people thinking
about this right a lot of people are
using exactly the same terms from the
question some people are changing it and
realize that golf
Club might be I'm guessing actually
let's see who this was because it's
different so golf course damn not
another damn is it damp down here oh so
what made you at the beginning changed
golf club into golf course I can guess
but I'm curious what you're thinking
interesting because because well God
well since but it's interesting because
golf club is the literal term but golf
club is tricky because it means the
actual thing that you're swinging as
opposed to what the question is really
getting at which is the place that you
do your golfing right and my guess is
this is probably why it ended up on a
Google a day because a lot of the Google
of day queries it's in order to be
successful you have to take some word in
the question and somehow transform it
into a way that's going to help you more
likely more likely see this golf history
Gulf of Mexico ah all right right okay
we can look at the words that people
used in their queries this is a sort by
frequency there we go all right golf a
club date right and then we can see the
links that people have followed and what
kind of responses look at that black
health club london i think it's
blackheath typo and network now we get
so we got some answers and the real and
the answer is in England actually
showing very different things here this
is the response sorry yes I said it too
quickly so the first thing I showed was
what queries people typed then the words
that people used extracted from those
queries the link that the pages that
they loaded these are the titles of the
pages and then if you typed if you
notice that there was a response area
you can actually type in the answer this
is the answer that that people typed
yeah well that's one of the reasons
that's that's right that's one of the
reasons that assessments are problematic
isn't it real-time updated what
everybody's doing this father's problem
collectively or individually but you're
seeing the collection collect the
collective aggregation of all of the
activity in real-time as is happening
and so and again right that the two
fundamental motivations for me is to
support classroom management so that a
teacher has a room of 50 students where
their backs to the teacher right they're
all sitting in front of their computers
may be in pairs you could go around in
one by one ask students what they're
doing and you look at the shoulders
that's fine thing to do but it be seems
like it's a lot nicer if you can do that
with some dashboard that gives you an
overview of what they're doing and then
secondly currently this you know
aggregated view is only on the teachers
display sort of designed either for a
tablet and or for you know shared
display in the room but conceptually
some of this information could be pushed
down to the students view so that if you
wanted to give the student some
aggregate view of what the other
students were doing we can do that as
well but we haven't decided exactly what
that information should be so this is a
it was originally called search party
because rights group of people searching
together we're now kind of generalizing
it too so we're calling an ex parte and
that the thinking is that rather than
focusing it well the church is just one
specific activity but really at least
conceptually this should work for any
kind of computer based activity in a
classroom it's so we're exploring a few
different technologies for how to build
that one is to try to make it easy to
build specialized web apps like this
sort of a platform for doing that and
the other is we have a plug-in a chrome
plugin that will put a banner on top of
the page so it will work with any
existing website and do some very
minimal monitoring of that website or
let you type in the answers but that way
you don't have to go and do any work for
creating your new website so it's kind
of a trade-off as always between how
much custom work you want to spend
versus the richness of the observation
of the Act student
tivity you can get but the that the
interesting idea here is to try and
think about if you've got a collection
of students that are doing something
synchronously how can you take advantage
of that tag and tab that you're doing
stuff for the course so mm-hmm so the
answer is no I'll just show you very
show you really quickly what it looks
like exactly so anyway so the answer is
today the answer is no so so if you go
to now any website where we get this you
know it just pushes down this little
thing on the top I specifically we
disable some things like it won't run on
your email on your gmail and a few other
things I suppose we should disable porn
sites but this is supposed to be in a
classroom setting we would just inform
students very clearly that anything you
do on your browser when this but when
this plug-in is on is going to be
extracting sep for the following things
that's what you open it okay yeah
they're going to yeah so alternatively
we could make it so it's you know
targeted to only specific set of
websites it depends on you know
obviously that's configurable but
depends on how you want it but anyway
that's that's the way works now so this
very class exactly fact this might be a
I mean we are having a lot of debate and
in my department on how much we want to
encourage or discourage student use of
computers in the classroom and it's a
substantial issue and faculty make their
own choices and so there are some
faculty that ban all use of computers in
the classroom significant number and
there's an equal number that actively
encourage it and have kind of social
policy saying you know I really don't
want you to do it for bad stuff and if I
see you doing it for in you know you all
haven't stuff i'll ask you to turn it
off relief that's right as you could say
you must use computers my classroom but
you must have a bug yeah
yeah I mean it's right it's not that
different than a lot of companies that
block all kinds of social websites like
when you a company time why not see
actually if you had a plug-in that could
just project everyone's randomly their
their browser up there well that's
that's actually part of the plan for
this right once you've got this plugin I
do want to be able to I mean for
positive reason say hey dan what are you
doing you've got a cool thing let's show
the class so actually yeah yeah I know
you're right yes you want to go out with
Suzie good shit up all right um let me
see on time we're doing I want to make
sure it's safe yeah all right so I'm
just gonna briefly say a couple things
about programming so this has been so
far about active student activities that
are kind of modest activities right kind
of search and find answers and do simple
things of course we also want to use
computing to teach students programming
and technical more technical skills so
what's that look like this in this came
up very specifically for me cuz it this
I've been on sabbatical so I had a
couple of interesting trips my other
trip was I went to Moscow and Minsk and
the reason is it turns out I have a
cousin that runs a company called eep am
which is Eastern Europe's largest
software engineering services or
outsourcing firm turns out google
apparently is a large customer of there
so you apparently have some deep amorous
around he's hiring a few thousand
software engineers next year in Minsk
and Kiev and Budapest and he cannot
completely rely on the educational
institutions in those cities so he has a
real training problem turns out is worse
than that I mean it's not only that it's
everywhere while I was talking to him I
ran into these guys in Russia they asked
me if I wanted to move to close the name
of it started in Annapolis Annapolis
if anyone ever heard of Annapolis it's
you know Disney made celebration while
Russia is making Annapolis it is a new
city outside of the city outside of
Moscow somewhere close to you know
halfway to Siberia which is basically
give me a new technical city and they
are building a new university and AH
Pelosi you and they're gonna have 20,000
students there in a few years and they
have this company needs to train to
three thousand new software engineers
next year Russia is expecting to train
25,000 new software engineers next year
or every year anyway how do they do it
right we have massive issues of scale
and of course this is where MOOCs have
great potential if you believe that they
can work as well as face to face which I
don't quite believe so how do we how do
we do how do we scale and the state of
the art is not that great right we've
got these super cool sites that are
excellent for your first programming
class right but not a lot of really good
online learning tools beyond that I
would argue so how do we scale up the
learning technologies so one answer is
so might met some the ex parte vision is
that when you have your students doing
these things what kind of higher level
metrics are there that we can monitor to
show the dashboard of their student
programming activity so one is instead
of seeing did you get your google a day
answer right maybe it's how are you
doing on the unit tests for this bigger
assignment and see you know this is sort
of what at least I understand Udacity
and Coursera are doing behind the scenes
right doing this analysis of student
activity after the fact but can we
integrate this into the teachers
dashboards in a real-time setting
especially for the real time is
important if it's a face-to-face
classroom and if not I think we need to
unfortunately take the good work that
these guys are doing in the proprietary
settings and democratize them and make
them available to all of the teachers
which is not yet done
there are a couple of interesting
specific efforts that are being done one
of my colleagues bill Pew some of you
may know him he had spent some time
spent some time at Google over the years
built a system that we've now used for
over five years at Maryland which is
this automated unit test server so when
the instructor makes an assignment they
can essentially supply the unit tests
with the assignment the student has a
button in the clip so they press the
button and boom it submits their
solution gets the unit tests run and not
only doesn't show you how you it shows
kind of both how you're doing and the
public tests but there's also all kinds
of motivation to encourage students to
not wait until the last minute because
it begins motivation is a huge issue and
students are very likely to do most of
their coding in the last 24 hours so
there's a bunch of tests that you can
only one run twice a day and so you have
to if you start earlier and assistant
and the assignment you least we'll get
you'll get more feedback there it also
has integrated code review so it has
support for some peer oversight of what
you're doing so that's kind of an
interesting tool up at least works in a
more automated way and has some bigger
scale that has not this kind of thing I
don't think it seemed really wide you
see yet a couple years ago and I taught
the intro class i was using submit
server and was great and i wanted to
have a little bit more social motivation
so i built a tournament server so the
idea was i made assignments that we're
two player games and if your student
solution passed all of the unit tests
than their student then their solution
got automatically entered into a
tournament the tournament would run
every 10 minutes and you have this
leaderboard showing what was going on
and you could dive into your name and
see a interactive history of the games
that your solution played against the
others so it was kind of fun and
motivating and would let you kind of see
what you how your system worked against
adversaries this was interesting so
going back to how well does this work
for women this worked incredibly well
Marvin Minsky's term for a few students
right or for some number of students
right I got emails in the middle of
Mexico by this is awesome you know I've
been working for
36 hours not number 2 i'm going to get
to number 1 and writers like yeah this
thing is really working great and i was
really excited until i did a survey at
the end of the semester and i found out
that half the students never logged in
to look at the tournament server right
so there's you know this very different
differing distribution and basically the
people are motivated by competition or
because they were doing really well
we're super excited and then there are
others that either weren't doing well
and didn't want to see where they were
or they just couldn't care less in fact
I what I had one actually chosen the
student but was a colleague of mine a
woman who was actually kind of mad at me
for doing this she was offended she
thought this was the antithetical to
teaching this was anti motivation this
would take all the good thing about
teaching which was you know learning for
its own sake and turn it on his head and
replace that with you know you know
American imperialist a competition she
was French but the but the point is that
there is a wide variety of motivations
and right things that work for some
groups don't work for other groups you
have to be really cautious about all of
these all these aspects all right so
I've got 15 minutes okay just enough
time so I'm going to just tell you very
briefly um so in them where am I going
with this two things so first of all I'm
building a new course has to be new so I
don't so I can start over and throw away
all the old stuff we're done and see
what can I do that's going to build on
top of all the things that we now know
and take advantage of these MOOCs and
hopefully do better so there are few key
characteristics for this course that I
think also have the potential for having
some more general utility the first is
like the MOOCs it's going to be
competency-based right our universe
these are time-based you take a take a
course for a semester and then you see
how well you do instead I'm going to
promise all of my students an a if they
complete or they can withdraw which has
all kinds of implications I'm going to
have milestones every few weeks and if
you don't pass your milestone then you
can't advance to the next mile
stone with that cohort and you sort of
fight stay behind sky can be a whole
bunch of like mini three mini courses
every few weeks it'll be flipped
classroom right it will have all of the
content online and this classes will all
be using doing some kind of activity
hopefully using technologies like X
party or whatever technologies right we
can come up with breaking students into
groups problem solving peer learning
right try and take the best of active
learning and see what we can do and it
brings up this really basic challenge
when I was starting to think about this
i emailed marcos dial and I said hey
Mark you know the master of all is can
you just tell me point me to what where
is the literature I'm having trouble
finding a literature on how people use
active learning in the classroom to
teach technical topics because this is
what we're all saying you should be
doing is it oh no there isn't any
there's a few ad-hoc things that people
are doing so that's kind of an
interesting interesting issue clearly
that we need to do more of it I'm going
to pick a it can be very problem driven
since I've picking focusing on the
technology pick a fun problem have
students build simulations for
artificial life and environmental
simulation so they can build little
creatures that respond to whatever
rising water and then they're creatures
will start by running on their own
little simulations and when they get
good enough then they will interact with
others in this world and one of the
lessons I've learned is it can't only be
you know competitive fighting it metrics
there have to be cooperative metrics as
perhaps being the primary thing to
motivate people are going to have going
to have the same kind of issues again
the obviously the tools will be they'll
be building Python on the back end I'll
provide web-based front end things so
will be interactive and visual it'll be
mobile have your your little creatures
connect to the real world so you can
control them by texting so anyway it's
going to be a fun thing to do this is my
spring project to see if I can develop
this course so hopefully in little while
you'll submit the game you play that
in sports they all know this that the
challenges you put everybody in one pool
and you get the same thing if you had
that you know if you think of the sport
and you're playing one-on-one basketball
but reality is the problem is they're
all in the same pool and you know
there's one thing about competitiveness
but I do think the other challenges it's
a single winner and it's all in a common
pool right as it goes having much
smaller cohorts yeah where there is some
sense of relation yeah so that's a good
idea so maybe there should be multiple
levels you start off in your own world
and then you get to pick your friends
and maybe you work in a world of three
or four people and it grows and maybe
eventually get to their broader world
people they want to be in that you know
or bigger bowl yeah yeah all right good
point I think sort of figuring out these
these this dynamics of how you get the
students to work together even if it's
just there's students systems working
together is important ok I've got 10
minutes I want to do one last activity
if you've got your got your computers so
while I've been here for a week I've
slightly against my better judgement
builtin little experimental prototype
that we're all going to try and I want
to you know I told you some examples of
some of my favorite teachers and why
they were so good for me I want to
understand what some of your favorite
teachers were and why or not who they
were but why they were your favorite
teachers what made your best
face-to-face experience is so good and
so what you're going to see when we go
to this tool is actually I'm going to
need to activate it just a second you do
have to log in with Google
authentication and I'll show you what
this looks like
well I don't care what you use but you
mean I will see your ID but nothing more
than that so you should see something
like this it should work ok on mobile
you're just going to ask ask a question
and then what we're going to do is I'm
going to be able to now show you this I
cannot you can end you can enter things
multiple times no one's there yeah
people able to log in ok so we're going
to go through a couple steps you can
enter multiple things if you have
multiple favorite things oh wait there
we go actually I make a little bigger we
can see I what you're finding and then
I'm assuming we're going to get a lot of
things here and then we'll do a little
group analysis of see if we can figure
out are there any classes of things that
made them work or not work I'll give you
a couple minutes to enter things
apologized for those on mobile phones or
any other kind of phone mobile phone you
really apologize the rotary dial
you
so I apologize for displaying email
address I'm just displaying nicknames
i'm not sure why sometimes nickname show
up as email addresses yeah that's
strange i don't i don't understand that
apparently all right i'm hearing the
amount of typing noise decrease alright
so now we're we're going to do is we can
read through these but i want to see if
we can collectively look at these and
see if we find any way to cluster them
so i wrote a lame cluster textual
cluster analysis myself and then you
guys are going to help me say will break
them to three clusters and we'll try
that okay oh yeah you can see this
yourself correct there was a link in the
bottom of that page and now so we can
see a tag cloud and then what i'm going
to do is I'm going to give you a new
activity which is we can now I'm gonna
sign you each to randomly to one of
these three clusters and now if you
click on that on that you should now see
have a new button that says start
tagging on the bottom of your screen and
then you'll get one of the clusters and
I'd like you to try and read the items
in your cluster and see if you can write
a word or two that describes what those
that sort of characterizes those items
in that cluster recognizing that the
clustering is not perfect and there's
not enough data to really put these
things together so maybe this will work
or maybe this won't
and then as you type in your tags they
should show up over here and we'll see
if we can come up with any collective
agreement don't let the tags on what the
tags are for these so I'm starting by
not showing you what the tags are that
you type yet I'll show those in a minute
I thought so you're not too influenced
by what other people are doing i'll let
you spend a minute or two writing your
own tags independently then i'll let you
see the other people's tags and we
cannot you should have a button on the
bottom of your screen that said start
tagging oh sorry correct on the first on
the first screen in the first screen
that's what it was thanks design bug
yeah so you've been given one cluster
one so one of the things we can see here
is how much agreement there is it's kind
of like ESP game or Google Image labeler
right actually I'm I thought there might
be no agreement at all so I'm happy that
there's Lisa two tags that people have
agreed with
all right i'll give you another minute
then we'll look at the tags and see if
it made any sense and of course the
point of this is not that the my
clustering algorithm is surely
particularly poor because I did it in a
few hours but the point is right if
you've got a classroom of students that
are trying to you know think about
something together then how can you what
are the tools that we might be able to
develop that we might develop to
collectively learn from each other and
think about what's going on all right so
let's see what's what these are so this
group said there was experienced stories
approach real-life anecdote spectacle
passion anecdotes real worlds similar
passionate so it's capitalization I
didn't all right I clearly ok fair
enough Touche ok Carrie wow so this is
definitely a different feel between
these clusters and there's someone
there's definitely some consistency here
personal goals social personal caring
what is that your tag went to their own
cluster really really did they all did
everybody does it all go up one mile Phi
1 but I'm not by one bug but how could
there be did everybody's appear in the
wrong one wrapped around that's a very
weird off by one bug but alright well
yes okay so but I this is technical
post-mortem is interesting but not the
point we on all three clusters there's
some at some agreement clusters weren't
very good to begin with there were
several things that talked about real
life experience in all of them and sell
them they had passion in all of them
that probably should have been clustered
together yeah other than where they were
at entirely I don't do synonyms or in
grams or anything it's just just just
words so that's pretty much this I'm
kind of done with my part for today that
so that I guess the point I want to
leave you with is not so much as an
answer as a question which is awkward or
maybe you can give me more answers how
do we how do we want our will to go
forward we're the designers of our new
world right we can make a world where we
get rid of our traditional universities
and do online only that's easy right
that's going to be the natural outcome
or we don't do anything for that we'll
just follow the lawyers they apparently
have thirty percent decreased
applications and law schools this year
compared to last year or we can say no
there is really in face-to-face
universities let's figure out what we
want them to be right do we want to just
not do anything different at all that
seems like a path towards failure
because there are these real competitive
market forces or do we figure out how to
make university teaching better by
having I mean the pedagogy says that's
likely to be around more problem
centered in active learning and problem
centered design and more relationships
more people working together and do we
use technology to support that seems
less like likely to be part of the
equation and if so how so these are
right sort of some first experiments and
I welcome your thoughts about what we
might do going forward so that I think
I'll stop and take any questions or and
I think it's time for discussion if
anybody wants hang around so thanks so
let's thank our speaker thank you yeah
so been several times in your talk you
talked about sort of the premise that
loops are
going to be as good as face-to-face
education wait no I did I say that wow I
can all right no I think I said they're
providing competitive pressure I don't
think I don't think they're as good and
its peril still figure out what you mean
they're not going to you I'm not going
to describe your challenging the
assumption that it could be I think
they're better at what their trade offs
there are better in some ways and worse
than other important ways to bring you
to was a step away from the premise that
are trying to be as good as face-to-face
education for a second okay let's just
assume that is going to be worse the
question is how much worse right and
also whether to trade off is reasonable
i think you were already stepping toward
that direction which is anticipating my
question I think there's a interesting
interaction with sort of a policy
question about what the goal of the
education is because as a as a engineer
at Google I'm I imagine saying you know
what I don't care about training 20,000
programmers I care about training 2,000
really really good ones right so
depending on your goal you might be that
if if your goal is equality that
everyone has access and everyone is at
least at a certain competency then
perhaps online looks are the right
solution but if your goal is to train
those two thousand really really good
ones it seems like exactly the wrong
thing to do so have you thought about
what is the these kinds of interactions
with what the real goal of University
information is supposed to be well I
guess I'm not even convinced I mean I
guess I'm motivation issue i think is
huge I don't think there are many people
that will be able to teach themselves a
full discipline entirely on their own
what you disagree yeah
very few people can do that yeah and but
nevertheless you could easily see the
market forces that kind of make
traditional universities be so be priced
out of only be available to the two
thousand but the thing is it's not two
thousand verses twenty thousand that's
actually not real estate it's like we
need 200,000 programmers palpably in
this right I mean we need vast vast
amounts of and that's just programmers
we need vast we need everybody educated
right we really want to get one hundred
percent maybe fifty percent of the
people educated right so I'm not
convinced that the online stuff is good
enough to get even our lower our lower
levels I think we may need the community
colleges which may be the first ones to
go to get the larger numbers of our
students my fear is that the peat that
that that the MOOCs may actually be
elitist it's in a strange kind of way
like that they'd aunt dance has been
doing this power MOOC can I've been
seeing some of these students that come
and take his class and they're like
remarkable and this one woman like
really blew me away she was from called
in from Ecuador to office hours she
sells flowers she wanted to learn to
become a better searcher in order to
basically increase her business so that
she could find where the flower shops
are in big cities and other countries so
that she could you know basically find
them and address them and sell to them
Charlie she's like I'm just a flower
seller neuqua door add but clearly a
super entrepreneur a very good
communicator had good technology you
know so she's someone that's going to
succeed because of this stuff and it's
an opportunity that you wouldn't had
otherwise you know so this is like what
we all like to raise the flag and say
wow what the world is so wonderful you
know that you know here's this person
that's having this incredible
opportunity that wouldn't have otherwise
and it's true but there's probably
another flower seller that didn't think
of going to this you know this thing and
even if they thought about it might not
have had the capacity to figure out how
to do it unless they already had
finished their undergraduate degree and
had enough training to to get there so I
kind of kind of rambling but I'm not
quite sure
that the premise of your question is
right it may actually be the exactly
reversed human named you had a comment
about this question so you mentioned
this long history of different kinds of
education paradigms and technologies is
there any study to the results of say or
simple statistics things like opening
universities and other types of kind of
universities impunity for success mean
on these issues who do they work for
what kind of students are they were all
successful their students are no I guess
I don't really know little bit about its
associated open university in the UK and
they were able to bring sort of a
classic education for university using
their model which is somewhat different
than these but same kind of distance or
anything and they also had kind of a big
following you know start with a hundred
thousand and graduate 50,000 by the end
of before your period but that's a
remarkable number where do you think
about it in some sense I think this is a
red herring to worry about the fall off
fish it's the total number of graduating
at the end Open University has changed
the patient education UK substantially
by increasing participation rate among
stay-at-home moms for example who would
never otherwise the Chancellor Nick so
it really changed the class structure of
Education key in UK oh well I have to
agree with you i mean i agree that
looking at the overall impact the number
of graduates is this is crucial and
that's 50,000 new students that did
wouldn't have graduated it's fantastic
but that doesn't mean that you can shut
everything else down right that we are
society Liz you know the sway society
works as their ecosystems and we have
quite lots of different kinds of
learning environment so that's 50,000
students that might not have gone to
school you know graduated but there's a
whole bunch of other students for which
this doesn't work so if it fit fills in
the niche right if it fills in
part of this you know trade-off space
that supports a set of students that
wouldn't have been supported otherwise
and that's great right but my fear is
that if it pulls people away from other
things because it's so much cheaper and
it provides lesser quality then you
actually have a hard time finding your
2,000 top super example in China the way
enter University that was a year that
had previously 10 years of closure of
the universities so there was 10 years
of backlog so reportedly flying 100
people coming in that year so there's
lots of people who were qualified and
wanted to have a higher education
couldn't remember I actually had a
so-called CCTV University this Chinese
central television network is the
University may offer University classes
and I actually know even a personal
friend who went to that kind of
university I don't know how successful
you will be they are usually but but
probably had the same impact that is
door people who at least felt like they
had some version of a higher education
that they wouldn't otherwise have had my
friend who went to today's president of
a major investment bank so maybe they
have a role to play yeah clearly there's
a role for this I just want to don't
want black magnum I guess I gotta sleep
my job to write try and protect so maybe
this is just maybe this is all just
protectionism right in the disguise of
you know quality but i just think so i
guess two issues one is i want to think
about what do we want our society to be
and my gut says we probably don't want
to shut down on universities and I in
order to do that in order to not do that
I think we need to think about what is
the value of universities and be more
clear about what is that they do and how
to make them better right so so part of
this is right just me think trying to
think about that and try out some small
experiments on how do we where do we
where are the places where we can take
advantage of
technology to potentially improve
education maybe these are likely these
are not the answer but there are weeks a
week's effort I mean try in a different
direction okay because I think we can
talk about educational policy forever
and we'll be here for another 30 minutes
if you just stay on that top there what
one thing I really enjoyed in your class
today like you're doing is the
interactive aspect of it easy the lesson
here seems to be something about
engagement right and the the key that
you open up with was motivation one of
the things I thought was particularly
intriguing several of the tools that you
showed was this continuous feedback and
I noticed a little bit of this weird
tension just me trying to use it in in
your experiment essentially which is
there's this tension between me paying
attention to my own task versus pay
attention to water people are doing I
was wondering as a CI expert if you
would want to talk a little bit about
this design tension and how have you
tried to deal with that so excellent
question to first of all you absolutely
completely right in fact when dan and I
did a some studies with ex parte this
summer with a student that was visiting
for the summer Mike Goebbels we very
much ran into that same tension in that
if you know it's kind of just you know
in the same we're saying we're designing
this tool because we want students to
pay attention to with the rest of the
things other people are doing but if the
students are paying attention to what
they're other people are doing then
they're not paying attention to their
primary task which is to do their own
work into it to think right and if
they're not paying attention to
everybody else then what's the value
right so so one answer is that this is a
fundamentally bad idea that's right
fails either one way or the other you
can choose you can choose your failure
mode and so that's why I had a back-up
plan which is a classroom management
right
the teacher does have to pay attention
to what the class is doing so so at the
very least the teacher can use this as a
way to see what the class is doing while
they're doing and then use that to
direct the teachers attention how
they're going to you know interact with
individuals and so on in this particular
case I obviously wanted to also
demonstrate the concept so I wanted to
show it to you but I I do think there's
a tension spect so that's why in this
particular case I started off by hiding
the labels on the tags right so even
though you could see that something was
going on that was supposed to be like
the fun factor and for people that
didn't have laptops or computers they're
not just sitting there twiddling their
thumbs for three minutes but at least
they can have something to look at and
then when it's time to say okay now
you've done some work let's look and see
what's going on so so this was a you
know not very sophisticated but a design
for that particular problem that's also
why we started by having the aggregate
view on the teachers display and the
teacher can choose what to display or
knotts display to the students right I
showed it to everybody in the classroom
but I obviously didn't have to show it
to you I could have said do your work
for 10 minutes and then afterwards we'll
all go look at it our class right now is
we have something analysis to this which
are the farms so we have people
commenting on solving the problems in
the forums and it has a similar kind of
tension should I be solving the problems
or should I be paying attention to
people solving talking about saw your
hands sorry so it's analogous very much
our thing that was scattered over hours
all right it's not synchronous that's
less than this well it's not just that
it's not synchronous it's over a longer
period so you can spend 30 minutes
working at our problem and then spend
five minutes which even doing the
contacts test not the actual test right
choice and so when you're doing this in
the space of three minutes is it
different
attention right it's like I only have a
few seconds how do i switch in my class
it's not such a big deal to people it
for a couple hours nanotech so I think
there's not just the sink ways it's time
pressure and this is time for sure my
class is not yeah so one of those things
that strikes me is I took a distance
learning in class university Minnesota
9091 we're there we have news groups we
had mailing list videotapes so there's
nothing new Under the Sun is that where
you say no it's just that it's always
worked for the same type of people so
you're talking about these ten percent
of the ten percent those people have
always been able to do this for the last
20 years you've been able to take a
class remotely how are we going to get
the other ninety-nine percent this
clearly doesn't work for them we've been
trying essentially this exact thing for
29 well increase the amount just like
you know videos are more accessible than
texts and certain so I think we it's not
that you know the number of people will
increase but I my gut says it's still
going to tend to be a minority and how
are we going to get those other people
just this fundamental style of learning
doesn't work are you seeing anybody kind
of trying to like directly say why
doesn't this work for you what can we
think how would you learn well and maybe
that you know this I mean I think MOOCs
are probably here to stay but maybe
universities really are here to stay to
it may be that that MOOCs are really a a
small minority of people and a
relatively small minority of subjects
for which they work well people
universities work for this also works
for i think that this more or less the
same people who can read a book on their
own are motivated can watch a video
there's more than ten percent of the
people in the country that can succeed
at the university are you claiming that
less people can do learn this method i
I've no idea that's what I'm saying have
you seen is anybody actually
deliberately going out to what about the
ten percent of the
other end well I had a little bit they
done that in one of the resounding
things it comes to that all the surveys
that we do on the MOOCs is people say i
would go to university but i can't for
financial reasons or tie reasons for
work reasons air so and that's the same
reasons that people in come here today
right most of you know it's exactly what
it's going to say yeah I mean there's
all these exogenous reasons right right
so those are people who don't get to
these other kinds of traditional
educational opportunities right and this
opens up yeah more people that maybe if
they work during the day another thing
what about the people that the ten
percent at the other end just this style
of learning beautiful you could argue
that they're also failing with
traditional classes i I'm saying exactly
that we are saying that are failing in
the university model or the MOOC model
they're all the same people why i'm
gonna type off the side I don't know
that that's true my suspect that people
I suspect that more people can succeed
at the University than in a MOOC because
I think that there is a lot of social
support and motivation the low cost of
entry of this style of instruction makes
it possible for a lot more people to try
it right okay and that's a that's a non
trivial thing the cost of getting ten
years is huge barrier privada well it's
always so I agree with you I think
there's an ecosystem is what he said
there's an ecosystem to get to a hundred
percent case but you know we get h %
more I mean that's an incredible feat
but some university people will say hey
I don't my MOOCs better than the
University I'm going to want to pay for
this I'll drop out and take the MOOC
other people will take a MOOC and say
wow this is fantastic I didn't know I
could do this I want to do this full
time when you're going to join the
University in the back
yeah looks like you're presented with
him and focusing on like online
education in the signing of university
or a professional training I mean just I
knowing like your take about the Royal
by education in setting out my high
school or imagery school where you might
be a much water audience so I mean I
think technology certainly has their
place but I think generally speaking the
younger you get the more these issues
become problematic in motivation and
focus right you know there are some high
school students that are capable of
learning independently and are motivated
enough to stay on task and to actually
get through a course but I think fewer
high school students than adults in
elementary school you know I think it's
a vanishingly small number so yeah I
mean they're already online or you know
combined online and combined high
schools in this country quite a few of
them I mean they're hundreds of
thousands of students now being educated
in an online or blended high school
settings our university is building one
in our new you know town high school is
going to be blended there's going to be
an online learning curriculum and you
know some of your stuff will be online
and well I know I don't know how well
it's going to work so I knew I guess I'm
not quite sure what how to answer you
except I think that all these issues are
the same by probably more so just copy
scenario when I say yeah the kids now I
love quickly like Smurfs smartphones and
computers and it grew up with smart
phones and they started hiring the
computers if everybody's a stage very
early age it's going to be computer
literate I like age of 6 5 or 6 i'm sure
computers will break hero in there you
know education growing up so I wonder oh
but if this people I know how to use the
technology doesn't mean that they have
the focus to work you know three to five
hours a week for 20 weeks right i mean
it's a right as a right to take what we
think of as art as a course or 10 weeks
or whatever is in our men
this amount of requires a tremendous
amount of follow-through that I think
most humans don't have without an
external force lies the argument that
you can make in a university study it
provides for them structure and that
force that causes you to stick with it
yeah all right maybe one more question
but yeah during your presentation you
mentioned that books all books have been
available for occur to you and yet
people go to actually to to watch these
MOOCs and videos online so I I don't
necessarily agree with the with the
assertion that hopes up that easily
elbow and I think one of the reasons
actually went moves are so popular is
because precisely because they're pretty
available both in the sense that they're
free actually there is easy access to
them but watching a video is actually a
hardly compares to reading a book is
like it seems to me just a one-time
thing after you watch to be even it's
difficult to search the video you cannot
use it as a reference up and of course
is over and a book seems like a thousand
times better to me than these videos so
and the same time books are not in my
opinion is fully accessible as the
videos in the MOOCs especially in
developing countries let's say are the
basic computer science textbook state
they cost over hundred dollars so wonder
if a lot of them are available you can
buy one as five years old for yeah yeah
for a few dollars but I agreed not in
this country not necessarily everywhere
although figure copies of Anand other
countries so going to developing
countries you come to even this and you
can it actually depends
so I wonder actually from master better
than most even is making actually a
major major folks in facebook says no a
smoke sorry but I think this goes back
to this you know what motivates people
to actually you know in deeply engage
for a long period of time and I just
think that fewer people have that you
may have the capacity to read a book i
personally barely do and i suspect most
people just don't I mean I mean so I
mean I agree with you about the quality
if for those people that are willing to
do it and follow through i just don't
think that most people do it's just you
know I mean the web has I mean if
there's anything that interface design
has taught us and especially the web is
that making lowering the barriers to
entry increases the number of people
that will participate you know the web
when the web came out it didn't add
anything new right there was already FTP
and gopher right and so when you know
web did not nothing new it just
increased the accessibility to existing
information yeah yeah mosaic mosaic had
not the web the mosaic added nothing new
HT blows HTML right it just as a
different file format and particularly
ugly one at that but it made it so that
a larger number of people could do a
particular kind of formatting that would
have been harder for them to do
otherwise and so what I think what the
MOOCs do is they just increase the
accessibility to the content it's not
that they couldn't reach it through
texts is just that the way that the
market works is that most people won't
same question for most why do people
actually sign up about
you can need to know that these moves
are online and things like this and it
takes to me that is pretty much the same
argument MOOCs are very widely available
so people will find a way to learn about
it about the final way actually to
organize meetups and social groups to
actually study in these mopes and so on
you books on that trailer go in
developing countries people find a way
to to use them it's not only physical
access to the books it's also that i'm
not sure what the word is it's the ease
of access right it's not when people had
mosaic right it made it easier for
people to do things and so more people
did it right if you have a grocery store
that's around your corner right you're
more likely to buy groceries someone's
selling drugs around your corner you're
more likely to buy drugs right i mean
just the way the market works you make
things easier to use but if you make
google search results a tenth of a
second faster google makes an extra
hundred million dollars right I so
there's all different kinds of ease of
access and the markets respond to that
but I'm saying it's not just the
physical books themselves the
information in a book is harder for most
people to to access by reading than by
watching a video book thing trust me
people who tried this the biggest
problem is copyright and publishers
trust for example a lot of the computer
science textbooks are available in India
printed differently on keeper paper and
all the stuff right you cannot import
those books and they're available for
like a dollar in India you cannot import
those books in the United States you
will get your rear end suit because
they're limited distribution so and so
that market force actually dominate our
participation you're right i mean if you
solve the first problem then you'd have
the second problem libraries been around
for a long time I don't see you know
spontaneous eruptions if you read it
with his experience love that
and so this other issue then where is he
said we got some would you quit it here
but we can hang around chat thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
