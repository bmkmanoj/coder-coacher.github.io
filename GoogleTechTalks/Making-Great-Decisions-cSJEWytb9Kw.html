my name is Adam lulav ski I'm an
engineer from the New York office and
I'm delighted to welcome you here I am
going to tell you something that's not
strictly true I'm a big fan of pair
programming which is true so I wanted to
get a book with two authors here so I
could invite invite them and get an
example of pair speaking but well you
know they say open with a joke doesn't
always work anyway without further ado I
give you David Henderson and Charlie
Hooper thank you well I guess I should
try my pair of joke I had a girlfriend
years ago and I'd say to her do you want
a pair and she said no I'll just have
one hello this is the book making great
decisions in business in life I'm an
economics professor at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey i'm also
a research fellow at the Hoover
Institution my colleague Charlie Hooper
was one of my star students of Santa
Clara University quite close to here 27
years ago so that's our little
background the phrase work smarter not
harder has been repeatedly ridiculed in
the dilbert comic strip not because it's
a bad idea but because its throne as a
dress as a brick to drowning employees
to tell someone to work smarter is like
telling him to be happier healthier or
wealth or wealthier it's not much help
just to repeat the objective what you
need is means of achieving the objective
our aim today and our aim in our book is
to help you achieve your objectives are
we right wrote the book to help those in
business and those in the business of
life in other words everyone to make
better decisions what we offer is both
simple and powerful a better way to look
at the world based on techniques we've
either discovered or learn from reading
other literature
who here has ever driven through the
corn country of Iowa or Nebraska all
right when you go and you you just drive
through it from a certain angle what you
see is this jumbled mass but then when
you get to a certain place you look down
you see these completely straight rows
well our book is the book to help you
see through the corn corn field of life
that once you apply these techniques you
find that some very apparently
complicated problems can actually turn
out to be relatively simple and
Charlie's going to start with one so if
you've ever seen the cover of our book
and if you haven't just look up on the
screen my brother Douglas took this
photograph in addition to doing work
like this he also does fine art
photography and wedding photography and
I know this might be surprising that i'm
actually related somebody with talent
but it's true and one of the wedding's
Douglas was photographing years ago was
at the Stanford faculty club and he was
preparing to photograph the remaining
elements of the wedding and that
included the garter toss and the bouquet
toss and the cutting of the cake so he
went over and talked to the wedding
couple and he said you know here's how
I'd like to do it here's the steps I'd
like to go through they said well that
sounds great but we're not gonna be here
hey so what if you know this is your
wedding you're the wedding couple
where's you goin and they said well you
know we thought we'd be done by now so
um you know we scheduled a limousine to
come pick us up and as soon as the
driver shows up we're going to leave and
that's because he's going to charge us a
fine of a dollar a minute if we don't
leave right then so think about this
they've planned for years for this event
they spent tens of thousands of dollars
they've invited hundreds of people to
their wedding and they're going to leave
early before they finish their their
wedding reception to avoid paying a fine
of a dollar a minute
I mean what were they thinking and maybe
they weren't thinking now if they
thought about it a little bit
differently maybe they would have come
to a different conclusion so somebody
could have come up to them said you've
already got the mariachi band the DJ all
the food the drinks everybody's happy we
could just extend your wedding for a
dollar a minute you know we can extend
it for an hour for a mere sixty dollars
which is a small fraction of what they'd
already paid or maybe somebody could
have said well let's just pass the hat
around and collect money from everybody
and just leave the limits limousine
drivers sitting out there for an hour
they would have had to collect 27 cents
from everybody at the wedding to make
this party go an hour longer the other
thing is maybe they could have called
the limousine driver and rescheduled and
they also didn't have to leave right
when the driver showed up maybe they
could have delayed at 15 or 20 minutes
to photograph some of those things and
then left so have they thought about it
differently they might have come to a
different conclusion and now I want to
tell another story from from my life I
call this story saving my father's life
I grew up in Canada and I've been in the
United States for virtually the whole of
my adult life in 1988 I got a call from
my cousin in Winnipeg that's near where
my father lives in Canada lived in
Canada and there was and he said My
father was suddenly in the hospital and
there was something about his tone that
made me wonder if he wasn't telling me
something I called the doctor and
finally I managed to drag out of the
doctor that my father had purposely
taken an overdose of sleeping pills and
I was puzzled I didn't understand why I
had talked to him two weeks earlier and
he'd seemed to be doing fine what had
happened so my next call was to the
airline and I went up to see my father
on the way up i had a very ambitious
plan it was to try to talk him out of
committing suicide but I realized there
are steps in that plan the first one is
to understand what happened what had
changed in two weeks that he had done
this because I didn't understand what
happened
why he was the way he was I couldn't do
anything so when I got there I found out
that he'd had these pains in his legs he
had polio during World War two maybe
there was a connection and he couldn't
imagine life without using his legs he
was a very active man he was 78 years
old he bicycle 20 to 30 miles a day
still he could not imagine life without
his legs so then the question I asked
was what if you could have some kind of
surgery so that you could use your legs
again would you want to live and he said
well of course and I said okay well then
that's the question we need to answer is
there a surgery so I go and find the
doctor as a small Hospital in small town
in Manitoba I find the doctor in five
minutes I found out yes there is a
surgery which by the way is something my
father had not even thought to ask now
as I said it's in Canada's there's a
little there's a little hitch here in
Canada they have socialized medicine
which means everyone lines up you have
to wait for surgery you have to get on a
waiting list and so the doctor said yes
there's a surgery but your father isn't
in serious enough shape to be at the top
of the waiting list so it might be
months or years so I've told my father
both pieces of news got him happy about
the first piece of news there's a
surgery unhappy about the second piece
and he said I don't know if I can wait
months or years well then there was a
new thought there's this country south
of here where you can actually pay for
health care and you don't have to line
up so i told them i bet you for twenty
thousand this is in nineteen eighty
eight dollars we can get surgery that
will fix it i'll come up next week and
drive we can drive you down to Grand
Forks or Fargo and we got it nailed my
father says yeah but 20,000 you know
that will reduce the amount i have to
leave to you and your sister
I mean he's got this house that's paid
for his retirement income exceeds his
expenditures even with him giving us
generous amounts of money every year and
he's worried about you know the estate
being twenty thousand less and I said I
think certainly speaking for myself I
can handle without the expert in so I
talked him into it and I had to walk him
through that reasoning by the way this
is one thing you'll notice when you
start applying these principles and I'll
get to the principles in a minute I had
to walk him through the reasoning again
and again through the weekend till by
the end he could recite their reasoning
to me because people get stuck in the
old ways people get sunk and you need to
keep pushing it's easy in the sense that
it's simple to apply these principles
it's not necessarily easy
psychologically but by the end of the
weekend I talked him into it and then
the kind of good news in a sense was a
situation got worse he went to the top
of the list and got his surgery in
Canada a week later so now from
Charlie's story and my story certain
principles emerge think back to the
wedding what were they telling
themselves they were saying I must we
must leave at five o'clock well there's
a novelist who wrote a novel in which
one of the character says the only
things I have to do in life the only
thing I have to do in life is die you
know everything else is a choice so
there are all these things we tell
ourselves we must do that we mustn't do
they didn't have to leave at five second
one think on the margin they put all of
this money into this wedding they've
planned it for months people have spent
we show a little calculation in the book
people have probably spent sixty
thousand dollars on the whole wedding
and the marginal cost of having an extra
hour of this wedding is sixty dollars do
you think that might be below the
marginal benefit
create better alternatives and Charlie
talk about some of the alternatives what
you could do you can hand out the Hat
you could do all these things in my
father's case the alternative to suicide
was surgery that's creating a better one
and then if he couldn't get a surgery in
can of the alternative was to have it
United States and think about what
matters in both cases the wedding what
matters sixty years from now if they
have a good wedding and by the way
they're not starting really well here
well they look back and say gee I'm so
glad we saved that sixty bucks even with
compounding you're not talking huge
numbers and so those are you know those
are some of the principles that emerged
from those two stories and what we're
going to talk about next to some of the
other principles so ask what changed
think value think arbitrage know what
you want before you choose and biases
affect the best of us now ask what
change is actually a very good principle
for clear thinking and I'm going to tell
you a statement and you're going to tell
me what's wrong with it okay fewer
people are attending major league
baseball games this year because
baseball is boring I think he's got it
okay I'm sorry okay well if you think
it's always been boring but it's a lorry
this year if you think was exciting last
year it's probably exciting this year
nothing's changed I mean baseball hasn't
changed maybe there's different players
in action and there was a strike or
something but just saying that doesn't
explain anything because it hasn't
changed so I want to give another
example I wrote a piece in the San
Francisco Chronicle back in nineteen
ninety nine at the time gasoline prices
had gone up in California by about forty
cents a gallon and if you looked at what
had happened to the price of crude in
that same time it had gone up if the
price of a barrel would translate into
only ten cents of that increase so why
the other 30 cent increase well people's
favorite explanations and there were
people writing editorials saying this
was that the oil companies were greedy
but that was the explanation now your
laugh and why
right because they're always greedy
right and by the way that doesn't
distinguish oil companies from drug
companies or Google I mean their goal is
to make money now Google does give a lot
of stuff away and thank you very much
for that I mean you've changed my life
in a positive way but the point is that
companies are out to make money so there
was no change in greed and in fact if
you had the greed explanation notice how
weird an explanation to be go to the
pump it's two cents less who they paint
a little less greedy go to the pump ten
cents more they got a little more greedy
uh-uh and in fact what I pointed out was
there been renewed refinery fine
refinery fires in California that meant
there was less supply and usually you'd
have arbitrage which we'll talk about a
little later where you would have fuel
coming in from other parts of the
country but because of EPA regs fuel
burned here can't isn't produced
elsewhere we got to have special a
special blend so the ask what changed
thing really applies to that another
alternative another principle is to show
you what it okay yeah is that to create
better alternatives and this is my
pillow story in fact we almost called
this book but it was too inside a joke
hard heads and soft pillows my wife
daughter and I were in Phoenix in 1994
and we were spending six days there over
thanksgiving week we woke up the first
morning and our next eight especially my
wife's in my next eight and we realize
it was these really hard pillows so we
have five more days in front of us so we
called around to all these hotels and
found out we could get an a different
hotel we'd pay at least forty dollars
more a night which is 200 more dollars
to us that was a lot of money in those
days and then we thought what I think
you're thinking
right and it was wait a minute our
problem is not with the hotel room it's
with the pillows so let's look into
pillows so went down to Sears on a
Sunday morning I lay down on the floor
trying out all these pills got the
top-of-the-line pillows for thirty bucks
each 90 bucks even if we gave him away
we were better off and in fact we
figured how to scrunch him into our
suitcase and so we created a better
alternative come up with you know buy
new pillows because that's what was
bothering us so we've told the story to
a number of people and just like
happened here people who buy new pillows
and they say it as if the solution is
obvious but is it obvious and what we
found is most of the time it is an
obvious to most people and it wasn't
obvious to Lance Armstrong now as
everybody knows he's the only time only
seven-time winner of the Tour de France
bike race and in his book it's not about
the bike he complains about the hotels
he stayed in and the food he was served
as he raced and trained throughout
Europe quote some of the motels we
stayed in made motel six look pretty
nice there were crumbs on the bare
floors hairs in the bed sheets to me the
meat was mysterious the pasta was soggy
and the coffee tasted like brown water
sounds like he's having a good time now
consider for a minute that Armstrong
lives in a 2.5 million dollar mansion on
a riverbank he lives in Austin Texas not
Mountain View California
he drives a Porsche and at the time this
was written he was making two million
dollars a year couldn't he buy his own
pillows couldn't he stay at better
hotels or eat a better restaurants or
give his cook more money to buy better
groceries so for perhaps a few thousand
dollars extra year Armstrong could have
been comfortable while he was earning
his millions so it certainly wasn't
obvious to Armstrong they won't have to
do it what everyone that's a good point
so you can't even get your own groceries
or you can't get University you've got
have your book but you cannot have you
you cannot you go that way your thing
real well guess what well get your name
and give you a little footnote in the
second editions it's a little less
cutlet nobody still could have gotten
good got back a better copyright better
groceries yeah better coffee right
photocopy yeah i think this not about
the book was written before you know
kind of earlier in his career but that's
a very good point good point yeah so i
want to get to another principle if you
could show her little principles again
no principles oh yeah i think value
think about what's value and one of the
things i want to highlight in this is
the value of time and by the way every
story we tell in the book is a true
story unless we say otherwise and in the
book we say we're making the story out
but ninety-five percent of the stories
are true and if they aren't we say so
and this is a true story a friend of
mine an economist invited a Nobel Prize
winning economist to his school to give
election and my friend went to pick him
up at his hotel and the economist and
and they were running a little late as
it was and they had to go to the
president the university's house for a
nice dinner little socializing and then
the talk and
when he picked him up this Nobel
prize-winning economist said I've got
this just raging headache and my friend
says okay let's stop in the little drug
store in the lobby of the hotel gets you
get you some aspirin so they look at the
aspirin and this economist says 495 a
bottle at home I pay 250 let's go to
another drug store my friend was looking
at his watch and saying but he figures
out a solution I'm going to make up a
name this isn't the name because I
promised I would never tell the name
this is your lucky day Gunther I'm going
to buy the aspirin now do you notice
anything ironic about that story given
that was about a Nobel Prize winning
economist he should have been the one to
point that out and by the way I don't
want to dump too much on them and fat
there's another point to make which is
that we can all do it we can all make
these mistakes I brought a novel up here
to read last night and I noticed it's
overdue two days ago and I thought 25
cents a day you know I think I can
handle that you know why do a side trip
to the library and the way up here so
think value another one is think
arbitrage in our lives there are often
arbitrage opportunities that present
themselves well sometimes they don't
present themselves sometimes you have to
notice them and again I want to tell
story of a colleague of mine who since
retired named Parker who when he was 17
did this he was sailing off Long Island
this was in the late 40s and he was just
thinking about things his father was in
the minerals industry was in mining so
things like prices of minerals were
discussed around the dinner table we had
just got out of the Second World War the
price controls on all these things had
come off and the price of live lead had
shot up he realized he was sitting on a
lead keel and when he did the math he
figured out his lead kill was
worth more than he'd paid for the whole
boat so he pulled the lead khilaf took
it to a lead deal or sold it so put on
iron keel on the boat did full
disclosure revealed to the buyer that
it's an iron it won't be as good sold
that boat and thought wait a minute I
can do that again so he bought another
one and did it another way I did it hold
did a whole bunch of them during the
summer the 17 year old kid he arbitrage
he moved resources from lower valid uses
to higher values 'as kind of like using
unused time at the nasa airfield for
example and which was great by the way i
don't know why people are dumping on
that and i was at his retirement party
and i reminisced about this story and
I'd never heard him tell how much money
he'd made doing this this is in 1948 he
made twenty thousand dollars in nineteen
forty eight dollars that was you know
triple the the median income of a family
in those days do you want to just offer
inflation there yeah I did that what
would you do is twenty that was like two
hundred thousand here's some 300 300
thousand three one thousand today's
dollars yeah so nice money and you okay
thanks David um now what is the main
measure of success for any business
I'm sorry yeah profitability right
profitability ok so I'm a consultant
sorry so how successful would I be if I
came in Google and said I got this great
idea let's increase profits ok I'm gone
I wouldn't get very far right that's
because this is like the brick lifesaver
the David mentioned in the beginning you
know you're throwing a brick lifesaver
to somebody you know grab onto this it's
like it doesn't help because all we're
doing is repeating the objective we're
not actually helping you achieve that
objective so people who thought about
this they've realized yeah I can't go in
and just tell them to increase their
profits I need to do something more so
they think ok now what our profits no
profits of revenues minus expenses well
tell them to reduce their expenses yeah
that's a good idea reduce your expenses
well what am I going to tell them about
revenues ok well revenues see how do
your revenues well you have good cuz you
know products and services and your
customers like them and they buy them
and they're happy and they just went
down the sequence of kind of logical
steps and they ended up with the thing
we've all heard which is treat the
customer as if the customer is always
right so I don't know if you've ever
seen you know some people have posters
up on their office wall and it's rule
business rules number one the customer's
always right number two if the customer
is wrong see rule number one this is
kind of ingrained in our society and
when i worked at Syntex in palo alto
years ago the HR people thought that we
needed to be better with customer
service so they told us the following
story this older woman walks in a
nordstrom store and says I've got four
car tires that I don't want anymore and
I'd like to return them well Nordstrom's
doesn't sell car tires and Nordstrom's
doesn't sell any automotive equipment
norris terms is a prestigious retailer
of fine women's and men's clothing with
very good customer service and a great
returns policy well now the question is
is what did the clerk do well in
true to form you know she's a
quintessential Nordstrom clerk clerk so
she took the car tires and gave the
woman a store credit but now we have to
ask the question is the customer always
right I mean is it possible that they're
wrong and what I'd like to do is tell a
story from my business and my company is
objective insights so when we get
projects we try to provide objective
insights so we had this project with the
small young company and they developed a
novel formulation of a corticosteroid
now corticosteroids aren't new and many
of you have applied one to your skin for
dermatitis or psoriasis is normally like
a cream or a salve but this company
developed a novel formulation they were
very excited about and the CEO reasoned
that the market in this country for
corticosteroids with 630 million dollars
a year back then so he thought if our
product is so good we should be able to
get two hundred million dollars to that
at peak revenues so we said okay sounds
like an interesting project we took it
on and we really looked into it as we
always do and we came up with objective
insights this is not an ad by the way
kind of so-so but one of the insights we
came up with was that this product was
exciting because it was a novel
formulation but that also meant that it
was pigeon-holed into a very small
subset of the market so when we went
presented our results to the management
team in the CEO our objective insights
we told them that the peak sales for
this product wouldn't be 200 million
like they thought it would be go 17
million well the CEO wasn't very happy
about this and he yelled at us and then
he kicked us out of the boardroom and I
think it goes without saying goodbye
client goodbye future business and they
never called us back
now years later this product did launch
and we tracked its history and we looked
at how how much it sold and whenever we
present the forecast for a new product
we present a probabilistic range now our
midpoint of that range was eight percent
too low so the product it a little bit
better than we thought so here's here's
our estimate the product did a little
bit better but the CEOs estimate was a
thousand percent too high so i would say
that we had better objective insights
than he had now years later when he
realized that we were right and that we
presented objective insights you know i
would have thought that he would have
sent flowers or something but they never
quite happened so now the question is
was this customer happy no certainly not
did we do the right thing yes we did and
we've since done it other times because
if we kowtow to a customer's
unreasonable expectations we see well we
lose our reputation and we cease
providing a service a valuable service
to our reasonable customers and our
unreasonable ones it's a deal of going
back to David our little gimmick thing
later um yeah and so by the way just one
thing if the customer always right there
wouldn't be Google I would have thought
of this in fact I used to think I almost
I guess I'll confess this I used to
right column for red herring that's not
the confession by the way but I found
google so useful starting around 99 2000
and I thought how they going to make
money that I almost contacted google to
offer that i calculated that my gain
from google was about two thousand
dollars a year and i almost contacted
google to offer to pay them five percent
of that annually because i didn't think
they could make money and and to even
write an article for free on their
website telling everyone else wise they
should do the five percent so it shows
what I knew about Google so bad to the
customer always being right there's a
company called best buy i'm sure you
always heard of it you've all heard of
it
that realizes the customers not always
right and in fact they have divided
their customers into what they call
angels and devils the angels are the
easy to deal with customers they come in
they get the product they like it
they're planning to keep it the Devils
are people who do things like buy it
bring it back the next day and get a
refund come back the day after that and
buy it as an out-of-the-box special of
fifteen percent off you know that kind
of thing and so they divided their
customers into angels and devils for a
hundred of their 671 stores and when we
wrote the book those hundred stores were
doing much better than the other 571 and
so the point is the customer is not
always right and that leads to a
something Charlie wants to talk about
yeah so that's a good segue into another
principle which is that we bring up in
the book which is called factor 16 now
many people have heard of or familiar
with Pareto's law wilfredo Pareto was in
a con italian economist like 150 years
ago who came up with this law of income
distribution and his law said that
twenty percent of the people a small
group create eighty percent of the
income and eighty percent of the people
create twenty percent of the income now
people in this country these days are
worried about income distribution and
everything but as you can see it's not
an American phenomenon nor a modern one
goes back to Italy 150 so years ago now
as we point out in our book this applies
to a lot more than just distribution of
income and as David mentioned with best
buy twenty percent of their angels or
their angels twenty percent of their
customers create about eighty percent of
their profits and on the flip side
twenty percent of their Devils you know
their customers who are Devils create
eighty percent of their problems now
in our book what we do is we take it to
the next logical step which is if you
have this relationship twenty percent
create eighty percent eighty percent
create twenty percent we come up with
factor 16 these people in this group are
16 times as productive as the people in
the eighty percent group so let's say
you have a pharmaceutical product that
is sold by a prescription and you're
going to promote it to doctors who do
you promote it to you go to the doctors
the really prolific ones who write
eighty percent of the prescriptions and
there's only twenty percent of them so
it's easier to get it and there were 16
times as much am I going to do the next
um yeah okay now I want to do something
that involves you a little more I'd like
two volunteers on the prizes five
dollars it's not one of these phony
things where you give it back at the end
of the talk you know you really get to
keep it so do i have two volunteers all
right what's your name Charles and
Richard okay so we chose a number in
advance we just Charlie have this little
rutten random generator thing and to
choose a number between one and ten and
so I'm going to just have Richard go
first and we know the number remember
you okay we know the number uh what's
your guess and you and the closest one
gets the five dollars three
but the number seven number was seven
now good for him okay the point is that
if you hear three your best response
then should be to choose for because you
get everything above four and four
whereas if you chose say something like
seven you know you'd be well a separate
was it cuz if you chose something like
one you'd be really way off if you chose
but what if he had said nine he would
have got it and we were going to run
this experiment a bunch of times but we
didn't bring that many fives and also we
don't have that much time so here's the
point he made a good choice but what if
it had been what if the number had been
nine and he said nine he would have won
the five dollars he would have had a
good outcome but he would not have made
a good decision the good decision is the
one you ought to make again and again
not the one you got lucky with there's
this old saying in sports it's better to
be lucky than good no you should be good
and hope for luck you can't plan on luck
that's why it's called luck and and so
the point is you've got to distinguish
between good decisions that get
sometimes bad results and bad decisions
that occasionally get good results
that's a very important distinction to
make do you actually want to show that
oh yeah so we chose um actually since
you generated you wouldn't walk them
through it yeah so we happen to have an
example with with three is the first
number that's picked so let's say
Richard dick Richard Wright pick 3 which
he did and Charles picked one now
there's some probability eleven percent
the Charles would still win because one
I don't know and he would win two would
be a tie and then he would lose if it
was four five six seven eight nine ten
and three you can't pick it again so he
would lose if it's one
and that's one number out of nine so
it's eleven percent to would win if it's
too or 14 would win if it's five six
seven eight nine ten or four and and ten
would win if it's seven eight nine ten
so it's four out of nine so the point
here is the highest probabilities for
which is what Charles picked and and he
won but he could have picked this one
now would have been a very good decision
and he could have lost there's a
27-percent twenty-three percent chance
he could have lost now he could have
picked this one and still won there's an
eleven percent chance you could one so
when you when people judge decisions
based on the outcomes they're not
judging the decisions they're judging
the outcome and to really know if
somebody made a good decision you need
to look at it this way and see what they
were deciding between right guy said one
thing sure Richard let's say you don't
now that we've gone through that and you
don't know it's three okay what would
you say now is the number fire bingo you
got it and then he would have happy in
the second not that I've picked three
imparted to
shortly I think the second guy we didn't
make clear did we we did not make clear
hear what he said being the second guy
given that that Richard chose three
could I be the second guy and choose
three and pocket half of it we didn't
make the rules clear but I guess it
didn't matter no he's not saying would
have been a good choice it's just in
retrospect right it depends if I know
you're absolutely right a dollar would
risk seems better risk we didn't say the
rules but the rules are you can't pick
the same number but what you could do is
agree with him that we'll split it
regardless yes yes and then you have
guaranteed two and a half the question
over there should be point seven eight I
think yeah seven-ninths you only got
nine to choose from so it's 79 yeah when
we should have round it off yeah this
should be point seven eight point six
seven point six seven yeah sorry about
that so the intelligent
okay way sharpen audience from the
fortune 500 firm we gave this yeah well
not that you guys aren't but the fortune
500 management we gave it to ya we gave
we gave this to the management team of
this company and they were just being so
obtuse i'm dave and i are looking at
each others like where's the hidden
cameras or something okay now who here
has a list of to do items you know honey
do list at home that's just like so long
and you keep doing stuff and you never
get to the bottom Ryan I mean I do
sounds like everybody does and it work
to the same thing happens at work you
know I've got this huge long list I
never get to the bottom one okay this is
what we call a Productivity table and
this can help you figure out what to
spend your time on what's most valuable
for you to spend your time and a couple
of ground rules if your daughter breaks
her leg go to the emergency room you
don't need to do this if you promise to
be in court on Tuesday go to court on
Tuesday you don't need to do this and if
you're just thinking should I spend two
minutes and check my email you're just
gonna check your email anyway don't do
this so this is kind of for bigger
things and what we did here is we just
kind of put down some things that were
on our list you know select the best
child the best school from the best
child like this
with the value be higher you know place
ads for an old car do some tree trimming
you know fixing some boards on my deck
things like that the next column we put
how long it's going to take and then for
some of these things there's a penalty
if you don't do it well so if I don't
fix the boards you know somebody might
trip or fall through and have some kind
of a problem so that would be a penalty
and then there's also rewards so for
example if you know I make do my
investments and I get a higher rate of
return you know there's some reward
there so this is what you put in the
table and then what we do is we look at
the the weighted return which is just
the reward basically press plus the
penalty and then we divide it by how
many hours it's going to take and even
if this is just as far as you get what
you notice is that some of these have
way higher value per hour than some of
the other ones so right there that tells
you maybe you should be working on the
higher value ones at least first but
there's one thing we left off here which
is that life is probabilistic it's not
deterministic so i might not fix the
boards on the deck but i might never
have a problem too so now we're going to
do to make it a little bit more
complicated so we're going to put some
probabilities in so let's just say i
assign a probability fifty percent that
somebody's going to trip and hurt
themselves now you might disagree with
these numbers and that's fine you put
your own numbers in here these are these
are our numbers but now what we do
instead of just taking the the return of
the reward plus the probability we take
the prime the the penalty the reward and
the penalty we take the probability
weighted total return so we multiply the
penalty times its probability plus the
reward times its probability and get
that and then what you see here's a way
to return and here's the weighted value
per hour and what you'll notice is
there's this huge difference here
so this one looking at my investments is
worth 2500 an hour who here makes twenty
five hundred dollars an hour we thought
there'd be a bunch so this might be the
best one to do first but even the lowest
one which is twenty-five dollars an hour
that's still a reasonable return it's 11
hundred as much so if I'm going to do
something maybe I should do my
investments first and then my tree
trimming only after I've done the other
things yeah so what if you think about
security features with a car that
potentially could save a lot but at a
very small change knowing that life has
probably infinite payback how would that
be better than this is never utopian
functions I understand further than the
the outcome expected value would be
listing would be like zero zeros your
Walker said you're right of the
probability can I just well we actually
cover that exact topic page 55 in the
book but okay I just want to say that
you're right on the probability and
you're right that if someone and the
experiment I do with my students I said
I come in with a loaded gun you know six
chambers all loaded I aim it you know to
a two feet from you i'm a don't have to
be a really good shot what do i have to
pay you to take that shot and of course
i get the answer infinity almost always
interestingly a student from a very poor
country i teach military officers said
if he by if i made it 10 million he
would do it because he'd have that to
leave to his very poor kids but the
typical answer is infinity and as you
say a finite number times infinity is
finite but here's the thing and we're
taking a small probability of dying and
if we look at the way we behave we treat
those probabilities of dying as finite
in the sense that we have to be paid
only a finite amount to take them so
economists have looked at what extra
wage do people make to take risky jobs
and they can back out of that what we
call the value of a statistical life and
then you just would put that number in
there and wait it and so on well and
that's one answer another answer I went
to Stanford for grad school and I
studied under raat Ron Howard not not
the actor happy days brilliant guy but
he came up with this concept called
microboards now you would never sell
your whole life well most people
wouldn't just because you wouldn't be
able to enjoy the money you got but we
sell little bits of our lives every day
you sold a little bit of your life when
you drove here today in your car because
there was some risk and so what am I
chrome Ward is is you take little tiny
increments of risk and you sign a price
to it so micro mort is a 1 and a 1
million chance of dying so now if i buy
a safe car or by an unsafe car i'm
paying more mike remorse to buy the
unsafe car and there's a price to that
and let's say you put a price of 20
million dollars on your life each
michael moore it would be twenty dollars
and you can actually calculate if you
want to go through it we give a little
example in the book that that depending
on how long you keep that unsafe car how
much you're paying in terms of
microboards versus the more expensive
car we have one more oh yeah five
minutes go you never see Kennedy's lift
so you get something that's low value we
never going to get so that's a very good
point and and you shouldn't yeah you
shouldn't be you're never gonna get to
it what's the alternative you get to it
but you didn't do one of the higher
value things and then as you say create
other alternatives hire someone to do it
so I hire a gardener for example yeah
things that have an intangible benefit
like I want to spend eight hours I'm
gonna go fishing right because it has
you know some other intangible benefit
and you would just try to come up with
some to make this work you would come up
with some monetary value of the fishing
you know what what's the value would i
pay 500 for the fishing you know stuff
like that yeah I mean these these are
just values we assign so like if
painting your house was up here you know
how much would you pay right now if
somebody just said tada your house is
painted you know and that's maybe the
valued put up there
okay another principle we'd like to talk
about is that biases affect all of us
we're basically all biased and once we
know that then we can make better
decisions because we realize we're
biased and the problem is is that people
for mental models about the world but
our bias perceptions go into those
mental models and so we might build the
wrong mental model or come up with the
wrong conclusion so here's an example
years ago I was talking with a female
colleague of mine about electronics and
computer stores in this area and she
said confidently and unequivocally I
will never again shop at frys
electronics so whoa you know why not and
she said adamantly they discriminate
against women I asked her well how do
they do that you know their employees
and she said no the customers they
ignore women shoppers and don't help
them I said well I had exactly the same
experience at frys I mean I go in there
and they never help me
so I just assumed that fries was trying
to save money so they could have really
low prices she on the other hand
associated herself with a group of
people women and when she didn't like
the experience she had there she
extrapolated to that group of people
women and she said fries doesn't treat
women well whereas i was thinking fri as
was just trying to save money
that's much yeah okay now there are lots
of times when we face bias and so one of
the stories we tell in our book is about
a man who kind of was very clever in
creating other alternatives to figure
out a way around by us so it goes to our
other principle create better
alternatives there was a black man in
the early 1940s in Chicago who wanted to
borrow five hundred dollars so he could
start a magazine aimed at a black
audience and he took his plan to a bank
and it was run by white people and the
guy looked at his plan and said very
good plan unfortunately we can't lend
you money in fact he was told quote boy
boy we don't lend money to colored
people unquote and this man said but you
think it was a good plan right he said
yeah can you mention can you recommend a
place that does lend money to black
people and the guy gives him a name and
says oh and you think it's a good plan
would you be willing to write a letter
to that effect he says sure it's not
breaking any of our rules so he writes a
letter the mangos gets the loan starts
Negro digest goes on starts ebony and
jet and his name is John Johnson and
just because he created an alternative
for getting around this bias rather than
letting it stop him don't ya don't
forget he's a billionaire too oh yeah he
died as a billionaire a couple years ago
now another kind of bias is weed net
tend not to do what we call check your
base so let me give an example it comes
up every year at a certain time of the
year when there's a newspaper story
about what kind of car it what's you
know what kind of cars get stolen and
you'll see the list and it's typically
got honda civics and honda cords and
stuff like that and the way it's
reported oh you know you better not have
a civic or an accord right but what
they're really doing is they're looking
at the number of civics that gets stolen
the number of Accords that gets stolen
the number of BMWs that gets stolen how
many BMWs are the relative civics way
fewer way fewer so in other words we
they forgot to do was check their base
to take the numerator the number stolen
over the base over the denominator the
number out there and that's a very
different number I mean a BMW is much
more tempting to steal although I'm not
sure it's as good a car but that's
another story now another example of
checking your base or not checking your
base and it's a much more serious
example is in the intelligence leading
up to the attack on Iraq this came out
in the in the later look back at what
had happened the US authorities had
reason to believe good reason to believe
that there was this kind of tanker truck
well they pretty much knew there was
this kind of tanker truck the Saddam
Hussein would use to transport chemical
weapons and they had all these aerial
satellite photos and in the few weeks
before the invasion they noticed a
dramatic increase in the number of
pictures of these tanker trucks more
pictures of tanker trucks but they
didn't check their base why were there
more pictures of tanker trucks because
the United States was planning invasion
and if they're planning an invasion
they're going to take more satellite
photos there were more pictures of
tanker trucks because there were more
pictures another principle which we laid
out near the start was think simple
Einstein once said make a problem as
simple as possible but no simpler and
sometimes you have a problem you're
looking at where you've got all these
variables all these things and it would
be very costly to get a lot of the
information to solve it and get
everything nailed down not always but
sometimes you can do what we call use
thresholds you can say if this certain
variable is above X or below X I know my
decision and Charlie's going to give you
an example of that that he used in a
consulting project so here's another
project where we provided objective
insights but instead of kicking us out
of the boardroom they were actually very
happy with us so we don't get kicked out
of every boardroom
um this was for a young small biotech
company and they developed an hiv/aids
medicine and this looked to be a really
good drug but the thinking within the
company was that they're just this
little small company they don't know
what to do with this big drug so they
were going to license it out to the big
pharma company that had the huge sales
force and the marketing teams and the
experience management and of course the
big pharma company would sell more of
this product than the little company
would write but we said you know we'd
like to look this and analyze this so we
wanted to look at the two cases keep the
product or license it now if you keep it
you have to set up the whole marketing
organization sales all that stuff it's
very expensive but when you get revenues
you get to keep a hundred percent of it
now when you license it out it's easy
you don't have to set up that stuff but
when you get revenue when when the
revenues come in you just get a
percentage of it that's your royalty
rate so we went to the management team
we said okay the big pharma company is
going to do better than you'll do how
much better no 10-percent fifty percent
give us a number and they were very
uncomfortable giving us a number so we
weren't thwarted what we did is we used
thresholds as david said and we went
back and looked and we compared the two
alternatives and made them equal how
much more wood this big pharma company
have to sell just to break even on that
decision turns out the answer is five so
for every hundred bottles that the
little company would sell the big
companies have to sell 500 now we took
this to the management team and we told
them five just to break even if it's
less than five you should keep the
product if it's more than five you
should license it out and we told them
55 is the answer and you could just see
their jaws drop five said no way is
going to be five you know they were
thinking maybe thirty percent or fifty
percent more but no way no way would it
be five and so we had set the hurdle
rate and we knew that reality was going
to be below that
um and so this company did take our
advice and they kept this products and
they've been very very successful since
then okay by the way Adam how long do we
have to go so I want to leave a little
time for Q&amp;amp;A at the end till now Oh till
now I'm wonder if we should do the
airline example vs leaf closing thing
I'm gonna do the closing oh yeah okay
I'm gonna skip something let me just
tell if I don't wants to wait around i
don't know if you have time but we show
you this nice little numerical example
of how do you decide whether to buy a
ticket in advance to go to a meeting and
imagine you're paying for it not your
employer to go to a meeting knowing
there's some probability the meeting
will be cancelled and we just kind of
walk you through how to do that but I
want to end with what we call it's our
last chapter in the book do the right
thing we focus so far in our cut talk
and in the book in the previous X number
of chapters on expanding your
alternatives having more options you
know doing better for yourself we
haven't said a thing yet about ethics
about making good decisions about making
ethical decisions and now I want to talk
about that and it turns out if you use
this same way of thinking that we've
applied you will get to the conclusion
that you ought to be pretty ethical I
mean you ought to be honest not to
defraud people steal from people murder
people stuff like that and i want to say
why because offhand it's might not be i
mean it might be obvious to you because
you brought up that way but it might not
be obvious in a very narrow cost-benefit
sense and that's what i want to show
think about if you start stealing from
people it seems like you'll expand your
alternatives right whatever you had but
you and I are equal you start stealing I
don't you have more options because you
steal stuff but here's the problem as
you get found out
your options your other options actually
start three shrinking the example we
give in the book is let's say you decide
to be accountable people would start
avoiding you especially around mealtime
and as Adam Smith pointed out in
civilized society he stands at all times
and need of the cooperation and
assistance of great multitudes while his
whole life is scarce sufficient to gain
the friendship of a few persons in other
words we have this incredibly extensive
division of labor everything you're
wearing today I guarantee you did not
produce we've got this incredibly
extensibility division of labor the
required cooperation from a lot of
strangers you're going to get more
cooperation by being more having a
higher reputation be easier to trust and
so on because otherwise you get found
out now it seems like a famous counter
example is PT Barnum who's famous for
having said there's a sucker born every
minute he didn't say it in fact he said
about someone else who tried to cheat
people poor soul not to understand that
the hardest way to make money is
dishonestly for that same reason I
talked about your narrow your options
shrink and in fact here's how he made
his money when the circus used to come
to town he ran a circus when the circus
used to come to town the circus would
rob you they actually had employees out
there to rob the crowd and other
employees to go to where the people in
the crowd lived and robbed their houses
because they're at the circus and that
word got out very widely and PT Barnum
said had got an idea create new
alternatives we will guarantee that with
our circus we won't have people robbing
your house or you and we'll even have
some plainclothes people looking for the
robbers and that's how is circus did
very well
now think about so what we say is you
know the US Constitution Constitution
Day was last September 17th I gave a
talk on it down in Monterey Peninsula
and I pointed out that the Constitution
is a set of things that the government
cannot do and then a very narrow list of
things that can do its enumerated powers
if it's not on that list can't do it
what we say that you should have your
own constitution so instead of We the
People I the person have a list of
things you won't do so if you're tempted
you go back to that and it's a way of
saving and thinking and saving on
thinking about temptation just know I
thought that went through when I was
really calm and I wasn't as drunk and
that woman you know that very attractive
woman wasn't there and so on and so I'm
going to go back to my rule and I'm not
going to do that right and so you ought
to have your own constitution and I want
to just end with one quick story to kind
of the moral the whole thing I was a
friend a teenage son of a friend of mine
years ago I live in the Monterey area
was sitting around talking to these
other teenagers and I was listening in
on their conversation and one of them
said wouldn't it be neat to get a job at
Pebble Beach that's kind of a dream of
you know 17 year old boys and in that
area and one of the other guys says well
Matt as a matter of fact I have a
part-time job at Pebble Beach and
everyone goes really really how'd you
get that and he said oh I just went down
and applied
so our lesson to you our moral to you is
just go down and apply thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
