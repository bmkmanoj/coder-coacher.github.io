ALLISON: Welcome, everybody.
Thanks for coming in to Google
New York for part of our tech
talk series.
We're excited to have you.
Just a couple of housekeeping
items while we get started.
As you can see,
tonight's agenda,
I'll be handing it over
to Dave and then we're
going to have the
JamBoard team presenting.
Just a few things in advance.
Restrooms, if you go out
that back door, there's
restrooms for everybody
there, just follow the signs.
Wi-Fi is GoogleGuest,
there's no password,
you can just hop right on.
Most importantly, no recording
and no photos please.
We will be recording,
we'll take care of it
and we'll be posting it,
so we've got it covered.
But now I will hand it
over to Dave Mandelbaum,
who is an engineering director
here at Google New York.
[APPLAUSE]

DAVE MANDELBAUM:
-- Hey, Johnson.
Welcome, everyone.
We're thrilled to have you here
for another edition of our Tech
Talk series.
We've been doing
this for seven years,
opening our doors to New York
technologists to show them--
show you what slice of life
is like here at Google NYC.
So tonight, we're showcasing
some of the amazing work going
on in New York.
The JamBoard team
is going to come up
in a minute to talk
about how they built
a very exciting new product that
they debuted at the Cloud Next
conference last month.
I'm a director here,
as Alison said.
I work in Corporate Engineering.
I've been here at
Google for six years.
Before that, I worked at
several companies in New York.
Began small.
Most recently, I was
at barnesandnoble.com,
I was a tech lead for
the Nook eReader project.
That was in the same
building, so I'd
been having the same
commute for 10 years.
My team is responsible here for
all of our custom HR tools--
hiring, learning, compensation,
performance management--
as well as many of our internal
mobile and collaboration tools.
For some of this
work, we partner
with the apps and
the cloud teams
to develop tools for Googlers
and our enterprise customers.
That's how we came to
work with JamBoard.
So JamBoard is a
product that has
huge implications for how
Googlers and our enterprise
customers work.
CorpEng's mission is to empower
Googlers with world leading
technology.
And with JamBoard and our
other apps and cloud products,
we work to do that for
external enterprises as well.
So I really enjoy
working at CorpEng.
Our customers are
my fellow Googlers,
who are both the smartest
and the most demanding users
you can imagine, but
also some of the most
appreciative and helpful.
The systems we build in
CorpEng are smaller scale
than something like
search or Gmail,
so our engineers get to
own large end-toend pieces
of the system and
shape the solutions.
At the same time, the
problems are challenging,
and in many cases, have
more complex interfaces
than our consumer offerings do.
So Google has become
a very large company,
but the New York office still
retains a tight-knit community
and many aspects
of a small company.
We do amazing, varied
work here across many
of the different
product lines at Google.
Besides apps and cloud, we
have search and ads and maps
and YouTube and many more.
So I hope you leave
today with a better
understanding of the kinds
of work we do at Google NYC.
There's a lot going on.
We hope you enjoy
hearing about it tonight.
And with that, let's
bring up the JamBoard.
[APPLAUSE]

TJ VARGHESE: Hey, everybody.
Welcome to this meetup.
And my name is T.J. Varghese,
I'm a senior product
manager on the JamBoard team.
LUCY BOURNE: Hi, my
name is Lucy Bourne.
I'm a program
manager for JamBoard.
AUDIENCE: We can't hear you.
LUCY BOURNE: I'll try it again.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
LUCY BOURNE: This
sounds promising.
[LAUGHS] Hi, my
name is Lucy Bourne,
and I'm a program
manager at the JamBoard.
TJ VARGHESE: So welcome.
We're really excited
to have you guys here.
One thing to note
about JamBoard is,
this is a product that we
designed here in New York City,
so we're really,
really proud of that.
We're going to start off
with a video to give you
an idea of what JamBoard is.
[APPLAUSE]

All right.
OK, here we go.
So we at Google, we love
technology and we know you
guys do too, it's one of
the reasons why you're here.
If you think about it,
technology is so cool
and is really changing
the way we live our lives,
and it helps us
better our lives.
Take, for example,
I live in Midtown
and I could literally
pull out my phone
and change the
thermostat in my house,
because it's getting
warmer today.
And so these are the
kinds of things that I
think we all get excited about.
And to that point, we
want that same kind
of benefit and
transformation at work,
and that's what our teams
work on collectively.
So Google innovations are
all about the enterprise
collaboration.
Google itself has--
I think Nick and
Eva will come on
later to tell you about how many
conference rooms that we have
and how Googlers interact
with other Googlers
across the globe.
And so this is a problem that we
deal with on an everyday basis.
And so part of our
approach in innovation here
is thinking about--
being very thoughtful about not
just developing and innovating
in technology, but thinking
about how it actually
helps our lives get better.
And this quote from David Sax
of &quot;The Revenge of Analog&quot;
is something that I like
a lot, because it really
talks about being
thoughtful and thinking
through what exactly are
you're trying to accomplish.
So we have a lot
of meetings here.
We do a lot of
video conferencing
and we felt like we could
do something better.
And part of meetings is
not just having a meeting
to discuss things, its
really about expressing ideas
and communicating with others.
And we do that well
here at Google--
if you walk around the
conference rooms here,
you'll see video conferencing
in almost every meeting room
or every phone room--
but there's one
element that's missing,
and the fact that people need
to express themselves freely.
And this is inherent
to our normal being.
A lot of times that's
what draws people
to start writing
or communicating
with some context.
So consider the whiteboard.
As mundane and as
ordinary as it is,
the one benefit of
the whiteboard is it
gives you a blank
space so you're
able to fill it with anything
that comes to your mind.
And a lot of times,
when you're trying
to solve problems or communicate
ideas or even just express
yourself, you'll
often find yourself
walking to a whiteboard
and picking up a marker
and expressing yourself
really quickly.
But technology is
limited, right?
So the whiteboard is
limited to the room.
Once you erase it, it's gone.
How many times have
you pulled out a phone
and taken photos of whiteboards?
I think If I did a poll, I'm
pretty sure almost every hand
here will go up.
And this is a problem, right?
We wanted to figure out how
do we solve that problem.
And so we looked at solutions
that exist in the marketplace
today, and one of the problems
is, the form factor itself,
it didn't feel intuitive.
There are products out there
that just look like a black box
to display.
Sometimes people aren't sure,
is it a touch display, isn't it?
They're really expensive and
they're really hard to use.
And so we wanted to
solve that problem.
So the ideal thoughtful
process of solving this
was, can we create a product
that was inspiring enough
for your ability to get
your ideas out of your head
very quickly, very
fast, just like you'd
do on a normal
whiteboard, but thinking
through all of the advantages
of digital technology, right?
Whether it be the ability
to continue your work,
save your work, and,
of course, making it
assistive in every way possible.
And so that's why
we built JamBoard.

We took a very
design-centric approach
to building this product.
Like I said, we
didn't necessarily
want it to just be a product
for the sake of innovation.
We had this philosophy that
if you could do it faster
on a whiteboard but you
couldn't do it faster
on a digital screen,
then we failed.
And so that was one of
our guiding principles
on this, where we wanted to be
able to walk up to a room and--
without going through
screens or anything,
but just tap on the screen--
and just start drawing, you
can, just like a whiteboard.
We also wanted to make sure
that if you drew something
and you made a mistake, you
could just use your finger
and erase it.
And so these are all
kinds of user journeys
that we took a lot of
time thinking about, which
was really, really challenging
from a technology perspective.
And finally, we wanted
it to be creative.
These are where your
biggest ideas come to life.
These are where
you solve problems,
and so we wanted it to
feel inspirational--
at the same time, feel less
like an electronic piece
of equipment and
more like furniture,
which is what speaks
to the design itself.

Now once you've got the
basics right, we're like,
we're not going to stop there.
We're Google.
So we want to bring
all of the intelligence
that we can think of
to the whiteboard.
Whether it be features like the
handwriting recognition tool,
where you can write and
it will auto convert,
or grabbing content
from the web easily.
And of course, many other
features that I'm sure
you've seen outside,
and feel free
to come afterwards and
talk to us about that.
So JamBoard opens up a
lot of possibilities.
You guys have seen and been
using Google Docs, Sheets,
Slides, and Google Drive, all
of the collaborative tools
that we have today,
what JamBoard does
is it brings that real
time collaboration upstream
into your thought
process so that you
can start with your idea
here and continue on
with the other
tools that we have.

So just taking a step
back, part of this talk
was to give you an idea of
how we work here at Google
and how we do things.
So this was our mission from
a very, very long time ago,
I want to say about
four years ago.
We wanted to really
think about how
to solve creating and
thinking and collaborating
and improve that process
on modern devices.

What you're seeing here is a
photograph of the first genesis
of JamBoard.
So myself and another
engineer got together
in a hackathon four years ago--
I think it's four years ago this
week, actually to be precise--
and this was part of
a hackathon and we
started to build a
tablet collaborative
app that was a drawing tool.

And when you build
stuff at Google,
and eventually that product
that we did in the hackathon
became what we call a 20%
project, where we spend
20% of our time working
on things that we want
to do ourselves
individually, that eventually
evolved into what we do
here at Google, which is
a practice called dogfooding.
So anytime we build a product,
in order to test the product
to make sure that it has legs
and is warranted and has users,
we test it here at Google.
And a big part of that is
the dogfooding process.
In the second half of
this talk, Eva and Nick
here are going to come in and
talk to you more about that.
So while we were
dogfooding that app,
we realized that we needed
to get into hardware
and actually figure
out how to put
this on a large touchscreen.
So you're seeing some
screens here of us,
some photos of us literally
coming up with design concepts
and working with folks
to come up with a model.
And what you see here
on the right side
is an actual
non-functioning model
of what a JamBoard
could have looked like.
And that happened two years ago.

So as we were designing
hardware and thinking
about what it's
going to look like,
we were developing this tablet
app and we wanted to dogfood.
And meanwhile, like
Dave mentioned earlier,
we're part of the G Suite team
and part of the Cloud team
and there's a CorpEng team--
CorpEng does everything
here at Google.
Meanwhile, we met a team--
it's Nick and Eva--
they were working at Google
on video conferencing
and how to better
meetings at Google.
And so we met that
team and that's
how we joined forces
to effectively bring
this dogfood into Google.
So this is one of
the early prototypes
that we built, and this is
what we brought to Google
and started testing
in multiple offices.
And we'll talk more about that.

So while we were testing
this prototype, myself
and a few other
engineers, we flew to Asia
and we met with a bunch
of different manufacturers
and we started this
process of really designing
the JamBoard that you see here.
And this was a very long process
that took several months.
And this is my favorite picture.
What you don't see here
is the panoramic picture.
There's actually I think 15
whiteboards that go around
in a circle, and
we have engineers
from different disciplines and
different industries thinking
about how we're going to
actually manufacture this.
And I love this because we're
of designing a whiteboard.

After a while, I was
like, wait, this is wrong,
why are we designing this
on a regular whiteboard?
So we rolled in the
prototype on the last day
to say, can you please
design this on our prototype
so that we can test
the stuff that we're
making and prototyping, so
that's what you see here.

This has been-- a lot
of people ask me, what
is it like to work on a
product that involves hardware
and you're trying
to launch something?
I put up this slide to
explain what that is.
It's basically multiple time
zones in every single day,
and it also overlaps
with Fridays and Sundays.
So it's a lot of meetings,
a lot of time zones,
a lot of caffeine, a lot
of coffee, a lot of planes,
and a lot of frustration-- a
lot of money, and more meetings.
That just summarized what the
last three years of my life
has been.
Here's a fun fact.
The JamBoard has over
5,500 total components.
There's over 200 suppliers that
actually make up a JamBoard.
There were over 200 engineers
that worked on this.
I did over 50 trips to Asia.
I was involved or witnessed
eight large earthquakes
and four super typhoons,
believe it or not.
So this is our final product.
We're really proud that
after so many years,
we got to develop this, and we
announced this at Cloud Next.
I'm going to hand
it over to Lucy
now to talk a little
bit about how we got
our products ready for market.
LUCY BOURNE: So
as you can see, it
was a journey to get
this product to a place
where we were ready to have
end users start interacting
with it, but once
the product was ready
and we had the first prototype,
we actually, in parallel, led
to different testing streams--
and I did this in
partnership with Eva,
and she's going to deep dive
into the dogfood side of it
in a moment.
But I just wanted to
expand on why we did that
and what that helped
us learn as a team.
So if you think about
the internal deployment
to Google, a dogfood
program, that
was essentially many
devices at one organization.
So what did that kind
of teach us or what
did we learn from that?
Well, in thinking about how
we had these devices deployed,
it really helped us understand
what are the key use cases.
So when teams have access
to many boards, what
types of functions
or disciplines
seem to kind of gravitate to
using a product like JamBoard?
What is some of the fleet
management considerations
within a single domain
or organization that we
need to understand?
And we learned a lot
around mass deployment
and overall supportability
of the product.
On the other side, we also
ran an early adopter program
for North American
G Suite customers.
So we had a small
number of devices
at many different companies
and organizations.
And really, what that
helped us to understand
is, what are the different use
cases across different types
of industries?
So obviously, at Google, we have
a really tech-centric approach,
but having these JamBoards set
up at design, manufacturing,
architecture, a whole range
of different disciplines
and organizations
really helped us
to understand what are
some of the workflows
and journeys that folks are
using on JamBoard that maybe we
haven't discovered at Google?
We also learned a lot about
the external enterprise
environments.
So thinking about how
these boards are deployed,
there's a huge
amount of logistics
that we learned
about in shipping,
set up, on-site
tech support visits,
and how that worked externally
for different enterprise
customers.
And we were actually able to
incorporate several really big
feature requests that we
kind of worked through
as part of our program
and got feedback on,
that will be included as part
of the general availability
version of JamBoard,
which is pretty cool.
In addition to
that, I would just
say there was obviously a really
strong partnership with us
and all of our customers.
So just learning
about what is the user
journey for folks that haven't
used a JamBoard before--
what are the commonly
asked questions,
what's the onboarding
material that
needs to be provided-- so
just thinking about all
of the peripheral information
and support needed
around deployment of
these devices as well.
And as you can see, we have a
few of the customers listed,
but we have many more
than that and we're really
fortunate to have a
high level of engagement
throughout our early adopter
program, which, unfortunately,
will be coming to a close
in mid-May this year.
TJ VARGHESE: All
right, I think we're
going to invite Eva and Nick
up for the next section.
[APPLAUSE]

EVA BACON: Thanks so
much, T.J. Thanks, Lucy.
Hi, everybody.
I'm Eva Bacon, I'm a program
manager on the JamBoard team,
but working in CorpEng as well.
NICK MICELI: And my
name is Nick Miceli,
I'm a software engineer and
a tech lead on the CorpEng
side of JamBoard.
EVA BACON: Cool.
And now we'll take the
collaboration aspect
to a meta level and
talk a little bit
about how we at CorpEng
joined the JamBoard product
team to collaborate on the
future of collaboration.

Awesome.
Dave mentioned that earlier--
at CorpEng, our motto is--
the big slogan-- is
to &quot;Empower Googlers
with World-leading Technology.&quot;
That is our mission
and our privilege.
And that means we are
responsible for building,
implementing, and supporting
all of Google's internal tools
and systems.

There are quite a few
of us in CorpEng--
1,750 Googlers across
many, many sites--
so remote collaboration
is something
that we experience in our day
to day quite a bit as well.
And to deserve the
attribute, world leading,
the world leading technology,
we do a lot of innovating too.
A good example of this is our
video conferencing system,
which we've rolled
out at scale in 2011--
it's quite a while ago--
and that definitely
changed the way we do work.
To be able to easily meet and
collaborate with colleagues
regardless of whether
they sit 10 feet away
from you or in another
office across the globe,
is nothing short
of game changing.
And while it's still not the
same as meeting face to face,
Google Video Conferencing was a
quantum leap for collaboration,
and a quantum leap that we hope
to replicate with the JamBoard
as well and giving Googlers
the free form capabilities
and adding that to the video
conferencing experience.
At Google, we push ourselves
to challenge the status quo
and solve complex problems.
Google is not just
known for what we do,
but also how we do things.
This does not just
pertain to technology.
TJ Mentioned earlier
the 20% time.
You come up with a new idea, you
spend 20% of your time on it.
Obviously the free
food, the campuses,
we all will know a
little bit about it.
Laszlo Bock wrote a great book
about it, &quot;Work Rules!&quot; in case
you haven't read it.
It's a good one.
So let's reinvent the
way we do meetings.
Seemed like a good &quot;meaty&quot;--
pardon the bad pun--
challenge to-- and you can tell
how a digital whiteboard would
fit into that story.
In short, CorpEng is
a fascinating spot
to be here at Google.

NICK MICELI: So the
story of Graffiti
actually begins for me when
I went away on my honeymoon.
I was on a different
team, I took a nice break,
I came back and was looking
at my email expecting
to see a trade of
changes that were made,
and instead I saw a whole
bunch of conversations
around finding a new team.
Turns out the team I was on
was de-prioritized, and as one
of the nice perks of being
here, when that happens,
you always still have a home,
you find a new team to work on.
So I was approached
by a director--
an eng lead at
CorpEng, and they said,
hey, here's a new project
that we want to spin up,
and we think we've got
this great GVC, right?
This video
conferencing solution,
but still we have
this problem of,
if you're in a remote office,
if you're in a remote location,
and you want to collaborate,
you feel like a third world
citizen, right?
You have to point a
camera at a white board
and hope that you can join
the conversation that way.
What if we change the way
whiteboarding works at Google?
And as TJ mentioned,
the JamBoard team
started up similarly
with the same challenge.
We said, let's not solve
this problem twice, let's
join forces, let's
make this happen once,
and let's make sure that
this product works really
well not only for enterprises,
but also at Google.
So that's what our
team does here,
is we make sure that the use
cases and value that Google
needs most out of JamBoard, we
get to champion those things.

EVA BACON: We mentioned
already the term &quot;dogfooding,&quot;
or eating your own dogfood.
And it describes a company
testing their products
on themselves.
It's a practice we take very
seriously here at Google.
Googlers is our very critical,
but constructive testers.
As Lucy mentioned, we've done
quite a bit of dogfooding here
with the JamBoard, we're
about a year into the dogfood.
And some of the
things we've learned--
you've seen the
prototypes on the screen
and they had some limitations.
Latency was a big one of them.
Every team I talked
to, every team that
tried the JamBoard said,
oh, I love the idea!
I really want to make it work!
But man, the latency!
It just takes a
while for the stroke
to catch up with what you're
drawing, and by the time,
you've lost your
train of thought.
So we knew that was something we
had to solve before we could--
before we could
bring this to market.
And we did.
If you've tried it,
it's pretty seamless.
And none of the recent additions
to our dogfooding program,
none of the teams that
have come on recently,
have meant-- bring it up.
So that's good.
But despite the latency and
despite some of the things,
teams kept using them.
And that sent the message to us,
like, we were on to something.
And of course, the goal, the big
goal is remote collaboration.
But despite that, even
small improvements,
like one side of the call
being able to present
their whiteboards to a hang
out, can bring big value
to our users.
Being able to show your
architecture sketch
to your colleague in
California, that suddenly
shows really what
you're talking about.
The person on the other end it's
just a little less left out.
And nobody has to point
cameras at whiteboards.
Another example.
Sending a PDF of the
results of your design
sprints without having
to retype everything.
That can save you hours.
That's it.
Not everybody's a
whiteborder and that's OK.
It's a specific mode of
communication, not simply
a medium.
I mentioned that Googlers
are our critical test group.
There are some things like, for
example, the drive integration,
being able to bring in
your digital assets.
That originally was
further along the roadmap,
but then our EAP customers
and dogfooders let us know--
loud and clear--
this was non-negotiable.
They needed this sooner
rather than later.
And so we added it,
we prioritized it,
and it was moved up.

Now dogfooding isn't
anything quite eng specific.
But one thing we
bring to the table
is that we don't just
think about this.
We think about this.
A JamBoard in its
natural habitat.
In a meeting room, in a team
huddle, or an open area.
We get to study it in a
big enterprise context
that we are very
intimately familiar with--
Google.
So how does it interact
with the other equipment
and its surroundings?
Where in a room should it
stand or be wall-mounted?
How can we make sure it's
easy to deploy and support?
On these questions, we
worked with a number
of fantastic partners in
CorpEng, outside of CorpEng.
We have a fantastic support team
that was involved from day one,
because there are going to
be the one supporting it
down the road.
The architects, the real
estate team, AV engineering,
and our friends
working on Hangouts
meet via Google Video
Conferencing and Chromebox
for Meetings, there are a lot
of people involved in this.
So at the heart of dogfood
is the feedback loop
with our users, with
our reference customers.
If you're familiar
with the Lean Startup
principles or Marty
Cagan's methodology,
this will all sound
very familiar.
Some of the things
we got feedback on,
obviously the features--
latency, something are
already mentioned-- but also,
is five callers enough?
Use cases.
We asked our dogfooders,
we asked our EAP customers,
what do you use it for?
How does it fit
into your workflow?
On the hardware/software
support side, what breaks?
I said, be as
CorpEng, we're going
to be the ones supporting them,
so we have a vested interest
in fixing--
servicing-- fixing issues
at their root causes.
On the deployment
side, how easy is it
to assemble and to provision?
And what tools do we
need to support it?
Fleet management, again, is
something we do in CorpEng,
and Nick is going to tell
us some more about it.
NICK MICELI: So on
the engineering team,
one of the first big problems
that we came to look at
was fleet management.
So just something that we
learned from rolling out GVCs--
tens of thousands of
them across Google--
we've quickly, quickly found
that as the size of the fleet
grows, the cost and
difficulty in maintaining it
increases dramatically.
When we had five JamBoard
prototypes out there,
if one ran into a problem,
it's not a big deal
to ask somebody in
that office, hey,
can you run up with the
laptop and plug it in and pull
some logs off it, right?
But as soon as you're all up
to 20 devices, 50 devices, 100
devices, 1,000, even
just saying something as,
can you reboot the device?
becomes unmaintainable, right?
So we really needed
to make sure,
because we know that there's
going to be lots of customers
who-- we hope we'll
have many of them--
but Google's going to be the
first of these large fleets,
so we're going to face
that challenge early.
So here in CorpEng,
we want to make sure
that we reduce the
cost of our partners
who have to support
this, but also,
build these things in a
way that other customers--
that enterprise partners,
when they get it,
benefit from those same things,
because they're going to face
the same challenges that we do.
And if our support team
finds it a frustrating burden
to maintain a fleet of these,
then we've done something wrong
and we know that external
customers are going
to feel the same way, right?
Because we have
people who are highly
trained in managing fleets.
So we need to make sure that
we are succeeding in all levels
internally.
So what does that mean?
That means the first time setup
isn't foolproof, isn't easy.
When you unbox this thing, is it
intuitive how to get it set up?
You don't need to
read a manual, right?
It should just be one,
two, three, get it going,
and move on.
How about detecting issues?
Specifically, should you have
to have a human involved?
Can we have machines
automatically
detect if there's
problems with this board
and take the steps
needed to fix it?
Completely remove the need
to send a technician down
to look at the hardware?
Yeah, so auto fixing.
And then doing data analysis.
We at Google love data, right?
That's one of our mottos.
So what data can we
pull off of this thing?
TJ mentioned the number
of components on here.
What data can we look
into, can we surface,
can we make intelligence out of?
And so that's been a big
area that we first jumped
into and took a look into.
But one of the
coolest things that I
found about working in
Corporate Engineering
is our ability to do
feature innovation, right?
So if a feature completely
fails and bombs and it's just--
either it wasn't built right
or wasn't the right feature
or it doesn't make
sense to the user,
if it's only Googlers that saw
it, there's no problem, right?
Googlers expect to see our
own technology in a very, very
prototypey state.
We expect to see things fail,
we expect to see things not
working-- and
they'll let us know--
but there's no problem
of having to deal
with user data, user trust,
the first impressions, right?
So that gives us an opportunity
to do incredible innovation
and iteration, to fail quickly,
to try out crazy ideas,
and we can learn from that.
And we can make sure
that all of that
churn we can get
through internally
first so that by the
time a user sees it,
you've missed all of
that, and you just
see a polished, easy
to use experience.
So a few cool things
that we've innovated on.
You can actually
see here we've got--
this is not part of
the standard JamBoard,
this is a USB badge reader
that we've added to it,
because our badges are
attached to all of us literally
at the hip all day long.
So we said, what if when you
want to save your content,
you didn't have to type
in an email address,
you could just tap
it with a badge.
And that's something we're
still experimenting with
and we're understanding what
are the implications of that--
what does that mean in
an enterprise setting?
What is the security
implications?
We played around with--
a lot of questions I got
talking to guys outside
was, could we put my own
credentials on this board?
One of the credentials on it.
We said, well, what
would that mean?
We found in that case, there was
a lot of security implications
there.
This is a public
device that's just
sitting out in your
office, guests can walk by.
Do you really want to
leave it-- like, it's
like leaving your
computer without locking
the screen logged in, right?
So this is the sort
of things that we can
test out and try internally.
And we've got other
features that we
want to play around with.
Keeping documents synchronized
between JamBoards in a meeting.
We've tried this out, we
found the user experience
was unintuitive, great!
Let's keep iterating,
let's keep playing
until Googlers come and say,
oh, now this makes sense.
Now it's ready for us to
show it to the outside world.
So one thing I wanted
to dive in on that I
thought was pretty cool was a
video conferencing integration.
So Eva mentioned we have a
fleet of our Google Video
Conferencing units
throughout Google.
We also sell a version
of that externally
for video conferencing called
Chromebox for Meetings, or CFM.
And this is what you see
up on the top, there.
That's our CFM, one
of the versions of it
that you can use to
basically join a Hangout
and meet with people
in other offices.
So if you've got Chromebox
for Meetings in your room
and you've got
JamBoards in your room,
these are both Google products,
they should just work together.
But this feature actually
started as something
that we built internally.
So we started off
with a prototype
that only worked with Google
Video Conferencing systems.
And we basically built
it over Bluetooth,
so we figure we
have two devices--
hardware devices in the room,
they should talk to each other.
So we built the
Bluetooth channel.
And the way it works
is when you started
a meeting on your GVC
unit, a little prompt
pops up on the
JamBoard and says, hey,
would you like to
present to this meeting?
I hit checkmark and
immediately it's
presenting to that
meeting, so that if you're
working from home or
from remote office,
you can still follow
along the meeting
and see what's happening
on the whiteboard
even though you don't
have a JamBoard, right?
It's a participant
in the meeting.
And this saves you the
time of having to go
and type in the name of
the meeting manually,
which we thought was
a very cool use case.
So we built this,
we gave it to users,
and they said, wow, this is
a magic moment when it works.
Turns out, Bluetooth
is not really meant
for this 24/7 communication
channel between two devices.
It was kind of rough,
it was kind of spotty.
And like Eva mentioned
with the latency,
though, we found despite
that, despite the fact
that every time we used
it, we weren't sure
if it was going to be a hit or
a miss, people kept using it.
They used it despite
that they were
willing to end their meeting
and join it again just
in the hopes of that
prompt starting,
so that tells us something.
That tells us this is a real
use case, a valuable use case,
we just need to make it work.
So we decided we were
going to iterate on it
and rebuild it a little
more intelligently,
but when that happened TJ
came up to me and he said,
Nick, this is a
great feature, we
want to give it
to our customers.
There's no reason
why this should be
a Google-only feature, right?
We have external
customers who have
Chromebox for
Meaning devices, they
want that same magic feature.
And that was that moment
where we go, yeah,
there's no reason we
should build this one just
for Googlers, this is
something we should build
once that serves everybody.
So when we iterated on
it and we ported it over,
we designed it in a way that
it worked across the platforms,
that it worked for GVC and
the external product Chromebox
for Meetings.
That it works for the
current version of Hangouts
and the new iteration that was
just announced at Cloud Next.
And we built it on top of a
bunch of cloud technologies.
If there are any people
engineering in the room,
I recommend playing
with some of these.
Google Cloud Pub/Sub and
Firebase Cloud Messaging
are what we built this
feature on top of.
And so now that we leveraged
the power of the cloud,
we didn't have to worry about
a physical radio in the device
keeping a communication
channel over with Bluetooth.
So we have this
really nice seamless
reliability and quick-- just as
soon as you start that meeting,
you'll get that prompt.
But again, what was
great was we built this,
we launched it
internally, we tested
out this new stack,
this new tech flow,
and as soon as we
saw it was reliable,
we got to give it
to our EAP customers
and let external users
play with it and try it.
So I thought this was a very
cool example of an opportunity
where-- in CorpEng, though,
our mission is to build things
for Googlers, we got to iterate
and try and imagine and play
and it ended up creating a
feature that was actually
shown at the Google
Cloud Next keynote.
So at our slice of time
on the stage showing off
to hundreds of thousands
of people worldwide,
this feature got to get shown
off, something that was born
here in Corporate Engineering.
So that was, I think, very
exciting for our team.

EVA BACON: Now not
to be a downer,
but collaboration isn't easy.
There have certainly been times
when we were asking ourselves,
why again are we doing this?
Joining two orgs?
Is this really worth it?
As you collaborate
with more parties,
the need for communication
increases and both sides
have to relinquish
a bit of control.
Actually, a fun
study on that topic.
In 2010, Catherine Phillips
at Northwestern University
published a paper on
diversity in teams
showing, when there were
more diverse opinions
present in the teams, they
became A, less confident
in their results compared with
homogeneous teams were all
drinking the same Kool-Aid,
and B, diverse teams delivered
far better results, because more
points of view and dissenting
opinions were heard
and considered earlier.
NICK MICELI: We think getting
two teams to share resources
and collaborate is an
awesome example of this.
It's an opportunity where
we had different voices,
different opinions, maybe
different things that we
wanted to prioritize,
different mission statements.
But by bringing all those
voices into the room, yes,
there is discomfort.
There's the sense of,
well, now neither of us
are sure if we're
doing the right thing,
but from that is born
a better product.
Because when you have
that layer of trust
and then challenge and
debate and communication
and conversation, you
end up with more thought,
more challenging, more
opinions, and that ultimately
results in a better product.
EVA BACON: And we
truly appreciate
the good, constructive
discussions
we've had with the team.
And to tie it all
back together, this
is exactly the kind
of magic we hope
to enable with the JamBoards.
The collaboration.

I think that was TJ's
slide, but [LAUGHS] I
don't know if you
guys want to join,
but that is certainly true.
It takes a village
to build JamBoards
and many other things.

TJ VARGHESE: Yeah, if you
guys want to learn more,
you can go to
google.com/jamboard
on the actual product and
when it will be available,
et cetera, et cetera.
[APPLAUSE]

So I guess we'll start
taking questions.
I think there are
two microphones here,
so if you want to walk
up to the microphones,
we'll take your questions.

AUDIENCE: Hi.
I'm [? Max ?] [? Monet, ?]
how did you solve latency?

TJ VARGHESE: That was a
very, very hard engineering
problem on multiple fronts.

Fun fact, one of the reasons
why G Suite, which is primarily
apps decided to
get into hardware
is because we were trying
to solve this software use
case of whiteboarding
on a digital screen.
And, like I mentioned,
when we looked
at all the technology
that were out there,
we found a couple of
problems, one of them being it
was very expensive to buy one
of these screens, and then two,
the performance lacked,
and then three, it
was just a whole
software stack, so that's
what actually prompted
us to get into this.
The latency was solved on a
couple of different fronts.
It had to do with us actually
redesigning and creating
our own video scaler
with the manufacturer,
and we called it a
zero latency scaler--
so we're just passing bits
directly to the display.
That, combined with the touch
technology that we're using,
which is very unique--
this is a very unique
touch technology.
One of the features that we
have here on the JamBoard
is 4K, 60 hertz, one millimeter
accuracy with a passive stylus.
So there's no batteries or
Bluetooth or any kind of EMR,
it's just a passive stylus.
So getting that kind
of speed and accuracy
down with our touch
tac was a completely--
I mean, that was
years of development.
And the other way we solved it
was owning the entire product--
everything from the silicone,
up through the software,
down to the where
you touch the screen.
So we were able to make software
tradeoffs, hardware tradeoffs,
and effectively bringing
that latency down.
Anyone who's tried
to attempt this,
getting touch to work at
that speed and that accuracy
without active
styluses is a huge feat
as you go per
square inch bigger.
And so that's how we did it.

AUDIENCE: Hi.
My name is James.
I'm on-- it's the other
side of the latency coin.
I'm really fascinated by
the bandwidth question here.
Because you have a lot of
media on there and I only
see one cord.
So that means it's not wired.
So how did you manage the
bandwidth problem, especially
as you scale across
enterprises that
may not have the same
kind of connectivity
that you have here?
And that may have, say, not
necessarily a Wi-Fi N network,
but may have G or B. So if
you can talk a little bit on--
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah,
that's a great question.
So actually, we wanted the-- so
one of the design inspirations
was to keep this very simple--
single wire mobility on
wheels, which in itself is
a huge engineering challenge--
I won't get into that.
But we actually do have
ethernet built into here
at the back of the
device, and that
is exactly what we
tell enterprises
who, like you mentioned,
don't have very strong Wi-Fi.
Either because they don't have
that available or, for security
reasons, they prefer to wire it.
So there is that option
in the back of the device
to plug in ethernet.
AUDIENCE: Am I allowed to--
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah.
AUDIENCE: So the--
but the question
about how it works over Wi-Fi,
is there some dynamic scaling
that goes on?
For example, in Hangouts, when
your bandwidth starts to drop,
you obviously use
the JPEG compression.
But you don't have
JPEG compression here,
you have the user input, you
have other types of media.
So I'm just curious about
like-- because there's obviously
some algorithms and something
going on back there, but.
TJ VARGHESE: There are
two things that happen.
Do you want to talk?
NICK MICELI: So I was going
to mention that we do actually
have internally
at Google a bunch
of different Wi-Fi networks
of different qualities,
so we can test what it looks
like on different networks.
And so the content
on the board, there's
different types of content.
There's everything from
media that is actually
an image to the strokes.
And we make sure that
this is all done--
each piece is done
asynchronously,
it's all through the
same sort of logic
that Google Docs does
to keep the real time
collaboration in sync.
So even though pieces of data
may come at different times,
right?
Drawing a C is going
to come much faster
than uploading a new image
that you dropped on the board.
We have a whole bunch
of math and algorithms
on the back that
understands what
the correct state of the
world should look like
and that keeps
everybody in sync.
TJ VARGHESE: And that combined
with the component we're using
is an industry standard
component for Wi-Fi,
so we got a lot of benefits of
that component and its drivers
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Will.
I was wondering how far back
you take the dogfooding.
You might have answered it at
the end the first question.
That is, did you start with
a Linux distro we know?
Or Chrome OS?
Or Android?
Or did you just say,
none of this will do
and we have to go our own way?

TJ VARGHESE: Just to clarify,
do you mean on the app itself?
Where we started?
Or tried to figure out what
platform we start with?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
The latter.
TJ VARGHESE: We
didn't, actually.
Part of being--
I mean frankly, this
just being an idea that
sat in a conversation that
I had in a micro kitchen
and ended up walking
to a hackathon.
And then the 20% project
was initially-- the engineer
that I was working with,
we were both on a team that
was building Google Drive and
Google Docs for iOS platform.
So our first prototype, the
one you saw in the photo
is actually an iOS product.
But interesting question.
When we got to building the
product in the prototype
to a point where we knew we
wanted to take this to Google,
there was no way we were
just going to do that
without addressing Android.
So we actually worked on
an Android iteration of it.
And then from there
it evolved as we
talked to users who either
wanted to see something
on Chrome or Android or iOS.
NICK MICELI: On our
side, we actually did
a whole bunch of prototyping.
On CorpEng, we built a prototype
before we joined on JamBoard.
And we considered a whole
bunch of different options--
do we want to run Linux on this?
Chrome?
Native Android?
And we did a whole bunch of
different latency tradeoffs
and it's one of those
things where you're
trying to decide
between supportability
and maintainability
and performance, right?
So this has been a series
of different iterations
and benchmark tests to
make sure we figured out
what was the right magic
formula of all this.
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah.
In the course of four
years, we probably
wrote it at least
five times over.

AUDIENCE: So first off,
this is really cool.
And especially
looking into it, it
seems like education
is a market where
it could be really disruptive.
My question was
about the screen.
And over here, the one thing
I noticed is the glare.
Were there any considerations
of using a matte screen
or having an option for a
less glossy in the future?
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah.
A lot of consideration and
a lot of thought and this
is the interesting thing when
you're developing products
where you have to
weigh off tradeoffs.
The touch technology
we're using requires
us to use a certain
set of glass,
and that glass doesn't lend
itself to matte screens.
And so we are R&amp;amp;Ding on that
and continuing to evolve that,
and we hope that there'll be
an iteration of that to come.
But it got to the point where
we knew we had a solution,
it was a workable solution
and gets the job done,
but you're right, there's a
lot to be done and proved.
This is one of those things.
And in this case, we were
limited to, do we go matte
screen and go with the
conventional technologies--
of which we then we make
tradeoffs on performance
and cost--
or do we say, we're going to
take this other tradeoff where
it's not the
perfect environment,
but we bring performance
and cost back into realm.
And we chose the latter.
NICK MICELI: I will
say, also, come play
with the one we have
outside right out on that
after the talk.
When you don't have stage
lights directly blaring on it,
it's a little more pleasant
to look at as well.
TJ VARGHESE: And
hopefully you're
not pointing a camera to it.

AUDIENCE: Hi.
My name is Ian.
I was wondering what
the experience was--
I'm not sure if it's
something that you can show,
I would imagine not--
of a remote user who might
be on a laptop that's
not a touchscreen and
what collaboration
they can actually have
with a team that's
working in a JamBoard session.
NICK MICELI: I didn't bring--
so there's a few
different platforms
that we use to
collaborate with JamBoard.
You can view the
content real time
collaboration from the web.
You can view it from your phone.
The tablet app is the
real full partner on this
that you can do all of the
same drawing and editing.
But from my phone--
I'm connected to the Jam
outside, I'll join this one--
but from the phone,
I can watch real time
and I can throw up pictures,
drive content, and post-its,
the idea being
drawing on this thing
is not a pleasant
experience, but that way,
if you're doing like a
design sprint or something,
everybody can throw
post-it notes to the board
and I can throw personal
content to the board from it.

So I'll join and I'll show you.
But what's great is--
I would love if maybe we could
bring up the house lights,
I'll take a picture
of the audience
and we'll throw it on the Jam.
You can see it, it comes up
pretty quickly even on Wi-Fi
to answer two questions at once.
LUCY BOURNE: I would
just add to this as well.
I think this is a great use
case for active collaborators,
but what we also
often see in sessions
that are similar
to whiteboarding
is passive collaborators,
so people that
want to follow along and
understand what's happening,
but may not want to directly
add content themselves.
So we do have a feature which
is integrated with Hangouts
and Meet, and that allows for--
for whoever's at the JamBoard
to present their content
to a meet code or a Hangout.
So folks who are
remote can actually
follow along on a big screen.
That's actually becoming one of
our most common user journeys
for JamBoard, and it's
kind of really leveraging
the power of G Suite, right?
And the full integrations.
TJ VARGHESE: And I think, to
add on, to answer your question,
you mentioned non
touch devices, what
is it a collaboration look like
we've heard a lot of feedback
during both internal
and external testing
that a lot of folks would like
to see a web editor where they
can actually interact
from a browser
and from their desktops.
And so that is something
we're taking very seriously
and we're looking at
it into a roadmap.
AUDIENCE: OK great, thanks.
AUDIENCE: On the
engineering side,
do you guys have remote desktop?
And would it be able to be
controlled by one administer?
By multiple users?
NICK MICELI: Or talking about
in terms of fleet management
or editing a Jam?
AUDIENCE: Fleet management.
NICK MICELI: Yep.
So that's what our team
has been working on,
is a full fleet
management system.
We're still figuring out
exactly what administrators
want and need, but this is
one of those places where
testing at Google
where we already
have 50, 100, soon, 1,000
devices, is going to let us
really see what
do administrators
need to manage this fleet.
Does that mean the ability
to remotely send commands
to the board, like reboot it?
We've built that.
The ability to see
statistics about the board,
like how's the
camera functioning?
How is the Wi-Fi
signal in this room?
We're building that.
But then there's like there's
a world of different things
we could build and
we want to make
sure we're giving
the right features
that fleet manager needs
for managing their product.
Is that sort of
what you're asking?
AUDIENCE: Yes, but-- sorry.
Would there be more
integration with IT departments
that we'll be able to work on it
without you guys being present?
NICK MICELI: Oh yeah, so--
AUDIENCE: Instead of calling
you guys, they'll get into--
NICK MICELI: No, absolutely.
So all of these tools
are going to be exposed
for the IT members of a domain.
So if you have a G Suite
domain, any of the admins
can go and use the same
tooling that we use internally
to manage your own fleet.
And they'll have access to
all those same abilities,
to reboot devices and to
see statistical information
about the hardware
and all of that stuff.
So everything that we
have for our own admins,
we're giving to
fleet admins as well.
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah, and to
be clear, we won't have--
once you buy this and set
this up in your organization,
we'll have no access to that.
NICK MICELI: Yes.
AUDIENCE: Hi, I work as
a Director of Technology
at a k-12 school district
and also co-direct
a Center for Innovation
in our district,
and we're looking at
reinventing schools.
I bet you know what my
question is going to be.
I know you've tested
this extensively
in the corporate
enterprise environment
and, honoring the
quote you said earlier
about having diverse
teams, I wonder
if you've thought
about also including
k-12 education in your
early testing and adoption.
Right now, most schools have
devices called smartboards
and we're looking to replace
them within the next two years
and I see an opportunity
here for bringing this
into the classroom, into
instructional spaces,
into training spaces.
Have you thought about perhaps
rolling it out in that space
as well?
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah,
I knew there's
going to be at least
one question if not 10
in that space.
So you've probably noticed that
we've been pretty deliberate
when we announced the product
that we're focused on,
enterprise and--
I can't tell you enough
how many e-mails of hate
I got when people
realize that they could
they had to be an enterprise
to be an early adopter program,
like the edu list was intense.
We are thinking about it.
We want to be really
thoughtful about it.
Like I had mentioned earlier,
we want to solve problems,
but we want to make sure that
we are very thoughtful about it.
The way we view
the spaces, there's
been a lot of folks who
have attempted this space.
Many companies
have entered with--
Smart leading the way--
with their technologies,
and we view JamBoard as
a collaboration device.
Our focus here was about solving
collaboration and meetings
and yes, we do see
the similarity.
We wanted to be careful and
thoughtful about ensuring
that we did not set
precedent or this assumption
that you can replace
this with your smartboard
because quite frankly, a lot
of the functionality of what's
here may not necessarily
exist in what's used there.
For example, this isn't
really a throw something up
on the web and point and click
and use it as a teaching tool.
The other thing we learned
in the education space
is folks wanted
screens that were
a lot larger and a
lot bigger, and that
comes in itself with its
own set of challenges,
both software and hardware.
So when we are going
to launch this--
and you can buy this in May--
we're not precluding schools
from purchasing them,
it's just we're
setting the expectation
that this is a device that
we built for collaboration.
We actually think that this
is a great tool for our staff
and faculty, whether it be in
a staff room or training rooms
like you mentioned, but
we don't necessarily
see the product as the front of
the room teaching product yet.
We are going to go
into a phase where
we start doing this kind of
testing with schools to figure
out, OK, what are the needs
and requirements there
and then shape our product road
of how we evolve the product.
That's our strategy right now.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

AUDIENCE: Hi.
Want to ask, do
you have any plan
to open the platform for a third
party application developers?
And also, what would be the
price range for this product?
TJ VARGHESE: OK.
The answer is yes.
We do have a roadmap
and a plan to open it up
for third party applications.
You'll be hearing about that
in the coming weeks and months.
The price right now
for the JamBoard in May
is going to be $4,999
for the device.
And we have a annual
support and subscription
fee, which is $600 for
the device per year.
And we're running a promotion.
If you buy the JamBoard before
September 30th of this year,
that subscription annual
price for the first year
will be discounted
at 50% to $300.
AUDIENCE: Hey, just
want to say, thank you
for a really thoughtful
presentation.
My question is
more on use cases.
Have you guys seen
any particularly
like notable use cases that
have come up and really been
facilitated by this technology?
Not really just core
use cases that you
build fundamental product
around, but really things
that have been new and maybe
even unexpected and kind
of surprising around the
product that have come up
because of that technology.
LUCY BOURNE: I'm going
to throw one out there.
I'm sure all of us are probably
going to throw some ideas out
as we go.
One of the most
interesting use cases
actually connects two of
our features together.
So the first is
drive integration.
So pulling up content you
created previously from Drive,
whether that's G Suite
apps or PDF or PNG image.
What we found a lot
is the JamBoard's
actually used as an interactive
presentation tool for teams.
So just to break down
how that would happen,
someone would add
their content--
so say they pushed
up a bunch of slides,
they pull out those individual
slides, expand them--
and then what
they'd do is they'd
open up the present feature.
So they would present
their JamBoard to a meet
or a Hangout.
And then they'd stop presenting.
But rather than having this
very two dimensional flat fly,
they actually annotate over
the top of it as they go.
They highlight key
points, they add ideas.
As people make
comments or callouts,
they'll put that in a parking
lot that's live on the board.
So having this used and
seeing the interaction
between existing content,
the annotation layer,
and the ability, as
I say, to kind of get
passive collaborators really
engaged in the content
is not something we ourselves as
a team came up with as an idea,
we actually found our
dogfooders, initially,
and then early adopter
customers led with using
these features a lot.
TJ VARGHESE: Yeah.
I actually nicknamed that
feature the CNN effect.
And frankly, so we had
heard a few dogfooders
and teams saying, hey,
they used it this way,
and we were like, huh,
that's kind of weird.
And then last year we
had this executive review
where we met with a lot of
our senior vice presidents
and we were
demonstrating JamBoard.
And our director just
naturally decided
that we were going to
do away with slides
and he did the same thing.
And I think just the wow
factor in the room with a bunch
execs where we were throwing
up a slide, talking about it,
moving it around,
throwing up another slide,
drawing around it, it just
was much more engaging
and drew the crowd in.
And that's something that
we've seen like really well.
EVA BACON: One of the most
fun kind of like use cases
that we totally
didn't anticipate
are birthday cards
and baby shower cards.
Due to the fact
that you can just
pull up a Jam by
a broadcast code,
by a six digit broadcast code,
lets you just email your team
and say, like, hey, we
started a greeting card
for our colleague.
Whenever you have a board, type
in the code, add your photo,
add your little
note, and then you
show it off at the party later.
I think we've heard five
instances of that happening.
So maybe we should start selling
it as a greeting card product.
TJ VARGHESE: Third
party good idea.
LUCY BOURNE: It
really just shows
the joy of using it, right?
People find reasons
and new ways to use it,
whether that's part of
their traditional workflow
or if it's just something
fun that they want
to celebrate with the team.
TJ VARGHESE: So guys, I
think we've come to a wrap.
We're still going to
be hanging out here,
so I know there's a few more
folks who had questions, just
come in and chat with us.
EVA BACON: And thanks
so much for coming.
TJ VARGHESE: Oh, and
we'll be outside.
I think there's--
[APPLAUSE]
I think there's 30 more
minutes of networking,
so feel free, go
outside, grab a drink.
