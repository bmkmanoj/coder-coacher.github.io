our tech talk on improving the world one
airship at a time i'm david morgan
thaller host and i'd like to introduce
Jeff Kagan Berg who I've known for many
years we play darts together kind of
ironic saloons and darts but Jeff and I
work together a little company called
reasoning where he was my director of
product management he's worked at
several aerospace companies and startups
here in Silicon Valley and he's now the
president and CEO of General orbital and
he's here to talk a little bit about
their technology and what they're doing
so without further ado take it away Jeff
thank so one thing I want to say about
this talk about me in terms of
presenting I really would rather have
this not be so much a tech talk as a
tech conversation it means I can already
tell there's a number of people here
have background in some of the
technologies i'll be talking about and
it's just the nature of this type of
technologies we're discussing that most
people have had some exposure to it and
therefore it should be more interactive
so in this talk I'm going to break you
know I trying to have the conversation
in a controlled fashion I fully expect
will deviate from this agenda and I'll
probably talking with you guys for about
you know 35 40 minutes I'll do a short
introduction in myself and the
technology but first I'll talk about a
comparative technology that we're all
familiar with that's benefited I think
all this pretty dramatically also talked
a very very brief history of airships
and understanding the stratosphere which
is where this particular set of vehicles
is targeted out and then of course i'll
talk a lot about how how these airships
can truly improve the world and that's
not a idle comment that's truly a
technology that can help you know reach
many people throughout the world and you
know add a lot of capabilities that we
need at home and finally I'll talk about
the text the tech challenges that we're
currently facing give you a little
insight into kind of the different
things we're doing and why now that this
is possible when people have been
looking at doing this for a while
I decided not to put a whole lot of
slides here so as as David had said I'm
Jeff Clattenburg I was asked to be the
CEO of General orbital with a couple
friends of mine that started up one
named dr. Alfred differ that had worked
on a lot of experimental balloon
projects on a very very tight budget the
technology we're talking about our
high-altitude airships so these are
airships that are targeted not the
blimps that you're used to seeing but at
very high altitude specifically
stratospheric altitudes and one of the
beauties of working on airships is
there's such a romantic interest
throughout society and airships but it's
also a downside because there's very
fanciful ideas about airships as well
and so we'll talk about that there's
very practical pragmatic things about
airships that make them wonderful
products and there's some really bears
of challenges in making them work which
is why they haven't been so far so that
technology I was going to talk to you
about is satellites you know I certainly
grew up in the the space generation as a
space nut I know there's at least a
couple here as well and satellites have
truly improved our lives whether you
really appreciate that or not people
have examples of satellites and how you
know how you use them today anybody out
there used to satellite today anyone
there you go on GPS oh yeah so so the
gentleman over there you know had you
know used his GPS unit today and
certainly that that's one way satellites
improved anyone make an international
phone call did anyone you know
absolutely well those aren't typically
done by satellites but the the baseline
communications that have been put out
there have you know been enhanced by
satellites be fair satellites in terms
of international communications largely
been TV and broadcast not radio and TV
XM radio anyone have an XM out there
anyone go to Google Earth and use some
of the stuff from landsat data weather
forecasting so here's a quick pictorial
guide to the satellites that's a picture
of our of our earth with satellites that
are out there today being depicted it
reminds me of a another graphic I've
seen not too far away from here but in
this case I like this graphic because it
also shows that there's two major
domains where satellites exist if you
notice the white dots up here are very
close to the earth and then you have the
ring outside and of course the rain
outside is where you have you know
geostationary satellites and the ring
inside the low fliers that have
different capabilities by the way does
anyone here had an aerospace background
or worked with satellites personally
okay a few I kind of got the feeling
a lot of the background that I had is
David indicated I worked for a number of
years at Lockheed supporting satellites
and satellite projects just as an
example not all satellites or
communication are truly geosynchronous
in this case XM uses a geostationary
satellite and serious does not but
they're both high flyers they're both
very very far away from the earth
serious basically is targeting a higher
latitude which is the only reason that
they need to go in a non geosynchronous
orbit conversely if you look at
satellites this is by the way the track
of the satellite that was recently
intercepted that was going to burn into
into the atmosphere this is your typical
low flyer environmental satellite spy
satellite that travels not only very
closely earth but typically in a polar
orbit that allows it to cover the entire
Earth as the air spins underneath it
gets each time a different paths of the
earth very very valuable and definitely
glad that those exist and this gives you
an idea of all the satellites in
geostationary orbit and how crowded that
orbit is getting particularly over you
no say over North America
and finally just a reminder that all
these vehicles actually had to get up
there these vehicles are of course very
valuable they have a lot of power
they're expensive not only to build but
also to launch a given satellite can
cost tens of millions hundreds of
millions even a you know upwards of a
billion dollars and launches similarly
if you start looking at geosynchronous
orbits can be similar
so I'm going to focus on to the two
categories of satellites I've just been
talking about geostationary these are
largely communication satellites there
are some weather satellites or
geostationary there are twenty-two
thousand miles away that's long enough
that light time delay becomes an issue
it's why they're traditionally not used
so much in telephone calls if you've
ever made a satellite college I have you
can notice the time delay about half a
second usually depends on your geometry
and of course if you're ever trying to
pass data over those sorts of distances
it becomes a you know becomes a really
painful problem
and then conversely for your spy
satellites out there for your weather
your typical weather satellites that are
getting very close data there closely
are the 100 miles 200 miles 200 miles
more normally 100 miles you're going to
burn in pretty quick these satellites
have very high resolution because
they're close to the earth but they're
orbiting about every 90 minutes so any
given point on the earth they're over it
for a fraction of time so if it goes
directly overhead that satellite will be
up for about 10 minutes how many people
here have seen the show 24 do you
remember scenes in there where they
would be getting a satellite feed and
they'd be watching a car and that
doesn't happen the reason it doesn't
happen is by the time you call up the
cars going right you've passed over that
unless you know the car is going to be
there the time it takes to set up that
satellite feed you're just out of luck
or unless you had enough satellites that
you actually could cover the entire
Earth but that's several hundred
satellites and so that sort of
capability actually doesn't exist now
the funny thing is people would like it
too if you have an oil pipeline if you
have a shipping lane a port you would
really like that kind of capability
now there's other satellites which I
course didn't mention which ironically
was came up as an example things like
GPS you know astronomical observation
other things that all have had you know
significant impacts on us but they're in
slightly different orbits than that for
different reason but those are the two
primary orbits so the trade-off between
the orbits geostationary you're a long
ways away if you're doing any
observation low-resolution have a huge
footprint of the earth you can see you
know quarter to a third of the earth at
a time so that's why it's good choice
for relaying signals but you have the
time delay talking to low Earth orbit
satellites very good resolution but
you're very you're over any given area
in a very short amount of time so I just
want to give you that as a basis right
so that you understand how we've
leveraged those capabilities and you're
going to leverage similar capabilities
with airships but with more flexibility
and more importantly at price points
which allow you to extend this to far
more people in the world
balloons I you could do several tech
talks on balloons they seem simple they
seem wonderful the concept behind a
balloon touches something in all of us
because it's it goes back to floating in
a pool right or just being a kid it you
capture enough light gas you float it's
a give you an idea the first flight of
both a hydrogen balloon and a hot air
balloon happened in 1783 225 years ago
we've leveraged this technology in many
ways that a lot of people don't
appreciate or no but that's when it
started then you know at that point you
would fly your left to the wind a lot
which is very enjoyable flight by the
way and I recommend it but in 1886 you
have the first person add a gas-powered
engine to a balloon you know you could
argue that's the first airship right
that that's the first time that you went
from something that floats with the wind
to being controlled and that was
certainly the objective but given the
strength of wind versus the strength of
that engine you'll find it's a nice
objective but not quite where you're at
1900 was the first flight by the LZ one
built by Zeppelin and Germany this you
know truly marked a point where you went
from a balloon effectively a lifeboat to
building a ship that would go through
the air and started a wonderful time
frame or time period in the airship
industries and by 1937 you had many
people going across the Atlantic in
airships mean it was a very pleasant way
to travel very elegant way to travel and
of course in 1937 unfortunately the
Hindenburg caught fire and that and the
advent of commercial aircraft suddenly
made airships Lee a less valuable for
personal travel as a side note for those
who haven't seen the Discovery Channel
or the Mythbusters coverage of the
Hindenburg I highly recommend it because
one of the things that comes out of
studying all the information now is it
turns out the initial the initial fire
with the Hindenburg was not a hydrogen
fire it started on the actual surface of
the of the ship they coated the canvas
with a reflective coating to control
temperature it just so happened that the
metals that they used to make that
coating we're aluminum and iron and as
we know now that is a mixture known as
rocket fuel it's actually used in this
same mixtures use are similar mixtures
using the solid rocket motors for the
shuttle so if you watch the video it as
soon as I understood what happened it
clicks if you watch the video the the
entire skin burns from top to bottom if
it had been a hydrogen fire it would
have never reached the bottom because as
soon as the tops are burning would have
burned
the skin itself was very very flammable
and was most likely the source of the
fire any questions nothing tomatoes you
didn't give them any fruit or anything
did you know oh that's true so as I said
one of the interesting things to me
about airships these airships are still
being used right there's this kind of
perception that the Hindenburg killed
airships and it didn't and even if the
Hindenburg hadn't happened airships for
personal transport probably would have
died because airplanes were much faster
and were less expensive than then a
eventually came less expensive than a
ticket on the Hindenburg would be so the
Hindenburg would have been a pledge you
know a pleasure craft that sort of thing
and probably would still you know still
fill that niche but be much fewer people
much smaller market but airships today
are still being lured so so here that's
actually a Hindenburg so an example is
for scientific research if you want to
explore the tops of trees and you don't
want to say disturb them with like an
ultralight and you want to hover and
take take measurements an airship is a
very powerful and very good way to go
and it's it is used in that sort of mode
and of course you know we're familiar
with advertising with football games
ionically observational usage that's the
same thing as a spy satellite right
taking pictures the ground front firm
ownership for particular purpose in this
case entertainment
on the plus side airships have very
quite quite flights which can be
important they have very very heavy lift
at very cheap power expenditures by
using buoyant lift if you need to lift
something very heavy a short amount of
distance it can be very effective to do
this and it's interesting there's a
number of companies who've tried to do
this and not quite made cargo lifters
was a an example a very sad example not
too long ago that it looked promising
but didn't quite make it there's
projects to lift lumber and various
other you know shorter haul heavy lift
things but if you're dealing with
airships
they're slow again that's really what
probably killed them in terms of air
travel and they're very vulnerable to
the whip how many people here are
familiar with the story the Macon in the
apron okay so they were airships that
were posted on the Pacific coast as a
matter of fact you probably have seen a
hangar you know not too far from here
and that was used to house those two
airships and they were ideal for
patrolling the Pacific waters because
they could slowly and it would give you
the time to really observe and see if
there is anything in the waters watch
for submarines and other you know other
potential intrusions both of them went
down and storms the problem is they're
very vulnerable to win you are big as an
airship and your light otherwise you
wouldn't be up there you have a lot of
inertia but you're still very you know
very vulnerable to win so winds start to
blow and you're going to be going off
course and the bottom line is in our
atmosphere you know wind happens right
it's a it's a very volatile place the
atmosphere close to the earth
so as I told you we're not aiming our
airships or that what I'll be calling
Geo SATs in just a little bit we're not
aiming at operating close to the earth
like most airships do current we're
aiming it operating them in the
stratosphere there's a few reasons for
that the first of all is as a satellite
as you get higher and higher altitude
you get to see more and more of the
earth the more more of the earth that
you can see for communications or even
for observation purposes it's very
valuable so the stratosphere is at a
nice altitude I mean you're looking
depending on what units you want 13
miles up 17 17 kilometers 250 250
kilometers up you're high enough that
you actually have a fairly large
footprint and of course you have enough
atmosphere there you believe me no one
go outside but it's enough atmosphere
there that you can still fly an airship
you can fly balloons up to upwards of a
hundred thousand feet you're getting
dicey you definitely have a lot less
payload at those sorts of altitudes but
if you're looking at say you know 70,000
feet or so you're going to have enough
atmosphere that you can hold a decent
payload most importantly low wind speed
it seems perverse and I'll show you in a
diagram of the wind speeds based on
altitude but the wind speeds in the
stratosphere are low after you get
through the jet string the low end of
the stratosphere you know you're
probably you know you're going to have
to be careful with but once you're out
of the jet stream the wind speeds the
average wind speeds drop precipitously
and that's an important regime to take
advantage of and that's why pretty much
all high altitude airships have aimed at
this target altitude that's the primary
reason but it's not a very pleasant
environment you're looking temperatures
minus 30 degrees minus 40 degrees
Celsius you're really going to challenge
a lot of a lot of your electronics a lot
of your controls and certainly if you're
ever going to bring people up there
you're going to have to you know come up
with a very comfortable way to hold them
also not much atmosphere close enough to
a vacuum it's going to be a problem for
electronics again if you don't condition
them or you have haven't used the right
electronics most of what we'll be doing
is having areas that will have pressure
in them so that we can use more
off-the-shelf electronics another kind
of interesting thing is it just so
happens to stratosphere is where the
ozone is as a matter of fact if you ever
look at a heat profile which we will one
thing that's weird about the ozone is as
you go up it gets warmer and that's
because that's where the ultraviolet
hits the ozone first and warming it up
so
for research it can be very useful for
people again electronics you have to be
careful so this is why I'm talking about
in terms of wind speed so this is a
graph showing the speed of wind and
knots versus the altitude and I've
highlighted where the stratosphere is it
actually goes a little bit higher than
this this is the region that you want to
have airships fly in it happens me right
around 70,000 feet and if you fly there
you can actually bring up enough power
to maintain your station if you start
flying in here and Jetstream you're
pretty much hosed and you could probably
get away with the winds up to 20 knots
but you know the higher you don't
altitude the less less you're going to
be able to carry um it it's relatively
consistent with density of air so if you
build a vehicle to fly at a certain
density of air around it you will move
up and down but you're probably going to
be okay and it also depends on how close
to this barrier you are the closer you
are to the barrier more the lessons are
the less stable it is the more you go up
the more stable it is because there's
less for the air aim you don't have the
geography of the earth you do have to
worry about hot zones a hurricane for
example would push the atmosphere up but
you're still able to it's a manageable
sort of thing you're probably going to
have to at times go off of station up to
a kilometer which might sound like a lot
but you're talking a fraction of a
degree right so in terms of
communications in terms of observation
it's not so bad
resolution
the sorts of resolution you could get
you know it depends on the equipment you
take up right it's because going to pin
on your optical resolution and whatever
resolution of the sensing equipment you
have on the other end of it right with
current technology well the best thing
to think about is it's like any other
aerial photography system and you'll be
able to get the same you could actually
see people and you know I don't know the
most cutting-edge technologies out there
in terms of capturing images and am sure
that there are organizations that do
that you know but if you're talking you
know you'd probably talking license
plate reading sort of scales or feasible
you'll have you always hear stories
about reading some news newspaper I
don't think that would be very realistic
but certainly identifying people or
identifying that it's a person not this
a particular person would be very doable
a lot of the images the high resolution
images you have on google earth as i was
talking to david are the high resolution
ones tend to be more aerial photography
and it's that sort of resolution you
would get right but you're always going
to get better resolution at this
altitude say 13 miles as opposed to a
traditional spy satellite at a hundred
and fifty miles because resolutions
largely depend upon distance and
equipment
does that answer your question okay any
other questions about this the
stratosphere the airships right right so
how what's the standard deviation of the
wind speed as opposed it's actually
similar question as before I don't have
a plot of that but you're talking at
wind speeds typically peaking in the
stratosphere at that altitude of 20
knots and then you know on average 10
Don so you know it's not again it's it's
a it's a fairly friendly altitude the
caveat being its weather dependent right
because there are events it will push
you know that will push the layers of
the atmosphere up and you're going to
have to go with them the nice thing is
when you build a balloon it stays at a
constant density of air right so those
densities are there are kind of what to
find the layers so you tend to go up or
down with that movement
there'll be more on that by the way in
the tech challenges this is the plot I
just wanted to show you because it
highlights really the fact that the
ozone is there you look at the
stratosphere most the atmosphere gets
colder colder colder as you get out
that's because you have less air around
you to get retained the warmth less air
above you to keep the warmth in its
being radiated out but as soon as you
get into the stratosphere you knows it
takes off in the other direction
slightly it almost gets to the freezing
point of water and in that is because
you have the ozone and it's heating from
the top down from the absorption of the
ultraviolet so as you're there if you
start going up you realize you're
exposing yourself to morale to violet
and you do have to worry about how the
ozone is going to affect your materials
how much a very gate how much variations
are the diurnal cycle the day/night
cycle in terms of the temperature the
ambient temperature doesn't change that
much the temperature of your vehicle
will change dramatically in part that's
because of the thinner atmosphere your
you aren't going to be able to stabilize
your temperature as well so when you're
exposed to the Sun you're going to heat
up as much it's much like being at orbit
so you have to deal with that cycle and
that's actually one of the key tech
challenges to staying up there ways
around that are you can either super
pressurize your balloon which means it
keeps constant volume so when you heat
up you know you're not going to tend to
make yourself less or more more dense
right so you have the constant volume
you just have more pressure in there and
that keeps you from sinking going up and
down as much but it's a more complex
product to build as a matter of fact the
ultra if there are there's a nasa
project out there called the ultra ultra
long duration balloon uld be and it's
designed around a hundred day life cycle
and it's a super pressurized
okay so all this talk so far hopefully
you know haven't bored you too much has
been background for what we call the EOC
OS SAT and eos just stands for edge of
space instead of Earth orbiting
satellite edge of space satellite and
the question is how will these improve
the world so this is kind of a bread and
butter of what I'm talking about
so we're talking about using inflatable
technology technologies like I said that
can go up to a hundred thousand feet
vehicles long capable long duration
flight but we're using off-the-shelf
components there's nothing in terms of
our technology the funny thing is was
David asked me to do a tech talk at
Google I was saying well what's the
cutting-edge technology and it's not
specifically it would fail if it was for
balloons because you need to use
reliable technologies you need to use
the stuff that exists what's different
is we have some specific techniques for
dealing with some key issues around
flight duration and material science has
created some products for us and
everyone that started to make solar
cells lighter and to make the structure
lighter so that you can get more up
there
so here's a picture that is actually not
quite accurate of our vehicle this was a
vehicle we had designed for a different
project where was this was a project
that Alfred if ur worked on to
potentially launch a vehicle from
altitude so it's got an open area in the
middle specifically designed so it can
support a large structure so it actually
hang a canopy underneath that would have
a a traditional launch vehicle that
would then drop from it it didn't
actually fire through it it's a nice
thought but you would lose vehicle but
but to actually carry the vehicles there
and that's not there in the in the
current design but it's a high-altitude
unmanned ship alright if you're going to
fly for a long time you don't want
people out there 13 mile flight we're
designing it around three months on
station that's pretty aggressive we're
confident we can hit the three months on
station which is actually very similar
to the uld be work and with an operation
concept beyond three months will work
fine
an important thing so it would use as a
communication platform in an observation
platform just like a satellite would but
a key difference is the projected price
on this again laying out the designs we
already have we're looking at a retail
price of around 10 million per vehicle
and of course as we go and optimize our
products will try and make it cheaper
but the price is very important because
this puts it in the reach of
municipalities it puts it in the reach
of states it puts in the reach of even
large corporations making it possible
for more people to get access to the
sort of capabilities we're talking about
so as you can imagine you know some
large corporations will have assets at
risk the hot chips at risk so they're
interested in protecting them if you're
looking at rolling out communication
services t st. Montana or to Africa you
know all of a sudden you have a platform
by which you can do this so the reason I
bring that up is there are projects that
will succeed you know Lockheed is
working on a project right now for the
Air Force for a high altitudes solution
for security purposes so a spy satellite
on a blimp and that project has a budget
of 100 million dollars and that project
will probably complete you know in the
2015 timeframe and I'm absolutely
convinced that they will succeed I mean
it's been tried before but this time it
will succeed because the technology is
there but they're not going to produce a
vehicle that cities can buy
and that's what we're doing that's
different
these are just other views you know one
I just want to say you know you know
there's areas for equipment but more
importantly this one because if any of
you have worked on balloons it's a semi
dirigibles basically it's not a complete
rigid structure but you have to have
enough rigidity in the vehicle to be
able to anchor certain points but you
also have to provide enough lecture so
as you go through different zones of
instabilities you go up through the jet
stream that you don't break effectively
you don't break your corners right
because it's it's going to have to flex
and give the all did anyone else have
any questions on the shape or structure
of the balloon in the book ah you walked
away that part I already covered that
um you know the elevators may or may not
be there they they're simply there to
help control pitch a little bit the the
amount of control surface there is not
is not significant so it becomes a
question at low altitude whether it
makes sense to handle it tho those are
meant more for the low altitude stuff
and not the high altitude but
specifically how this is different than
a lot of other airships is other
airships tend to be long and narrow you
know they're trying you know all
airships are trying to reduce the amount
of surface area in the front I increase
the amount of volume two things about
this ship is it's built specifically to
be able to pitch up at a very high angle
be stable there's a lot of baffling
there which you're not going to see to
help make that possible that's very
important for cutting through the jet
stream and other areas of instability as
fast as possible and then the second is
it does have a fair amount of roll
stability in comparison to other
vehicles again that's to help it survive
you know controllably through some of
these regions and then also as you're
looking at different uses of it the
stability roll stability becomes an
issue I'm seeing a question sort of no
how will it be used so the applications
for this product are pretty pretty easy
to articulate and there's probably more
up here than than I have and certainly
more probably in the heads around here
then then you know that i have on one
slide some of the primary areas that
we've had discussions with around
disaster emergencies right if you have
one of these vehicles up and also give
you some coverage circles as examples
you can provide communication services
within an area you know to anyone it has
access to it event use so you know
disasters aren't the only reason they
have temporary communication Burning Man
Olympics right it's basically an
alternative to a geosynchronous
satellite in this mode it's close to the
earth you don't have the light time
delays you have better link margins you
have the ability to have it over any
spot on the earth one of the things I
didn't cover with geosynchronous
satellites is they can only literally be
over the equator so with this it can be
over wherever you want it to be
the other is you can put me d you can
put protocols on there that operate
traditionally closer to the earth you
don't have to use just the other side
you know the typical satellite
communications ke bande or other
communications you can put stuff that
works terrestrially one caveat you do
have to use high gain antenna so your
coverage for that sort of different
observation again staying consistent
with my comparison to satellites I put
it second but I will tell you right now
this is what's driving the market for
these crafts it's not a surprise
lockheed has 100 million dollar contract
for this we're talking to customers
about using this vehicle and hopefully
we close the customer next few months
about using this vehicle for persistent
security there's too many people have
too many assets at risk that want to see
if something you know if something's
coming close to a pipeline is coming
close to a shipping channel coming close
to a port
also something I like to promote because
living in California I get tired of this
it's a great platform for early warning
fire detection so even though we talk
about observation from the standpoint of
you know spy satellites Google Earth
security there's tremendous applications
just like satellites view of whether you
have earth resource mapping you have
crop management the same is true of this
and it's at a price which now the state
of California can potentially use it to
detect wildfires before they become an
issue real-time traffic I don't know if
any of you use 511 org google google
maps one thing that would be nice is
have a button and click and you can see
video of traffic issues as they arise
there's no reason you couldn't do
applications like that weather
permitting and of course has already
harped on a lot security
so I've been talking about abstract that
you have a big coverage circle this is
the actual RF horizon of the vehicle at
60,000 feet so any communication that
you could do with a normal satellite
today you could do in that sort of
coverage circling so let's say you want
to drill out a competitor to dishtv to
direct TV or you know you just wanted to
provide direct TV like satellite
internet access to parts of Nevada you
could now do that with it with a much
cheaper vehicle
so you would have certainly if you were
looking at commercial aspects you're
looking at a big enough media market
that you can actually you know make
money on this or if you're looking at it
you know as a government and you're
looking is there enough service that you
can provide to justify the cost there
there are
this is one that's actually a little bit
I think more important
so if you look at high gain coverage so
I assumed a 5 degree antenna which would
give you enough link Marge enough power
radiated power that you could use things
like wimax you could use self you know
you could provide cell coverage that's
the coverage circle now that coverage
circle could move anywhere in that other
circle right you can choose where it's
at but if you were pointing at the Bay
Area that's what you could cover or a
little bit easier to see that's the sort
of range that you can cover so imagine
you have an earthquake
you can have your cell phone antenna up
there anyone with a cell phone could
text for help
that's in that circle
no one has to be left unfound if they
have a cell phone or they have some
other way to communicate to you also as
an emergency measure could use things
like cell phones and other communication
technology to deliver a message to
everyone examples from Katrina where the
emergency workers couldn't get messages
to people to tell them where to go you
could do it there's no reason any large
city shouldn't do this
the other nice thing about the airships
other than being able to be permanently
over an area is their mobile so one one
of the potential discussions we had with
Homeland Security was the fact that how
long would it take you if you stationed
a few airships over the US to get from
point A to point B if you had an airship
you know based on the west coast over
the air you'd want to do that four winds
because the jet stream goes from West
East you can give me on the eastern
seaboard within two days if you a bit
basically chose the correct light that's
assuming you were at altitude with
basically three airships you could cover
the contiguous us within half a day so
the model here that I'm kind of hinting
at is you have an airship up over the
middle of the US and you know a
hurricane is coming to a certain area
you could start to move it there you
don't have to have every municipality
buy one of these for it to be an
effective solution
so just to give you a little bit more
reality of kind of the work that been
done this was a proof-of-concept airship
that our CTO dr. Alfred different
mentioned a couple times now this 175
foot vehicle that had been built as a
test platform for the Air Force the
unfortunate thing is the Air Force had a
requirement which cannot as far as i can
tell be met by ner ship and that as they
wanted rapid deployment so they wanted
to be able to in to deploy and inflate
the vehicle have a take off in the field
the one thing about an airship is
they're big there are lots of fabric and
what happened in the test flight of this
is at launch time a dust devil went
right over it when it was not inflated
that was not very good
I basically destroyed the airship that
you actually i wish i had the video with
me but you get to see the the streamer
of the vehicle the fabric basically go
up in a helical pattern it's actually
pretty powerful dust devil people you
know there are some people fortunately
no one got seriously hurt but there are
some people that you know you have a lot
of people unfurling it they weren't able
to let go fast enough and they were
actually falling a fair distance just in
that time frame that took them to
mentally let go the vehicle so wind is
is a problem particularly when you're
not inflate once your inflated you're
going to move right and and you have to
make sure your vehicle can handle the
stresses but you're not going to have
that problem where it just kind of gets
ripped apart so if anyone tells you you
know they're going to use an airship
make sure that they're going to inflate
it in a hangar in that take off just the
inflation will take a couple hours ramey
you're pumping a lot of healing minute
it there are ways to speed it up but not
you know their limits
but on on other flights that I worked on
actually it's technically at 90,000 feet
but you know 100,000 feet this is over
Nevada so you know this gives you a
night and looking towards the west coast
but this gives you an idea of the the
sort of view that you get from up there
eventually of course we'd love to be
able to take people up and all that kind
of stuff but the primary uses of the
product as I mentioned our unmanned two
hours that that's that's the killer
thing about being able to pitch and take
off very quickly through the atmosphere
you won't be able to do that with people
but it takes off much like a weather
balloon would in terms of speed so we
you know it as an airship you don't want
to mess around with being in the jet
stream it just you know unless it's
going the way you want
okay so life is great we you know we can
build one of these off-the-shelf
technology life is you know easy right I
wish it was so I was asked earlier about
the choice between helium and hydrogen
for the vehicle the first vehicles were
that we will build will be helium base
for a very practical reason you know
although hindin the hydrogen was not the
responsible for the Hindenburg accident
hydrogen is very flammable very
explosive until we have really worked
out the design in terms of static
discharge in the sorts of environment
we're going to we're rustic with healing
there's no reason to blow up a vehicle
even though be unmanned you know to
begin to begin with but the plan would
be to move to hydrogen hydrogen through
mylar has a lower effusion rate so one
of the key problems with a balloon is
holding the helium long enough to have a
long-duration flight and you know the
the ways around that is you use thicker
mylar which of course makes a blend
heavier you can't lift as much you you
know make sure it's well sealed you
bring up liquid helium so you can pump
into it which isn't really an option for
hydrogen because gaseous hydrogen is not
too bad to deal with liquid hydrogen
no what about water well so you could
potentially bring up water and
electrolysis and does there are actually
some groups that are working on that
sort of thing and that might be a good
way to go if you're going with hydrogen
the trade off though if you're going to
use liquid helium just so you know
liquid helium or waters hydrogen is one
the weight of it but more importantly
the balloons that typically lasts
longest are those super pressurized ones
i told you about which we're fully
sealed so if you're going to have any
system where you're going to insert
helium into it or you're going to insert
hydrogen into it you're going to have
you're going to have to design something
no one's done which is the super are
pressurized balloon that's right now
that you can actually put material into
you put the answer to
well then then you just have to have a
way to control but you could do them I
mean that might be a way to do it I mean
you might be able to do the same thing
with the electrolysis but you're still
going to have to design something which
is this balloon which can support that
right because you'd actually be having
mass on the the structure of the balloon
where right now they're built to be in
an envelope and the the stresses are put
going down although its interests handy
and I it's not one that I necessarily
know it's been explored yeah well you
can make more ozone I think we need some
so other challenges the the day night
cycle if you don't go with a super
pressurized balloon if you have free
free floating balloons which are easier
to build and cheaper to build they will
they will become denser when they get
cold and they will become a lot more
buoyant when they they warm up because
they're going to warm up more than the
surrounding air so it's not like you'll
stay with the area you're in you'll
actually move between zones and it's
actually not so much that you would move
the issue is that it puts you in this
threat where you could move into zones
of too much wind because especially if
you're looking at communication or other
things if you're looking relatively
straight up or straight down vertical
motions almost you know insignificant so
you can you can literally move a few
kilometres and not affect your your your
mission
the other issue which has been and it
has been in issues generating enough
power or more accurately generating
enough power without using so much mass
so you know and the power you're going
to use up their traditionally is going
to be solar cell that's been true for
quite a while I do i do have people
every so often that want to use wind
power but if you ever find out a way to
do that that's not a perpetual motion
machine let me know and then the other
issue I put up your yeah well there are
you could probably come up with ways
where if you use different levels that
you could do that there are actually
interesting propulsion techniques where
people are using kites for both ships
and you could use for airships so you
drop a kite into the jet stream at the
altitude you want you pull along so that
that's definitely for motive power is
very good the nice thing is if you
generate enough power to move which we
have to do we have so much power up
there for the payload for the
observation satellite yeah I remember
having a discussion because we're
talking about a 400 kilogram payload
which is a pretty big payload for an
observation package and they were asking
me how much power could they have and so
I was running through and saying okay if
you're assuming the steady state on
average you could have 10 kilowatt hours
per day and they're like it's like well
if we didn't have that much power we
couldn't move with with the winds you
know peaking at 20 knots
now I kind of put this in a technical
challenge slide but a key thing that is
actually kind of kept things from going
is the markets out there the the people
that would be buying products are sorry
funding products developing products
don't want to take technical risks this
has been true since the dot-com boom are
gone bust relic there's been this
movement of the market to say if it's a
technical risk don't fund it I find that
to be frustrating to some degree because
as you look at the dot-com boom although
there are people that took stupid
technical risks largely the failures
where companies VC took too much market
risk but you know there's been a way
moving back if you've talked to any DC
out there and I've talked to a few no
one wants to find any technical risk
that's changing
so why now well one is clearly new
materials if anyone's been following
companies like nanosolar and and the
companies like that and various nanotech
products from making carbon fiber and
all these things you be able to make
structures lighter that are very strong
that's part of what makes us possible
and specifically solar-powered buildings
because the weight of the solar panels
is the heaviest thing on the view so the
two key things one is the the whole
principles printable solar cell and
before that the amorphous solar cells
that you could potentially bind to
canvas rather than having to use
metallic substrates so these are things
that suddenly made something that had
been effectively a bit of a dream that's
why I know Lockheed will be successful
these things have changed and now you
know those barriers are gone and
importantly also locking is a good
example it's persistent securities now
spurring the market there is no
persistent security solution there is no
magic 24 satellite that sits there and
gives you the ability to watch a car
that's driving towards you or your
refinement all right
since there's such a hunger for security
solutions people are willing to fund the
technical risks that they weren't before
and we're a beneficiary of that and
there will be others and there needs to
be others this space needs to be funded
people need to develop products in this
area they'll benefit
if you're ever going to work with the
company or anyone else in any new
technology make sure that they have the
practical experience this is an example
of a flight that I'll worked on that was
successful it's very simple one of the
balloons hell's popped and that's
actually the picture of the excess of
the redundant balloon cell fortunately
that ended up in the frame front the
camera you know you're dealing with
stuff going up at very high altitudes
you know you're going to have to have
the ability to understand what kind of
failures are going to happen so that's
it for for the talk you know that I kind
of put up here but are there more
questions out there must a big little
the sexy getting commercial
to this our heavier-than-air carefully
like Julius okay so the question was
will this succeed or sooner or will you
a heavier-than-air uavs such as helios
it's solar-powered succeed and the
answer is right now airships have the
advantage because one they take up a lot
more power with them right so helios has
to use its power to stay aloft where
we're already loft the other right now I
can have one controller in terms of an
unmanned airship control a fleet war
with Helios and other unmans UAVs the
costly UAVs is dirt cheap right in
comparison to the sort of stuff I mean
you can get UAVs potentially down to a
quarter million the problem is the
cheapest UAVs to fly right now are six
hundred to a thousand dollars per flight
out if you're doing a to 24 by 7 365 day
your security application it's a
no-brainer so well that that's the
question is will they build the software
and stuff that will allow them to hover
well enough but I the that won't get
them over the power and then the other
the other issue right now is the Helios
is still not a permanent flight I mean
eventually they will but when they get
to that they'll they'll still need me
most of that power for the vehicle not
for the payload so you need to be able
to get up an altitude stay over a fixed
point pretty much and then provide
enough power and control for the payload
that you you know you haven't so it's
airships just a more natural fit for
that and as the price comes down on
airships then why would you do it
because eventually i'll be able to get
airships i'm convinced down to you know
a million's a couple million for
but it's you know it's degrees out it
should be better to stay in the same
place like an electric fan yeah it's a
hile tits it's funny brought up you know
Helios it's it's using a high altitude
prop with electric with electric motors
the funny thing is you don't want to
turn the prop very fast anyhow because
it's it's that's very long and you don't
want to exceed the sound barrier to tips
which is very easy to do because the
speed of sound drops at those altitudes
as well be add so to stay on station
you're using electrical power electrical
motors with special double helical props
to to drive the low low density air
what's the worst weather you can take
off
so in terms of on the ground you know
for normal operations we would target
five to ten knot winds or under under
ten knot winds and try to try keep it
under five it's really a question of the
risk that you're willing to take with
damaging the vehicle and stuff around it
so in emergency situations you're going
to come down right in and you're just
going to you're going to deal with those
risks you know I would start to get
nervous if you start getting 20-knot
winds and you start getting gusts gusts
are actually the bigger thing as you get
close to you know any structure and you
get a gust you're potentially going to
run into it that's the nature of the
risk but you know the nice thing is if
you think about where you put the hangar
because you'll you know you fly the
vehicle you know to and from a location
and you'll typically go on station a
couple days one thing I didn't talk
about a funny thing about the one of the
limitations is also somewhat of a
benefit and that is you have me we'd
like the flight duration be six months
and you're having a three month duration
longer would be better the longer the
duration there's no doubt it's better
but it's actually advantageous that you
cycle the vehicles because you will be
able to upgrade the payload you will be
able to update the pay would you be able
to repair the paler so even if let's say
we had a flight time of five years I'm
absolutely convinced that customers
would be bringing things down every
probably year or two anyhow to up to
upgrade equipment so you know at some
point you get to a natural crossover
point for the duration
whole hour but the final question may
actually it was the size the vehicle
again mr. hope so that how prototype was
in our 75 feet wall that was 175 foot
that was a two-third scale prototype for
that project the the vehicle that we're
looking at producing as an EOS at is
going to be a 50 meter vehicle so 150
feet so about that size for the unmanned
vehicle and if we do go to a man vehicle
be about 75 meters so about 215 and feet
about the same size as the 75 meter
vehicle it has yeah this vehicle sorry
that there was at one point there's
another vehicle as i said we originally
started as a a space Inquisition so
there's another vehicle that was
designed which is a hybrid airship
rocket that would actually go from
60,000 feet to orbit that you know we've
we've kind of cycled back away from that
but that vehicle would be much much
larger so
you know I forgot to look that up but
it's I think it's about 400 feet long
yeah so we're our vehicle is about 215
feet long but ballast of 215 feet wide
we're much wider because of the pitch
stability so the Hindenburg was 400 by
probably a hundred feet something like
them I apologize for not having that
because I knew I would get asked that
especially here google it yeah we're
here anything else look at them
no we we use ballast to come down so you
basically just pump more more of namely
ozone into the vehicle but now you'd
pump air into into the cells use the
pressure and lower lower the vehicle
down we definitely don't want to lose
any helium if we don't have to okay well
thank you much everyone I hope you
enjoyed the talk and if you have any
questions don't hesitate to give me a
whole thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
