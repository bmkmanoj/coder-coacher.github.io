less follow Peters introduction word for
word I too I'm an emeritus professor I
also think that most of you know me my
name is David Bradford I'm emeritus
professor at the University of
Nottingham and it's my great pleasure to
be able to introduce the first keynote
speaker and to be able to say that it's
very largely due to him that we are all
here today I think you could cast your
mind back just over 25 years now to the
formation of Adobe because for those of
you that don't know and i will no time
to go through all the details consult
wikipedia where there is excellent cv
for our distinguished speaker dr. John
Warnock but broadly speaking he and his
friend colleague Chuck desh ki were
there in the glory days of Xerox PARC at
the end of the 1970s and early 1980s
like many other people there they became
very frustrated Xerox's total inability
to exploit what they were creating and
they left in late nineteen eighty-two
and the rest as they say is history they
founded Adobe suddenly for me Adobe and
John first came to my attention with a
moment I will never ever forget it was a
9-inch macintosh screen in early
nineteen eighty-five driving on the
apple laserwriter which had got adobe
postscript embedded inside it and of
course the processor speed and the
general speck of that laser printer were
far in excess of those of the macintosh
itself and it just changed everything i
mean there was this beautiful typography
and even the boot up page was a work of
art do you remember you you started off
the laserwriter it threw out a page with
beautiful curves on it and actually told
you how many pages you'd printed so far
on this thing and very shortly
thereafter the language that was doing
all that PostScript it really did change
the world because I think it's fair to
say that the Apple and laser art a
combination did kick start the desktop
publishing revolution
and within the next 45 years John and
his colleagues managed to just conquer
also the professional newspaper magazine
print publish industry totally and by
1990 the world really had changed for
good but I think in setting the scene
for today's talk rather than the
originator PostScript language which is
still there of course what happened in
the early 1990s I think was very
significant John and his colleagues as
again I'm sure we all know came out with
a more compact more linearized more
static very portable document format PDF
based on the PostScript imaging model
and I believe is just tell me I think
last time we look the work there seem to
be two hundred million PDFs available on
the web i think it's now something more
like 500 million other it really is a
success story if you want accurate
representation of documents no matter
how technical no matter what the color
space is PDF is the de facto standard
and there it is but roundabout at the
same time of course we had HTML and we
had the web a very very different model
much more flexible much lower quality
pretty good at what it does in some ways
but drives you mad at times and these
two standards for the past 15 years have
been kind of moving along together not
getting in each other's way too much and
I think many of us feel well as a gap in
the middle that needs to be addressed
there's going to be some issues that
sooner or later we cannot brush under
the carpet and I honestly think we are
at a 1985 moment again because the thing
that is changing the world in my view
are these tablets which are changing
everything but I was delighted therefore
by the title of John's keynote address
which is the evolving form of documents
and i'm pretty sure that some of the
things i've alluded to exactly what
worrying him and adobe just at the
moment so do please give a very big
welcome to John Warnock
thank you David it's a pleasure to be
here I'm really happy to see sort of the
age of the audience I expected some
older people and there aren't many so
that's great so I'm going to go into a
little history about why document
creation on computers sort of became the
way that it became and give you try to
give you a little insight into what
happened so today after 30 years
documents are almost completely
computer-generated there's the old world
of paced up and Reuben LIF and waxers
and things like that that my wife who's
a graphic artist understood very well
have gone away they've been replaced
with computer tools that allow you to
completely control type illustrations
color halftoning and documents have
advanced from that to contain multimedia
components animations all manner of
audio all kinds of things so the world
has become a much more complex place and
we're finding that most of the documents
are computer generated and that's sort
of allowed for the elimination of a
great huge huge number of paper
workflows that existing commerce today
so how did all that happen it all really
started to happen in a serious way at
xerox palo alto research center which is
not very far from here this was during
it started during the early 70s when a
lot of the ARPA community chief
scientists were hired by xerox to form
the xerox palo alto research they all
came together in a in one place and the
the Charter was to build the office of
the future so what they built during the
70's was way before the PC way before
the Apple to way be
for any P home computers everyone at
Xerox PARC had a personal computer with
a graphical user interface a raster
bitmap display a keyboard a mouse an
external hard drive they were all
connected by ethernet together they all
had access to file servers at both black
and white and color laser printers that
were invented at xerox parc and they had
the first word processors what you see
is what you get kind of word processors
we called a Bravo a park and that later
became word because Charles simoni who
invented bravo went to go to Microsoft
to invent word we had mail programs that
look almost identical to the mail
programs that you have today now this is
30 years ago on inconceivably small
machines there isn't a phone that
doesn't have a hundred times the power
that these machine machines had so what
did this look like well this was the
alto and the alto had a display that
looked like a printed page now xerox was
in the copier business and so as if any
of you are old of which are not old
enough but any of you remember the early
xerox ads it was how mirror miraculous
the pages copied with it with the
xerography process so Xerox cared about
documents and they cared about
topography so you have an eight and a
half by eleven screen and you composed
your documents on that screen by typing
and back spacing and you had your first
text editor and you would save the
document often you would send it over
the ethernet to a laser printer in that
case it was a dover and it would print
at 60 pages a minute and this was in
1970s Steve Jobs visited one day at park
and it blew his mind so he left hired a
bunch of the park people and started to
build the Lisa computer Lisa computer
didn't get a lot of things right so then
he started to build the Macintosh
microsoft finally figured out looked at
the apple and then they sort of copied
that but all of sort of the document
technologies and the environment you
lifted in today was sort of first
started at xerox parc so how did type
work at this result the bitmap display
was really black and white there were
only two states on the display it didn't
have any gray scale capability and the
tablet or the the page was was it had a
density in a resolution of 72 dots to
the inch so a 12-point type looked like
the top line and when you printed it on
the printer it looked like that because
the printer was 240 dots to the inch now
how did you make type well you made it
bit by bit you made each little matrix
for each little letter by hand and so if
you want a 12-point type you made a face
for 12 point type if you wanted 14 point
type you made a face for 14 point type
and they made a complete suite of about
six typefaces for both the 72 dapper
inch display and for the 240 per inch
printer well the El Alto became sort of
long in the teeth and so they started to
make other machines so they the second
machine was the dolphin and then there
was the Dorado and these two machines
were different okay they had different
resolution displays different format
displays and they had different color de
couleur capabilities so they were color
displays they also had different
printers that were a different
resolution so this caused a problem so
Chuck yesh key started a laboratory
called the imaging sciences lab and we
were he hired me and we were chartered
with exploring device independent
graphics and printing protocols
and worked on a project called inner
press and the whole point of this was
how can we avoid redoing this huge
amount of work on typefaces for every
new device that comes down the line
because it was a huge amount of work and
if you really wanted a thousand
typefaces you're talking about an
incalculable amount of work to bit tune
each little typeface well we worked on
inner press but we could never resolve
the fact that type and graphics were
different so type was one thing graphics
were another an inner press they were
kept separate and it was it was an
extraordinarily difficult problem to try
to bring these two worlds together we
failed at xerox but we found at adobe
and we started working on the PostScript
language and this was a necessity is the
mother of invention first of all we said
let's make PostScript a full programming
language let's not leave out anything
let's put in conditional statements
let's put in lit loops let's put in data
structures let's put in the whole nine
yards mathematics sines cosines all of
that stuff so PostScript we designed as
a full programming language and we
decided we had to make text and graphics
under a unified imaging model and what
that meant is that we had to make text
represented as outlines in other words
they were analytically represented as
character shapes and then the
insurmountable problem was how do you
rasterize those so that they look good
well we figured out a way to do that and
it it was based on simply of one simple
idea you don't take an outline shape and
figure out what bits to turn on you
squeeze and deform the outline shape so
that it produces good looking characters
relative to the rest are
and that's the simple idea that made it
all work so now you could rotate text
you can scale text you could share text
you can do anything you want with text
and you can take the rest of the
graphics on the page and do the same
thing and that was the PostScript
imaging model now the most important
thing that we did was we made the
representation device independent what
does that mean the document depends on
no information about the device when you
have a postscript file and you send it
around the network or you take a PDF
file and you send it around the network
it has no knowledge of the device it's
going to be rendered on keep this in
mind this is probably the most important
thing the PostScript and PDF
accomplished also we punted on character
encodings we said we cannot have the
language depend on a specific character
encoding because there were no Universal
standards Unicode was I think somebody's
faraway dream at that point in time
there were multiple standards on the
Microsoft platforms and on the IBM
platforms and on the Apple platforms
they were all different character
encodings Japan had two standards for
character encodings in Japan China I
don't know what was he happening at
China at that point but when we
anticipated that we would have to go
into Arabic devanagari all these wild
languages that had different type
setting rules vertical and horizontal
type setting rules and so we said we
have to make a general enough structure
to adapt to all of that which we did so
what happened it was first introduced in
1985 on the apple laserwriter and as
David pointed out that that shocked the
typesetting world terrified the
typesetting world and and really
democratized publishing we
did one thing when we had announced it
on the apple laserwriter we also
announced it on the lino tronic 100
which had a 1200 spot per inch was a
1200 papa rinse photo typesetter that
would take a postscript page and take
exactly what you had on the laser writer
and render it a very very high
resolution on the on the line neutronic
100 the first edition of the post group
manual was printed on the lino tronic
and that's the way it worked in 86
digital equipment which then became
compact which of them became HP licensed
postscript deck was a big company in
those days in 87 IBM and HP license
postscript which was the end of the game
once they licensed postscript it the
floodgates opened in 1990 there were 31
printer manufacturers that supported
PostScript and they produced a hundred
and ten products in 1990 Microsoft
decided they were going to compete and
so they came out with their version not
one single printer / shipped from from
Microsoft in 1991 I had a crazy idea of
how to take a postscript file which
didn't have everything you need to sort
of print the page and sort of flatten it
and turned it over to my best data
structure guys and said design a format
that has legs that can be extended that
can adopt to new things and Peter
hibbard and Richard Cohen and Doug brats
came up with the PDF file format which
has evolved and evolved and evolved so
in 1993 we have we announced Acrobat in
PDF and I at first nobody could figure
out what in the hell this was good for
so you know it just it's sort there were
some government agencies that love this
thing okay the Center for Disease
Control said we can send documents all
over the world instantly talking about
outbreaks of contagious diseases without
having to print them and ship them and
this is going to save a lot of lives so
they adopted very early the IRS de
adopted very early today each reader
release has about a half a billion
downloads so it just gets downloaded
constantly currently they're about 550
million PDF files on the web pdf has
grown a great deal to try to adapt to
the multimedia world it now incorporates
video 3d annotation OCR for scanned
documents which is great signatures
collaboration interactive meetings I I
know now that most of the documents i
signed i sign electronically these since
they're encrypted they can't be modified
they're much more secure than paper
documents and we have all become a
national archive standard for documents
the cool thing about PDF is it just
works you just send a document and you
can open it and read it and it works
there are substandard implementations of
the readier that some aspects of the
readers don't work I would like to see
that change well now we've got the
proliferation of devices ok we have cell
phones we have tablets we have tablets
in all sizes and shapes we have big
screen computers we have small screen
computers we have portable computers and
my take is this is like paper when you
to give a graphic artists a format and
you say I want you to design me a card
that will serve this function they
design for that size so they will
depending on the content the way that it
goes into a specific format is radically
different for various for various sized
devices the kind of information you
present is different the way you present
the information is different
if it's a link document the way you
handled the links is different so here's
an example this is the new york times on
the web it's a multi-column but their
various rip wits and this is a sense a
static design if you're going to the web
to the new york site times com website
it has layout these are actually videos
that are embedded in it and for the most
part if you really print this thing out
and gather all of it it's about 400
yards long going down the screen so you
scroll down and scroll down and you get
the various sections in the various
layouts now if you download the x reader
which is an air application that was
written in with adobe's tools you get a
very different kind of window this if
you if you make the window wide you'll
get the one on the one on the left if
you start shrinking the window making it
narrow and narrow the page relays out
you'll notice this this picture gets
smaller it spreads to columns and the
reflow some things get collapsed and if
you go down to the far side you'll see
summaries in a linear form in one column
now I think this is probably a model for
a lot of the ways that the magazines
deal with the world so now if you go to
the next representation on a phone this
is my phone I use an android phone the
new york times on the phone app now why
is it a phone app this isn't a web page
this is a phone app and now most of the
magazines and most of the documents you
see don't deliver their content via the
web they deliver the content via an app
and that app is crafted for the device
and it shows on the device in a very
very specific way
and you have to ask yourself why that's
the case i looked up for just the new
android devices so there are about 50 of
them here and i said gee are these
devices consistent along any dimension
and the answer is no they all have very
very different resolutions they have
different formats they're all small well
except for the tablets they're all small
so there's you can categorize them in
three broad categories there's sort of
small medium and large okay so if i'm a
document designer and I really want to
serve all of the device markets I have
to design for small medium and large
because so I tried to do this I've been
writing HTML for a long time and I got
into my html5 manuals and got into the
css3 stuff and we went and got my
favorite supplier of books about that
which is so Riley and and start reading
about it and in that book they suggest
that you have a CSS file for every
device well I'm not going to do that so
let's talk about HTML HTML was first
mentioned by burnt Tim berners-lee in
nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-five
HTML two point O came out ninety-seven
HTML 3.2 and 2008's html5 which is an
evolving standard and this one has been
touted as the future of the web so
everybody says gee you don't need things
like flash and stuff like that you can
all do everything you want and all your
heart's desires in html5 well I don't
know
well HTML does not work well across a
large range of devices I'm sorry it's
just the facts and it's because HTML has
a fundamental design flaw this is at the
lowest level there is a design flaw in
HTML it started with HTML with from Tim
berners-lee representation HTML is
device dependent in the worst possible
way size of HD you cannot draw in HTML I
1 inch square nor can you set 12-point
type so Pete all people know that
12-point type is readable you can't set
12.5 in HTML size in HTML is only
relative to a pixel which is
dimensionless it doesn't have any
dimension size is only determined by the
specs screen width in pixels screen
height in pixels and pixels per inch of
the device on which the page is being
displayed so you have to be aware of the
device that's being displayed to have
any control over size as a designer you
have no control over the absolute size
or the viewable size of anything across
all devices as a matter of fact if you
don't know the device you're going to
you have no idea what size it's going to
be the designer only has size control
when targeting a very specific zai
device which there are thousands I call
this a fundamental design flaw absolute
size matters in designing a document a
business card is different than a
greeting card is different from a
magazine page is different from a
newspaper page they are different sizes
that are all handheld but you design
them differently type size on a handheld
document determines readability and you
don't have control over that shrinking
and enlarging a document only works in a
fairly fixed range all of you who have
phones will see this teeny blot on the
middle of your screen and then you will
zoom in and scroll around until you can
figure out whether you can read
something fortunately there is a simple
fix to HTML too fine a pixel in HTML to
be 172nd of an inch and allow for
fractional fractional pixel positioning
modify the browser's to enforce this
definition but also allow for scaling of
content on the screen so now if this
were the case then you are magically
device-independent you don't have to
know about any specific device because
the breast the browser will render at
the right size you're only designing
against one criteria to size you're not
if you think about it resolution has
nothing to do with anything it's not a
useful concept it doesn't tell you
anything useful about how to do
something this will allow for a unified
device independent imaging model
o'clocks all resolution including
printers remember in the early days of
HTML when you send a page to a printer
and it came out as this little teeny
thing because the resolution was
radically different than the resolution
of the display designers will be able to
design for screen sizes instead of
resolutions they will finally be able to
specify 12-point type and they only have
to specify at once why use CSS and
styles and shapes to worry about
specific devices why don't we worry
about something substantive so the other
thing is hundreds of current work
arounds blogs will not be needed because
the web now I went around there are
hundreds of ways to try God do we do
this with viewports to how in the hell
do we get around this
way that hTML is defined well what I'm
hoping is some responsible entity will
modify a browser to reflect this kind of
change the browser will be released to
find consequences and advantages and if
it's all good news the definition of
HTML should be changed and then it could
join the ranks of useful document
creation tools this is a serious serious
problem and it's a problem that actually
could be solved now that's not all
that's wrong all the pages i showed you
in the first in the first slide were
made by were made by programs like
indesign and illustrator and in
Illustrator and InDesign you sort of
have the full imaging model under your
control and you can do a lot of things
you can have you can have very
sophistication k H&amp;amp;J you can have
sophisticated hyphenation you can have
all of the layout power that you need to
do really good documents html5 doesn't
get there and they did put in html5 some
PostScript like things they put in
canvas okay that's one thing and they
put in SVG but they left type out that's
crazy now why would they leave type out
well because I think they're it's felt
that the mark-up is really important the
mark-up of text is really important that
you want to retain the structure you
want to take retain the structure of the
text wherever text occurs in the
document and I think that's actually a
good idea I really believe in style
sheets I really believe in marking
things to to have different looks and
have those ducks looks beery conformable
but there are different ways to do that
so it occurred to me what would I like
if I had an authoring tool well actually
I would like JavaScript because
JavaScript gives you a huge amount of
flexibility but I need more than
JavaScript what I also need is a way to
sort of layout text easily from
JavaScript so what I would like is G
give me a JavaScript routine where I
give it a section of HTML markup ok and
I give it a sequence of outlines and it
takes the text from the markup and it
puts it into the outlines and flows the
text the way you want it to flow the
text and it does H&amp;amp;J that would be great
but it needs in the background to build
an object model that I can go back and
safe where in the hell did the text land
yes it does we're in sv gia does and
does it do a good job of agent j does it
allow for arbitrary rotation that's good
news I will use it see I knew there was
a reason I had to come to this
conference anyway I think that we live
in a world where almost all the tools
will have to deal across a large number
of devices and those tools if they don't
work need to not necessarily be added to
but fixed so that they're in a useful
environment I would love to do all of
this stuff on the web it's hard and I
would like HTML to become one of those
environments where we can get on I
probably haven't used all of my time but
if there are any questions I wrote a
memo to Adobe a couple of weeks ago sort
of stating this case
you know and it's amazing how it had not
occurred to them that HTML was not
device independent it's just it's
amazing to me anyway questions
no rocks throwing
i we we were very aware of meta fun no
danke nice work wasn't he didn't change
the outlines he tried to figure out what
bits to turn on from the from the
outlines which actually led people to
try to extend his work and all of those
I had none of them worked very well and
the scheme that we came up with actually
worked really well yeah you think you're
gonna persuade Adobe's come on with us
all I'm asking yes I am I'm I would love
it if adobe would in their browser in
the air implementation they have an
opera browser that they use change the
implementation so that it's device
independent I you know if you start
thinking about this and you think about
your job as a designer it makes life so
much simpler to have sort of art fixed
size as a target so if I'm doing for a
phone I would go for a phone that big
design a document and then allow for
scaling in the middle to take over the
rest oh I probably would agree with you
yes
I
I agree with that and I think that you
need to have as I say these flexible
waves of reef lowing text and
repositioning items on the screen and
knowing where they are the New York
Times thing I think that's a very
interesting approach I asked Kevin Lynch
about this and he said there's a lot of
hard programming going on in there and
you know I don't know that you can sort
of statically just with style sheets
represent the re-design of a document in
the way that you have to I think you
really need a programming language in
there somewhere to help solve some of
those problems and make decisions about
certain things and I did to a certain
extent it might even depend a certain on
how with the style of the document I
mean you know it's it's a hard problem I
agree with you but dealing with this
morass is a pain
of the he says that it's a presentation
language it's not a great presentation
language but it's a document structure
language it is sort of a document
structure language but when it first
came out it was sort of a document
structure but then features have been
added to give designers more and more
control you have things like layers you
have all kinds of crap that's been
introduced to give people control over
the look of the document and I agree
that you need document structure I mean
I completely agree with that but you
also need control over design well
everybody so the typical sgml approach
has been in the passenger now you're
hearing just my really biased opinions
so forgive me the approach in the past
is G you have this document structure
layout thing that tells you the
structure of the document and then you
have a DTD that tells you how you're
supposed to represent this thing on the
page I don't typically believe you can
do that with a static data thing I would
rather have a programming language over
here in a document structure here and
let them work together that's what I
would rather have
okay well thank you very much indeed
