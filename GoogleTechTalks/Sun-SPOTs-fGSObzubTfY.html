does cool things like sailing and
photography and he's generally a gadget
kind of geeky person a self-described
but in his professional life he's a
director at sun labs and he's going to
talk to us today about the sunspots
project so please welcome Roger hi so
today I'll tell you a little bit about
sun labs where I come from how we work
and what we work on and then I'll tell
you about this cool project that I like
to talk about called sunspots sun labs
is the research arm of Sun so we're not
the product group we don't build the
standard products we do the
forward-looking stuff and that the key
thing is that we're here to take the
risks so to do the projects that may
fail so we do high-risk high-return
projects that we think are interesting
things to sort of help set directions
for the future for the company and we
have a quick three three step process
for doing this we come up with good
ideas we innovate we build them we
demonstrate and then we transfer them to
the business unit where they make money
off of them that's the theory anyway
turns out that you can have a bunch of
really smart people and make it really
easy to come up with good ideas and they
can even be do good at doing things and
and be able to build the cool stuff but
actually turning it into products is the
hard part son has a kind of an
interesting way of doing this what we do
is we over fund the labs a little bit so
that instead of in many places the labs
are sort of begging for money from the
rest of the corporation but in son we
sort of look at it as the labs job to
put those business units out of business
right we're trying to come up with the
new things that that helped them along
so so we want to have our own separate
funding and sometimes actually the money
flows the other way where we will take a
project and will fund it as it transfers
into a business unit so you get to
transfer the knowledge the prototypes
the people
and some money to support them for a
little while so as a manager in a
business unit you don't have to make a
decision should i take this new thing or
or keep doing what I'm doing that makes
money this slide basically tells you
that what I just said there is a lie at
least forty percent of lie what I
described is sort of a major part of
what we do but we also do other stuff
this section here the fifteen percent
community thought and thought leadership
that's an area i call keeping the world
safe for son it means sitting on
standards committees doing open source
projects publishing papers and that
section in particular is growing
dramatically so this is pretty out of
date now most every project has some
phase or part of it that is open source
or relates to community and thought
leadership and that's a lot of what we
do in labs sometimes we come across an
idea that just doesn't fit in with the
rest of sun and its current business and
so in order to get it out there
sometimes we have to start what we call
a micro business unit sunspots is an
example of that okay we in labs went and
acted like we had a little new start
company our small group of people went
off and we designed the box we designed
the industrial design we built the
hardware we take care of manufacturing
we did it all in our little group and
acted like we had a little startup
company there to do the entire thing and
take it to market ourselves and we do
this not necessarily because we want to
usually do it because we have to to get
something out there and you know right
now the sun spots isn't a great business
it's not the kind of thing that's going
to make send a lot of money so we don't
want to distract our business units with
it it's something that we're focusing on
for other longer term purposes and i'll
tell you about that
we take our work very seriously so you
guys have lots of places that sort of
look like this I just wanted to let you
know that our place you know we have fun
too the reason that I came to son about
four years ago is because basically
everybody that I interviewed with was
smarter than me and I mean it was just
incredible I'd sit down for an interview
and these people would come out we move
these questions and everything and I was
so impressed I just wanted to be around
those people so that you know through
osmosis you learn more and we've got six
of sons so our group is is about a
hundred and fifty people out of 35,000 &amp;amp;
Son and of that group we've got six of
sons fellow so those are the highest
ranking people on the technical ladder
so these are fellows are the folks that
you kind of bow down as they go by in
the hallway as people like wit Diffie
who's the co-inventor of public key
cryptography you may have heard of the
diffie-hellman algorithm that's him or
radio pro man she invented the tree
spanning algorithm that makes routers
work without her there's no internet so
our joke with her is that the Internet
has many fathers but only one mother and
this
anyway it's a really cool group our
little group is responsible for twelve
percent of Suns patents which is
proportionally more than you know we
should have given our small numbers but
on the other hand it's interesting to
note that eighty-eight percent of the
patents come from elsewhere and Sun Sun
really takes innovation seriously and it
happens throughout the company we
believe in slave labor so we have lots
of interns we're very open most
everything that we do you can find out
about it research suncom and I mentioned
the funding we've done some cool stuff
you may have heard about Java and things
like that we've had a pretty good track
record of getting our stuff into
products that get out there everything
from pieces of chips to you know two
things like Java and it's kind of
interesting working for a labs like son
because at son we build chips and spark
the spark chip we build systems computer
systems we build storage we build an
operating system solaris we have a
language Java we have applications like
Open Office we've got pretty much
everything you can imagine that relates
to computer science or electrical
engineering it's all fair game for us
and labs so it's lots of fun these are
the kinds of things that we're working
on right now we're working on systems
that allow chips to talk to each other
very high speed for very low power not
generating a lot of heat turns out that
wires are the problem there and you
makes people want to build bigger and
bigger chips so they don't have to use
wires to communicate between the chips
well we've got a way to make it so that
you don't actually need the wires you
get the chips to communicate by just
putting them very close together just a
few microns apart and they form a little
capacitor you put a charge on one side
and the opposite charge shows up on the
other chip and this is communication and
you can do this at gigabits per second
and in fact you can do it at really high
density really high speed and not have
some of the side effects of generating
heat slowing down your speed and
and those sorts of things that happen in
chip-to-chip communication but you don't
have you also avoid the other
disadvantage of building larger chips
which is that the yield goes down they
become very expensive so it's this could
revolution 8 revolutionize the way that
computers are built on the future it's
pretty interesting we do lots of stuff
in system software java java java java
java java java java we've got some
people who kind of know a thing or two
about java so we do lots of java stuff
but we do other languages too we have
things like in fortress is an open
source scientific computing language
that we're developing we have an open
source system for gaming building
multiplayer online games called Dark
Star we have an open source storage
system that's a very large scale
distributed storage system that I
learned a new word because of this
system and so I will allow you to
impress your friends with this it stores
yottabytes of information tara petta x's
a de yada yada as a lot to be system
science we do work in security and so on
there's there's a lot of system system
science it's kind of cool because that
place where we get to put together all
the stuff that we know about with from
chips to applications and everything in
between and then networks and clients
and the project I'm going to talk to you
about now is is this one here in the sun
spots project that's just one of those
those projects so project sunspot came
about because we've been very successful
with cell phones getting java on cell
phones where I think 2.2 billion cell
phones or something like that now but if
you think about it there's only six and
a half billion people in the world we're
up to 2.2 billion already so we kind of
got a limited market left you know so we
have to think about what comes next
what's it going to be what's going to be
the thing that instead of having one per
person maybe you've got hundreds or
thousands per person all right what's
that going to be well we don't know what
that is so we designed a development
platform that we call son small
programmable object technology or
sunspot that's basically a system for a
development platform for people to
invent the next cool thing the idea of
it the design point is something that
will inspire people to build cool stuff
right because we don't care what it is
that gets invented as long as they do it
with our technology then someday maybe
down the road they might pay us for it
we're willing to suspend disbelief come
on no it's it's a great thing we just
want people to use this technology get
out there and invent cool stuff so what
is the sunspot basically put together
some interesting technologies or stuff
that we thought was interesting one is
it's embedded we want to think beyond
the keyboard mouse and screen and think
about stuff that lives out in the world
with you it should be easy to program so
we made it java top to bottom this
system is java all the way down to the
metal so you write your device drivers
in java you do everything in java so if
you're a java programmer you know how to
program this device and you can do
whatever you want with it it's connected
it's got wireless communication built
into it so i can communicate with other
things around it that means in our case
it can do mesh networking and as well as
over the year programming so you can
program it over the air and looking
Institute it's mobile it's got a battery
so you can take it with you you can move
it around it's not tethered to anything
and then one of the key things it's
aware and active and what I mean by this
is that we put sensors on it right it's
about being able to sense its
surrounding it's about knowing more
about what's going on in the world
in your average computer and being able
to do something about it sometimes so
for example in robots where you move
things around and then of course we're
big on security and we think that
anything that people are going to play
around with that eventually they want to
have some business outlet for it it
needs security to be thought of from the
beginning so we've built that in the
system itself has basically three parts
to it the battery the main processor
board and the application board or
censor board the main board is 180
megahertz arm9 processor it's got half a
mega RAM and for mega flash and this 8 0
to 15 dot for radio if any of you a part
of zigbee it's a new up-and-coming sort
of low-power short-range low speed
communication mechanism we use the same
radio although we have a slightly
different protocol than zigbee there's a
USB interface for charging and so on and
and then it's got the the battery as I
mentioned it's a lithium-ion battery
connected to it the e demo board has a
bunch of sensors on it and things like
that so you can know about the world
around it and I'll pull one of these
things out here so we can take a look at
it so this little bored here this is a
sunspot and the little bored that's on
the top here is the application bored
with the LEDs blinking on there that
board there has a three axis
accelerometer so it can sense motion in
all three dimensions has a light sensor
a temperature sensor has these eight
leds because LEDs are just the coolest
thing geeks love LEDs push buttons got a
couple of push button so you can you
know interact with it and then it's got
ways to connect up to other types of
sensors and other devices so it's got
six analog inputs five digital i/o lines
and for digital outputs and then to top
it all off you program it all in Java so
this is standard Java like you having a
cell phone it's
CLD C 1.1 for those who care with an IM
p profile it's basically just like a
cell phone only without a display and
what this all means is that you can do
things like this my my son when he was
either seven or eight I forget now ask
me about this project what's the sunspot
thing all about daddy and so I spent a
weekend with him and we wrote a little
program and we just used the
accelerometer here in a sense when you
swing this back and forth and to blink
the LEDs and we got this it says hi this
is a Sun SPOT okay that's done with the
skills of a manager and the attention
span of an eight-year-old so what we did
in the labs is we put this together into
this kit and we built this little this
little kit like I said I'm extremely
proud of this stuff because our little
group you know had to even design the
box for this and so this kit has and
we've aimed at sort of an education
market mostly for this education and
research where we've got a couple of the
devices as we have there and one that
acts as a base station all that that
means is it doesn't have a battery in it
and you have to keep it tethered and it
can you know connect you to the internet
and stuff like that but you get all the
software and tools and a bunch of little
gadgets along with it and on top of all
that it's all open source
so I'm talking about everything here
we're talking about the virtual machine
that it's built on we're talking about
the drivers we're talking about all the
demo applications and the ton there's a
ton of those and and things that are
built on top of that and even the
hardware and in fact more hardware than
you get in the kit so these are the two
boards that come in the kit the main
board and the e demo board which is just
sort of a demonstration of the kind of
thing you can connect to it but we have
other boards like these prototyping
boards high-speed serial board SD flash
board a edik board that's for high
quality data acquisition and other ones
that are all open source and available
to anyone to go off and build one of the
cool things about this is of course
other people jump in and start building
stuff too and so we've got a pretty rich
set of things that people are building
out in the world and it's a lot of fun
putting these together and seeing what
people say about them and so I'll just
toot our horn a little bit embedded calm
likes us and says that it's the fastest
prototyping platform available top 10
amazing java applications by java lobby
editor's choice award at the maker faire
the number one must-have gadget for the
discerning geek all right so we're just
for the discerning geeks according to
info world and we just recently won this
thing called the Sun innovation award
which we're pretty excited about all
right so yeah sounds interesting and all
but what does it really do what are
these things good for well this is this
is kind of gives you some idea of what
they can be used for obviously there for
prototyping gadgets or building things
they've been put into toys they've been
put into a rocket that we launched up
and were able to monitor as it was
flying up in the air we put them into a
balloon that went up to a hundred
thousand feet they've been used by the
government to keep track of deep dark
secrets I'll show you this one just
because it's fun they've been used in
robots we put together grids of them
they've been used in art projects that
took over an entire Hotel in downtown
San Jose for the 01 festival that was
kind of cool here's an example of
something that a student did down at the
Art Center College of Design so our
students are really cool because they
don't care how it works they just wanted
to do something right this guy wanted to
build a swarm of blimps okay he wanted
to kind of hang out and go to hang out
like like fish and swim around together
and so I put a sunspot with some little
motors with propellers and so on and
these things can zip around the room and
and he did this really cool thing where
he used a cell phone vibrator on the
side of the of the the blimp and it
makes this really cool eerie kind of
whale noise they're kind of echoes
around in this big room this guy has
kind of made a career out of this now
that he did this as part of a class
where they had lots of other amazing
applications because art students come
up with some of the most creative stuff
but he's been going around doing art
openings and everything and even was
featured and make magazine on the cover
of make magazine with the blimp bots the
attack of the blimp bots definitely fun
stuff these have been used in robots so
for example there's a company in in Utah
that's built a robot that is completely
sunspot base so they sell this platform
and you plug in your sunspot it's got a
spot for brains and it's basically you
know got a bunch of sensors in it and
then i subtract read system so you can
drive it around and we've been playing
around with a lot of those and and doing
sort of swarm behavior kinds of things
this actually it's kind of interesting
how things like the the the the guys
with the Art Center guys got us thinking
about the sort of swarm behavior stuff
and what happens when you've got a lot
of things sort of cooperating to get to
some goal and with the sunspots we've
had lots of interesting applications for
that since they can they they have the
radios to communicate and they can sort
of cooperate to do stuff of
my son last week actually was at the
summer camp and he built this trebuchet
and we were throwing stuff around in the
backyard because that's what dads do
with their kids you know and he said
well I wonder how many jeez it takes
when this thing throws this and so we
got a son Spartans sunspot and started
throwing it around the backyard and and
and now we know that it's just about six
GS which is about maxes out the sensor
and in this case for example this throw
this periodic spinning here is the thing
was spinning around in the the it was
spinning in such a way that the
accelerometer was off-center slightly
and so you get this periodic motion of
the centrifugal force of the the spot
spinning there and we know that it's fun
six times we've got this cool thing
called the modular data center this
started out with the idea of if we
what's the biggest computer that we
could sell somebody and one of the
things we started thinking about there
was well first of all it has to fit into
a shipping container so you can move in
some place and so why not make the
shipping container of the data center
right so so we've got this thing called
the black box or the modular data center
is the product name of it and when it
was first introduced they we were having
lunch with one of the engineers and he
said boy you know we could really use
sun spots because when this thing is
turned off i'm driving around on the
back of a truck you really don't know
what's going on with it you don't know
where it is you don't know if it's being
dropped you don't know if it's out of
temperature range or any of that
sunspots are sort of self-contained you
could just put a bunch of them in there
and it would take care of it so we put
sun spots with we hooked up a GPS to a
sunspot and a cell phone so it could
phone home and then we monitor
temperature and humidity and light and
we even built some hardware for it the
data logger board that I mentioned it's
open source that we have available that
that board we built for this project and
the cool thing is we did all that and
had it up and running in two weeks
so as a complete network of devices
monitoring this thing and they were even
time synchronized so we could tell do
rigidbody simulations of this thing as
it's running down the road and we
actually found a time when they did drop
it on us so that was kind of fun and the
cool thing was since this was in there
we were able to do things like they
wanted to see how this thing held up in
certain environments like in an
earthquake right so what what happens in
an earthquake with this modular data
center so they put it on this giant
shake table down in San Diego and this
thing can can simulate I guess they were
doing the Northridge earthquake and that
was like six point seven something like
that and and it's big enough to build a
house on so they put this whole modular
data center in there and they let it
bounce around and we had sun spots in
there to see what happened and so the
camera in here kind of shows you they
were doing the experiment by the way
with leaving the top things off these
racks to see what happened and it turns
out it's a bad idea but this is what it
looks like inside a data center during a
6.7 earthquake and the spots were able
to record data and tell us what's going
on sunspots are also used to collect
data now this we have this side interest
yeah I'd be great if the whole world ran
on Java that'd be that'd be wonderful
but we know that it doesn't and so even
if somebody takes a sunspot builds an
application and then decides not to use
Java we still want to do this project
because a lot of the projects that
people come up with are about collecting
data and that data needs to be stored
somewhere needs to be processed and
guess what you know we're happy to help
you out with that we got the machines to
do that so we're looking at lots of
projects that are just about collecting
data like monitoring water quality in
Malawi Africa there's these guys at kth
in Sweden who actually are spearheading
this project to help warn the residents
of this this town in Africa when the
water is not fit to drink
it's a simple enough thing and you know
just putting the right sensors in the
right place and collecting the data and
telling people can save lives of course
these other guys have higher hopes they
want to save the planet these are these
guys from Warren Wilson College in North
Carolina and they've got a project down
in Panama their story I'm going to take
a second and tell you this story because
it's kind of a fun one so these guys
wanted to do something in Panama they're
there this is Professor David Abernathy
and this is chris busting he's actually
an intern of ours now because we met him
thanks to this project but David
Abernathy told me that Warren Wilson
College is kind of seen as a hippie
college so I actually googled hippie
college and the first hit is their
homepage it's not even like something
saying oh here's the list of hippie
colleges it's their home page so I guess
they are a hippie college anyway they
wanted to do something to monitor data
in the rainforest and so on and so they
got this idea of doing something with
with sensor networks and so on and so
they they pitched something to the
Panamanian government saying hey could
you can we have a grant to go do this
and they got the grant and so they said
oh we got the grant now what do we do
well they started looking into this
sensor network stuff and found that they
went to a company that had some similar
kinds of things like this but they're
there when they went to that company the
company said all right here's what you
do you take your five top grad students
and you sign them full time to the
project you'll probably get PhDs for all
of them out of this and then they'll be
your experts on this nest sea stuff
which is this programming language for
this because then you'll have a bunch of
undergrads to support them and they'll
have to you know learn from the graduate
students and and support them and so
you'll probably need you know about
three times as many of them and so on
and and david abernathy at this point is
going well okay guys we don't have a
graduate program
we don't even have a class and see much
less than se stuff you're talking about
and then he found out about sunspots and
he said well we do have a class in Java
and so he and five undergraduates have
done this project and they're monitoring
that they were working with these
biologists they're monitoring the the
rainforest canopy and down on the ground
and looking for differences and looking
for what changes as they move towards
places where there's deforestation
problems and so on it's very interesting
a little closer to home son is right
here next to the dumbarton bridge and
all around us there are these salt ponds
and the usgs is recovering those two
turning them back into wetlands and when
I found out about this I said well we
got it we got to talk to these guys
because we found out that they're doing
a lot of scientific stuff to try and
figure out how these changes affect the
populations of animals and things that
are in the area so that it's it's it's
fairly complex what they're doing it's
an ecosystem they're manipulating and
what they normally do is they send grad
students out to put in some sensors and
then they send them back in a month to
get the data out and all this and we
said how about since it's right next
door to us how about if we build a
network of sunspots and monitor what's
going on there so that project is
underway and it's pretty cool
this one's kind of fun we gave a kid to
the University of North Carolina and we
didn't hear for anything from them for a
month so we sent them email is
everything okay they said go to our
website and check out this video so this
is the video we saw that's an autonomous
helicopter and it deploys sunspots so
that's a sunspot you see falling down to
the ground and so this autonomous
helicopter can fly to predetermine
places and drop sunspots and then it's
got another sunspot inside the
helicopter that can communicate with the
ones on the ground and so it can spread
them out and get the data from them down
on the ground and this is cool you know
like if you're studying volcanoes or
something like that and you really don't
want to go in there and deal with that
stuff this is a great way to do it these
guys in the Netherlands actually take
sunspots and tape them to the backs of
their swimmers literally duct tape and
from the side of the pool then they can
monitor what the swimmer is doing so
this woman that she goes and swims along
they actually have a live feed of the
data going along with them as she's
swimming and they can see if she's
tilting too much if she's changing her
pace or the pace is wrong or if she's
you know taking breasts at the wrong
times they can actually see that in the
data and it's a pretty cool application
now we just had one that was flying and
one that's exercise so if you put them
together you get Mike's flying bike now
this was kind of cool we just found this
video on YouTube didn't know this guy at
all but what this guy did is he took
sunspots and he made his bicycle fly and
you guys were involved what he did is he
took his son spot when she's holdin up
there and he instrumented his bicycle
and use Google Earth the flight
simulator so that he can from his
exercise bike fly around in Google Earth
and actually you know move around so
he's got it set up to like the
handlebars are instrumented so he can
tell which way steering them and he's
got these extra little drumstick things
I don't know what those are the probably
control ailerons and stuff and then the
wheel is instrumented so that he can
tell how fast the wheels going
and and all that and then he just wrote
an interface to take all that data and
act as a keyboard and mouse to his
computer and then he can fly the flight
simulator I think this is really cool
because you know what better motivation
is there for doing your exercise then if
you stop pedaling you'll crash into a
mountain so I think you should have to
pedal faster to take off i don't i don't
know about this but anyway this is SFO
and he just lifts off and heads out over
the golden gate bridge i think i love it
see I think we're getting closer to that
thing where there's going to be billions
and billions of these things out there
trillions like this one is a surefire
winner this guy had this dog named Sadie
we tried really hard to get him to
change the name of his dog to spot but
he wouldn't do it so sadie is his dog
and he wanted to know when he goes off
to work what is the dog do at home so he
set up a webcam to watch the dog but the
dog was never in the room so he put
these buttons over here and he can press
the button and it plays out a sound
saying come here Sadie and said he comes
well she'll come he can also make her do
tricks right so he can make her sit and
roll over it didn't take long till he
figured out that this is kind of a mean
thing to do to restock so he took his
son spot kit and he hooked up some
servos and things to it and built a
little device that will dispense treats
so when the dog does her tricks he
presses the reward button it opens up
the door and dispenses a treat and we're
all good to go
my favorite part of this whole video is
the fact that what happens now he
presses the closed door button and the
dog is gone he never will find out what
the dog does while he's off at work okay
so this is some guy Bob Beasley who's he
actually learned java 6 months before he
started this project so we like this one
too he's a an interesting guy I got a
chance to meet him and you may be saying
at this point yeah yeah okay well this
guy Bob Beasley he's like a genius right
because because he can build stuff that
you know interacts with his dog and all
that using sunspots well let me walk you
through something that's basically
topologically equivalent to this so he's
got some servos hooked up to a sunspot
he's connected to them over the radio
let's do that same sort of thing and
build a robot okay so I've got a little
robot here and basically all that it is
is just a few different parts it's some
servos like you get at a hobby shop for
a model airplane or something like that
there's some tires connected to them
their servers that are continuously
rotating so they keep working there's a
little box for some double a batteries
and there's a sunspot and some wires to
hook it all together and that's that's
all that makes up this this robot the
wiring is pretty straightforward there's
three wires that come out of a servo
this is looking right at the back here
there's these three wires coming out of
each servo the black and red ones are
for power and the yellow one is for
control so you connect the black and red
ones up to this battery box and the
yellow one basically hook up to the
sunspot turns out you also connect the
red and black ones so you've got a
common ground and things like that but I
assure you it's easy to wire up and I
can have any of you doing this in a
matter of minutes
okay so now we've got a robot alright
alright so the hardware is easy how
about some software how many folks here
know java okay well then let's take a
look at the code here it is this is a
whole app you bring in some some
libraries that we provide you that know
about things like servos and the i/o
pins of the of the demo board that
they're connected to and all that and
then you define a method that's a
standard Java method for a midlet that
says which is the cell phone kind of
application it's like main you know and
uh and so you define that which is
called start app and then you go through
and you say give me an array of pins
this font doesn't show but that's
actually an array thing there of pins by
going to the e demo board get it getting
the instance of e demo board in the Sun
SPOT and getting its output pins right
so we now have an array of output pins
okay well let's say that there's a servo
connected to pin h0 on the board and
call that left servo let's say it
there's a servo connected to pin h1 and
that's the right servo and then let's
tell it to move
not rocket science so that's the code
and I don't have a horizontal surface to
run this on that's up high enough for
everybody to see but basically we
extended this a little bit where we use
this my battery seems to be done on this
guy let's see if this works where I can
take the accelerometer data from this
one so so you guys all know the earth
sucks right it's always accelerating you
towards the center of the planet so with
this 3d accelerometer I can sense how I
tilt the sunspot on my left hand and I
can send a message over the radio to the
device on the right and build a little
gesture control robot so as I tell
forward it goes forward I can turn left
turn right back up and you'll just have
to those of you in the back and have to
have to imagine that you can see this
it's driving around so it's a has a fun
time with the carpet here so we've got a
little gesture controlled robot that's
about to fall off the podium cool
it's just wires and hot glue in fact
there's no circuit design no transistors
capacitors in that it's a software
project it's a high level software
project right this is a java project all
those of you who raised your hands
earlier can do this and you can do it
pretty quickly and pretty easily so in a
nutshell that's what sunspots is about
it's about inspiring people to do stuff
we want we're not going to be able to
come up with every great idea but maybe
we can help inspire other people to do
it you know and so by putting the stuff
out an open source and getting people to
use our technology and making it
something that's flexible and easy to
use we hope that we can inspire people
to to do cool stuff and invent the next
great thing that there are going to be
trillions of instead of billions of and
you know that would be a good thing so
that's the idea of sunspots I left a
little bit of time here so that if you
guys are interested I figured there
might be a few developers around here I
can sort of show you what the process is
like here and do a couple of live demos
which is just a really bad idea right
you never do things like that but I'll
go ahead and try it and we'll see how it
goes here one of the exciting things
about this stuff is that everything is
open source and when I say everything
it's not just the hardware and software
it's even the tools that we use to do
this stuff so I use netbeans which isn't
it's kind of amazing that you've got
NetBeans and Eclipse and all these
things that are these open source
development tools that are out there we
use we have tools that we've created for
managing sunspots that also are open
source so like here is this one called
solarium that lets you manage the sun
spots so i've got a couple of sunspots
here that are running a little program
called bounce
and it uses the accelerometer to once
again sense gravity and make these
things bounce around well I can do
something kind of fun with that where I
can take these and connect them together
by pressing the buttons and they will
connect over the radio theoretically so
that the balls can go together
so yeah well of course through the head
trick yeah everybody wants to see the
through the head trick all right okay
I'll recover we call these the
ectoplasmic bouncing balls and that
ectoplasm in your brain it's so the cool
thing about this is I've got these two
devices here and let's see I can I can
take one of them and I can I could like
let's let's start another application in
here let's run something I called Roger
Twitter okay so now this application is
this the sunspot is running two
applications spot bounce and Roger
Twitter and in fact I'm not sure which
one it is so let's just tell it two
blankets LEDs and you guys can see which
one it is here this guy here he's our
lucky twitterer and I've got a little
application that just will basically
Twitter have the sunspot Twitter's and
and you know it's Twitter's about things
that are important to it you know I mean
everybody Twitter's about such
interesting things of course where's my
mouth here let me try and pull up a
browser and let's see what he's
twittering about now the idea of having
things that are out there in the world
that are connecting with stuff in the
internet and so on and and and
interacting with the world is kind of
cool I think oops and
just log in here the name of this if any
of you want to follow this guy he's and
see when I do demos it's Roger spot and
you just said hello I'm awake I'm on my
feet in a place where it's 80 degrees
and it's pretty dim here and so we can
do things like we can turn them over and
theoretically or if I can find where my
big connection is here it appears I'm
lying on my friends I think this is just
about as valuable as most Twitter
traffic but we can do more than that
anybody know what this is yeah okay you
can read great anybody know what
semaphore is this is why you have
semaphores in programming languages
because these guys on boats used to
swing flags around to send messages to
each other and this one is set up to
it's the same thing as the as the robot
I've got a couple of servos here a
little pack with batteries because
servos take enough juice that they want
to have their own power and then a
sunspot and the rest is wires and wood
and flags and Lego parts the important
stuff and this guy is set up if the demo
gods are with us so that he will
semaphore out the tweets that that
sunspot is sending and I think let me
start this guy going to make sure
and I turned everything on
yeah really it's great it's great fun I
actually wrote this last night so I
don't know if it's a good thing or not
normally when it starts out there's some
lights across the top there well it's
the demo effect let's take a look and
see if we can see what's going on here
so we've got our sun spots here and I've
got ah hang on a second let's just let's
just reset this guy I can do this
remotely or I can do it from the another
thing they're a bit I basically have
most of the control I can deploy
applications i can start things stop
things i can do all that sort of stuff
over the air to this and what i've got
is I've got a base station or a sunspot
connected to my laptop here and it talks
over the air to this guy although I'm
just not seeing anything from it could
be that I killed the batteries so I
apologize for that but imagine flags
waving around and being very amused
that's great fun anyway this is just to
show you that things are relatively easy
and you can you can have lots of funds
with these with these gadgets so with
that I will say that as I mentioned all
the stuff is open source and you get to
us via go on next page by this website
here called sunspot worldcom and as long
and also spots dev Java notice where all
the source code is for everything
hardware and software but with that I
would like to open it up to questions if
any of you have anything you'd like to
know about this project yes
deploy one of these a while once sir
rearrange to respect and what sort of a
solar charging what it takes he's going
so so the question is thanks the
question is if you put these out in the
wild how long is the radio range between
them and how much juice do they need if
you want to charge them with solar power
or something like that the answer is
they get about a hundred meters between
hops on a good day downhill with the
wind behind them so like inside the
building you won't get 100 meters but
outside free range you can get 100
meters if you position them right and
that's between each hop so you just have
to have a spot every hundred meters to
get back to where you want as far as
power goes the power question is a
really interesting one it turns out that
the way that these applications work
lots of people have built devices like
this but they've made them much simpler
little 8-bit processors hard to program
and all that but they use less power and
there's this interesting thing that
that's we're looking into here which is
with those 8-bit processors say you
start processing you you normally put
these things to sleep when you're not
using them so your sleep you've got
something to do you wake up you use some
power while you're thinking about it and
then when you're done you go back to
sleep with a more powerful thing with a
180 megahertz arm9 you can when you wake
up use a lot more power but you get an
answer a lot faster and you go back to
sleep and in our case the difference
between being awake and being asleep is
at least three orders of magnitude so
the answer to your solar power question
is it depends on how often you're
sampling if you're sleeping most of the
time the battery can last year's if you
have it on and you're you're blasting
the LEDs at full power and you got the
radio on all the time and and you're
just having a good time you know
calculating pi to the end
digit you're going to run through the
batteries in a matter of six hours eight
hours I mean you can really can really
burn through it so it really depends on
your duty cycle and one of the cool
things that we've done with this project
is we because we have Java right on the
metal we can actually control the
hardware and Java is scheduling all the
tasks here so it knows exactly when to
wake up and when to go to sleep and so
if you've set a timer and say I need a
you know I want my task to sleep for you
know ten for a thousand milliseconds it
knows that can go to sleep and it can
wake up just enough time before you need
to be awake to get everything up and
rolling so that at that time schedule
time you're awake and you're going and
we think that if we're really good at
this we can sort of do for power
management what Java does for memory
management right with memory management
the cool thing about Java is you don't
think that much about it the garbage
collector kind of takes care of a lot of
stuff for you would it be cool if that
works for power management as well you
just worry about your program and the
system takes care of the power
management so that's one of the research
areas that we're looking into other
questions yes to things so do they
haven't been flash on there do they have
embedded flash on there yes they do so
they have for mega flash built-in and
then we have this extra card that we
built that one of these guys here that
has an SD card slot on it so you can
actually plug in external memory you
know and get gigabytes of flash if you
want Cosper spot what's the cost per
spot excellent question glad you asked
so that kit that's floating around here
is the only thing that we sell remember
where this research group we don't know
how to sell stuff and so everything's
hard and getting part numbers and things
like that is hard so we have one part
number it's the kit that's all that we
sell and that kit is got has got the
three devices in in software and these
little clips and all whole bunch of
stuff and that's seven hundred fifty
dollars commercial however
there's an education discount if you
know somebody who's in school you can
get it for 300 bucks and 300 bucks is 43
you know palm type scale of compute
devices is not so bad so so that's that
yes sir panadol can you attach a camera
to it we have we have not attached a
camera to it yet we've been thinking
about doing like one of those CMU cams
they've got a nice serial interface the
demo board has a serial interface right
built into it you can take one of the
pins and make it a UART essentially and
talk to those sorts of things so so
we've been thinking about stuff like
that and haven't had a chance to do it
actually the CMU cam isn't the one with
the serial interface but but anyway we
have not done it we have a couple of
applications that people have come up
with it maybe they will do it or if we
get around to it we've been just swamped
with so many ideas and things we haven't
gotten around to that one but one of the
things there's there's a group that
wanted to use these for forest fire
monitoring so they want to put these
things up on a on a watch tower
somewhere and have them look out for
smoke and this has got enough processing
that they can actually do some simple
pattern matching and if facing think
they see a column of smoke they can say
hey there might be smoked out there and
trigger things so so there's lots of
interesting applications like that the
bandwidth of the radio is they claim 250
K bits per second but a lot of thats
tied up in overhead and all that so if
you're lucky you get 150 k bits you're
not going to be streaming video from it
other questions yes sir so does it have
to be a wait for the mission
does it have to be a wait for the
message away just have to be awake it so
does actually awake for the mesh
communications to work yes at some level
so there's two levels of sleep there's a
deep sleep where you get this
thousandfold decrease in power usage if
you do that it's shut down there's a
shallow sleep that uses more power but
it lets you do things like keep the
radio alive during that time and you can
manage interrupts and things so so kind
of knowing the sort of weird in-between
limbo state it can it can monitor the
radio yes in the back so far we have one
is a portal you can actually put okay
can you put more than one app board on a
sunspot you can put two so you can you
can stack two boards and exactly two
boards and that's just that we
communicate through an SPI bus and we
only have two addresses there that we
use so that's the limitation but you can
put two yes sir imagine the openness of
are there any third-party vendors right
now are there any third-party vendors
for this since it is an open source
project even the hardware so someone
just announced earlier this week someone
in Hong Kong announced that they're
going to start building some of these
third-party boards are these add-on
boards that we are not providing because
that would be more part numbers and
stuff than so so they're starting to
build some of those they are building
bare boards and you have to stuff them
yourself unfortunately so there's a
little bit of work involved but that's
happening we certainly have follow on
things like that robot and so on where
people who are designing products around
this and we only open source this stuff
of what like three months ago now so a
lot of people are just going through
that decision making process now and
we've had a fair amount of interest and
that's great because I don't really want
to be in the business of manufacturing
little hardware devices we build big
stuff you know this is this is hard for
us yes sir
so the question is we have focus on
wireless what about wired interfaces can
we do other things yes so the when you
saw the twitter demo there what's
actually going on is that the base
station sunspot which is just a sunspot
mainboard that's all a base station is
it's just it's a sunspot without the
battery and the other board is connected
via USB to my laptop and so I'm
communicating over USB to that too to my
laptop and using that to go over the
Google internet connection to talk to
the Internet and so we have that today
we also have the hardware supports
things like some interesting stuff like
right now this is a USB client the
hardware supports USB host which means
you can plug in other USB devices to
this it just requires a lot of software
and we haven't written it so we have a
board an open source that somebody could
go and build but there's no software to
support it so so that's another option
the chip itself actually supports
Ethernet has an mi I interface so you
can you can actually connect into you
know an ethernet Phi and and go to town
and so you can connect Wi-Fi and things
like that it's it's it's just a matter
of software we also are looking at
experimenting around with lots of things
come in SD card size packages nowadays
including some wireless communication
and so we're looking at incorporating
some of that in might be an easy way for
us to go without designing a whole lot
of hardware anything else yes sir
so sorry what open source license are we
using so we have two licenses the main
board and the JVM are under GPL
everything else I guess there's a couple
of little core pieces at our GPL and
that's mostly because that's the Java
license and we had to keep up with that
everything else is bsd it's completely
open
releasing more gracious of the
development kit I mean you can can you
modify that so are we horrible yes are
we releasing more versions of the
development kit yeah in fact I'll show
you a cool little thing here there's
this tool the sunspot manager tool and I
can go here and look at the different
releases that are out there right now
and in fact I can go in and go to my
preferences and say I want to look at
the beta releases and find out that
there's a beta release that just came
out a couple of days ago and so we've
got that here and this is the tool that
I that I use it installs it on these are
the software development kits that are
installed on my laptop these are the
ones that are available on the network
once I install one I can go to my spots
and upgrade them and put that software
onto them to match my development kit on
my laptop and so that's that's basically
how the process works for this and all
these things have tons of documentation
and song with them including tutorials
that step you through everything and so
each release has that so there are some
so right now a lot of we feel like it's
it's what should I call it it's feature
complete to a certain level right you
can you can take this and do it do stuff
with it its version for the software it
does stuff we're looking at longer term
things now we're going back to our
research roots and trying to like look
at some big things like we don't support
real-time right now let's put some real
time extensions in here so that we can
we can do some stuff quickly and and
let's builds an infrastructure around
this for data collection and databases
son bought mysql so we've got a project
called egg brazil that's a java.net
project that grabs data from a network
of sunspots makes it easy to grab data
from a network of sunspots and throw it
into a
debase so things like that or what we're
working on yes sir ask you see in your
example you showed em to Deadspin
programs right on one of the spots yeah
open it to number of programs or other
counties is there a limit to the number
of programs that we can run on a spot
we're only limited by memory so as many
as you you want to put in there you can
you can go ahead and put in scheduling
like you're talking practical limits
well being you want real world things
I'm talking theory man I'm a lab sky
come on but no we we run them with you
know you start to see degree integration
it depends how much it degrades depends
on what applications are doing obviously
and so it's there aren't any real limits
to that we can run four or five apps on
there and they can all work and
especially if they sleep all the time
put 20 of them on there doesn't matter
but we're not putting hundreds of them
on there we've never tried that not
saying it won't work just haven't tried
it
alright so any other questions then one
more last question all right it's all in
java java java java java didn't you were
you here for that part of the talk java
java dava dava dava dava dava so this
this what we've done is we've taken a
java virtual machine and it's called
squawk and we've added some sort of
operating system type extensions to it
to let you look at tasks as objects so
you can take a task and tell it to
suspend or resume you can tell it to
start running you can get a list of them
you can do things like that and so you
have some sort of things that are that
are very much like operating system
kinds of functions that are being
carried out by the vm ok thank you very
much appreciate your time
